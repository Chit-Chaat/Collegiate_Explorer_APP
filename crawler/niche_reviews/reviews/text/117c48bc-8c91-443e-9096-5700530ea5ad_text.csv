Junior,5,I am someone who enjoys online learning and would much rather learn in the comfort of my own home rather than in a classroom. I have a great method for getting assignments done in a timely manner and managing all of my classes while being at home all the time.
Alum,5,"I did not take classes online while at Temple, but my friends who did thought they were great. They said that they were very interactive and the instructors were willing to set up one on one meetings to provide extra help."
Alum,5,"First of all Temple has EVERYTHING. But if you go to Temple, you must take the initiative. Don't expect people to come to ask you to do something... put yourself out there and try things out. For me, The Diamond Marching Band and the Honors College set me up for a lifetime of friends and memories. Also, my Cooperative Education experience helped me to graduate with very few student loans to pay back. I was able to get them out of the way in less than 5 years. I have friends who are still paying after 10 years. Make smart choices and this is definitely a school to consider."
Alum,5,Proud Temple Alum. Great academics and great experiences. I had a wonderful experience ar Temple University and it prepared me for my fulfilling career.
Alum,5,Great professors plus a wide and diverse catalog of online courses to choose from. Wonderful experience.
Freshman,5,"This semester all of my classes online, and honestly, I don't hate it. Professors make sure everyone is on board with the material, and often put students into break-out rooms, which allows some social aspect."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online couses while attending Temple University. All of the classes I attending were on-campus. However, I have colleagues who have completed online courses and have raved about the enagement and accesibilty to professors."
Alum,5,"I wouldn't trade my experience at Temple University for anything in the world. The personal growth, the lasting friendships and relationships with professsors I created is truly priceless. Temple provides a state of the art campus in the heart of Philadelphia. A true mecca for studies in healthcare, business, technology, law, tourisma & hospitality, news, political science and theatre. The diversity of the student body and educational staff is a true reflection of the world economy. No matter what your education tract - Temple will provide  you with the necessary skills and alumni network for you to find career and be successful."
Junior,5,"I like that Temple University facilities have many tools and resources that help when it's needed. The environment is very diverse, there are great people here who are able to help when needed, and the organizations are helpful."
Junior,5,"The professors are easy to reach and are always available. Now that I am taking online classes, professors are more flexible wit their time."
Junior,5,I genuinely believe the staff and administration have the students best interests in mind and they have been incredibly helpful throughout my time there.
Junior,5,I love everything about temple University. First it is a diversity school with students all over the world. We are able to go to school in other countries such as Japan. The teachers are also very helpful . There is nothing i want to change at Temple university
Freshman,5,It was okay. The only problem is that we are paying full price for an online experience when we won't be in person
Senior,5,Great college in a great city. Lots of choices and places to see. Easy to get around. Lots of choices on majors plus very good guidance counselors to help you with your studies.
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience has gone amazing because the professors I have had in the spring. I worked when I returned home almost immediately and if somehow, my work schedule conflicted every so often, they were always super understanding to my needs and accommodated me with ease."
Junior,5,"Due to the Corona-virus, the campus was forced to move their in person classes into online learning. The adjustment was difficult at first since I was used to doing lectures in person. The professors did an amazing job transitioning their classes into online learning."
Junior,5,"Temple University caught my eye the second I entered the campus borders. It wasn't my first nor second choice of school that I wanted to attend. As soon as I went to experience what it was like, the students, staff, and the environment, in general, were all so welcoming. That school made me feel like I belonged there, I chose to attend Temple and I don't regret it at all."
Senior,5,Temple is very diverse and I love the city of Philadelphia. They have a large amount of majors to pick from and the people who go here are great.
Senior,5,Online classes are pretty easy and are not that hard. I would not be scared about having to take a class online.
Alum,5,"All online aspects were simple and easy to use. Professors were easy to get in contact with, and all online applications were simple and proficient."
Junior,5,"Transitioning from campus to online was a bit jolting, but I don’t think the online experience affect how we learn that much. Perhaps its because I’m more comfortable with a laptop, but online class has no isn’t a determine and was operated very well."
Junior,5,"So far I have loved Temple. There are so many resources and I feel as though they want everyone to get the best out of their college experience. They want to see their students succeed academically, but in all aspects in life. Faculty and staff try to make the campus as approachable to all people and I think that's a great way for the university to make a name for itself."
Sophomore,5,"I love Temple University. There is so much diversity leading to nonstop learning about different cultures and ways of life. The campus is in the perfect location, just outside the city so it is not always hectic with city life, but is an easy trip to everything Philly has to offer. Every professor I have had so far have done an amazing job of relaying their knowledge, inspiring students, and making sometimes huge lectures feel like intimate classroom settings."
Sophomore,5,"So far, my time at Temple University has been amazing! There is so many resources available for students. All you have to do is get out there and discover the opportunities available!"
Senior,5,"Due to Covid-19, the second half of my school year went online. The transition from in-person to online classes did create some confusion at first, but with the help of my professors, I was able to get right back on track with ease. Right now I am taking summer classes online and the support from my professors have helped tremendously. Quick responses to any inquires I may have and easy set up for zoom meetings if necessary."
Senior,5,"Temple University is located in North Philadelphia, ten minutes away from the life of the city. Crawling with a diverse group of students, there's always something going on around campus. Whether it's a party at night or a pep rally at Bell Tower, you'll never be bored. On top of that, there's plenty of food options to choose from. You have the lines of food trucks scattered across campus and Chick-Fil-A, because who doesn't like Chick-Fil-A?"
Sophomore,5,"I never would have opted for any kind of online learning experience because that style of education has never worked for me personally, up until being put into a resticted position. My eyes were open to the proposition that online classes could actually be achievable for me. Through what felt like an endless period of adjustments, I was able to mentally and physically organize myself better. The use of technology encouraged participation and allow for an increased flow of knowledge."
Sophomore,5,Temple University is founded on the principals of hard work and a dedication for learning. Owls go above and beyond to receive a higher education and quality of learning. We are united not only in our passion but in our strive for equality and love of diversity. We would not exists without the warm embrace that our North Philadelphia brethren's provide for us. It is this relationship that allows for a healthy and reciprocating environment.
Freshman,5,Temple University very quickly became my home. I was timid at first going to a new place with thousands of people I have never met before. It didn’t take long before I become comfortable with the change. I am a part of the Mens Crew team and they have become family to me. I wouldn’t change a thing and I have never doubt my decision to attend TU.
Freshman,5,The change from in person classes to online zoom meeting happened very quickly. The university has a plan and they executed it very well. After only a weekend the entire university has become online. They made it easy for everyone to adjust during the pandemic.
Freshman,5,I havent taken any online classes yet but I have had online orientations and they have all gone very well.
Sophomore,5,"Online gened classes are the best to take at Temple University. The pace is fair, and the communication between professors and students is pretty clear."
Junior,5,"Only had one bad professor for a gen ed, other than that most professors have been good. Just check with other students before taking a class."
Junior,5,"I transferred from a community college, and the transition has been smooth. Most of the professors care about your success in class, make sure you use ratemyprofessor before taking a class. The only thing that’s annoying is the website portal page which can be confusing, other than that socially the school has a bunch of things to do."
Freshman,5,"Great university with amazing professors!! The area is a little shabby, but the university is a great place to explore and learn."
Freshman,5,"The online learning experience at Fox has been incredible. The professors efficiently transitioned to online classes relatively quickly. However, some of my other professors didn't fair as well. The math department made the tests much more difficult, and the Econ department seemed like it gave up."
Freshman,5,I am glad I chose to Temple University. I love being on campus and off campus! The professors are nice and understanding and I actually like learning the material. People on campus are usually friendly and it is easy to make friends.
Sophomore,5,"So far, the classes i have taken are pretty good. the professors are super engaging and fun. they will go at a pace where every student is comfortable with. online classes are also good. professors will help you with anything and they communicate very well"
Sophomore,5,"It feels like home here and everyone is so engaging with student activites. the advisors are super helpful and will guide you through everything you need. student life on campus is never boring, there is always something to do and the campus is close to the city which makes it nice to venture out and explore philadelphia."
Freshman,5,"Temple offers excellent and exclusive learning environment. It’s rich campus life is what I would like everyone I love who intends being in university to experience. The bottom line is everyone has equal opportunity to succeed at Temple because of the soft landing they offer to every student, irrespective of your background."

The bottom line is everyone has equal opportunity to succeed at Temple because of the soft landing they offer to every student, irrespective of your background."
Niche User,5,The environment was always welcoming and fantastic. The school gave me a place to explore my passion with no bounds and expand my knowledge on what I want to do with my life.
Niche User,5,I have always gotten the information I needed to be successful with the school. The websites were easy to navigate.
Freshman,5,"Temple University is such a great school. The University has great diversity. Since it's in the city, it has many opportunities and many different things to do."
Niche User,5,"Hi I am A to be freshman of Temple University. I went for a college tour and that was when I decided that this is it. Beautiful campus, Diverse people, Good food, good assistance, etc. I dont really know about other stuff but I think I am 100% right about this college being fantastic."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Temple University. I am an international student from India, at first it was challenging adapting to the life and culture here in the states but Temple and Philadelphia in general had a very welcoming and inclusive atmosphere and I basically regard it as my home now. It was the best decision I would have made."
Alum,5,"Temple is the place to go when you need your eyes opened wide. If you're from small town America, go. You will meet people from every walk of life and go home wishing you could bring everyone from home back with you so that they too, could be more open minded."
Freshman,5,"Temple University has been a great experience.  I have met many new people from all different backgrounds.  I have experienced a bonding with my teammates. I have had the opportunity to explore the city and all that it has to offer.  I have had the opportunity to really feel like I am a part of something wonderful. You would think that being a part of such a large university, you wouldn't fell special, but I have had great interaction with my professors and classmates.  I lived in the dorm this year but I am looking forward to moving into a home on campus with friends from high school and some new friends that I have made at college.  I have the best of both worlds because I am not far from home if I want to go home."
Graduate Student,5,"I love my experience at Temple University. Temple is an urban large university located in the heart of North Philadelphia. The amount of resources and aid that Temple offers their students is impeccable. I have received an abundance of support, not only academically but financially. Temple makes it their business to offer a quality education for an affordable price."
Sophomore,5,Temple is a school for everyone and anyone. The school is very diverse where they is no typical student.
Alum,5,"Amazing! Don't let the stigma of Temple being in the ""North Philly ghetto"" get to you. I always felt safe on and off campus with campus and state police always on patrol. My classes were amazing, student life was amazing. I wouldn't trade my experience at Temple for anything."
Graduate Student,5,"Temple is great! The school has really invested in itself, from the new Charles library to the renovations across campus. I am very into research and there are plenty of opportunities for that here. The social life is also really fun, and I love the sports here too. Very proud to be an owl!"
Alum,5,"Temple University was an amazing school filled with people of different backgrounds. Everyone is kind, diverse, and willing to be adventurous. The city provides an easy escape from the party scene as there are many adventurous activities to do in the city. Plus, talk about the best cheese steaks! Jim's or D'Alessandros steaks are the best. I talk about the social life first because a student who goes to school in Philly can get caught up in everything that happens in a city which can distract them from having a good time. At first, I was nervous to go to Temple with it being in north Philly, but it turned out to be the best four years I could have ever asked for and a lot had to deal with my friends I made and all the activities to do. Furthermore, the academics are good. I graduated with a 3.1 GPA while balancing my grades with a good social life. My major was Kinesiology and I had to take chemistry, physics, biology, and other hard classes, but I managed and passed them all."
Niche User,5,"Although I have not yet started attending Temple Univeristy, it is my dream school and by the visits and things that I've done so far with this school. I am glad to say that I am ready to be fully invloved as fall of 2020 quickly approaches!"
Niche User,5,"I had an amazing time at Temple University. I graduated in 2017 and can definitely say I received an excellent education. Temple has a lot of great programs and classes there and also really push for their students to get out of their comfort zones and become multifaceted individuals. You will meet people from all walks of life here; our school is nicknamed ""Diversity University"". I was a film student, but I had the chance to take a wide variety of electives such as philosophy, fencing, scuba diving and many more. I cannot recommend Temple more highly!"
Alum,5,"Temple allowed me to build my network and to enhance my knowledge in which my degree was in.  It allowed for great opportunity, as it was in Philadelphia with plenty of jobs and volunteer experiences."
Alum,5,"I love temple University. Philadelphia is a wonderful place to attend college and if you want an urban environment this is the university for you.  Great academic atmosphere, new dorms and apartments in the surrounding neighborhood are comparable to better than most universities, diverse population, social life both on campus and off is all that you can ask for, and whether you are oriented toward the art and music scene or a sports fan you will find something that supports your interests.  Take a Art History course and go to any number of area museums and see what most college students only see in books, the internet or class visuals, thousands of internship opportunities in business, the arts, education, and health sciences to name a few. In the end Temple prepares you for life after you leave campus."
Freshman,5,Top professors. Great being in Philadelphia. There are many things to do on campus. Many artistic opportunities. Brand new library with the latest resources for research and creative projects
Alum,5,"I enjoyed every bit of my time at Temple University. I started off at their Japan campus in 2009 and transferred to the main campus in winter 2011. Their campus is very small compared to the one in Philadelphia, but I enjoyed the fact that the professors were more personable and focused on each student's progress and abilities. I genuinely felt close to my art professors compared to my art professors at the main campus. However, the main campus has it's perks as well; the facilities, the Tyler School of Art, the food trucks, student clubs and events, the list goes on. Their Philadelphia campus has it all. There are so many opportunities. Also, along the lines of opportunities, they offer study abroad programs to Rome, Italy, where they also have a campus. It is small like the one in Tokyo, but it was a delight to finally have the opportunity to see Roman classic art in person on my field trips in art history courses. If you are a sucker for anything art-related, this is your jam."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere of Temple! Even though it is a large school, all of my professors genuinely care about me and my fellow classmates and make multiple opportunities for us to see them if we need help with class material."
Sophomore,4,"Because of COVID-19, my current semester at Temple University is a hybrid of online and in-person. It is much harder to learn by being taught through a screen but my professors do a good job at communicating with the class and making sure that we understand the material. I have been very lucky because my professors have put in effort to keep the class interested and focus, and this has helped me a lot throughout the semester since I often have a hard time staying focused and can easily have my attention  diverted. Overall learning online a is a very different experience but it has taught me that there are many ways to approach learning and it has also made me able to teach myself as well."
Sophomore,4,"My Experience at Temple University has been great. I really like that there are many resources available to students and how there is always an event taking place that are great experiences for students. I also like that Temple offers job opportunities and programs that are helpful for building a resume as well as job fair experiences and interviews. If there is anything that I would change I probably would like to see improvement with financial services and payment plans, just so that more students have the flexibility of paying their tuition rates on time. Although the health center is a good resource for students, there are also a lot of improvement that I would like to see with how the students are taken care of and more resources for those who do not have access to a primary doctor and may need one for certain situations."
Junior,4,Temple University is a great school with so many different opportunities. They have so many services and people to help you achieve your future dreams. The campus is very nice easy to make your way around. Very good school to attend.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Temple has been fairly good. I am enjoying the campus life and diversity here at Temple. There is a lot of new people to me especially since I already lived in the area and my High School was less than a mile away from here. I wish Temple had a better COVID plan, but I know it is hard to do because we do have an open campus."
Alum,4,Temple University had good safety relatively for its location. Many nice places to study and get work done.
Freshman,4,My experience at temple has been pretty good so far. With everything that is going on right now it can be hard to meet new people or make connections with people. Temple is trying to make sure that there is still a way to have that college experience even from home with zoom calls.
Freshman,4,My experience at temple has been pretty good so far. They are really good at keeping people updated with changes and new things. Their professors are so understanding and really try to connect with their students.
Sophomore,4,"I am in love with Temple University! Temple is dedicated to the success of their students. The drive exerted from faculty and administrators is outstanding, especially with all that has occurred over the past several months."
Freshman,4,"It is a great school for so many things but Temple is really what you make out of it. There are clubs and organizations for everything, and if you are lucky enough to get into the Honors College you will have access to exceptional academics. Sports and party scene is outstanding if that is something you are interested in. 
Just find your crowd and you will be just fine."
Freshman,4,"I liked that Temple University respects students and is a proud leader for diversity on campus and within the university. While respecting staff and students, Temple really follows by their mission statement. Temple is totally inclusive and accepting of all genders, races, and represents other minorities and ethnicities with their fun clubs! It's really easy to participate with activities on campus, there's just so much going on with clubs, groups, and other organizations to join!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the campus is nice and everyone is friendly. There isn't much to do because it's located in North Philly. With the COVID-19 situation, I feel like it could have been handled better."
Freshman,4,"I’m having a very positive experience at Temple U despite Covid-19, putting extra barriers up for everyone.  I have 3 great roommates, who desire to obtain their degree in order to build a bright future.  I can honestly say that the dorms at Temple are quite comfortable and secure.  My classes are going smoothly so far.  Each professor has made it clear that assistance is available for each student.  I think they understand that this class of freshman is nothing like any other, in the past.  Covid-19’s interjection has made the freshman year look and feel very different.  But as an Owl, I believe I will thrive!!"
Freshman,4,"I’ve only attended the first week off online classes.  But the experience has been positive.  Being able to attend class from my dorm is just like the last half of my high school senior year.  The professor seems well equipped and knowledgeable.  Temple’s IT department seems to have taken every step necessary, to insure that the online portal functions appropriately."
Freshman,4,"The professors seems very well informed and my online experience went smoothly so far, the other students were also quiet and respectful."
Freshman,4,So far the school seems to be good however the financial aid offices take such a long time to respond to you.
Freshman,4,I am only a freshman so I'm not that sure yet but so far I like temple. It is a diverse school with lots of different backgrounds which is cool because there is not one type of temple student.
Junior,4,"I took several classes online due to the COVID 19 pandemic and although it was a rocky start, my experience greatly improved over the course of the semester."
Alum,4,"When I went to Temple, I was fortunate to have a diverse group of professors with great credentials. I felt like I was getting an Ivy League education for a public school price. My academic advisors helped me stay on track to graduate and there were various campus programs that I utilized, from the writing center to the study aboard program."
Alum,4,"I did any online courses, but I felt that online communication at Temple was clear and concise. Professors were always responsive through email, coursework was present and downloadable, and assignments were easy to submit."
Junior,4,Yes I did take online classes and I am currently enrolled in online classes. The teachers make us meet online in like a group video chat where we listen to them talk and take down notes. Then they later provided a quiz for us to make sure we understand what was being teach . Also we are allowed to ask questions and ask for help .
Freshman,4,"From what I can tell, academics are great. Students have spirit and enjoy coming here for their education."
Freshman,4,Really good school. A lot to do on campus. Also Really good academics. So many wonderful people to meet. Many activities and study groups to participate in
Senior,4,"I enjoy Temple mainly because of where it is located. Due to the fact that Temple is located right at Broad Street, the Broad Street Line runs right through the campus, allowing for me to have reliable transportation to and from campus."
Freshman,4,Very easy to use and understand. Professors and advisors answer all questions and provide help to students when needed.
Freshman,4,Very helpful when you have questions or concerns. Helped me to easily transfer from high school to college life.
Senior,4,Some classes are fine online some should be more in the classroom. Certain subjects require more people interaction in order to be most effective. The basic courses are fine online but most of not all the advanced courses should be in classrooms. Even if they have to be smaller classes and spread out would work too.
Sophomore,4,"As a computer science major, I had the advantage since my labs were already done on computers. My ability to learn math was great, but the exams were hard to take with the time limit and submitting screenshots properly. I personally feel that learning languages online was impossible. We stopped meeting regularly so instead of me teaching myself new words, I skimmed through the notes as quickly as possible. All in all, I was satisfied with my grades in the end, but I do prefer in class learning."
Sophomore,4,"It’s an extremely diverse school with great student life. Compared to other Philadelphia schools, Temple University is much more affordable. I do think the professors and advisors really care about the students succeeding which is extremely motivating. The college attracts people from all sorts of family incomes which is comforting. I never can complain about the food because the campus offers so many options to make everyone feel at home."
Junior,4,"I love my dorm here but I am not sure I can say the same about all the professors. Those who are really passionate about teaching end up grading really badly. And those who do grade normally dont really care about teaching. The campus is good. I wish we had a tacobell here. Further, tuition is good for citizens since they get FAFSA and everything but being an international students sucks because we pay more than double the amount most of them pays.Overall it ain't bad."
Junior,4,"I feel like the professors are doing their best to help us in this situation and pandemic of coronavirus. It's hard for them too. Ofcourse, in person is always preferred."
Sophomore,4,"The staff is amazingly helpful, but since the school is diverse, there are some people who view this diversity as a bad thing. Campus also becomes a wind tunnel very fast. However, the staff at financial services and the bursar's office could be more helpful in my experience."
Sophomore,4,I loved the city and the friends I met. I just wish the board wasn't taking so much  money from their students.
Senior,4,I like the fluid movement of not having to attend class at a certain time. This allows me to work at my part time job more and I still get my work done.
Senior,4,"The city of Philadelphia is what has really drawn me to Temple University. They have a vast selection of classes and student activities. A negative experience I had was when I lived off campus and my apartment got robbed twice... and I lost my laptop twice. This hurt me financially, but as a student living in north Philadelphia, it happens to someone at some point."
Alum,4,"Professors were absolutely wonderful. Library is a bit small for a large campus, but computers and printers are easy to use."
Junior,4,"While Temple University isn't my first choice for college, it was still a choice worth considering. I can't say much, since I'm barely outside; but based on the groups and clubs around here. I'd say the place has a loving community."
Sophomore,4,"I only ever took online classes when the pandemic hit my city hard. Since the pandemic my classes have been placed online. Covid-19 was unexpected and it threw everyone off. Transitioning from in-person classes to online classes was tough. At that time I was taking a theatre class which was difficult for obvious reasons. That particular professor was frustrating and hard to work with online because she still required us to do things that we could only achieve in person. My Math teacher on the other hand was understanding and easy to work with. He understood that this was a difficult time for everyone.He worked hard so that we actually understood the material. Overall, online classes depends on the professors. I am a person that pays more attention in class, when my classes were placed online I had a tough time. Most of my professor worked hard so that I could understand, while others could care less."
Junior,4,"I prefer to have in class sessions, but I think professors adjusted well to online learning. They tried their best to make sure everyone was on the same page and as comfortable as they could be with the way things had to be this past year. Not everything would work out perfectly and you could sense the tension and stress, but I think they did everything they could to make it work."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Temple so far has been interesting. I met new people and created great memories within my first year. My academic advisor is always there when I need help. Although it is easy to feel like you are going through the college process alone because of how big the University is. I have had some great professors who offer help when needed, and over all campus is very vibrant and always has something interesting going on."
Junior,4,"so far all my professors were easy going and very understanding, I feel like my professors truly wanted to see me succeed and make more of my life"
Junior,4,"so far all my professors were easy going and very understanding, I feel like my professors truly wanted to see me succeed and make more of my life"
Senior,4,"Temple  University is a good school. It offers great facilities equipped for student's success. My most favorite feature of the college is the computer lab. It stays open until very late hours so that students can have access to computer, wi-fi and a place to study. This is greatly appreciated.

Something that I found detrimental was the fact internships in my field of study are not as readily available. this major is somewhat of a broad field because one can do many things with it such as, qualify for medical school, etc... And because it is a broad field, I often times wonder what there is to do with just a bachelor's degree. It would have been much clearer if the school had people to help the students to explore their options with a degree in this field. One thing I noticed is very well done with the Kinesiology department, as they help their students find internships. I wondered why my department did not do the same."
Senior,4,The online class I took were very good. I found Zoom very useful and professors were willing to help and answer any questions.
Senior,4,"The campus a beautiful. There are plenty of food options to fulfill your every craving. The recreation available is expansive and extremely useful. The professors really care about their students. I have taken many really interesting and amazing classes that I will remember forever. There are great resources such as the writing center, the tech center, the Charles Library and many more that can help with resume building and other things to help with classes and future job opportunities. There are many different clubs and on/off campus activities available for all students to participate in as well."
Freshman,4,I have yet to attend temple university. I am incoming freshman but I have visisted the school and have done research and spent hours during quarantine to get a feel fo the school. although I have not taken an online course yet I will be when the fall semeste4r starts and I believe they are doing a great job with the online experience we ae receiving before hand.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Temple University is very good. The academics are good, the price is fair, and I feel very safe."
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience with Temple started out rocky but did get better. I definitely did not learn as much as I would have if we were in person though.
Sophomore,4,"At first, my online experience was difficult considering I never took online classes before. However the professors were very accommodating given the circumstances."
Alum,4,"I took some classes online prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The professors taught those classes well. For this spring semester, I took all my classes online through Zoom. I thought that the professors did a good job with zoom considering that it was all on such short notice."
Alum,4,I went to Temple all 4 years of college. I liked Temple very much. My major was Biology with a minor in Spanish. They have great academic programs there. The student life was great as well.
Senior,4,Temple is located in a big city and full of diversity. I felt very welcome and at home here. I would like to see Temple invest in the North Philadelphia community more.
Freshman,4,"I am about to attend Temple University, and have solar been helpful with the beginning steps of college. Can't wait to attend!"
Freshman,4,They have handled all of the incoming freshman questions very well and have kept all of us excited despite the changes due to covid
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the academics at Temple University are excellent, especially given the price. You’re getting a quality education that is affordable. Not to mention, the experience at Temple University is pretty nice. The campus is great for those who love a city, but still want a campus-like experience."
Junior,4,"Right now I commute so I do not know too much about the full Temple student experience. But, as a transfer student the business school seems great."
Junior,4,"My experience studying in temple university is very good, the professors are always willing to help you, and it hasn´t been difficult to take online classes."
Junior,4,"What I loved about Temple Univeristy was that people from all over the country and world went there, it was interesting to see. I also loved how nice the professors were. And just the overall scenery that Temple sits in is so fun to be around. Something that Temple can improve on would be helping students with their financial needs. Temple is considered to be a more inexpensive university to most, but for me and money other students who are not thriving in the money department, it is still a lot. I am paying for this university by myself, no help from my parents because they cannot take out anymore loans, but I still want to give myself the best education I can, even if it means putting myself in debt. So, if Temple could help their needy students more, that would be amazing. Other than that, I love Temple University."
Sophomore,4,Campus is safe with polices going around. The new Charles library is amazing. There are so many different food trucks around campus.
Freshman,4,"Temple University is a college with an incredibly diverse student body. Located in the city of Philadelphia, students are given the opportunity to experience a wide range of culture while pursuing their higher education."
Senior,4,"Temple is a great university , there are multiple places accessible for students to have time for themselves to study or relax. Only downside to temple is the 4 years I've been here I haven't had a teacher that actually cared about what they taught or their students. It's always about following the course plan. I have so many classes I was genuinely interested in learning but got overwhelmed by coursework."
Freshman,2,"I took all of my classes online, and the professors were not exactly technologically trained. Most of them knew how to navigate the Zoom program, but there were a lot of times where audio was hard to hear, and a lot of the professors were uncomfortable with the awkwardness of teaching an online class. Student participation definitely declined to an all time low, with cameras and audios off. I definitely don't think we are receiving the education we did when we were on campus and in-person classes."
Senior,2,I had to do online learning last minute with Temple do to the pandemic and my experience wasn't great. The classes were not initially molded to the online learning atmosphere therefore it was extremely disorganized and confusing. I had a lot of extra and seemingly pointless busy work to fulfill requirements that were not there at the start of the class in the spring.
Graduate Student,2,Temple is a cool school not the best. I chose Temple due to financial reasons. If I had the money or offered more scholarships I would have choose a different campus.
Junior,2,"I applied to Temple with little to no research on this school, other than the name which is highly regarded across Philadelphia. My first semester, the ""vibe"" felt off to me. Coming up on my fourth semester I can definitvely say, I do not like this school and am looking into other accredited universities to transfer into. 

First of all, most students who seem fascinated by Temple are from out of town. They enjoy the Philadelphia experience Temple offers. For students who are local, such as myself, I am not impressed with it. Additionally, I have only had one or two instructors thus far that I genuinely feel wanted to see me succeed in my career choice. The rest appeared to me to be either narrcissitic, rude or wanted you to feel you were getting your money's worth by overcomplicating simple material. 

I did meet some great students here, a few of which I still keep in contact with contact with long after our classes together."
Sophomore,2,"As a classical music major, I did not find Temple to be the place for me.  This is absolutely not to say this is the case for everyone (or even every music major for that matter).  Temple has a great social environment for students with a strong emphasis on diversity.  There is lots of great food on campus if you avoid the dining halls and eat at the food trucks all parked around campus (there's also great food in Center City if you're willing to make the trek).  I found the focus on academics to be average (or maybe slightly below so), but I really enjoyed being a member of the Honors College and really enjoyed studying with my current music professor.  Overall, make sure you thoroughly research Temple and weigh it against your other options for your college studies before making a decision."
Freshman,2,"Temple is way too cliquey. People talk about how diverse it is, but most people just stick to themselves and people of similar ethnic groups / social classes. Parties are okay. I personally don't like being out too late in North Philly when I'm buzzed. Safety here is awful. I've had a slushy thrown at me walking home from the gym,  my roommate and I were followed to our dorm on two separate occasions, and businesses let homeless people loiter in their stores. If you want to work in the Philly area, Temple has a really strong business school. It's not recognized nationally though. Tyler is one of the best art schools in the country. However, if you're not in the business or art school, I would not recommend going here, especially if you are out of state. Their college of liberal arts and STEM majors are not that strong."
Senior,2,The advisors are useless; they send you back and forth between different advisors because nobody knows anything. Most of the science and math teachers speak broken English. The school only caters to students who live on campus and they don’t care about the commuter students.
Junior,2,"Temple is a decent size school. That means there is a good amount of students. Things get packed very quickly. Temple has a terrible administration system. There are a select few within the administration that want to help you. However, everyone else just about wants to get rid of you and sends you to a different office and in the end you end up where you started. They are still on blackboard, so their system sucks. However, they do have beautiful campus; however, it is not that safe. Temple Main Campus is in Philadelphia. There is a lot of crime. This year there have been a few students whom have lost their lives at Temple."
Freshman,2,"I had a good scholarship for my first year.  I was not informed about requirement changes.  Less than one month before classes begin got an email saying no longer qualify for scholarship.  Financial Services said ""NO APPEAL PROCESS"".  Too bad if you struggle during your freshman year."
College Senior,2,"My school cut a bunch of D1 sports to build a football stadium for our sub par team. They care about sports only in the respect that they care about making money, even if that means sacrificing affordability for students, safety, and the homes of the surrounding communities."
College Senior,2,I constantly get notifications about muggings and assault.
College Sophomore,2,Don't really have Greek life at school
College Senior,2,"The greeks are very cliquey and make up the majority of people on campus who act stuck up and entitled. They lock all their members in the tech center and monitor them during mandatory 'study hours' so that they can brag about their average gpa's, which would be fine except that this usually results in large groups socializing disturbing most students who are actually trying to do work. As far as the 'alumni network' is concerned if you're in the business school you're going to get a job anyway, I can't speak for the other schools. Anyone who thinks that frats are the only parties at Temple really has no idea what they're talking about. We've recently had several houses disciplined for 'unsavory activities' which the student body has always known about. I'd say lots of universities have a big greek life, Temple isn't one of them. If you plan on greek life being a big part of your college career I'd suggest looking somewhere else.

Of course all the greeks will disagree, it's fair to say that we agree to disagree. We don't like them and they don't like us."
College Freshman,2,"Don't be an idiot, and you'll be fine. Don't walk alone, especially North, especially if you are a girl. Sad but true."
College Freshman,2,It was very hard trying to find somewhere to live on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Overall, I have not enjoyed my experience at this school and am sincerely looking forward to graduating. There were classes I really wanted to take, but sometimes the professors are not professional at all, whether that be reflected in their grading or their treatment of students they don't like. There was a lot of favouritism, and I just don't like to engage in that kind of thing for the sake of a grade. Overall, it reminds me of an expensive high school, and as said, I just want to get my degree and get more real-world experience."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are some departments that have been incredibly friendly and helpful, but the departments I have to see the most (with the exception of a few) are most often the departments that are the worst to work with. They are impatient and do not want to deal with individual student's needs. It's actually frustrating to have to go down to them with an issue when I already know they don't want to work on it."
College Senior,2,"There don't seem to be many perks to being an alumnus, unfortunately, and job prospects are not always easily in reach or clear."
College Senior,2,"As said before, some grading policies with certain teachers are very strange. (For example, for group projects, one teacher insists routinely that he will only give one group of students in the class an A. All the other groups' work, whether of equal quality or not, will receive a lower grade.) Grading tends to be inconsistent, and at some points downright strange or debatable. However, it is difficult to wish to appeal unfair grading because the teacher is almost always viewed as ""right"" at the school, and there is the risk that the teacher will also punish the student in future for having questioned the grading. There have been a variety of grading methods at Temple Japan, and only some seem ""normal"". On top of this, for some classes, teachers show up late or sometimes not at all. Things feel generally a little too laidback or unprofessional at points."
College Senior,2,"There is no proper campus for Temple Japan, as the school exists within just one building, which is also shared with a Japanese company. Housing for the school is quite far from the building itself, but I do not and have not lived in the campus housing, so I cannot properly judge it. I can only say that the dormitories are quite far."
College Senior,2,"It's more of a safety school at this point. It was one of my options, and I chose to take it. But I have not felt satisfied with a lot of aspects of the school, including class material, grading policies, and the overall school experience. Even though I did have the school listed as a safety option only, I still went in with high hopes for what I could achieve there. I feel like a lot of those hopes were dashed because the school does not have enough resources and seems more to be trying to just ""get by"" than actually focus on and assist students. I am also among a few students who have been verbally abused by the financial aid advisor at the school for ""being extra trouble"" for being in need of financial aid. Such experiences have left a sour taste at the school, on top of the general disappointment while attending."
College Freshman,2,"There's a large contingent of the student body that drink, and many drink to excess as well. That's not to say that you can't find the non-drinking group, but alcohol and weed are very visible at this school."
College Junior,2,It was a horrible decision.
College Senior,2,this is a concern of mine. career prospects seem week and career fairs are lacking
College Sophomore,2,Temple only really cares about football and basketball. All of the other sports don't get much funding or attention. The school even cut several teams a couple years ago while they're looking to upgrade the already nice football facilities.
College Junior,2,"its not very good. the only good thing about on campus dining is the food trucks and Cosi, but the Sodexo employees are the absolute worst!"
College Junior,2,"it's sort of hard to get scholarships (in my experience) here, because everyone is applying for them. its a university in a very poverty stricken area, so most people need the money."
College Freshman,2,"unless you physically go to the office, goodluck.."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're in greek life, non greeks don't really care for Greeks. Greeks think they're great while others couldn't care less. Obviously there are special circumstances, i have friends in greek life who i love, but overall it's kind of a joke and you only put up with the frats for the parties."
College Freshman,2,Off campus in North Philly  is definitely not a good idea. Students get robbery emails every now and then and its soo scary sometimes but that's the sad reality. THose homes are also cheaper than oon campus dorms so that's what makes them good apart from that the security is poor.
College Freshman,2,enough money is not given out
College Junior,2,I haven't received much help from my financial aid office. I'm struggling to pay for school and housing
College Freshman,2,"It is the end of April and yet I am a returning student still awaiting my finical aid package. I submitted my fasfa on January 26th, yet the only feed back I get from Temple is that I need to submit my fasfa or it has not been processed yet. In addition they do not incorporate off campus housing on a tuition bill to ease the process of getting a loan, even though they do not have nearly enough on campus housing for students."
College Junior,2,The financial aid office does not know what they are doing and the line is always extremely long.
College Sophomore,2,It is very difficult to talk to a financial aid adviser and often times they get confused as to a possible solution. The best tip I can give is to do a lot of research on your own and only go to the office if absolutely necessary.
College Freshman,2,"It is such a headache, you have to wait forever to even talk to anybody and when you do they seemed to not know what they are doing! I hate dealing with the financial aid issues!"
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office workers do not do their job to the fullest extent to make sure you get your aid that you were awarded credited to your account. They will answer questions tat you did not ask just to tip toe around what your initial issue is. If you do receive any scholarship, grants,etc. make sure you are on top of everything and know exactly what you need to ask and get taken care of. The office is also always packed in the beginning and the end of the semesters."
College Freshman,2,"Not the best options when you look at it from the health aspect. Majority of the staff are very rude and act like they hate their job, which makes your experience unpleasant. The value just is not worth it along with the fact that your meals don not roll over if not used."
College Freshman,2,"I do love Temple and that is the school I decided to attend. However, they should have given me more scholarships, other schools offered me more."
College Junior,2,There are very few scholarships offered through the school
College Junior,2,TUJ doesn't have a meal plan. It literally just has a vending machine or two
College Junior,2,"There is never any parking around Temple. I typically like to try to park on the street because it costs about $20+ a day to park in the garages; however, it takes me about 20 minutes to find a spot close to campus."
College Junior,2,"Temple makes it extremely difficult to get aid. Most colleges deadlines for aid are may 1st, Temples is March 1st meaning your taxes have to be done way ahead of time. Also the financial aid office is awful. They do not assist with any problems you may be having and the wait is extremely long."
College Sophomore,2,"For Temple being such an amazing school academically, they're financial aid is HORRIBLE. They seem like they don't care and don't want to help you get an education. They try to rip you off!"
College Sophomore,2,To pricey for what we pay for.
Recent Alumnus,2,The off campus housing is reasonably priced but extremely unsafe due to the high crime rate in the area.
College Freshman,2,The Greek houses are awful and their reputations are even worse.
College Senior,2,The food is expensive. I don't have a meal plan.
College Freshman,2,"Sororities don't officially have their own houses in Pennsylvania due to being considered ""brothels"", which heavily impacts their role in Greek life here. Most of the frats are alright; they're really only good for being the backup option or last stop of the night for people who go out on the weekends due to how small, cramped, and unclean they are."
College Student,2,If you want to see a real party come to my parents restaurant hosting. You'll re-question everything you ever called a 'party'.
College Junior,2,Students tend not to venture too far off-campus. The surrounding neighborhood is not a safe area.
College Junior,2,"All schools are pricey, but my tuition jumped about 10% this year due to becoming an upperclassman and the tuition hike. This was the first time I fell short on funding and I was told there was nothing more I could do."
College Junior,2,"There are many incidents that occur off campus. North Philadelphia is not safe, it is best to live on campus, at least for one year to learn the layout."
College Freshman,2,Any place worth while is kind of far.
College Freshman,2,Only one percent of the university is involved in Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,"Center city Philadelphia is very nice and I really enjoy visiting there. There are plenty of attractions, including museums, concerts, and other events. Overall it is mostly safe and there's much to do. Unfortunately North Philadelphia, where Temple University is located, is not the same. It is located in a low income area, where there are constant occasional unfortunate, sometimes life-threaten occurances between the students and locals. I would like to see a bigger improvement in the satety, as well as condition of the area to make it as enjoyable as the rest of the surrounding city."
College Junior,2,"Its hit or miss.  Either you live in one of the brand new $100 million dollar dorms with all 2014 amenities (of which there are only 2), or you can live in any of the other dorms (of which there are 9).  It was very clear the Temple University simply bought an old nursing home and turned it into a dormitory (Temple Towers).  The ""living room"" in my suite was roughly 15' x 40' , the ""dining room"" was 20' x 45' and the bedroom (shared with another student) was 11' x 14'.  It was so small that the door hit the bed and couldn't open all the way.  I requested a loft kit in order to put my bed higher, then be able to fit my desk under it and open up some more space, was told ""underclassmen aren't allowed to have loft kits because undergraduates are more prone to falling out of bed""...???  Also, 350 people per wing, 1 elevator, max capacity 4 people...  Move in day = chaos with elevators so small couldn't fit mattresses inside.  

Security is a joke, but I'll get to that in later segments."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office is always busy. Never give up on receiving financial aid, no matter how stressful it might be. With hard work and dedication 7 times out of 10 financial aid will come your way."
College Freshman,2,"Safety is definitely a big concern. I would not suggest living off campus, the neighborhood is not the best, so it is not always safe to live to far away. its much better living in the center of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The food track cost is low,but the price is high to customer. And the food may be is not healthy."
Sophomore,1,"This is a school that only cares about rankings, statistics and ultimately your money. The tested material does not reflect what is taught in class. Your time is better spent studying and reading the book rather than attending classes. Perhaps if temple wasn't so concerned about their GPA's, graduation rates and padding their pockets they would actually take some of their time and resources to teach their students actual content! Forget clubs and extra curricular activities, you wont have any time for that. You'll be so busy wanting off your self from the unrealistic work load that you will just be lucky if your able to have more than 1 meal a day. I wouldn't wish this experience on my enemy. 

Oh and the student population is pretty diverse or something like that."
Sophomore,1,The online learning experience at Temple is by far one of the worst experiences in my life. If i have to do this another semester i wont be coming back.
Senior,1,"My online learning experience at Temple University last semester was very poor. While a sudden transition from physical to digital learning would be difficult for the average person, the way Temple, specifically the teachers, handled the situation made it even worse."
Sophomore,1,It was extremely hard to follow along online classes as professors were unable to conduct a learning environment that was able to engage and support students. I failed my classes because my teachers were unable to give productive criticism and let many students down.
Niche User,1,Chemistry Program is awful. Taught by TAs and all classwork is done on a web page that does not work even though I payed to go to a college not an online school and was supposed to be in actual classes! I would rate 0 stars if i could! Never give this school your money or time they give nothing in return.
Graduate Student,1,Staff is not culturally aware if you’re a person of color. There’s favoritism from professors towards certain students. Grading system isn’t fair nor accurate.
College Senior,1,"I see security sleeping at the desk sometimes when I leave school very late, around midnight, one am... Sometimes, they're not even at the desk. I get TuAlert notifications on my phone about armed robberies within a block away from our art building. The place where I live is 10 block away and I have to stay at school sometimes if the weather is bad and I can't bike home safely. I find broken windows in our apartment and hear gunshots."
College Senior,1,I live in a dangerous area
College Junior,1,I hate everything about greek life here. its completely irrelevant and the only people that don't see it that way are the greek participants.
College Sophomore,1,i am not affiliated with anything greek and dont plan on it
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek life at Temple Japan.
College Senior,1,"At the Temple Japan campus, there aren't really any active sports teams or events. This is probably because there is no actual place to practice! (Temple Japan shares a single building with a Japanese company and has no actual campus.) It's really a shame, actually."
College Junior,1,My room flooded my first semester because of a pipe burst.
College Junior,1,greek life is too wild on campus
College Junior,1,The sports teams are given way too much funding.
College Sophomore,1,Hate the school I am in. Just trying to finish up and graduate with my degree.
College Freshman,1,They don't allocate enough money for students to comfortably live on campus without taking out a lot of loans so i commute.
College Freshman,1,Takes forever to process the financial aid letter and the staff is rude
College Junior,1,They never offer me any scholarships. Very difficult
College Freshman,1,The food is absolutely terrible. Half the time you swipe into J&H and they hardly have any food out and you can't get your meal swipe back so you're stuck eating pizza and burgers that give you a terrible stomach ache. It is way too overpriced for the quality of food we receive and next to impossible to eat a meal without having a stomach ache after.
College Junior,1,"I only say it is the worst because off-campus is very unsafe. Temple is not in a good area there are shootings, drug deals, robberies all the time. It is not safe to live off-campus. The houses and landlords are cheap and nice though."
College Junior,1,Temple University offers no scholarships to graduate students.
College Freshman,1,Terrible. Barely any aid given.
College Sophomore,1,I don't have any financial aid.But my family hard to support my kinds of fee in U.S.So i want to get a financial aid to reduce my parents burden.
College Sophomore,1,"The school kept changing my financial aid, so I had to constantly make changes to my previous loan requests. It is still an ongoing process as well."
College Sophomore,1,I have had my computer and my camera stolen. The campus security even PERSONALLY told me that their security cameras suck.
College Junior,1,"No, I wanted to switch major but it is too late. I did not like the teachers, I did not like the materials I am learning."
College Junior,1,"I hate my program, Health Information Management. It is very small, even though it is a growing major.The curriculum is set and if you cannot pass the class with a 73, you have to retake the class, but the worse part is that it is only offer once a year, therefore your schedule will be messed up. Many of the classes seems repetitive, I learned about the same material over and over again."
College Freshman,1,East coast weather in general is pretty horrible. Its humid in the summer and in the winter its cloudy and cold and depressing but if your from the east coast your used to weather like this
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any type of aid at all.
College Freshman,1,Not knowing what classes to take.
College Freshman,1,"I don't have a car on campus, but I know some commuters who drive and I hear it's awful. One time my friend missed an entire class just because they were looking for a spot the entire time."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no enforcement of anything, even when in broad daylight."
College Sophomore,1,Walking around--during the day or at night--alone is dangerous.
College Sophomore,1,"Temple nickels and dimes its students, and they refused to make the new scholarship guidelines retroactive, which would have helped a lot of students afford their education."
College Sophomore,1,There is usually never any parking when it matters the most.
College Sophomore,1,"Marijuana, Molly, Speed, and others are everywhere in this University, and enforcement is non-existent."
College Freshman,1,"I don't own a car, but you can easily see how there are never any spots."
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process is absolutely horrible to go through. Every month, I receive an email from Temple, stating something is wrong. One month, my check bounced and I had to pay late fees and it inhibited my registration. The next month, my PHEAA grant was not given to me, and a financial hold was placed on my account. Another month, none of the process went through. In addition, Temple practically did not give me any aid. Some tips I have for getting financial aid, is to apply early, to account for any mishaps that may occur. "
College Junior,1,Parking is miserable! You can never find a spot unless you pay a lot of money.
College Junior,1,"I received financial aid but overall I can say that the financial aid office is the absolute worst part about this school. You can call all day and no one will pick up, wait in person for 2 hours, and someone still might not be able to help you. They also sat on my Parent Plus loan so long they screwed it up and told me my Sophomore year I owed them Sophomore and Freshman tuition. It was only after we threatened a lawyer did they try to fix the situation."
College Junior,1,"I really want to like Temple. I don't hate it, I don't hate the friends I've made, and I don't hate my program. But Temple administration has screwed me over multiple times, from financial aid to messing up my course schedule. Beyond that, it still feels a lot like high school. If that's something you like, that's fine. I just don't think Temple is for me."
College Junior,1,"Living on campus isn't great. The dorms are old and not very well maintained, and there isn't much of a sense of community. Off campus housing isn't much better either; usually a very dingy place with sky high prices."
College Junior,1,"No one really cares for greek life on campus; that's not to say most people hate greeks; we just don't care beyond the parties they throw, and those are usually pretty crappy."
College Junior,1,Our library is quite nice though I feel like it's very small for a college library. Most of the students are commuters so there isn't much of going on in the way of student life
College Sophomore,1,Always apply for financial aid in a timely manner.
College Sophomore,1,Temple University's attendance policy is very strict. The only thing more stringent is the academia policies.
College Sophomore,1,"Do not even try to call and get some useful information. You will probably end up staying on the phone for 2 hours on hold for someone to answer the phone who doesn't even take the time to correctly view and analyze your account. And if you go in the office to speak to a counselor they are very rude. They do not try to understand your issues and will send you on your way frustrated and ready to cry. They don't provide much grant or scholarship info either, I asked was told ""We don't do that you have to do it yourself"""
College Sophomore,1,There are a lot of security guards but they obviously cant cover every inch of the campus. Its no out of the ordinary to hear of someone getting robbed on campus. Its best to travel in groups and keep some pepper spray handy. 
College Sophomore,1,There's a process you have to go through online first. Then you go through the actual meeting process where you find out if you actually got into the organization of your choice. I guess it pretty much the same everywhere else. 
College Senior,1,Temple parking is horrible they have plenty parking lots but they are expensive. Off campus parking fills really fast..
Recent Alumnus,1,I would give academics a higher grade if the administrative staff and student financial services were not completely inept.
Recent Alumnus,1,I am happy with my program outside of the administrative staff and the student financial services. I would not do it again because the aforementioned draw backs are so terrible it is not worth the benefits of the program.
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is only focused on drinking and getting laid. There are parties which are disgusting dirty events filled with drunk girls with no respect for their self.
Recent Alumnus,1,Temple University is in North Philly which is full of crime and destitution. Students cannot leave campus without fear of being shot or robbed.
College Senior,1,I have to park off campus and am subject to City ticketing
College Senior,1,Parking at Temple University can be a nightmare. students should get to campus at least 40 minutes before your class. be sure not to get parking ticket. I would recommend that if you are running late try to park on temple parking spots and pay $ 13 instead $ 45 or $90 ticket.
College Senior,1,"Parking is terrible, and the towing services are even worse"
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is the absolute worst.  If you don't purchase a parking pass, which is expensive AF, you'll never find another parking space on the street."
College Sophomore,1,Nobody cares if you drink or party.  The police are there to make sure you're safe because the location is in north philly.  If there's a massive party that is out of hand the police will shut it down but they don't arrest anybody even though it's obvious there are underage drinkers.  I love it.

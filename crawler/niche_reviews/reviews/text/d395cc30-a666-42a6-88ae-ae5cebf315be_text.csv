Sophomore,5,"Professors care about students, and will work with them towards their success. The small size of this college really allows students and professors to connect. Online classes still allowed for classroom discussion, and where possible were kept interactive."
Sophomore,5,"A nurturing and welcoming community with caring faculty, and an engaged, and active student body. Classes are small, rigorous, and challenging. Professors are readily available, and the Center for Student Success has further academic resources for students who may seek it. Connections are built, and fostered on so many levels across the beautiful campus. 

The dining services are top notch, and the staff are extremely friendly, and accommodating. Concordiaâ€™s music program is exemplary, offering opportunities to participating in choir, band, and orchestra. The school offers a strong foundation in all areas of study, while encouraging values  of critical thinking, and application to the community. Being a D3 school, sports are not all-encompassing at Concordia- athletes are students first- that being said, there are many opportunities to participate in sports,  or attend games and cheer-on fellow students. There is a lot of school spirit here.

A hidden gem in Minnesota!"
Sophomore,5,"From the moment that you step on campus, you get an immediate sense of community. Every single person you walk by will smile or greet you and would be willing to help you find a certain area or building that you are looking for. It has a small enough campus where you don't need to worry about getting lost, and almost all of your classes are within a 10 minute walking distance from where you would be rooming. The campus itself is absolutely gorgeous with plenty of areas for picnics, stretching out on the lawn, or going hamocking. Not only this, but the surrounding Fargo-Moorhead area is filled with tons of fun shops, restaurants, and coffee stops, which are perfect for when you're family comes to visit!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the the caring environment provided by the faculty and staff. I feel like I am free to express myself in any matter that I wish, and can finally be free."
Senior,5,The college is not known for online learning however is committed to ensuring student success both in the classroom and outside. Students are encouraged to be somewhat self-reliant and pursue opportunities and self manage themselves. overall great experience with online courses.
Freshman,5,Professors were always available in need. The Information Technology Services of the college helped students with the necessary technologies with the transition to remote learning
Freshman,5,It is a small college and everyone is ready to help everyone. There are always resources to help you out. It has been my second home.
Niche User,5,"I have not yet attended Concordia, but my experience with them so far just with interviews and getting involved has been excellent. My first experience with the college was with the soccer coach, he really from my first meeting with him stuck out with how helpful he was and optimistic with everything. I also stayed overnight in the dorm twice and got to know the team, that in itself really showed me that everyone is so nice and encouraging. Overall I really think that this is going to be a great experience and I can't wait to go next year."
Niche User,5,"When i toured the campus was amazing and the people were so friendly, it was like a small community! The only thing they could work on is getting air conditioning in the dorms."
Freshman,5,Concordia has a very friendly environment. Lots of people are there to help if needed. The size of the campus makes it easier to not get lost. Also allows you to see more individuals. Concordia shows concern for your own individual and the community. They do a great job of recruiting students.
Freshman,5,"I really like being a student here. I am on the women's soccer team and am involved in relay for life and cobberthon. I have had a great experience so far. People are very welcoming and friendly, that's one reason I like it here so much but it also feels like a second family to me."
Freshman,5,Everyone at Concordia College is so friendly. I also enjoy how serious they take academics. It is a wonderful school that has a lot of diversity. The financial aid department was very generous.
Niche User,5,How big it was and close to home for my major and career. The tour was good and I was able to see what class and dorm life would be like. I have always wanted to attend Concordia as it has the law program I want to attend. They also have a high acceptance rate into Law School after.
Alum,5,"What a warm and welcoming community! The arts here are phenomenal, and the excellence of the choir and its opportunities were some of the best experiences I ever had. Great place to get a degree and learn about yourself!"
Freshman,5,"I love the students, professors and everything about Concordia. Everyone is so friendly and nice. The professors really care about you and want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,"I have only attended one year at Concordia College so far, but it already feels like home to me. I have made many good friends and am happy with most of the classes I have taken thus far. The professors I have had have all been very kind and understanding, and are also very approachable. The alumni presence and pride is outstanding, and I love being a part of the cobber community!"
Junior,5,"Concordia College is such a special community. The network between prospective students, current students, alumni, and faculty is so strong and supportive. Because it is a private school, students have access to excellent resources and teaching. As a small school, it is hard to individuals to disappear into the mass. The professors care about you individually and will help you reach success. Concordia excels in many areas: music, science, business, english, you name it! It is a fun school in which students form meaningful, lifelong relationships and are prepared to positively influence the affairs of the world."
Sophomore,5,"I love Concordia for its teachers, how easy schedules are to manage, and their Dining Services are the best in the state! People there are always there to help in any way they can. The Career Center is a helpful tool in figuring out how the future might pan out, and they do get you out in 4 years as long as you don't switch your major after your Softmore year to a completely different department."
Freshman,5,"I traveled to Concordia College with my mom in the middle of a wet storm, we hydroplaned into a ditch, we're fine, but we had to get a hotel. We had to have our appointments and visits pushed back, but they were very accommodating and stayed in contact with us in order to make sure I'd still be able to tour the campus and see the dorms. A professor from the Nursing department met with me and my mom on a Saturday when he usually would not even be in the building! My mother and her mother both attended Concordia in the 90s and allowed my grandmother to attend because she was part of the staff. They were very accommodating then, too, and allowed her to leave work to go to class. Overall, this school has made me excited to go to college! Sure, I'm a little nervous, but I know that I'll be in great hands at Concordia."
Niche User,5,I will be attending Concordia College in Moorhead this coming fall.  I am very impressed with what I have learned so far.  They are a very impressive institution.
Freshman,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Concordia is the place where dreams come true. I am really excited about this place as I have dreamt of it my whole teenage years. Apply, Live, study, work, experience and enjoy!!!!!"
Freshman,5,"Concordia provides a small, safe environment where you can learn from professors who take the time to know you. The music building is spectacular and Dr. Haberman is an amazing band director. During band, he is constantly motivating us to be better. Working with Dr. Wakefield, the clarinet professor, is also great. He works with whatever flaws you have as an instrumentalist and helps you to overcome them. Concordia feels like a second family, especially in the music building. The campus is small enough that it feels like home. You can walk around campus and engage in multiple conversations because you know that many people on campus. This college is a great place for college students to find a second home."
Sophomore,5,"The community is absolutely wonderful. The campus maybe small, but the community is definitely worth it."
Sophomore,5,"Good value, good academics, especially in the sciences! Nice People.  I am on the tennis team and in the choir and I am really enjoying my time hear so far."
Junior,5,Concordia is a welcoming place with a great learning environment and a community that cares. Don't let the cold Moorhead/Fargo winters chase you away! The warmth of the people on campus will be more than enough to make up for it.
Freshman,5,"First I am very impressed about the campus very clean big and distressful
secondly the staff is very pleasant and help me a lot to focus on my 4 years plan."
Senior,5,"I love the welcoming atmosphere at Concordia and the opportunities you have as a student. I've interned for a local magazine, worked out in Washington D.C. for a semester away, and been published, all during my undergraduate career. I do hope that they continue to address the lack of diversity on campus and upgrade the athletic facilties."
Freshman,5,I like how kind the area is and the community that is at this college. The professors are all supportive and very helpful. Overall I feel like this school is very committed to the success of its students.
Freshman,5,"I wasn't really sure what I wanted when I made the decision to come to Concordia, but I absolutely love everything I've found here."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful college. Great professors, small campus and good classes. There is a lot of care put into the students and even though the initial price tag looks high, almost half of that tuition is paid in scholarships just from the college itself."
Alum,5,Concordia College was absolutely one of the greatest adventures of my life. The education that I received was fantastic and I had so many opportunities that I am confident I would not have received anywhere else. Concordia helped me grow and become confident in my decisions. I truly do not know where I would be if it weren't for all of the wonderful people and experiences I encountered at Concordia.
Junior,5,"Concordia College is very community-driven.  The college puts academics at high priority but also gives students a lot of opportunities to make the most of their college experience through residence life, clubs and orgs, music, theatre, athletics, and student government."
Freshman,5,I love the people. Everyone is welcoming and they make you feel at home. When I am away from campus all I think about is when I get to go back.
Freshman,5,Everyone here is so friendly and willing to help you no matter what it is you are dealing with. The professors here are super funny as well.
Freshman,5,Campus is very same.You can even walk without any fear at mid night.Academic is very good and professors are very caring.
Freshman,5,"I thoroughly enjoy Concordia-Moorhead because I do not feel like just another college student/number there. The professors care about each and everyone of their students, coaches put their heart and soul into the sports, student organizations motivate kids to broaden their horizons by expanding their knowledge, and the campus has a very ""at home"" feel.
One thing Concordia could improve on is affordability. They could offer just a few more scholarships/grants that would allow a greater number of people to experience the amazing campus they have. The cost of a college is what, in most cases, makes the decision for a prospective college student. By making it a bit less expensive, more kids would be willing to look at Concordia as a college option."
Freshman,5,"Concordia was DEFINITELY the right choice for me! Since coming to Concordia I have had so many unique experiences, learned so much about myself, and I have just all out had a great time! The professors really care and really want to get to know and help their students. The students themselves are friendly and caring. Overall, Concordia is my home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"Concordia College is my second home. Everyone here is so genuinely nice, the professors are supportive and want to get to know you as an individual, and the courses are rigorous and rewarding. Concordia is a place that challenges you while also giving you incredible opportunities to work/intern in your chosen field, study away, and be involved in many different things. Nestled in the fast-growing community of Fargo-Moorhead, a tri-college town, there are so many fun things to do!"
Sophomore,5,Everything was great! Everything was great! Everything was great! Everything was great! Everything was great! Everything was great!
Freshman,5,"Absolutely loved everything about Concordia. Everyone is so nice and amazing, and the professors are so awesome and nice."
Sophomore,5,"Concordia College is a close-knit community in the smallish city of Moorhead, MN. Right across the bridge is Fargo, ND with plenty if stuff to do when you aren't studying. Concordia has a wide variety of activities for a smaller campus, and is worth every penny. The relationships with faculty, other students, and future employers are unlike any other college or university in the area. "
College Junior,5,"You will have great support and help from the staff on campus. There are so many resources to use if you actually reach out to them that will help you take giant strides doing something with your life and maybe changing the world and helping a tremendous amount of people. You are most likely going to go on to school, or you will be hired soon after graduating, if not the school will hire you (helps keep up their good stats)."
College Sophomore,5,"I've really enjoyed and learned a lot from the classes I've taken. Many are challenging, but the best classes always are."
College Sophomore,5,"Just to list a few things that are great: High tunnel, Concordian, Eco-Reps, AASHE, Anderson Commons."
College Sophomore,5,The legacy of being a Cobber seems to be known across the nation
College Freshman,5,Involvement on the hockey team
College Freshman,5,I love Concordia. Best decision of my life.
College Sophomore,5,Concordia does a really great job helping its students be successful during college and after.
College Senior,5,Already working  in my field
College Sophomore,5,Class sizes are small and the professors really care about you as a person and your success as a student. I have the cell phone number of many of my professors and it would not be out of the ordinary to see a prof grabbing coffee and chatting with a student.
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I can't imagine being this happy anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel incredibly safe on campus. I tend to be very forgetful and have left my computer and phone in public areas around campus several times. My things have never been stolen. I don't recommend leaving this, but theft is not common. Students leave phones and wallets on the table when they get food and that is never a problem. Public safety officers also work on campus and are very helpful. They can always walk you to where you need to go if you ever feel unsafe."
College Sophomore,5,"Concordia has a very strong networking circle. Cobbers love to hire Cobbers. Internships are available in all fields and are very common for students to be involved in. The career center is also very helpful and can assist students in finding jobs, writing resumes, mock interviews and more."
College Sophomore,5,Class sizes are nice and small. The average student to professor ratio is 12:1. Professors are very knowledgeable in their fields of study and push students to succeed. Professors are usually easy to get a hold of and our very present on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Concordia! Concordia has an extremely friendly campus. Professors care so much for their students and are great resources. Professors want you to feel at home on campus and it is not uncommon for a professor to have the class over for dinner at their home. Many classes involve real world experience including service projects and internships. Students here are very involved and it's not hard to become involved. Concordia offers over 100 clubs, an impressive music programs and a world known language village off campus. I love my school and would highly recommend it!"
College Freshman,5,The emails we receive are great things to know.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love this college!
College Freshman,5,This music program here is absolutely superb!
College Freshman,5,"This is the best, most welcoming place ever!"
College Freshman,5,Safety of us students seems to be a great priority.  I feel safe on campus.  There is always someone from security available to walk me anywhere if I need it.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning was something that not many students (as well as professors!) expected to end the 2019-2020 school year with. Regardless, Concordia did a wonderful job of finding new and unique ways to adapt to the challenges that we faced. Professors made sure that students knew they were open to communication by email, through Moodle, or even through personal Zoom meetings! Each professor was able to put their own unique spin on on-line learning to help keep students engaged as well as providing different ways for students to interact with their professor and other students in their classes."
Senior,4,"Hard-working people, great attention to detail. Concordia College goes to great lengths to ensure student safety and pride. The college has dedicated itself to improving the community both on campus and abroad."
Senior,4,"This online experience was only due to COVID, and it wasn't my favorite. However, professors did an excellent job making it the best experience possible for the students."
Senior,4,"I grew up at Concordia, as both of my parents are alumni along with my sister, cousin, aunt, grandma, grandpa and cousin. It feels like home, and the professors are sure to make that be known throughout the entire experience at Concordia. Campus is beautiful and I can't imagine attending anywhere else."
Freshman,4,I love the class sizes and the professors that take the time to get to know their students. It is a great campus!
Sophomore,4,Very welcoming community! Has many opportunities to make friends. Great academic support outside of class. You will have everything that you might need to be successful at this college.
Freshman,4,"Concordia College has a strong academic. Although, Concordia College is a small school I enjoy it a lot. One thing I like it being small is that its easier to make friends. Students, there are kind. The professors care about the students. It nice having small classes because it is nice having one-on-ones with the professors. The Campus has a strong environment where everyone is friendly to one another. Having sports at school is very fun because I get to support different team activities with friends. One thing I would like to see change is not having classes at 7 am in the mornings. My overall experience at Concordia College has been great! I really like going to school there."
Sophomore,4,"Academics at Concordia are very good, the campus is beautiful, but there is not a lot of diversity on campus."
Alum,4,"Concordia College has a beautiful campus. Some of their buildings are older, but they have added on or remodeled some and try to keep classrooms up-to-date. I had a great experience with several professors in their history department. They have a fantastic student life and make you feel very welcome."
Senior,4,"I love Concordia. From day one, it has felt like home. My professors have been very helpful and friendly both inside and outside of the classroom. They want their students to be successful and it shows. There are always events going on on campus and the community at Concordia is one of my favorite parts of being a student here."
Sophomore,4,Concordia College has an excellent sense of community. You really get the feeling that the professors and students are looking out for you and each other.
Sophomore,4,Concordia College is a school that focuses on academics as well as creating an inviting school environment.
Sophomore,4,"The tuition cost can be a little intimidating at first, but Concordia College in Moorhead is well worth the price. It is a small, private, liberal arts college where the class sizes are small enough that professor knows each of their students names. These small class sizes give everyone an opportunity to immerse themselves into their classes and actually enjoy getting to learn from and know their teachers."
Freshman,4,"Amazing arts programs. They do a great job preparing students for jobs once they graduate. They keep everyone in mind and treat everyone as a person, not a number."
Sophomore,4,Concordia College has offered me a very open community where I can be myself. Since it is a relatively small college I am able to also have a close relationship with that I would otherwise not be able to have had I chosen to go to a bigger university.
Sophomore,4,"Concordia is a college that does not make you give up any of your extra curricular activities and hobbies to succeed academically. In fact, it is encouraged that students participate in activities, clubs, societies, and teams outside of pure academy. That being said, Concordia also expects determination and work ethic from students enrolled in classes. I have found my time at Concordia very rewarding so far, allowing me to explore ways of life, hobbies, interests, and connections I could not get anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"Concordia is a good place to be. The professors are all wonderful and understanding, the on campus food is spectacular, and it is a very welcoming environment. You feel safe here."
Freshman,4,I loved how much the teachers cared at Concordia. It was amazing how they really wanted you to succeed and would do everything in their power to help you achieve that.
Junior,4,"Concordia College is a great experience for the student looking for a comfortable studying environment with an overtly friendly student body. The community of the campus and relationships between the faculty and students is what truly makes Concordia a great place to be. Every student is given the resources they need to succeed, if only they ask for them or track down the connection. As a private liberal arts college the student body is generally smaller and not as diverse. Another negative side-effect of great resources and small numbers is the high sticker price. However, 99% of students receive financial aid and other scholarships. As with other small colleges, Concordia is facing current downsizing and further budget cuts as more students are choosing not to go to college. For anyone looking for a great undergrad experience, Concordia College is definitely worth a tour. If you aren't sold by the beautiful campus and friendly environment, the dining services will sell you for sure."
College Freshman,4,I've really liked the professors I've met and the options I have to take or audit courses.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of options to get experience in my field.
College Freshman,4,There is easy access to Kjos
College Freshman,4,"The RA's are very helpful, although I couldn't get a hold of Residence Assistance to find out about moving in early."
College Freshman,4,The sorority on campus does a lot of great things for the community.
College Freshman,4,The athletic facilities are very accessible and nice to use.
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid office was great about trying to help me get more money, but couldn't actually get as much as I'd hoped."
College Junior,4,"Like I said, great atmosphere, I love my Concordia family, I love the classes and professors. I was able to fit in a double major and double minor in fields I love with classes that interest me. I am studying aboard in Spain soon. I love choir and the Christmas Concerts. There are many other bands, orchestras, fantastic plays, and events to attend. I have a problem with some of the ethics the school has and power structures they have in place along with Resident Life, and Public Safety."
College Junior,4,"I love Concordia College in Moorhead and despise it all at the same time. The students are wonderful, talented, passionate, and smart. However they can be naive, one sided, and ignorant. The professors are amazing and the classes are wonderful. However the cuts to humanities and arts and growth of science and business sucks for classes and new buildings. Res life and Public Safety are corrupt. Financial aid office are life saves and open to help with anything, along with the registrars office."
College Sophomore,4,"There are stories that people get job offers/interviews because someone else saw their Cobber Ring. Now, not everyone buys a ring, but that says something of the reputation that precedes me and my fellow Cobbers."
College Sophomore,4,"I think that the college offers a lot of services that help keep students safe, but that students to not always take advantage of those services."
College Sophomore,4,"It was really convenient living so close to classes, so it was easy to squish in breakfast before classes. Roommate selection is decent, but not perfect."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy Concordia, it is expensive and there are politics between professors but overall, I like it and I am glad I chose this school"
College Sophomore,4,The faculty and staff care a lot about the safety of the students
College Sophomore,4,It is expensive and can be hard to afford but a lot of financial aid is available
College Freshman,4,Professors were very helpful and accommodating. Class sizes were perfect for learning and staying engaged
College Freshman,4,Many different employment options available on campus. Lots of help from students and staff
College Freshman,4,good with email alerts and services to contact if students find themselves in trouble
College Freshman,4,Good to adapt to the college life and meet new people
College Student,4,I have only met one of the business professors and she was very nice and informative.  I have discussed classes with my student advisor but have only registered for one class.
College Student,4,I have signed my letter of intent to play football at Concordia-Moorhead and have really enjoyed all of the coaches I have had contact with. I am excited to pursue my college football career at Concordia.
College Junior,4,Our athletics are very important and I am involved in golf and find it to be a very large part of my college career and have gained many friends and great experiences from it.
College Junior,4,"Concordia I find to be a very great place, it offers many opportunities and pushes myself and all students to be better and constantly strive to do their best."
College Junior,4,I always feel safe walking through campus any time
College Junior,4,The small class sizes are the best.
College Junior,4,There is almost 100% job placement post graduation
College Freshman,4,"I do have night classes, and I have not felt unsafe at anytime.  I know that we do have campus police if I ever feel that I need them."
College Freshman,4,"I have already been to an elementary school to volunteer as part of my Social Work class.  I feel that this has been a great way for me be with the younger kids, that I hope to be working with someday."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the small classes.  I am able to get in contact with my professors either by email, or by meeting them before or after classes.  I can tell that they are engaged in what they teach, and what I'm needing to get out of their class."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy the dorm that I am in, and I have requested to be placed in the same area."
College Freshman,4,"I love Concordia and know that I will come out with a great education, I'm very concerned of course with the amount of loans that I will have when I'm done.  Concordia has helped me with a first year scholarship to attend which has been very helpful.  They have also helped me in making a final decision, on my major and minors.  I'm hoping to continue with Concordia for my next 3 years."
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus.  It's super convenient but it's crazy expensive.
College Sophomore,4,"Concordia asks a lot of its students but does a great job helping you succeed.

I don't think it's really worth a lot of debt many students get into.

The theatre faculty are really great people but I wouldn't recommend coming here for the theatre program."
College Senior,4,Yes I would I am proud to be part of this university.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,All about that Cobber Ring.
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in Hoyum my Freshman year and I absolutely loved it! Hoyum tends to be a dorm that is very popular for music majors, however I am not involved in music at all. I loved being surrounded by talented people and learning from my peers. The people in Hoyum are creative, different and friendly. I highly recommend this dorm."
College Sophomore,4,Concordia only offers on sorority on our campus and it is partnered with NDSU. The girls in this sorority are very involved in volunteering and enjoy the experience.
College Freshman,4,The alumni are always glad to see new students.
College Freshman,4,Housing is spacious and roomy!
College Freshman,4,We have a great football and hockey program.
Alum,2,"Concordia College used to adhere to their purpose written by Dr. Carl Bailey, ""to influence the affairs of the world by sending into society thoughtful men and women"" but along the way they let religion supersede the value of education. The quality of  the science departments in general are being neglected by the administration. If you want to ""feel"" good, and learn lifetime values go to Concordia. Make no mistake, values are good and necessary to life. But insufficient, if you want to excel in thoughtful leadership in the  global community of science. Go elsewhere to learn and explore in depth the fundamentals science and how to make contributions to your exciting science vocation."
Freshman,2,"On the good side of things, the food is decent for a college and the school takes academics very seriously. There is very little diversity, some of the class sizes are so small that it is uncomfortable, the work out area is terrible, there isn't a large course selection, and there are many required classes that should not be required."
College Sophomore,2,"There's usually like a two weeks-two months wait for an appointment with the counseling center.

If you go to the health center and ask for birth control, they'll give you a lecture on abstinence and one condom."
College Freshman,2,"There is only one sorority on campus, so Greek life isn't that important here."
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty cold, but it is manageable if you are from the Midwest."
College Freshman,2,Most of it is alcohol.
College Freshman,2,"It's terrible for a Christian college. I don't party, or spend time with people that do, but I always hear stories and it really bothers me."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of alcohol problems, the policies are almost never enforced."
College Freshman,2,"The winters suck, but it's something you get used to and the campus does a good job of having ways of getting around where you don't have to be outside for long periods of time. It floods most springs, but that doesn't effect us, and the spring and fall are short but really pretty."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is a huge struggle.  The lots have space for only half of the complex and there is no overflow except for 12 blocks away.  Parking on the street is free, except there is a rule to move your car every three hours.  This is extremely impossibly to do between classes, and if you have two classes in a row and can't get there, the fee is $25 to the city of Moorhead every single ticket.  The professors take all the available parking lots during the day and leave the students with nothing but parking tickets.  Nearly impossible and unfair."
College Sophomore,2,"This is the one area where the school needs improvement.  Very much still stuck on olden day beliefs, there are still intervisitation restrictions in the first year dorms along with very little parking availability for any complex.  Alcohol is a ""shushed"" word on campus, which is ridiculous since it is a college and now the twenty-first century.  Fines are put in place for any alcohol, visitation violation, or parking.  Needs improvement."
College Junior,2,"Most of the student body generate from more well off families, who have made them go to Concordia because it is a private christian school. Even from faculty, I am a fresh breath of air because I have a want to succeed and better myself. As a creative person I wear clothes that are different, which I do feel at times I am judged. Preppy would be the word I would describe for fashion sense and overall tone. They are accepting, but from first glances... judgmental. "
College Senior,2,"This school has a very welcoming, accepting facade.  If you make it a good experience, it will be.  But if you notice all of its faults and realize the amount of Cobber propaganda that is thrown in your face daily, you won't like it.  Especially for the cost."
College Senior,2,"Unless you get one of five full academic scholarships, you will be in over your head with student loans once you graduate."
College Senior,2,"To put it briefly--the homecoming CONCERT is far more packed in attendance than the homecoming football games.  Unless you're an athlete, you don't really care about sports."
College Senior,2,Most kids have Macs (but most kids are filthy rich).  People might think you're weird if you have an old chunky PC.
College Senior,2,"The summer's are really nice, but winter can get really quite cold. It snows an average amount depending on the year. School can get cancelled due to snow storms."
College Sophomore,2,"There is limited space for parking with about 3 parking lots. You only need to register your car so there is no permit cost. If you are not able to park in a lot, you must park on the street where they are monitored very closely. In winter it is especially bad because of snow plows and towing."
College Freshman,2,Not very knowledgeable about local scholarships - the staff is not very helpful at all
College Freshman,2,There isn't enough space for all the cars and it gets cold walking to your vehicle in the winter.
College Junior,2,Parking is a nightmare. The staff like to take the only open parking for students during the day and we get a parking ticket if we park in the staff parking/
College Junior,2,"I admit this is a low point. The winter practically lasts forever. However this is a great time to drink hot chocolate and wear cool scarves. But yes, it's freezing. We all wish we could take the whole of Concordia and stick it in Hawaii for the winter. Although the winters are a little ridiculous, spring is nice. There's always people doing homework and throwing Frisbee on the lawn."
College Sophomore,2,OH MY GOODNESS.... The wind is horrible. It didn't snow much this last year but make sure to pack scarves and gloves and winter coats because the winter wind sure does take a strong hold on this campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There are usually computers available on campus. Most students bring their own anyway so the computers are mainly used for additional research or group projects or for printing things and doing last minute changes. The internet is somewhat strange at times, but I've not had many problems with it personally."
College Junior,2,"Requires 2 Years, Dry Campus, and Visitation Policy. Concordia requires you to stay on campus the first two years, and while the dorms are not the worst I've seen, they are nothing to write home about. They have no air conditioning and some of them have mold problems. The campus is also ""dry"", meaning even if you are 21 you will be heavily fined if you are in possession of alcohol. Furthermore, Concordia has a strict visitation policy- nobody of the opposite gender is allowed in your room past 1:00am on a weekday and 2:00am on a weekend, and they are not allowed in until 12:00pm the next day. This makes it frustrating when you are working on a school project, not to mention it's embarrassing as an adult to have someone making sure you don't have ""immoral things"" going on in your room. Most people I know leave after the first two years, but once you're a junior you can move into the nice, air-conditioned apartments or town homes."
College Sophomore,2,"Wind, Wind, Go Away â€“ Because Moorhead is so flat, it is always very windy, which can get to be a hassle.  In the fall and spring it rains a lot, and walking to class and getting soaked is not enjoyable.  The worst time of the year is the winter, when we are pounded with snow and ice, and then the wind is added into the equation which just makes going outside terrible and dangerous. It doesn't help that classes are never cancelled due to the hazardous conditions."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not sure what happened with my finical aid. I wish I would have known about more of Concordia's scholarships so I would have been able to apply for them. I feel like I heard about them after the fact. I like the financial aid I receive, I just wish it was more."
College Freshman,2,"Small Homes â€“ Being such a small town, off campus living is pretty much limited to small houses surrounding campus. Rent is expensive, as with any house, and you have to buy your own food. Concordia has on campus town homes and apartments, it'd be wiser to live there than off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Small Town. Moorhead is a small, dumpy town. There are a limited number of stores, and very little going on in the town. Our next door neighbor is Fargo, North Dakota, which is a step up. Fargo is a cute little city with the downtown experience and more variety."
College Freshman,2,"Not What I'm Used to â€“ I'm not from around here, but the saying ""Minnesota Nice"" is well known even where I am from. At first this appears to be true, but take the time to get to know the people and you'll realize the ""Minnesota nice"" is only skin deep. I'll take the company of a fellow Coloradan over Minnesotan any day."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Activities â€“ There isn't really a lot going on here at Concordia on campus, especially on the weekends. Week days are packed with tons of homework and a billion club meetings but once the weekend arrives, really the only thing going on is a poorly announced game or two. Most students will go home for the weekend, or sleep away their days and drink away their nights. For those of us who do not have the option of going home on the weekend and who have no interest in drinking, the weekends are very boring."
College Sophomore,2,"I Didn't Know What to Do â€“ It seemed very complicated when I first had to deal with financial aid. All I was told was that I needed to pay X amount of money by the middle of August and that I should ""get a loan."" I really had no idea where to look so I had to do tons of digging on my own, which confused me even more. I guess I even checked the wrong box on the loan application because the amount I received for both semesters didn't cover what it needed to.
In the beginning of the first semester, I visited the Financial Aid office and they helped clear things up. I really wish I would've known to go talk with them! They were quite helpful. I'm even going up to visit them sometime this summer to help with financial aid for this year."
College Freshman,2,"Concordia is a Division III school with an emphasis on the arts so there's not a whole lot of turn out for games, but our teams do well overall."
College Freshman,2,"I do not have any personal experience with off campus housing, however I have heard that it is etremely expensive and often times landlords will over charge."
College Freshman,2,"There is little diversity on our campus. Most students are some sort of Scandinavian descent. There are some international students; Concordia has an excellent program for international students both on campus and for those from America who study abroad. 
Anyway, there is a definite gap between the male students and female students; about 3 to 1 and there is also a definite population of gay students."
College Freshman,2,Hmmmm Somewhat Diverse â€“ Three to one female to male population plus a 30% homosexual male population.
College Freshman,2,"Fargo/ Moorhead is very far north. It gets very windy because the land is so flat, and winter is long. While the weather may be miserable, campus is designed to be very close together and you can get almost anywhere in under five minutes. Just bundle up! All dorms have heating, and Ugg boots are in fashion from november to about march, when the floods come."
College Junior,2,Bus transportation is slow. Not many other major forms.
College Senior,2,Not enough parking and too many cars.  It also doesn't help that snow eats up half of the parking lot in the winter.
College Junior,2,Buses Are Not Used at All by Students â€“ The bus transportation system of the Moorhead/Fargo area is not used by students at all really.  The busing takes longer to get there than it would be to just walk there.
Alum,1,"This was a challenging school, but an unhealthy environment. Teachers become inappropriately attached to students and blur the line on what is appropriate. Conservatives thoughts are stomped out and their rights and liberties stripped. The college behaves more like a high school than a college."
College Sophomore,1,We have one sorority. I think maybe they do community service? Don't come here if you are looking for Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"There is a single sorority on campus, otherwise, there isn't any greek life."
College Freshman,1,"Fargo was given the title of ""worst weather"" or something along those lines last year, and it is true. There is snow on the ground basically during the entire academic year."
College Freshman,1,Concordia in Moorhead is a private school and does not have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking sucks because there are never enough spaces for how many permits they hand out. It also cost more to park off campus than on, but if you are in the wrong spot you are immediately ticketed."
College Sophomore,1,"Orientation week it was a sauna.  Then it was nice for a few weeks.  And then it poured for weeks on end.  And then the wind and snow came and 20 degrees started sounding real warm.  30 degrees? Don't even need a coat-just a sweatshirt.
Eh, I'm from Minnesota though.  I can handle it. "
College Sophomore,1,SO COLD! Struggle to find a parking spot with the snow removal and is freezing to walk to classes.  
College Junior,1,"If you cannot handle cold at all.... DO NOT COME HERE!!!! The winters here are the worst. The snow is heavy, the wind is strong and harsh, the plows are non-existent, and the temperatures... lets just say there are weeks where the high is -10 degrees. And once the snow melts, its flood season."
College Junior,1,It is non existent! It doesn't affect the social-life because Concordia is all about academics. I don't hear much in the subject of partying. The surrounding colleges have the social- life.
College Junior,1,"There is one dining hall on campus and a commons cafe area. Pretty much the only options everyday include the grill area, chicken strips or a burger, stir-fry, salads, or wraps. Not much variety at all. The value for the meal seems a bit outrageous as well. For instance I had recently got a cheeseburger, fries, strawberries, carrots and celery I paid $16. "
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek life on our campus. We have one sorority that focuses on philanthropy and they are all really nice to everyone!
College Junior,1,Parking sucks on campus. I've had my friend drive around 8 times to find a parking spot.
College Junior,1,Inter visitation is way too strict. $25 charge if violated is horribly outdated and a cheap way to nickel and dime students. We are adults and ought to have the same rights as other adults.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is actually a nightmare. The parking lots are set up by dorm and there are multiple dorms on each permit. If you don't have a permit for the lot you park in, you'll get a ticket. Tickets are relatively cheap but they pile up if you don't use your car frequently. Parking is just something that makes you not want to go out sometimes, especially when the over flow parking is all the way across campus."
College Junior,1,It is cold in the winter. That makes going to class not very fun.
College Freshman,1,"Not Enough Spots! I absolutely LOVE that Concordia has free parking. Unfortunately, it becomes a serious problem when the spots have all filled, and there is nowhere else to go. At this point, I tend to avoid driving places for fear of losing my parking spot and never being able to find another one. Parking is free, but the availability is HORRIBLE."
College Junior,1,"Though the college celebrates diversity, the percentage of people here of different ethnicity is almost laughable. We are predominately white and Lutheran."
College Freshman,1,"The only reason Concordia does not get a failing grade in this area is because there is one sorority (Lambda Delta Sigma), and a soon to be fraternity.  Without those, Greek life is absolutely nonexistent."
College Student,1,"It is almost impossible to get a parkingspot in the lot your vehichle permit is designated for during the week. Many lots parking restrictings are unclear or not even marked. Parking tickes are often given and the actual violation is unclear, or undeserved."

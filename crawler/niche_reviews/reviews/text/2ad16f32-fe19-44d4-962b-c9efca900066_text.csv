College Junior,5,I love SWAU. Except the food
College Junior,5,It's a very friendly campus!
Junior,4,My online experience with Southwestern Adventist University has been very well organized and easy to learn. The professors I have had for my online classes and have at the moment have made learning very easy and time efficient for me. I was worried I would have trouble because I like learning face to face and not over a computer but they have done a good job so far.
Junior,4,Being village is hard to make friends cause I only see people in class. Being in the dorm would be easier to make friends but I don't have that option. Something to involve village students with the dorm students would be nice
Freshman,4,I like that I can see my assignments and what I have to do with quick access to canvas. It helps me not forget what I have to do.
Sophomore,4,"All students switched online due to the global Covid-19 outbreak. It was a big change due to the fact that one of the best things SWAU has to offer is their amazing professors, but they proved why they hold that claim as they worked with all students."
Sophomore,4,"The thing I like the most about SWAU was the fact that I felt like a became a better person. From getting closer to God, becoming more involved in school events along with the school body, playing and becoming an integral part of the soccer team."
Senior,4,"Southwestern has given me the opportunity to have classmates that are like family. We always find ways to work together and encourage each other when it gets hard. I came as a transfer student and I was instantly welcomed and new I made the right choice in transferring. However, there are sometimes communication issues and a lot of frustration because of it. There are also some instances in which it appears that some students experience punishment for plagiarism and cheating, while other students suffer no consequence from doing so."
Sophomore,4,"Southwestern has teachers who are invested in their students success and help them understand concepts after class, their science department offers a diverse range of classes from general chemistry to Ecology and Wildlife management. The music department has excellent teachers and resources for students who want to improve on or learn an instrument, or join the choir. This school is filled with quality people in all departments and a family atmosphere between students and staff. There are also several opportunities to get involved in research, such as the Dinosaur Science Museum on campus that allows students to learn how to clean, photograph, work with a database, give tours, and many other things that introduce the student to what good science really is."
Niche User,4,"My experience with Southwestern was good. When I visited the school, they were having lots of different events on campus which did not allow me to enjoy very well. However, during the Sabbath hours was the best time and that was the highlight of my experience. Their worship is very genuine and you feel the Holy Spirit in the music all the way to the sermon. I truly enjoyed that part of my experience. If you are looking for a good Christian school that will help strengthen your relationship with  God, then Southwestern is the best choice for you."
Sophomore,4,Southwestern Adventist Univ. is a very good Christian college. They are very focused on not just teaching the students but also in helping to strengthen their spiritual life as well. It is a very good school for those interested in theology and religion.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that this school has a small student body, so it allows for the students to have a family-like feeling. SWAU allows you to be closer due to its small population.
Something I would want to change about SWAU is its location in the middle of nowhere, there is not much outdoors life, but they keep it interesting with student activities."
Junior,4,"The student body is very diverse and it is a spiritual campus, where everyone is kind and willing to pray with you."
Freshman,4,SWAU is a good school. The class sizes are small and the professors are accessible. The food isn't the best especially if you have an allergy.
Freshman,4,My experience at Southwestern Adventist university was great. I liked all my classes and was happy with all the financial help they are willing to give. I also like all the activities that the student association puts together and the school's whole atmosphere.

College Junior,4,The courses in the school are good and the professors and teachers are always willing to help you when you need it
College Junior,4,It's very peaceful and quiet. The dorms are well maintained and in good shape as well

College Freshman,4,I not familiar with this
College Freshman,4,I'm a online student but i'm pretty sure the sports are awesome.
College Senior,4,The campus safety department is lead by a gentleman that really is on top of making sure that the safety on campus is strong. There are student security guards that work pretty much through the night to make sure things are safe. There is a police station super close to the school that if anything were to happen we could have extra help.
College Senior,4,"It has been an interesting experience. I have had the great opportunity to meet professors that are very understanding and will do all they can you help you in any way they can. There are professors here that really invest their time and life experience for the students. There are professors here that not only care about your academic growth and success, but also for your walk in life with God. When life in general is beating you left and right, there are professors here that will that person that you need to talk to."
College Sophomore,4,Good definitely outweighs my bad
College Sophomore,4,Lack school spirit but everything is good
College Sophomore,4,Drugs and alcohol aren't really an issue on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Enjoy everything about it so far
College Sophomore,4,"The overall experience has been great including the spiritual, social and educational experiences people should have at a school."
College Sophomore,4,Depending on the field you are in they will do their best to try to find you a career after you graduate and work towards steps to get to your goal.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are really interactive and social. They are fun to live in and have adequate rules and guidelines for those who live in the dorms.
College Junior,4,We have a very diverse group of people on campus. Really great to see
College Sophomore,4,We have a great alumni network and we have recruiting fairs on campus which are useful.
College Sophomore,4,I have experienced a professor that I feel is God's gift to students. Then I have also had some excellent professors. But there are three that I warn people about because they are rather horrific.

College Junior,4,"It's a great friendly school. It's easy to make friends, classes are tolerable, and we have a lot of activities"

College Senior,4,So many options to work after graduating
College Senior,4,They do their best to keep our students and campus safe.
College Freshman,4,They are really strict on illegal substances and even alcohol.
College Freshman,4,I am here for what I paid for. I stay focused with the environment around me and I have many meaningful friendships here.
College Freshman,4,The University has allies in the neighboring Hugley hospital. That is good for pre-med students trying to obtain jobs and internships to make some money and gain experience in a medical setting. I was also able to obtain a job in the administration building which is one of the good jobs on campus.
College Freshman,4,"What makes the school unique is the friendly environment. You can hang out with new people everyday and go out to eat and hang out and it's not weird at all. While it does get irritating that the school is not so close to a big city that has actually helped a lot with staying focused on my classes.

I would like, however, for students to be treated more like actual adults rather than high-schoolers with a little bit more freedom."
College Freshman,4,I really like the schools environment and that it was really easy to meet people and make new friends
College Sophomore,4,The campus provides a Christian environment where you can get involved.

College Freshman,4,The school I'm attending is great! #GoSWAU
College Senior,4,"I love this school so much, the professors are very knowledgeable and the people are great! The spirituality is really good and I've enjoyed my time here so far!"
College Freshman,4,It's the best and awesome place to be I love it and I hope I get to come back
College Freshman,4,"Small knit family school, very friendly."
College Senior,4,The professors in the Biology Department are always willing to help you grow as a student!
College Freshman,2,I wish there was more campus spirit. I would also like to see a shift towards more competitiveness in regards to the university competing with other schools. A legitimate football team would be awesome!
College Sophomore,2,Tiny town with nothing to do. Closest town is a hick country with trailer trash and beer.
College Sophomore,2,There are maybe three cute girls and two cute boys on campus. All of which are in relationships. Everyone else has no style and is just there for school... maybe?
College Sophomore,2,"You have Royal Pizza, Sonic, Subway, A student run tiny diner called the 360, and Yo's migos(a horrible mexican restaurant)  and that's it."
College Sophomore,2,"The classes are easier that my highschool freshman year. The teachers are lazy and there's only a small handful of 'quality' staff on campus. They fine you for literally everything so going here will be very expensive. The advisors are horrible at their jobs and you'll end up taking at least five classes you didn't need to take. The dorms are in bad condition. There is curfew even if you're over 18. The campus is tiny so good luck finding anything to do with your free time. The town is small too with a lengthy drive to any neighboring towns so you can't leave very frequently. Poor planning of class times. Cafe doesn't stay open for breakfast so you have to wake up at six AM or you starve until noon. Just all in all a horrible campus. NOT WORTH $20,000 A SEMESTER!!!"
College Freshman,2,average variety of food. Leftovers are given too much
College Freshman,2,"they over do it here with rules, attendance and fines, you have to sign a release slip just to go home for holidays, and even weekends, or you will fined nightly if you are gone passed curfew."
College Freshman,2,this is a small christian school and the curfew does not really allow for parties.
College Student,2,"Some of the facilities are getting old, since the school was founded in 1893, you expect stuff like that."
Recent Alumnus,2,One should not feel surprised if one experiences every type of weather change or season in one week.
College Sophomore,2,"Food is well cooked most of the time, and a wide variety is served. The is also a sandwich bar at lunch and supper for those who do not like the meal being served. However, there are local restaurants willing to work with the school on helping broaden students meal choices but the school refuses this option. The is only one place other then the cafe itself to eat and it is often overpriced on many items."
College Junior,2,"The nightlife at Southwestern Adventist University is boring. The only popular thing that goes on around this school is sports. The games are not all that fun because we don't get a lot of supporters a university should have. The basketball, soccer team, and volleyball teams are known for losing. And that why we don't get the support we need. We have no clubs around and the whole campus is quiet all the time so. Not too much goes on around this campus. Now a lot of people may ask why do I attend this school then. Well..."
Recent Alumnus,2,Off-Campus apartment options are somewhat available. They might be slightly expensive but living of campus helps one manage their finances.
College Junior,2,"Some of the more popular sports on campus are the most boring, such as soccer. The more exciting sports like basketball or volleyball are not coordinated very well and are not fun to watch due to the lack of talent."
College Freshman,2,Fast Food – There are not many Healthy diners around capus we have alot of fast food and un healthy foods.
College Senior,2,"Nothing to Do. There is actually nothing to do around here. If you have a car, you can go to downtown and find something to do."
College Sophomore,2,"Still Looking – Though the programs varies, it is quite hard picking a program that I would love. Maybe in a year a two,other programs may be available that sparks my interest a helps me further my dreams"
College Sophomore,2,"Being Off Campus – Living in the city of Keene lets you experience the rustic side of the great state of Texas. The friendly environment seems to invite you in as if you are apart of the family. For an escape, Dallas is less than 30 minutes away,as well as Ft. Worth and Arlington. Though there are times as it feels as if there is nothing to do around Keene, there are hidden treasures all around."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life. Bummer.
College Sophomore,1,"You must be a devout seventh-day adventist or you will hate this school. A student got suspended for partying on the weekend without any alcohol. REQUIRED nightly worships at 9:30pm, $5 fine for every one you miss. REQUIRED assemblies where all they do is sing and do a bad student sermon, $15 fine for every one you miss. Curfew is midnight, $25 for every 30 mins you're late. Basically fines fines everywhere for stupid things. NO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM."
College Sophomore,1,There are no sororities or fraternities at all on this campus.
College Sophomore,1,I have never heard of ANY parties of ANY kind on this campus. Not even nerdy LAN parties... Its sad. Not even on the weekends.
College Senior,1,"Although the library has a very big parking lot, there is a building on campus that could use a bigger parking spot. Students have to either park on the side of the road or park far away, just so they have a spot. There are other buildings on campus that don't even have a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,"Sports Are Lacking – Though there are verity of sports, they are all lacking for support and performance. The spirit of the team maybe strong, but it doesn't equal out if you can't win the game."

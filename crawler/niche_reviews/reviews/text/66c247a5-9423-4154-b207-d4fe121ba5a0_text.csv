Alum,5,All the staff and faculty there are very welcoming and provide a friendly environment. No matter the problem or issue they are always ready to communicate with you and bring about resolutions that best fit your needs.
Alum,5,"What I learned at the University serves me well in Grad school now. They have a great curriculum that fit into every student educational needs and there is no cutting corners with them. You will learn, you will succeed and you will converse. Hands down, Dr Karki and Dr Young are the reasons that I have something great to offer to the coming generation in the mathematical field. We need mathematicians like these two professors because they care about quality education and  excellence. If they would transfer with me to my grad school, I would become a Professional Student!"
Junior,5,Online classes are very well thought out. Professors always have time to email you back and make time to help you whenever needed.
Junior,5,"Overall, I have had a great experience with IUE. My academic advisor is very helpful. They offer awesome programs to help you stay involved. They do require parking passes to park on campus. There should be some type of regulation for this if say you only have one class in person. I know I have heard a lot of difficulty on this particular situation. Brewfus is an awesome perk at IUE. I wish there were more food options on campus though."
Sophomore,5,I took all of my classes online and they do a good job of giving you a schedule of when everything is due. You just have to make sure you keep up with it. I suggest a planner to keep track of due dates.
Sophomore,5,I enrolled into IU East as a freshman last year as a student athlete! I moved five hours from West Virginia to the beautiful state of Indiana. I currently took the spring semester off for health reasons but I am planning on taking summer classes to remain on schedule and finish with my Bachelors degree. I love the University because they all care for one another and the officials are always available in need. Since it is a small school it allows a higher academic successes rate!
Sophomore,5,"Strong online program, with an easy-to-navigate and user-friendly interface. Easy-access student aid, such as scholarships, student counselor, success coach, and academic advising. Really tailors to the students. So far have loved the professors."
Junior,5,"Indiana University East is a prestigious institution where learning is made easy and fun. I never thought that learning could be fun until i became a student in IUE. It's a place where one can find comfort while studying. My university has taught me things I couldn't have known, not only academically but otherwise. The communication line between their students and academic staff is never broken. I love my school and I am a proud IUE student."
Sophomore,5,"Indiana University - East is a cozy little campus situated in Richmond, IN. Not many students live on campus, but those who do are very friendly and tight-knit. The professors are very supportive and enthusiastic, and the staff are extremely helpful. I've loved every moment of being a student here."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with Indiana University-East has overall been extremely positive so far. I commute a 45 minute drive onto campus three days a week this semester, but it is well worth it. I have made many close friends already, as well as I have learned and understood everything that I am learning. Most of the professors and staff genuinely care about each student, and making sure they succeed. I am not sure about the housing, as I commute, but I do know that we almost always have free food and t-shirts on campus, and we also almost always have events going on around campus. The atmosphere is nothing but positive, and I could not have picked somewhere better to attend college at. I love Indiana University-East!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at IU East has been nothing but amazing. All the staff is super nice and friendly, the students are always polite and friendly. They have a large variety of courses offered and staff is always looking to approve."
Freshman,5,"In Indiana there are a couple "" Indiana university"" schools. Personally, I like Indiana university- East very much. It is a nice small campus. I take my classes all online but the school still tries to make me feel connected to call myself being apart of the Indiana university wolves."
Sophomore,5,I really like how IUE tries to include everyone in all of their events. They make you feel like you belong there.
Junior,5,I really enjoy taking classes online at IU. The courses are great and the professors are helpful. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to apply.
Senior,5,"I have taken only online classes through IU East. It has been very easy to communicate with various departments to complete my degree (financial aid, academic advisors, etc.) without having to make the trip to campus. Teachers are wonderful and always available to help with issues."
Freshman,5,Iâ€™m currently a student at Indiana University East. I have enjoyed my experience as a student because the staff are very commutative and friendly. I feel that the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff plays a key role in my success in college.
Sophomore,5,"Indiana University is a great college with many great opportunities. It's a small college but is always growing and making improvements for the students that attend. I honestly didn't want to go to IUE at first, instead I wanted to go to a big school, but I am so happy I chose IUE. After my first year I have loved the small tight knit community and I really feel welcomed here."
Senior,5,"IU is a great college offering the convienence of online classes to finish degree.  The professors are top notch and always willing to give you your time.  Online courses are tough but their curriculum makes it tolerable.  The professors are easy to reach and provide ease to contact if needed.  There are writing labs and math labs available 24/7.  My experience at IU has been more than pleasant.  I have two classes remaining and would recommend IU to anyone interested in online classes. Because I live in Nashville, TN,  it was hard to be involved with any campus activity, but, from what I see in emails, IU has plenty of activities and always step up to help their local community.  Again, I would recommend Indiana University to anyone wanting to take online classes!"
Sophomore,5,I love this school. I'm an online student and IUE's online degree program allows me to work around my schedule. I work 40 hours a week and love the flexibility. The online classes are set up extremely well and allow me to actually learn on my time.
Junior,5,Everyone at IUE is so helpful and accommodating. I am pursuing an online degree in business administration. I am in the military and have had to go on a couple of exercises where I haven't had access to internet and haven't been able to complete assignments when they were due. The professors have been very accommodating and have worked around my military schedule.
Freshman,5,I will be attending this school for my 1st year in the fall of 2018. I went on a college visit there and the staff and students were so nice and helpful. I feel that this will be a great school for me. I am ready to get involved and be connected with the students and teachers there.
Alum,5,"I had an excellent experience and Indiana University East. The campus was welcoming and inviting, I was able to navigate the campus with ease, and the teachers are phenomenal. I loved my time spent here and I always felt at home here."
College Junior,5,"My experience has bene great at IU East. I wouldn't change anything I've done the last two years. The professors have worked so hard to provide me with nursing information I will use in practice and practice at Reid hospital. I enjoy the size of my campus and how close I am to professors. I am not a number, I am a face and a person."
College Junior,5,Athletics are important to IU East. Many students play sports and keep their grades up to par to be eligible to play. The teams here are doing great things and winning many different tournaments. The students here come out to support a multitude of sports. There are always free gear to wear at the sporting events. We've just built a new athletic facility for the indoor basketball and volleyball to play in.
College Junior,5,"My experience at IU East so far has been exceptional. I love the size of my school and the one on one time I get with professors. My nursing program offers hands on experience being right beside REID hospital. We have multiple school activities such as concerts, cook outs, and free merchandise all the time. I play tennis for my school and I have made so many life long friends doing so. I enjoy the student living center that they've just built beside IU East, and I am currently living there to be close to campus. If I could do it all over, I wouldn't change a thing."
College Senior,5,"Being that we don't have student housing or greek life, the problem of sexual assault isn't very real."
College Junior,5,Indiana University East is an excellent school.  I attend online and I greatly enjoy it.  It has made me a better person attending Indiana University East and it will make you one too.

College Junior,5,The computers and technology at IU East are great and very helpful!

College Senior,5,No drug problems that I'm aware of at Indiana University - East.
College Senior,5,I feel safe on well maintained landscape at Indiana University East campus at all times. There is always someone sitting at the front desk entering the buildings. Students are alerted by cell phone with special security message at all times.

College Sophomore,5,They take academics serious which i think is great.
College Sophomore,5,They really show how they care about the athletes and their grades.

College Junior,5,Very helpful staff. They have done a great job with helping me.
College Junior,5,All public health concerns are quickly communicated to students via e-mail and text messages.
College Freshman,5,The computers are great and the IT guys are always very helpful!
College Freshman,5,Our basketball team here at IUE is great! Many students come out to show school spirit. Our volleyball team also brings a large crowd of roaring fans! Games are such a great place to go and get your mind off school!
College Senior,5,Our local weather has never affected my campus or off camous experience.
College Freshman,5,"I am a social work major, and I know that there will always be a job for me. I love our program and I get excited to go to my classes."
College Freshman,5,"I love the Social Work Program. We have great staff and great opportunities. We have long classes, but it's college."
College Sophomore,5,"I personally have heard of alcohol use, but that is it."
College Freshman,5,"There are many groups, tons of nice approachable people, and I've met alot of new people."

Junior,4,"Indiana University East is a very good school. Small, but gives great opportunities and plenty of time with professors."
Senior,4,"I loved my time at IU-East. I attended 100% online, so I cannot speak to the campus life, but I was extremely pleased with the my experience online. The professors are engaging. My fellow classmates were respectful and courteous in our online discussions.i would recommend IU-East online to anyone looking to attend college online."
Senior,4,I started at IU-East after completing my associate's degree at Ivy Tech. I attended 100% online. My advisor has been extremely helpful figuring out what classes would be best for me. The financial aid office helped me figure out my financial aid and worked with me during the financial aid appeal process. All my professors kept me engaged in a virtual environment. I am extremely happy with my decision to attend IU-East.
Sophomore,4,Itâ€™s a good online college with good teachers and good online success helpers but the academic advisors can sometimes take awhile to respond.
Senior,4,"Online was great, I'd like to see a little more flexibility with classes for majors.  Teachers are responsive and genuinely care to see their students learn and succeed."
Junior,4,I enjoy IUE because they are very personal with their staff and students. I enjoy the atmosphere at the university. The people here are wonderful and I feel safe at this campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love that not only the teachers, but all staff genuinely want their students  to succeed. All of the advisors are very helpful. The class sizes are small so students have more opportunities for one on one time."
Senior,4,Very good online program and instructors are very thorough and helpful! The course and students are both very diversified. Course content is expanded on in good detail and many links to outside resources are suggested.
Junior,4,I really like the experience that I am getting at IUE. There is always something to do on campus and they always give clothes away at the events. It's small so you get more attention in a classroom. We're like a family. Everyone knows everyone.
Freshman,4,"I love Indiana University East. It has helped me maintain the feel of a small town school like  grew up in, while also giving me exposure to diversity and new people. Indiana University East has so many opportunities for students of every kind and has a place for everyone. It provides the perfect opportunity for students to find their place in society and to help them discover their self. It provides so many degrees like a big campus, but also maintains small classroom sizes and intimate group discussion capabilities for a closer classroom connection. Most professors at IU East are fantastic, while there are some that could use some guidance, like any university. Student life is as big and involving as that of a big university, so it really gives you"
Junior,4,I am currently enrolled in online classes and have one more year until I graduate. The adviser I have worked with has been so great in helping me navigate through everything such as choosing classes to finish my degree. You definitely have to be motivated for online classes.
Senior,4,"This school is an excellent college option, especially for those in the Wayne County area. Don't make the financial mistake of going off to some big fancy University when you can start at home and attend classes here. Trust me."
Freshman,4,"Indiana University East is a great place to study, they offer lots of different ways to get help with things like math, science, and writing. The teachers are very invested in making sure you succeed. Over all it is just a good place to go to school at."
Senior,4,The Academic advisors are very knowledgeable and kept me well informed about the courses I should take towards my degree.
Senior,4,"Indiana University East is an affordable place to attend college. For most students, the work is pretty manageable if they can find a reasonable balance between courses and working a job. The instructors usually work in small classroom environments, meaning they are pretty immediately accessible if students have questions."
Alum,4,Indiana University East is a fantastic college to attend if you are looking for a close-knit family environment. It is easy to make friends and grow with each other throughout each individual program. Everyone in each specific school grows closer together through the four years IU East. Every professor and advisor wants to help each individual student succeed and fulfill their maximum potential. IU East is a great place to attend and be a part of a friendly and positive environment.
Freshman,4,Iueast is great school. Their academic are great and they are developing well with their athletics department
Freshman,4,It's inviting. Lots of lounging areas to just chill between classes. Great place to meet new people and just a generally nice place to learn.
College Junior,4,It is a top 10 degree school. The alumni network is large and some come back to teach at IU East.
College Junior,4,Safety and security on campus is great. Campus police are constantly driving/walking around the campus parking lots and buildings. There are many different opportunities for faculty to teach us students about sexual assault and stopping it such as orientation and sporting rules.
College Junior,4,"We don't have direct campus living. We have a student living area just beside campus and a multitude of apartment complexes around campus. The covenience of living at the annex or chester heights is wonderful. It is just a five minute walk to campus. The annex hosts many different activities and free food events to get the school year going. It is a little expensive to those in college, but worth it with amenities such as washer and dryer and being fully furnished."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are very passionate and helpful, while students and peers are friendly. The staff is also very friendly and considerate."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many ways to get information on jobs and internships at school, as well as people who are willing to help out."
College Sophomore,4,"In nearly every class I have been a part of, we have gone over safety rules and have talked about where to go and what to do if we have any issues or concerns to report. There have also been many events centered around safety and awareness on sexual assault and other issues."
College Sophomore,4,"There are tons of events around campus that are for sports, clubs, and other activities. There seems to always been something fun happening around the school."
College Sophomore,4,"I've had a great experience at school so far with friendly peers, passionate teachers, and helpful staff."
College Senior,4,"I haven't been on campus yet, being an online student, but I can say that it is a nice community with opportunity."
College Senior,4,It's great again for the affordability of the program and what that means for your long term success.
College Senior,4,"I go to the online school, so I've never really seen it. The facilities look nice on the website."
College Senior,4,"IU East allows me to complete my degree online, which I really needed the flexibility for. Whether it is living in Mexico or traveling down through Asia, I am allowed to pursue a degree, while also building life long skill and building job experience."
College Junior,4,"I love IU East, especially this year! We have already had so many fun things on campus and the schedule is packed with even more fun stuff. It is a small college which means small classes more one to one time and it is a commuter school. Now though, thanks to the Annex student living apartments right off campus it is more fun than ever. By living steps from campus and with many others who are too you get the on campus housing feel. IU East has already had amazing turn outs for after school events like an outdoor movie and our whole week of back with the pack. IU East is definitely a growing school with amazing staff and still an IU degree."
College Sophomore,4,"Nice campus in a smallish town. No on-campus housing, so most students commute and therefore there is no partying which is fine with me. Small class sizes so you can get to know people better and interact with the professors."
College Junior,4,The Nursing program is fantastic.  The staff are wonderful and very helpful and classes are not too big.
College Sophomore,4,I love attending IU East. It's not as big as the previous college I attended and I like the smaller atmosphere. I think the professors and advisors and spend more one on one time in a smaller community. The class sizes are great and the classes offered are what I need to get my degree.
College Sophomore,4,IU East is located on the edge to town between the hospital and the interstate. There is a Meijer close by and several fast food restaurants but other than that most restaurants and shopping is on the other side of town.
College Junior,4,many choices of online programs
College Sophomore,4,We all interact with one another.
College Sophomore,4,There are several unique things about our school (diversity)
College Sophomore,4,We have a diverse group
College Sophomore,4,I have had no problems.
College Sophomore,4,Added new parking behind Hayes Hall.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people join in the activities.
College Sophomore,4,Nursing program. Need at least a 3.4 gpa. I was able to get in this first time. I am now a junior and doing very well in the program. Everyone is willing to help with studies. We are a team. Staff is excellent.
College Sophomore,4,Several things to entertain you.
College Sophomore,4,Most good areas for apartments.
College Sophomore,4,"Several fast food with Bob Evans, Frickers, and Carvers near by. Quick access to interstate for more options for dining."
College Sophomore,4,"To get into the nursing program you have to pass all courses with a 75% or greater, and students with a higher gpa are usually accepted first. You also need a background check and to comply with all immunization and privacy records in order to maintain safe interaction with the patients you encounter."
College Freshman,4,"There are labs in pretty much every building.  If you don't have a computer, no biggy.  But it definitely helps when you want to save stuff or for your personal entertainment.  I like having my own computer.  The labs usually aren't full, and the library has computers that are by themselves if you want to be away from other people. I've never had a problem with the wireless internet but it helps to be in or close to a building to get reliable, fast connection."
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy going to Indiana University East. The campus is a smaller campus and easy to find the class rooms on the first day. I would choose this school again if I had to. I am not a fan of living in dorms or on campus. The drive is not that far from my house and I can easily come home if I have a break between classes.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the nursing program. All the staff are friendly and helpful and I have made a lot of new friends. We help each other and study with one another. My career goal is to get my bachelors' in nursing and becoming an RN. I would like to be either a care flight nurse or a psych nurse. I currently work with people who have psychological problems. 
College Sophomore,4,Parking permits are fairly cheap per semester. I think that it should be for a year instead of just a semester. The parking is really good. Parking lots at each building. There were a few days last semester where the parking lots were completely filled and students had to park and walk a distance. They are currently making a new parking lot for students.
College Sophomore,4,I needed some help when dealing with financial aid but the staff in the financial aid office was very helpful with helping me out. They made sure that I got the help that I needed.
College Sophomore,4,Student life is really good and fun on campus. They come up with a lot of great ideas for welcoming week. They are all friendly. Staff is very helpful and always find ways to help someone out. Students are friendly with smiles on their faces when you pass them in the halls.
College Freshman,4,It is a better school for me than IUPUI was.
College Freshman,4,Richmond is a big city with a lot to do.
College Freshman,4,"Good, except the Wi-fi doesn't always work."
College Freshman,4,"Everything is well taken care of, and a lot of things to enjoy."
College Freshman,4,I have never had any problems.
College Sophomore,4,"There is not much violence at all on campus, there is a large amount of campus police available, and my only  concern is a few unlit walkways at night."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of respect for those of us in the nursing program, and we are often spots of advice for younger and sometimes older students who have not yet been admitted. However, maintaining those spots is often difficult, and many students spend as much as an entire day filling out paperwork. It is a very rigorous program, and not for students who would take it lightly. The grading scale is curved upward, so that a 74% would be an F and not a C. There is also no extra credit, and professors do not have sympathy for those who do not do their work."
College Junior,2,There aren't very many choices of greek life at our campus.
College Junior,2,The school does not have campus housing because it is too small.
College Sophomore,2,I am an older student and am unable to receive scholarships. I am looking on line at present time for anything to help me.
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is a commuter campus, so there isn't much nightlife at all. There are rarely events that are hosted at night, but not enough to bring a lot of people out."
College Junior,2,"Small town, not alot to do."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid claims that my parents make too much money, when we are struggling to pay for school."
College Sophomore,2,Campus or public transportation is only available for sports teams and local high school students on tours. Everyone else has to drive themselves or carpool if that option is available to them.
College Sophomore,2,I live at Chester Heights apartments and they are always trying to pull on over on college students you have to be careful ask lots of questions and show proof of payments.
College Junior,2,The weather is typically cyclical and Midwestern. Nothing to write home about. Summer and winter can be brutal .
College Sophomore,2,"Since there are no dorms here, there really isn't much for the police to be strict about. They do seem to ticket the ""visitor"" section of the parking lot quite a bit though."
College Senior,2,"They could use a bit more updating. The outside of the building look nicer than the insides, though. Some higher-end finishes might help in some areas. The workout facility is way too small. The den (cafeteria) is also way too small."
College Junior,2,"There is a public bus transportation route that passes by the university. I see very little cabs available. Because Indiana university east is known as a commuters college, transportation for specifically college students is poor."
College Junior,2,"Kind of Tough â€“ The social work program has an extensive application process. The process requires the applicant to write three detailed essays about a certain social work topic. The application also requires three references with certain criteria, which somewhat limits the student on who they can use for a reference. Overall, it is great that there is an application process to get into the program to weed out the ones who do not really want it, but it was an intense process even for those of us who did want in."
College Sophomore,2,Small town. Lots of food joints but nothing to do.
College Sophomore,2,"No Snow Days â€“ Even when it snows a lot or the roads are unsafe, the campus rarely shuts down for snow days. The teachers tend to be understanding if you are unable to attend class on those days, however."
College Junior,2,"Parking Police â€“ Parking is very abundant at IUE and the parking police are sticklers about ""student"" parking and ""visitor"" parking. If you are a student DO NOT park in the ""visitor"" area or you will get a ticket!"
College Junior,2,Great for Richmond Residents â€“ For students attending classes in Richmond there are plenty of choices for dining with the opportunity to use discounts at many fast food places.  Commuters do not have as large of a selection.
Alum,1,"Some professors understand it, some do not. Overall it can never replace a face-to-face classroom.  I suspect more learning will be done online in the future."
Alum,1,"I entered their new Graphic Design program because it was affordable and close to home. The program is high school level at best. YOU WILL NOT BE JOB READY BY GRADUATION. 

I received A's for the classes relating to my major, and I found the work to be extremely basic. The professors are experienced and they try, but the expectations are set way too low. There is absolutely no emphasis on career readiness, which I find bizarre since graphic design is such a competitive field. You will not be challenged if you enter this program. 

By the time you graduate, you will know:
BASIC COLOR THEORY
BASIC TYPOGRAPHY
BASIC PHOTOSHOP
BASIC ILLUSTRATOR
NO INDESIGN
NO LIGHTROOM
NO WEB DESIGN
NO DESIGN FOR PRINT

This material should be covered in High School, not University.

Even though I excelled in the classroom I still feel completely unready for a job in this field. If you are interested in nursing or the school of business, you might be fine. Just not graphic design."
College Junior,1,There is not any place to party
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life at this campus because it is a strictly commuter college that has a ban on alcoholic products
College Junior,1,I am a transfer from Ohio and the scholarship process is terrible.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have school buses,but the community buses could take you. That is about it though."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no transportation offered by the school. The city of Richmond has a bus and taxi service, but rather than that student's use their own vechile's to get to school."
College Sophomore,1,"Go Home â€“ Indiana University East does not have dorms available to their students. For right now a student either travels from home or rents an apartment close to campus that gives student discounts. From what I have heard, IUE has been planning the building of dorms for a few years and are just contemplating where to place them. I do not believe that there is sufficient space on campus for dorms. This campus is very young and are increasing in younger students. Only time will tell."
College Sophomore,1,"There really is no nightlife in Richmond, Indiana. Nearly everything closes around, if not before, eleven thirty. The cause of this is the fact that we do not act like a college town. There are three colleges in Richmond - Indiana University East, Ivy Tech Community College, and Earlham University. Two of the mentioned colleges are community colleges and call for commuting everyday. There are no dorms and no real nightlife available. I cannot say the same for Earlham, but since I do not attend Earlham it does not matter. Indiana University East does try to have parties and student organized events due to the increasing attendance of young students. This college is only 40+ years old and still has an above average population of adult students. They are surly but slowly making changes to accommodate younger students. If a student wants to have fun the best option would be to hold a party in your apartment or attend one at Earlham."
College Sophomore,1,Lack of Off-Campus Student Housing â€“ There are not many odd-campus options for Indiana University East students. The only apartment complex that I know of that offers a discount for students is chester heights. Although that apartment is close to campus it would be nice if the younger students had more options. I know that IUE is trying to become more than just a small community college. They now offer a sport programs and if they are trying to go in that direction they need to provide some sort of housing. I know there are talks in regards to the old hospital in town that is close to the campus being converted into dorm rooms for IUE students. I think this would be a great idea and a good thing for IUE.

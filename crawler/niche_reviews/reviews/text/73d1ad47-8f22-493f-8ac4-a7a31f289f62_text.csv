Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the scenery of IUP. The Oak Grove is especially beautiful during the fall. I also really enjoy the dorms. Most of the dorms are a suite style with a kitchen and a bathroom. For the most part I have also really enjoyed my professors and feel like I have learned a lot. The only thing I would change is the food. I wish there were more food options. It would also be nice to have options that stay open a little later. For the most part, I love going to IUP and I am happy that I decided to go there."
Sophomore,5,I do not regret coming to IUP. It is a great experience. Their academic programs are great and it is more diverse than I expected. It is fun and I enjoy meeting new people. The campus is beautiful. I love it!
Freshman,5,"The transition from in class to online is seamless. The free online portal is beyond helpful when it comes to tests, quizzes, and assignments."
Freshman,5,So far my experience with IUP and the staff in both admissions and disability services has been very accomodating and helpful in helping me figure out what my needs will be and how I can go about getting those needs met.
Senior,5,Very glad I chose to attend school at IUP. Very friendly and diverse community. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.
Senior,5,Professors try very hard to make online learning consistent with what would go on in a normal class room.
Senior,5,I am a transfer from Lock Haven University. I am blessed to be able to come to IUP. This school is amazing and I am so happy I decided to transfer when I had the chance. I have been here for 1 year and I have yet to have a bad experience at this school in any aspect! Athletically I am in a great position with football and academically as I am now pursuing my masters degree. IUP has helped me to become a better student-athlete and person in general. This is definitely the best state school in Pennsylvania!
Senior,5,My experience is amazing academically as I have good grades. I am mow also pursuing my masters degree because I love my school so much!
Freshman,5,"The school is everything I could have dreamed of. The students are diverse, the campus is full of life, and the parties are never-ending. Everyone is warm and welcoming, even the classrooms are fun. The dorms are top of the line, they look like apartments. Each dorm has it's own bathroom, private bedrooms, kitchen and living room. The food is better than any other college I have seem. They have chick-fil-a, Starbucks, sushi, subway, specialty pasta, burgers, and community dining as well. They also have a sheetz on campus and ""pod stores"", open til 1am. The safety is also up to standards. RA's in every hall(they are cool though) and hundreds of blue light safety buttons all over campus. On campus police are always walking around at night, again they are ""chill"". 10/10 college if you are looking for the true college experience."
Sophomore,5,The Indiana University of Pennsylvania was a good school and I received a quality education for the price that I payed. The system to sign up for and to pick classes was difficult however but once that process was over it was smooth sailing.
Niche User,5,"All of the current students and professors make every new upcoming student feel welcome, and the campus feels like a home away from home."
Freshman,5,"My experience overall at IUP, has been great! Since I came here, I have been offered numerous opportunities that I know I would not have had if I attended the community college back home. Some of these opportunities even came with internships for the future. What I love most about IUP is the different organizations that you can get involved in and make many friends."
Freshman,5,This campus is beautiful. A lot of the professors are willing to work with you before you are even enrolled in the school to make sure that this is the right place for you. The students are very welcoming in the departments and you can typically go to them for help in classes you share. The professors in the music department are working every day to make sure that you are receiving the best education you can to prepare you to teach others or perform. They also help you find jobs for when you graduate. IUP was the perfect fit for me and I knew that as soon as I stepped on campus.
Freshman,5,"So I am currently a freshman at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and I am happy with the campus and everyone is very kind and helpful. My first few days of when I arrived I was a bit lost but I mean who wouldn't be if you're in a location you don't know. I asked around for help and everyone has been so kind and helpful. I have also noticed so many other helpful thing on pin boards and flyers. For example, if you're looking for a job I have seen many papers saying where you could find jobs, where to apply, flexible hours etc.."
Sophomore,5,"The community is very open and welcoming as compared to the other three campuses I toured in 2018. I can't vouch for the other departments, but their science department has a lot of resources."
Sophomore,5,"Niche hates on IUP so much but it's because they are jealous. My honest, unbiased opinion is Iup offers so much for their students and is the only state school in PA worth going to."
Niche User,5,"I have not attended as a student, but I have gone to an open house and I loved it. I thought the campus was beautiful and is a safe environment. I also noticed that their facilities were accessible for students. Everyone seemed friendly and willing to help out incoming students."
Freshman,5,"What I love about Indiana University of Pennsylvania is that it is a very diverse school, who allows students to be who they are no matter the difference. Even the Chef's at the culinary campus inspire me to become a better and hard-working student. They motivate me to my best ability, and I love it completely"
Junior,5,Geology department is number one got to travel to Tawain and to California.My Professor are great they want the students to learn having a great college experience thanks to IUP
Graduate Student,5,Great experience. I've had the best 4 years of my life year! Can't wait to see what grad school has to offer here!
Freshman,5,I appreciate the diverse schools of thought that live on campus. I feel as though I am growing intellectually through every conversation I have on campus.
Freshman,5,"Entering into a college four hours away from my hometown was worrisome for me. I worried about not being accepted, or having professors that wouldn't correctly teach subjects. Being a part of the soccer team allowed me to meet new, life-long friends, who are going through the same adjusting period I am going through. It also allowed me to meet more people on other sports. Going to class each day is also another amazing part of my day. The professors are amazing and the resources of what they offer and what the campus offer are more than sufficient for my needs."
Freshman,5,"Iup has many great reasons to attend. Campus life here is great, there are always different events going on. The profs here will work with you and help you achieve academic success."
Niche User,5,It is a very beautiful and open campus. The dorm rooms are home-y and super nice. There are a lot of places to eat and study.
Freshman,5,Indiana University of Pennsylvania is a very good school to go to. They're very diverse in what kinds of classes you can take and in the campus community. There's over 140 different majors you can choose from!
Sophomore,5,It is very different from the city. It is in a quite urban area. There is a lot of activities for college student to attend and be part of. You can join of community in their dorm that are the same to your major and find people that way. There are over 100 club college students can join or make your own.
Junior,5,"The things I like about the Indiana University of Pennsylvania is it is diverse, and you can find lots of people from all over the countries. There are more than hundreds of clubs that everybody is welcomed to. There are lots of sources available in the campus like counseling, writing center available for students who need help with their essay or writing and much more. The things we can change about the Indiana University of Pennsylvania is to lower the cost of student fees and other additional fees. The reason why I said that we should lower the fees is that the bursar office automatically takes wellness fee even if you do not go to the gym. I feel it is unfair to those who do not use the gym sources and yet they have to pay the money for wellness."
Freshman,5,"So far as an in-coming freshman, I love the campus. It's so beautiful and there is always activities going on so it's a perfect place to really join in and get involved with others. Being in my dorm, I have noticed the room are pretty decent. I just moved in yesterday, August 25th and instead of feeling homesick, I feel like I'm at home. It is super easy to make friends here and the staff, RA, and professors are all extremely helpful and are always available when need be. I will definitely be continuing my education here at IUP."
Sophomore,5,"IUP is an AMAZING place to go to school. Every part of campus is so beautiful and they offer so many opportunities for you to learn. The dorms are up to date and way better than all others that I've seen. The professors really want you to learn and pass their classes. They offer many after class tutoring sessions to make sure you are learning. There's many places to hang out to study, eat, or just have some fun. It's located in a town that loves having the college kids here. There are many business of all types around town so there is always something to do. Also, if something isn't in walking distance (which most of it is), they provide bus transportation for the students to get around. I would highly recommend Indiana University of Pennsylvania to anyone interested in going to college."
Freshman,5,"I love how friendly and helpful everyone on campus is. The campus itself is also beautiful, surrounded by rolling hills and big green trees. The blue light system is always present to make sure you feel safe and comfortable. Philadelphia street gives a lovely city vibe to the campus, and there's always student activities going on!"
Alum,5,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania is an affordable and valuable state school nestled in the center of Indiana, PA. IUP will give you a quality education and many incredible and inspiring professors work at IUP. While the school sometimes gets deemed as a party school, there is a lot more than meets the eye. Academia is the main focus of all campus professionals as well as the student body. I began my Chinese Teaching career at IUP, attributing my career path to the extra-curricular activities and clubs that IUP funds. This university is without a doubt prestigious and there is a lot of stature on that campus if you work hard and pursue it."
Junior,5,"IUP is a very welcoming college. Being a transfer student, I felt very welcomed and appreciated for attending this school. The staff are very helpful and caring."
Junior,5,"The only problem I have with this university is that I am non-traditional (older) student with a full time job and it is very tough to get classes in the evening or online in some subjects. For example, the language department offers NONE either evening, online or Saturday classes. Therefore, those classes MUST be done elsewhere. The biology with the lab is the same way. Either the lecture or the lab is morning/evening, but never both in the evening. Again very tough for a non-traditional student with a full time day job. Also, there a smattering of professors that do not like non-traditional students and will not work with them. This includes repeated emails. But, overall, the campus is wonderful and most of the professors will work with both the traditional and non-traditional student to make a great learning experience."
Junior,5,I love the diversity and all the new things that I was able to become a part of as soon as I came to school here.
Sophomore,5,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania is such an amazing place to be. Growing up in a small town, I wasn't sure if I was ready for a bigger school, but I absolutely loved the atmosphere of IUP. Placed in a small town like where I grew up, it feels just like home, yet I am surrounded by thousands of students. Everyone, students, professors, and workers alike, are accepting, kind, and hardworking. Especially in my department, I have never met such caring professors that go beyond their expectations to provide a quality education. You can find a new friend every single place you go on campus, and there is always something going on to make you feel involved and more at home."
Junior,5,"I loved the atmosphere and the people. The staff is great, they help you immensely and are so supportive. The people are kind everyone is smiling, people say thank you, and excuse me. It is just a welcoming campus and I wouldn't change it for the world."
Junior,5,IUP has been the perfect choice for me so far. I am a nursing major and the nursing program is great!!
Sophomore,5,I love Indiana University because the campus has so much to offer to students. The class sizes are small so that gives the student a better learning environment.
Freshman,5,"The staff at IUP have been very helpful in assisting with getting ready for school. Whether it is scholarship help or trying to find a way to get more funding to pay for school, they have helped every step of the way."
Sophomore,5,"I love IUP, the professors are all very friendly and most of the iup staff is friendly. It is a very diverse college there is people from everywhere here! On the downside though theres parties everyweek."
Sophomore,5,"Has an amazing environment and atmosphere. Going into college is intimidating enough, but IUP welcomes you and makes the transition as easy as possible."
Sophomore,5,"Overall IUP is a wonderful campus and university to attend. They seem to constantly be updating campus and keeping everything as modern as possible. The dorms are great, all suite style dorms, except for the honors college. Also they have a new dining hall that opened recently. IUP is a beautiful campus, especially on a nice day out in the oak grove. IUP offers  a bunch of student groups and organizations to get involved in on campus as well as numerous work study opportunities. IUP does a decent job at advertising their events in campus , but their advertising could be better. Indiana is definitely a college town, not a lot to do but some very good restaurants."
Freshman,5,"I liked that the campus is big, its family oriented. The dorms are up to date. That they have program set up for undecided majors. The professors are nice and very outgoing."
Freshman,5,The people at IUP are extremely helpful and friendly. The campus is beautiful in all seasons. It is like a home away from home for most students. The programs offered at IUP will intrigue you and keep you wanting more.
Niche User,5,"It's a fabulous place, where the people, teachers are very open, and even the students as well. When choosing a dorm to live in, there are many options, which are great because you have the option of sharing a room with a person, or getting a room that has two bedrooms and one bathroom, or even getting two bedrooms and two bathrooms."
Alum,5,I had an amazing experience at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the resources that IUP offered to me. I worked with amazing peers and professors that truly made my experience at IUP a great one.
Freshman,5,I love the environment of the whole campus! The staff is so helpful and very nice. If anything was to change I think that it should be the price of living or parking.
Sophomore,5,"This university offers class scheduled that meet your specific needs. They have staff who are very well trained to teach material and who demonstrate their abilities daily. The office staff are also very helpful, and truly want the students to succeed."
Junior,5,"Partying is still insane if you know the right place to look, cops have been trying to crack down so you have to be smart, but you can still have a lot of fun. Academics are great too, the Criminology program has a lot of professors with past experience in law enforcement, and they teach you lessons as well as real world experience to give you both sides. Dining halls are beat, but Wal-Mart is pretty close and you can stock up your house for cheaper then a meal plan. Overall, highly recommend for anyone wanting to step out of their shell and party while also getting in a quality education"
Freshman,5,There are so many groups to become involved in that you don't ever get bored.  All my teachers so far seem concerned that I suceed in my classes.   I personally love all the opportunities to exercise.  I can work out at the gym or go swimming and there are trails where you can run.   It has been a great experience.
Freshman,5,"Indiana university of pennsylvania is an amazing school. The campus is very clean. the campus is safe the officers there are amazing and very genuine. The campus police there safe for the safety of the student very much. The teachers there at indiana university of pennsylvania are amazing. The doorms are clean, they have a lot of space. The CA's in your residency are so amazing they help you with any needs you have. dealing with the campus or personal. i would recommend indiana university of pennsylvania to any person looking to attend a college. an excellent school 10 out 10"
Freshman,5,I really like attending IUP. The music program is wonderful. I've made great friends and I get to study with incredible professors.
Freshman,5,The school is wonderful in just about every catagory. IUP's professors are extremely helpful and considerate of students and the difficulty of college life.
Junior,5,"Party scene is solid , if you go here to be a crim Major you’re actually going to get a really good education, depends on your major look it up see if they have a good department. Greek life is absolutely lit def best in pa for state schools, house parties are okay , bars are also pretty damn good for a rural town there’s literally always at least one bar that is packed every night of the week other than maybe Monday’s, parties are wensdays-Saturday and are usually easy to get into especially if you’re in a frat or sorority. Everything here is pretty dope other than there really isn’t much to do other than drink with friends or party unless you like the outdoors then there kinda a lot i guess. 90% love it here, 100% the best state school in pa, only better option in state is like psu or I guess some private schools. No one cares at all about sports here at all tho which is funny cause we have really good teams but like it’s D2 so no one goes or cares"
Sophomore,5,"This university is full of opportunities with leadership, professional experience and provides a healthy, beneficial learning environment."
Graduate Student,5,The best college ever. I'm so glad I transferred there from another college. The professors were always so helpful and really guided you to succeed in the real world.
Junior,5,"As a junior at IUP, I have been able to excel because of the interest I have developed in my course work. I look forward to completing my course work and using what I have learned to pursue a career."
Junior,5,"IUP has been nothing short of an excellent experience. Nestled in the foothills of Western Pennsylvania, there are plenty of things to keep yourself occupied with outside. The classes have been wonderful and the staff had been knowledgeable and helpful."
Freshman,5,"My experience coming to Indiana University of Pennsylvania was kind of nerve-wrecking, as a young adult moving almost 5 hours away from my family. I didn't know if I was gonna be ready for the big change, but I was and I'm glad I did. I liked how the campus from the first day I moved in, it was very connected and close together. There was easy transportation to get around campus or even to the local grocery store and shopping center. The students at IUP are very friendly and you feel like you're in a community. there is anyway different events throughout the week and especially the weekends. The students club/organizations are very active in the school community. The professor at IUP are very helpful, I know if I need help with something academically or personally I have many resources for me. Overall, Indiana University of Pennsylvania is great school and makes me feel like I made the right decision."
Senior,5,Indiana University of Pennsylvania has led me to excel and advance beyond my peers. I accomplished things I never thought I could and became a person who I never thought I could be. I'm proud of who I am and what I have done because of IUP.
Sophomore,4,For the most part I have not had too many problems with my professors. I really enjoy my learning experience. Most of the professors try to make class entertaining and try to engage you. They are also willing to help in any way that they can. All you have to do is ask.
Freshman,4,Indiana is an affordable school with quality curriculum. They are handling the pandemic very appropriately and doing its best to keep students safe.
Senior,4,"Personally, online classes are not my preferred platform for learning, however IUP does fairly well designed online classes.  The professors in my experience have been very communicative and prepared.  Even when COVID-19 came and our university adapted, despite the circumstances, most of my classes went very well all things considered."
Freshman,4,"To this point, all of my communication with IUP and the staff in admissions and disability services have all been online. Other than having a few glitchy moments here and there with the system, I am able to get to the areas I need and find the information I'm looking for. I would like it to be a little more self-explanatory in some areas."
Junior,4,I have taken classes online and I do enjoy taking classes online. The professors for those online classes are very helpful. Plus the online classes are on your own time kinda bases. You don't have a specific time to log on to that class.
Junior,4,What I like about IUP is that the professors are there for you to help you exceed in your major. They take the time to really help out there students. IUP has great involvement programs that offer many students different opportunities. The online classes are great the professors are always there to help you out. The library is awesome. I love the library including the amazing staff. IUP is a great college.
Junior,4,"I'm currently a junior at IUP, and I am in the music department. The instrumental music program is wonderful, but the vocal department could use some work."
Junior,4,"Unfortunately I've had to convert to online classes throughout the Covid-19 crisis, but my professors did everything they could to try and make their courses work. Music classes are incredibly difficult to teach through solely online classes."
Sophomore,4,IUP is a wonderful place to get an education. Truly this place has made me love learning again. The student body is very diverse and not huge which is nice in my opinion. If you like target and cannot live without a lot places to shop then small town Indiana is not for you. The town is VERY small.
Senior,4,"I enjoy my time at IUP. However, it truly is how you make it. The school is centered in a small town, which is nice since there are not many distractions. However, it can be hard to find ways to wind down and distress if you are not involved. A few of the main changes this university needs are some type of reward student for the students who are doing well academically, way more diversity and better food options for those with allergies. One main place for dietary needs is not enough."
Sophomore,4,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania has been everything I hoped for in a college. I was apprehensive about going to a smaller school out of state, but the campus has truly become my second home. I love the entire atmosphere and the community that is available on campus. There are so many ways to get involved and that had helped me a lot with conquering my social anxieties."
Sophomore,4,"During the time of Covid-19, all of my professors were very quick to adapt to our new online learning environment. There were many hoops we had to jump through because I am a Vocal Performance major, but every single professor I encountered was more than understanding of the technical and emotional issues that might have come about."
Junior,4,"This is a great school for nursing! IUP is not too big, and not too small. It allowed me to find friends easily and see familiar faces, yet not feel like I was in high school. The nursing classes are a good size, but they are still small enough where I feel that the professors know us one-on-one."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience has been great! I have taken online courses during the spring/fall semesters, as well as during the winter and summer to stay ahead for my minor as well. The professors are very easy to get ahold of and the classes are manageable if you set aside enough time."
Junior,4,Great medium size campus. Lots of activities and help. Profs are easy to talk to. Campus is very nice.
Junior,4,Online was very easy. Currently have taken a total of 5+ online classes and all have turned out great.
Junior,4,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) may be surrounded by nothing particularly interesting, but is truly interesting itself. IUP is a community of inclusion in every aspect and truly feels like a home away from home. The professors are committed to seeing the students succeed and the individuals that attend IUP all become some of your closest friends. There are an abundance of clubs and organizations that will get one involved within the university and the community. There are plenty of events that will be sources of great entertain for the students. I truly did not know what to expect when I went to college, but IUP exceed all my expectations. IUP is my second home with the family that I have chosen. IUP may not be in a big city, but I would not want to go to any other college due to the professors and the students that attend IUP."
Junior,4,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) was very  accommodating and adaptable during the transition from face-to-face learning to online learning. All the professors that I had were very easy to contact and would respond in a very timely manner. Zoom sessions were optional, but everyone attended to receive the instruction for the week. Professors provided a modified schedule for the rest of the semester to keep the students on tack. Nothing was sprung on the students. Overall, I hate online learning but IUP adjusted well to the situation and I was able to maintain my grades during the time and continue my learning."
Senior,4,I found IUP to be my second home. Amazing school and professors willing and wanting to help each student succeed. Made amazing friends and got involved in school activities and events. I would definitely like to see more changes to healthier eating options. I believe more options to eat healthier and education on healthier options can go a long way for many students. This can lead to better grades and most importantly the students are living healthier lifestyles. These can benefit those students families back home as they can educate families and friends on healthier eating options. This goes to only giving the advice that they’re taught in college. Those students that strive to be dietitian’s can benefit greatly for experience in this area.
Junior,4,"IUP has been an amazing experience for me so far. The school is not too small or too big. It is just perfect. Eberly has a lot to offer, and greek life is really fun."
Junior,4,"My learning experience has been amazing. I enjoy classes with the professor in class and online. Some Gen Ed classes are pointless, but much of it is worth your time."
Alum,4,"Online courses are available depending on course. Every online course I took was explained thoroughly, which made it easier for me to ensure my work was done on time!"
Alum,4,Professors took interest in the students. Peers were always willing to help each other and include others!
Senior,4,I’ve taken many classes online through the university. Most of them are pretty good. The only problem is when every professor chooses a different website to use which you have to pay for and check daily. This makes it inconvenient and expensive.
Alum,4,"Indiana University was an amazing experience. The teachers, students and overall environment helped fuel my experience for 4 years. In the Criminology Department, you will encounter some of the best Professors to ever teach. IUP had a reputation of a ""party school;"" however I found that IUP gave me the best chance to find my passion. The job fair helped to find employment within my career field fresh after graduation. Not only is the campus strikingly beautiful but everything you need is close by."
Sophomore,4,I liked how helpful the teachers were with the students. I liked the class size too. I was able to find something fun to do whether it was on campus or outside of campus.
Freshman,4,My experience at iup has been great so far. My advisor gave me great pointers and the professors have all been very helpful during this pandemic.  The only complaint I have is the meal plans. Im vegan and struggled to eat outside of the north dinning hall .
Freshman,4,"When I attended IUP, I was undecided. The staff was very welcoming and helped me find a major that I'm interested in. I only left because I think that another university would be a better fit for me. I think that anyone who wants a good relationship with the staff and a good life on campus will really enjoy IUP."
Junior,4,Facilities are lovely and I enjoy taking my time to study and learn here. I was able to adjust to college life quickly due to the help of faculty and other workers on campus.
Junior,4,"The best part about the Indiana University of Pennsylvania are the professors. Many of the professors are not only incredibly knowledgeable, but are caring and considerate of their students. In particular, I've had great interactions with the professors in the Humanities college and the professors in the Biology department."
Freshman,4,"It's great for whatever you'd like to do. Good professors, good friendships. Easy to walk everywhere on campus"
Alum,4,Social opportunity is there for a state school. Academics are also great depending on the college you go into!
Alum,4,Well i am looking for colleges to go to. And Indiana University of Pennsylvania is the one school that stuck out too. I love the environment for me. The class sizes are not too big either which I love.
Freshman,4,I am still attending this school as of this moment right now and I love it lots. It is not too far away from my hometown. There a few places to go outside if the campus. There are many new people that you will meet from all around the world as well.
Sophomore,4,I love my program and I like that we are given alot of opportunities and assistance. The campus is very nice and the students are very diverse and interesting.
Freshman,4,I love the area and how safe it feels. I just wish their was more communication with the adults on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my time at IUP. The science department has endless opportunities for research and getting involved. The environment is comfortable and safe. The area is beautiful and the Oak Grove, especially in the fall, is a wonderful sight. My biggest complaint however is the limited hours that the library now has and the closing of the second dining hall."
Sophomore,4,"The staff is wonderful and is always there to help or listen. The university is a beautiful place and has many area where you can study or just relax to de stress from classes. The academics are good, most professors are kind and easy to understand and keep up with the work. Some professors are not as helpful or as kind as others. But overall I would say this university is a great place to attend."
Freshman,4,"Professors are very nice. Some students can lack self control and be crazy, but what else do you expect from college?"
Freshman,4,"It's fun,  very diverse, many people who are caring and wanting to be sure you're safe. Overall I'm glad I'm here."
Junior,4,"This college is reasonably priced, and you really do get your money's worth. My only complaint would be the pricing of the dorms, for some it is even more than their tuition. Also, the library hours are a little limited, and some of the professors are not very good lecturers. However, all the staff and professors are super helpful if you go and talk to them one on one."
Niche User,4,"It is a very nice campus. It is well laid out and they have nice facilities there. The only problem is the parties. IUP is one of the top party schools in the country. No grant it I don't have to go to parties, but I heard there are parties everywhere. But despite this, I liked IUP and the professors seem nice and there are plenty of resources for you to use if you are having trouble or need help with something."
Freshman,4,I so far have enjoyed my time here. I feel included and heard making me what to get involved in what they have to offer.
Junior,4,The Nursing (Rn/BSN) program at IUP has been amazing to me! Very hands on & educational. The professors all really care about their students and want to see them succeed.
Sophomore,4,I’m a biology major and my teachers are for the most part very helpful.  There is many research possibilities and the people are nice. The campus is fairly large and the oak grove is beautiful. The campus is well maintained and constantly improving.
Junior,4,I love how there are lots of diversity students and teacher are so helpful. There is an equality for everyone . I love how they offer us an tutorial
Alum,4,I attended IUP and had a great experience. I met with people from all around the world. It's a nice small college in a nice small town. Kind of rural but also a lot to do with some nice restaurants and people.
Freshman,4,"Indiana University of Pennsylvania has a lot to do with very nice professors. The dorms are very nice, too."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Indiana University has become very unique.  From the classroom to outside the classroom, IUP has alot to offer."
Freshman,4,The campus is very calm and relaxing. Most of the students are very easy going and the administration is very helpful  and understanding.
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful particularly in the Spring when everything comes into bloom. The surrounding town also has everything a college student could possibly want. The professors are also some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting regardless of their department. These educators work tirelessly to help their students succeed, get involved and prepare for their professional careers."
Sophomore,4,"The college is great. I've had a great time learning and I feel very at home there. The people are generally very nice, it has very good and in depth facilities. 
I wish the food was a little better (not to say it's horrible) and sometimes I think the school could put it's resources to better use. those really my only complaints."
Freshman,4,"I think that there could be more accessible healthy food options. Also there are minor fires in the laundry 
rooms in the dorms often (at least in mine) and I was a little concerned about that,  and I t was frustrating when it happened in the middle of the night. I like all of my professors and was happy with the classes."
Sophomore,4,"Some things I really liked about Indiana University of Pennsylvania were they had very nice dorms, great professors, and a lot of academic resources such as tutors and a writing center. One big downfall of the school is that the food options are very limited and even more limited on the weekends."
Junior,4,"The school is in a small, quiet town. Offers wide variety of majors. The professors that I have had so far were kind and helpful."
Sophomore,4,Good student/teacher ratio.   Offers a lot of choices for classes and majors.  Many intern opportunities.  Offers tutoring for those that need extra help.   Nice campus easy to navigate from class to class.
Alum,4,"I thought IUP was phenomenal, in terms of there Communications Media Department, which was the department I was in during my undergraduate years. This department gives you great experience for the real world, especially if you are looking to get into the media production field. The only thing I wish they focused on more was troubleshooting, in all subjects/areas. Nonetheless, this department was amazing, which is why I am hoping to be able to attend IUP this fall again for a Master's in Strategic Communications."
Freshman,4,"Next term, I will be entering my sophomore year at IUP. I major in Natural Sciences/Pre-Dentistry. First off, I just want to say that the campus is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! I can say for the science classes I've taken so far, the professors are really good and they actually care about you passing, they show this by being available via email and office hours. They also might book a classroom for review sessions before an exam comes up. As for campus life,  the food is okay, the dining halls love to have themed lunches and dinners, there are also other places on campus to eat with your meal plan. The dorms are nice, you'll have your own bathroom and kitchenette to share with your roommate. I don't go to parties much but there is almost always one being thrown, and they aren't on campus of course. Our biggest party weekends are homecoming and IUPatties which are highly supervised all around campus and frat row for everyone's safety which is pretty great."
Senior,4,"I was a student athlete here at IUP, and am going to miss it when I graduate in a month. I studied natural science & mathematics and will be graduating in May and pursuing my dream of being a physical therapist at Thomas Jefferson University this summer. The professors at IUP are very helpful and their number one priority is to see you succeed. I guarantee that if you come here you will make a connection with at least one of your professors throughout your four years here.  The campus is very pretty, but can get cold in the winter time. As a student athlete I had all the resources I needed to succeed  here and I am sure non-student athletes feel the same way. Overall my four years here have been some of the best years of my life and I can't believe it will be over in just a couple of weeks. GO HAWKS!"
Sophomore,4,I have many good and bad experiences at IUP. It is overall a traditional and inexpensive school to go to for a basic college experience. In addition there are many scholarship opportunities and it is cheap for in state students.
Niche User,2,"A good college, but the forms & paperwork that are required are confusing. The staff is not helpful, the financial office is not welcoming, overall it feels very hard to navigate. Especially if you have no parental support."
Senior,2,The focus is greatly on diversity and meeting a status quo or having a political correct stance rather than given students the education or product they are paying such a high cost for the parking on main campus for commuters is horrible with a ratio waited much more towards pay spaces or faculty and the professors this is were you see diversity stressed over knowledge or experience I really have not been pleased with the education process professors have told me they put the information out or make it available online it’s the students job to learn it if you fail they do not care retake the course they do not care about students or their financial futures or the consequences of their poor performance on students i can not wait to be finished and no longer be judged by professors and faculty who think or act as they are better than others it’s a shame where this university is heading and veterans affairs what a disgrace Vets support is minimal
Junior,2,I did not feel safe here and the professors did a very poor job of teaching material.  They did not go out of their way to help me and they were not very not caring of their students.
Freshman,2,I personally didn't have the very best experience here at IUP. The food is bad and I was judged because of the way I looked and because of my skin color if the school was more diverse this would be a great school because the academics are good and the teachers are very dedicated to their cause it's just the students sometimes aren't the friendliest or as open.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life overwhelmingly controls the atmosphere of the campus and very much resembles a cult
College Freshman,2,"Lots of partying and police do their best, but it's often not enough"
College Senior,2,The housing is overpriced and small. The housing here is very expensive for rent alone and the amenities are your the students sole responsibility to handle.
College Sophomore,2,Many people do not follow along with sports. We dont have a ton of fan support or school spirit. Being a D2 school i feel as though people here do not care as much. I wish i attended a larger school just so i could get that school spirit and student involvement with the athletic section.
College Sophomore,2,I hardly see anyone recruiting for jobs on campus or even internships.
College Junior,2,"In some Greek life parties, alcohol is accessible to all ages..."
College Junior,2,I'm an English major so the outlook is pretty bleak
College Junior,2,This is an idiotic concept all together because most of them don't do the community service they vow to do
College Junior,2,Too much importance is placed on them and the players do not take school seriously nor are they challenged academically in any sort of significant way
College Junior,2,In my experience college is a lot of useless hoops to jump through and they allow the landlords of the surrounding area to take advantage of students as well
College Sophomore,2,We have the most atrocious gym equipment in the weight room. It's all the cheapest stuff they could find I can never get a good leg workout in all the leg machines are near the point of broken. Also when it rains the roof leaks and there's 20 buckets I front of the squat rack and around the already tiny gym.
College Freshman,2,"There are probably a buttload of graduates from IUP, but we're still aptly known as a party school. So, I think that decreases the value of my diploma."
College Freshman,2,"This is my first year and there has already been a lot of crime. 3 students were stabbed right in front of my dorm. A girl was sexually assaulted on my floor. Someone had been shot at an off campus party. IUP can be a nice place during the day, but at night time you never know what you are in for. They do have blue lights all over campus that if you were in trouble you could hit it and the university police would be there in one minute, but most campuses have the same system. I feel very unsafe here I make sure that I dead bolt my door every night."
College Freshman,2,"If you want great greek life don't go here. Greek life sucks. The frats are the worst. They are known for raping girls and drugging them. There are no sorority housing. Some sororities are super nice, others are very rude"
College Freshman,2,"The crime rate has gone up due to them trying to become a D1 college. The first month of school there were 3 deaths and two rates. Later on this year the rapes have gone up and there are a lot of mugging, standings and shootings."
College Sophomore,2,Parties take priority over academic work
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is way too strict and makes it almost not even fun. All the greek rules make greek life a little lame compared to what it could be.
College Junior,2,"As a student athlete I feel like we get the worst weight room.  The nice weight room was just redone a year ago for non-athletic regular people.  The track treat which I am on is always struggling for donations over sport like football and basketball who got to go to Canada somehow... 

Also doesn't help that each year our equipment is ruined by maintenance as they run over it with snow plows... pole vault equipment in particular."
College Freshman,2,It is obvious that there are many parties. The best parties seem to be at the sororities and fraternities. I would say the party scene has a negative impact on the school even though most students seem to take advantage of the parties and alcohol.
College Freshman,2,"People party Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. There is a lot of underage drinking. A lot of people seem to party, but I don't think everyone who says they do actually party all the time."
College Freshman,2,IUP does not care about what you do unless you are drinking or doing drugs in the dorm rooms. A lot of parking tickets are given out cause the cops just like to write people up.
College Sophomore,2,they draw all the time. its like we cant live but that is why we go off campus. then the cops come to ruin the fun. how rude
College Freshman,2,CA's here think they run sh*t but they're honestly dorks. Only strict thing on this campus is parking and drinking.
College Sophomore,2,I'm happy I moved off campus and started making my own meals.
College Sophomore,2,It seemed as if the people I was talking with on the phone did not understand the English language.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting financial aid is a smooth process, but I am still struggling paying for school. Even though IUP is an inexpensive tuition, the cost of living is what jacks up the bill, and meal plans. Also, I do not think IUP offers many scholarships at all. Not in my field at least, which is Nuclear Medicine Technology."
College Freshman,2,"Not all of the fraternities have houses and the sororities can't because for some weird in PA it's illegal for more than 5 women to be living together because it would be deemed a brothel. 

Our ""Greek row""is just a block where there's about three houses. Other fraternities have houses that are scattered over town. The houses are shacks compared to larger schools like WVU or Penn State. 

Greek life isn't big at all. They are horribly strict on who they let in and are known for being douchey. 

I planned on joining a fraternity in college but I have no interest in joining any here."
College Freshman,2,"I myself didn't personally take care of the financial issues, but my parents did and they found it to be rather troublesome."
College Freshman,2,Some very attractive guys if you're into jocks and preppy jerks who are full of themselves and only want to party.
College Freshman,2,"Most people think that IUP is ""I Usually Party"", but this school's party scene is absolutely pathetic."
College Freshman,2,They constantly are losing things and making it impossible to get anything accomplished. I want to transfer and the people in the office literally sent me in circles before telling me to come back in January.
College Sophomore,2,They've been cracking down on drinking lately.  The fines for certain alcohol related offenses have doubled or tripled in response to IUPatty's day '14.  The campus police are super friendly if you're not on their bad side.
College Junior,2,"My parent did my financial aid, but it took two attempts and a lot of time to figure it out and make sure everything was completed and done correctly. For something so important, this should be an easier process."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Honestly, I think the school focuses on students from under privledged circumstances too much.  I agree that they deserve the attention but the school does very little to help the students who fall out of that bracket."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process is painstaking. I have barely any money to afford school, hence why I am filling out this survey."
College Junior,2,Academic Advisors are not helpful to advise w/ major
College Junior,2,IUP needs lots of work on diversity.
College Senior,2,"Scholarships are tough to come by.  I have never had problems with financial aid, but I know for those who have, it has been a nightmare."
College Sophomore,2,I dont know too much about the greeks
College Sophomore,2,Snow makes walking around campus difficult.
College Sophomore,2,I would say about 3/4 of all IUP students go out every weekend and either drink or partake in the use of drugs.
College Sophomore,2,It constantly snows here and is always cold with winds making it feel colder than it is. I am not used to the constant slush and snow on the ground nor such cold winters.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very expensive to live off-campus, and the majority of the houses are VERY lived in."
College Sophomore,2,"While drugs and alcohol are prohibited on campus, that does nothing to stop most people from partaking in the activities. I do not do either, but I fall in the smaller percentile of individuals who obey the campus rules and state laws."
College Freshman,2,I think the sports teams aren't the best that is why no one pays attention to them. 
College Freshman,2,They could easily help you out more and not let you figure out things on your own. 
College Freshman,2,"I've been to Indiana University of Pennsylvania plenty of times before become a student here. I never really noticed how small the city or town of Indiana. There is little to no attractions in this town and sometimes can get extremely boring. I sometimes see cultural events going on on campus but traveling off campus I never see anything. This town is pretty safe there has been a couple of deaths of students due to things drug related. The mall is pretty terrible , I could never get a good shopping experience there whatsoever. Our sports are very active though, students really have a lot of school spirit. I really enjoy going to the games and supporting my school. The local attitude towards the students is very kind. The local people are very nice to students and show respect. "
College Junior,2,There is always some sort of percipatition going on. The sunny days are far in between when it comes to this location.
College Student,2,There aren't many places that you can park without paying or having a permit. Things are rather close together but if you have a car it makes things a lot easier.
College Freshman,2,"It's very old here, we have heated sidewalks."
Recent Alumnus,2,outside of Pizza its non-existent
College Freshman,2,"If you talk to students at IUP, some of them might say IUP stands for ""I Usually Party""."
College Freshman,2,"If you love the cold and the snow, then IUP is the place for you.  Otherwise, its pretty bad.  Snow sometimes begins in late October, so that you have a white Halloween.  The wind chill is ridiculous around campus.  However, since campus is not too large, its relatively easy to get to class quickly before the cold sets in fully."
College Freshman,2,"the way everything is set up, they make it very difficult to get the RIGHT amount of aid needed. I lived with my parents but then something's occurred so I know longer live with them. I needed to become independent and its still a process im going though. its extra unnecessary stress a pound me and other students. I tip I would give for those that want financial aid and the amount they need is to be straight forward until they get it."
College Sophomore,2,"At first when you get to IUP you think there are so many options and so much food. After the first semester you realize how limited your options really are. There is fosters which is one meal swipe and all you can eat. When you eat at fosters the food quality is not very good and after an hour or two your hungry again. Then you have foldgers which has pizza and some other things you can get but you need at least two meal swipes to get enough to eat and the food is not really healthy enough to have every day. The Hub is your third option and the best. You can get burgers, bagels, sandwiches, salads, a lot of things but even The hub gets old quick because its always the same food. "
College Freshman,2,This is a dry campus and  most times parties are broken up before they even get a chance to start.
Alum,1,"Do not go to this school if you are studying any computer science related major. The professors do not know anything related to it and I have gotten laughed out of interviews and at conferences because I went to this school. Worst computer science school in PA.
Not to mention that the school itself did not feel safe at all. The parking lot for your car is 2 miles away from campus. I had my car broken into and the school did nothing about it."
Graduate Student,1,"The graduate program in English completely drained my passion for literature. Professors lacked empathy and were slow to provide feedback. (Normal turn around time was 2-3 months.) Thanks to IUP, I changed fields."
Junior,1,"I'll start with the financial aid office. Purge all of your employees and get new ones. For incoming freshmen enjoy the financial aid package you will recieve, for after that you basically get no help.. especially if you're african american. Some of my african american friends have all reported that the financial aid office barely helps to support the pursuit of their education. Claiming that the small packages they are given is all the school and fasfa can offer to them. If the school is currently discriminating against african americans by giving smaller financial aid packages to them, to keep them from applying and returning then an investigation needs to be completed."
College Junior,1,I refuse to involve myself in those types of choatic scenes. Parties are a waste of my time!
College Junior,1,Never been to a party but I have heard some horror stories about them.
College Freshman,1,The dorms are cheaply made you can hear your neighbors and the elephants upstairs
College Freshman,1,"Classes are easy, too easy for me and I am not the smartest student. I had a professor tell me that he does not care how well I do in their class, he will get paid no matter what. A lot of professors seem to only care about their paycheck. There are only a select few who really care about their students. There are a lot of courses offered which i like. Classes can be small or large it varies."
College Freshman,1,"If you are from the area, than IUP may be the school for you. If you are not anywhere near the Pittsburgh area, than i strongly encourage you to look for another school. Most people go home on the weekends since 85% of the freshman class are from the suburbs of Pittsburgh. The people here kinda suck. The parties here are boring and trashy. The frats are rude and the sororities are trashy. The professors never know what they are talking about ( no wonder why the tuition is so cheap). Even though the tuition is cheap, which is what attracts most people, it is not worth coming here to further your academic career. Most professors are very un-professional and you will question how they received a college degree. Don't make the mistake that I did by choosing IUP as your school."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, I have a feeling my degree is just going to turn into my toilet paper when I'm living on the streets because I couldn't find a job"
College Sophomore,1,So many rules and so secure that it makes living not actually feel like living on your own with just a roommate. Needs to be more freedom and more realistic.
College Freshman,1,I am unable to find scholarships
College Sophomore,1,"I'm anti-greek, but that's my personal opinion and other people should do whatever they feel like doing."
College Freshman,1,Rural and very racist. This is an awful place to go if you're used to a more urban setting.
College Freshman,1,I have no clue about Greek life here.
College Sophomore,1,"For out of state students it suck I am a out of state student and wasn't awarded anything but a Pell grant I feel I have somewhat of a special condition. I am a minority, out of state student, first generation college student, raised by a single father who makes under 40,000 dollars a year it was very discouraging when the school didn't give me any grants my first year or make me aware of anything I could do to try to help my situation as far as finances. In this returning year I am a sophomore I made the deans list in my second semester and have a 3.3 gpa now and they awarded me less money in my finical aid. If you are out of state and need finical aid don't come to this school it sucks for in state though I think it is much better from what my friends I have met here that are from PA"
College Sophomore,1,"It's terrible. They're ticket happy. No overnight parking. 

Where do they expect guests to park? Narnia?"
College Freshman,1,"The winter here is unbearable. It's not only cold and snowing all the time, the wind is constantly blowing. Going to class is the biggest struggle."
College Sophomore,1,It is always super cold & it snows every other day! the weather in IUP is very inconsistent
College Sophomore,1,The days that it is nice and warm out everyone is out and socializing but the days that its cold or rainy you can't really leave not feeling miserable walking outside.
College Sophomore,1,The nearest airport and train station are at least 45 minutes away and the bus takes a very long time to get you where you need to be.
College Sophomore,1,"It is very cold this winter, and when it isn't snowing it is most likely raining. Very dreary!"
College Sophomore,1,I hate the way the registration process is. Sophomores register for classes last. By the time we register no classes really be open especially the science classes. Professors be giving us 30 page papers and they don't even read them. Besides that everything thing else it good. 
College Sophomore,1,hate it. the police are very aggressive
College Sophomore,1,hate it. it be nice one day and cold the next. i been sick way too many time since the school year started.
College Senior,1,"As long as what you are doing is out in the open, and your not endangering anyone around you. you will be left alone."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No one at IUP ever helped me with financial aid.  I went into school and came out of school with the same understanding of financial aid, which was almost nothing.  The only thing I know about financial aid is that I owe SallieMae thousands of dollars."
College Senior,1,The weather is so unpredictable. But when it is nice the campus is beautiful. Not the schools fault we live below the great lakes.
College Senior,1,Some places around campus are good to eat since they added some things but most of the time you need to make sure you have flex so that you are able  to eat there the worse place to eat n campus is the actual dining hall sometimes they barely have good food and there is always some type of left overs most of the time when people go to the dining hall is to socialize maybe make a sandwich or salad
College Freshman,1,The weather is very iffy. Its always cold because we are in the mountains. Classes hardly ever get canceled but some fun events do. The experience you should get only happens when its nice outside.
College Sophomore,1,"I receive a decent amount of financial aid from the school and they tend to be lenient if you apply for more loans and such - however, when calling the financial aid office they tend to not be so helpful. Student workers answer the phones and are generally the ones to help try and deal with your problems, and unfortunately, most of the time they're not really sure what you're trying to get across as a problem, so they end up not being much help. And even when they put you through to an actual aid officer, they tend to not really try very hard to help you with your problem, which is disappointing and frustrating. They're also rather terrible at returning phone calls, so you end up playing phone tag for weeks at a time to get an answer to your question."
College Junior,1,"Parking for students is always terrible, no matter where you go.  However, at IUP it is absolutely horrid.  When you apply for a ""commuter pass"" you do not have to enter your local address nor will they check your address.  So people who live a block away get the limited number of passes and parking spots.  For people who are real commuters, like me, who lives over 15 miles away, cannot find a spot and have to leave even earlier for class.  IUP cannot even manage their parking lots, let alone their university.  "
College Junior,1,"This school is nothing but a scam.  It is known as a party/drinking school and that is exactly what it is.  Teachers do not care about their students as individuals.  They only care about making sure x-amount of students fail and x-amount of students pass.  I transferred into this ""university"" from another university because I switched majors and my mother works at CMU.  I know how college courses, teachers, and college departments are supposed to work and IUP fails in every aspect possible.  Their nursing department is the WORST of them all, with biology next in line.  They are NOT there for their students and it shows.  "
College Sophomore,1,When it is beautiful the campus is wonderful! But so often it seems to catch the storms that are hitting both the north and south parts of PA and is depressing and gloomy.
College Sophomore,1,"I get that there are tons of opportunities at the school, but i am in the honors program and in over 5 honor societies and still struggle to find aid. I went to the finical aid office to get some guidance and they handed me a piece of paper with the iup scholarships page on their website. I was so upset."
College Sophomore,1,.                                                              .
College Sophomore,1,"The weather here is crazy. In the beginning of the day it will start off really cold then it gets warm. It's also possible that in the beginning of the day it starts of warm then gets cold. You never know with IUP. Word of advice, always keep your winter coat or a thick sweater handy.

The rain is also crazy here. I'm from Philly and I don't remember the wind being so strong while raining. The wind destroyed 2 of my umbrella (tote so they were pretty good brand) "
College Sophomore,1,Indiana is always overcast. Its rare to see the sun.
College Freshman,1,"Unless you grew up in the middle of no-where, the atmosphere of IUP is rather painful. There is absolutely nothing to do. The town consists of two blocks of a few bars, two Chinese restaurants, and a drug store. Also, the mall is a run down mess. There are a few stores and the anchor store is K-mart. There are a few nice buildings, however, but the overall feel of the town is not something that someone who enjoys always being on the go. Also, when it comes to activities, the school will schedule big tours on days where it is a big ""holiday"" so it makes it seem like the school is big on pride (do NOT be fooled by this). Not to mention, since there is absolutely nothing to do alcohol and drugs runs rampant through out the student body. I have seen numerous friends fail out of this school due to drugs and alcohol. Because of this problem the town's people DO NOT like the student body. Including the environment, the people (staff, students, and town's people) are all rather cold. They all live up to the stereotypical east coast attitude. Also, the attitude of the people reflects the weather."
College Junior,1,"The school doesn't help you find off-campus housing at all. If you are looking for a residential apartment or home and you are a student no landlords want to take you with very few exceptions. Finding a place is nearly impossible and when you may have found one, it is given to somebody else. Most every off-campus housing option that takes payments by semester are outrageously priced and in poor condition."
College Freshman,1,"Transportation around Indiana is fine, but if you are trying to go long distance, forget it.
There are daily buses to Pittsburgh, but if you want to go east, the only option is taking a cab to Johnstown ($75) then getting a train from there."
College Junior,1,"I give our local weather a D+ for the simple fact that it's western PA. Our weather here is so inconsistent its ridiculous! You will wake up and its sunny, after your first class you look outside and it will be raining, next thing you know it it's snowing outside all in the same day. Just be ready for the weather that's all I have to say about it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Theyre arent enough drug safety awareness options on campus.. the drug scene here isnt major however, there is drug use among students. Drinking seems to be the social thing to do."
College Freshman,1,It doesn't really affect my campus experience besides the fact that I'm usually goin to class with a hoodie on! Prepare for more than usual punt of Pennsylvania rain. This place seems to get more than most places.
College Freshman,1,Growing up in areas with functional modes of public transportation I can honestly say that IUP still has a long way to go if they desire usable transportation means.
College Freshman,1,I applied for financial aid and got none. I am not poor but not rich an feel that I should have at least got some money.
College Freshman,1,The campus is very strict. I don't find it fair that we have quiet hours when we pay all this money for campus housing and can not enjoy it to its full extent. I also think that certain age groups could be grouped together because I feel as though I'm treated like a child when I have a knock on my room door about the noise.
College Junior,1,"There are definitely not enough spots for all of the students that drive and need to park on campus.  To be completely honest, there are many days where I need to risk it and illegally park somewhere near campus."
College Freshman,1,"I'm sure there are some great guys here but if so, I haven't meant them. A large portion of the guys have ulterior motives and a lot of the girls have yet to realize they're in college not high school. Of course there's some amazing people to get to know here. I've met some people that I'll continue to keep in touch with but some people I've met here I could have went forever without running into."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not much attention is given to people who do athletics. I tried rugby but it became too much with all the classes and having to purchase all my own equipment to play and no transportation to the games.
College Sophomore,1,communicating with the school to receive information about financial aid was extremely difficult.
College Senior,1,There should be sone kind of transportation for events for distant learnering students
College Junior,1,To be a commuter at IUP you must live 10 miles away and even with a commuter pass if you come to school after 9 you will not find a spot. Pay by spaces are for everyone but are hard to find and very expensive. When it comes to parking on campus anywhere it is a nightmare. There is no parking anywhere in Indiana or campus between 2 am and 6 am you will be ticketed or towed or both. Having friends over is a hassle.
College Sophomore,1,The police are very strict about underage drinking. Its very serious if you get caught.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Like High School – I preface this with saying I was never really interested from the start, but Greek life is lame and full of all the ""popular"" people you saw in high school. If that's your crowd, you'll enjoy it....if not, don't bother. Only 10% of campus is in greek life, so be the 90% and find your own friends for free. (But go to the parties at least to pick up some easy girls!)"
College Junior,1,"Campus Police & Indiana Police – If you get caught drinking on campus and you are underage, you get in trouble by both the police and the school. Then your required to go to these programs which are like Alcohol Anonymous for college students. They can be a real pain in the butt. Also, if you get caught for underage drinking on campus again , you may risk losing your housing on campus. Third offenders get kicked out of the university. In addition, both the campus police and Indiana police are always sooooo suspicious. They give off a vibe like everyone is up to something. It seems like their main motive is to catch people drinking or with drugs than to protect the students of this campus and the people of Indiana."
College Senior,1,"If you're not an alcoholic, nightlife at IUP is horrendous.  Stay indoors as much as possible."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Nightmare for Commuters – Campus parking is confusing.  Some spots are pay-to-park at nearby machines, they have numbers in the spaces.  Other areas are for F-S-C, Faculty-Staff-Commuters, yet some get fines when they think the S stands for students and they park there without a pre-paid commuter pass that you obtain online."
College Junior,1,getting a D is just as bad as getting an F.  Having a D drops your GPA and it also does not transfer to any other schools.  They usually suggest you retake the class so that is not on your transcript.  Another thing is that it also depends on how many D's you get because if you get a few they will put the person on academic probation and with doing that the person must get their GPA up to remain at IUP.
College Senior,1,"Horrible weather in Indiana, PA and no one on campus seems to keep up with it when it comes to the sidewalks and roads!"
College Sophomore,1,"When It Snows, It Really Snows – Being as though my school is in the mountains it gets really cold in the winter time. When it snows it snows a lot, imaging walking to class in so much snow, not good. Sometimes when it snows really heavily classes are cancelled so it turns into something good after all ."

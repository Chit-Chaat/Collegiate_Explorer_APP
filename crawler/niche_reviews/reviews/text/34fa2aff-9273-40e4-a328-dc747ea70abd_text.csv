Senior,5,"Belmont Abbey is a really good school the staff, faculty, and students create such a warm atmosphere. I am so glad I came here, it changed my life for the better!!"
Senior,5,"My time here at Belmont Abbey has flown by and it has been a wonderful experience. BAC has felt like home away from home these last 4 years. Everyone is so welcoming when you step on campus your freshman year. I played on the soccer team here and have made lifelong friends. We have made many memories together that we won't forget. The psychology department the professors are very helpful, knowledgable, and always there when you need them. Overall, I am glad I chose Belmont Abbey College to further my education and soccer career."
Senior,5,"I have had a wonderful time here at Belmont Abbey College. I graduate May of this year and I'm not ready to leave yet!
During my time here, I have formed lifelong friendships with my teammates on the cheer team and those outside of cheer. After college I plan to room with my some of girlfriends from here and I'm so excited!  My fiancé and I currently planning to get married at Belmont Abbey of next spring too! Since we met at Belmont Abbey it only felt right to get married at the place we call our home! :) Through Belmont Abbey's amazing business department, I have found the career path that I plan to take in Event Planning and Marketing and that makes me extremely excited for my future. Since my first day here, I have been welcomed with open arms and there's not a doubt in my mind that I was supposed to go to Belmont Abbey! I've had an amazing experience here!"
Junior,5,Belmont abbey is such a wonderful school from its academics to the student life. The small class size allows students to be one on one teachers and get more out of their academics then they would at a bigger school. The professors really care about your success at this school while still challenging the students.
Junior,5,"I feel like I met some of my lifelong friends here at Belmont Abbey. It is easy to get involved on campus, and there is always something to do."
Alum,5,BAC is a spiritual academic experience that virtually changed my life.  I entered the Abbey as an  adult degree student and honestly was scared I wouldn't succeed.  But after my first semester and engaging faculty and my peers I found the Abbey to be inviting and sensitive to my concerns.  The campus provided me a spiritual outlet where I could meditate and sort out my concerns.  I found my professors to be of the highest quality and character.  There were so many activities I was able to participate in and I know that God placed me at the Abbey at the right time in my life journey.
Alum,5,"I will always cherish the friendship, guidance, and academics that I received at Belmont Abbey.  It’s a great institution and am a proud alumnus."
Freshman,5,Belmont Abbey College is my home away from home. The professors and all staff on campus work so hard to make this place like no other. Belmont Abbey is the place to be and I cannot wait to spend the next three and a half years here! #RaiseTheRed!
Junior,5,"During my years at the Abbey, I have grown in my academics. I share a love of learning with my peers. The Professors greatly impact our appreciate for the subjects. You can tell that the professors truly love what they teach, and care for their students' success."
Niche User,5,"Belmont Abbey have a very unique campus and  I really liked their campus religion affiliation, i loved the monuments that were in the school as well at the chapel."
Freshman,5,"Belmont Abbey felt like home from the first time I set foot on campus my junior year of high school. It's a very Catholic school that adheres to the church teachings. Even though it is a Catholic campus, Belmont Abbey is very welcoming to everyone. It's really easy to make friends on such a small campus and you get back what you put in. There are ways to socialize and meet new people almost every night but if you don't go you'll never make friends. Many of the professors are amazing and care not only about your academics but your whole life. Everyone here is apart of a massive family and it's amazing. If you're wondering about the food on campus it's not the worst, it's proabably to the better end of food you'll find on a college campus. If there is one thing I recommend it's bringing a car if possible, it can be a little tedious being stuck on campus. Overall Belmont Abbey has been an amazing experience for me and I am loving every minute of it!"
Junior,5,"I wouldn't want to be anywhere else for my undergraduate degree! Everyone here is so friendly and kind. I love the fact that when you walk to class you see friendly faces. Here, you are not just a number. You are a person with a name. The professors actually care about you. I love that there are monks actually living on campus. I love how everyone is involved in everything. I genuinely love this place and would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
Senior,5,"During my time here at the Abbey, it has truly been remarkable.  The college really does live up to it's motto: In all things God may be Glorified.  The college also lives up to the vision by fulfilling the mind, spirit and body of the student by making them better people in life through excellence and virtue.  The college has lived up to the vision by having excellent: athletics, and professors. Did I mention we have small class sizes?  The professors really do care about you. We also have a great Student Life.  They are responsible for all activities that happen on campus.  They also coordinate activities that are  off campus as the college is located just 5 minutes from Charlotte."
Junior,5,"I love the academics in this school because the professors really care about you and also your peers in the classroom are very helpful and friendly. I am involve with so many activities in the school. it gives me an opportunity to meet new people everyday and able to get to know them. It is a small campus, but at the same time it is really nice to know everyone on campus. The campus is close to Downtown Charlotte, I spend my free time in that area with my friends to go on the plays, eat at the local restaurants and coffee places and just be adventurous. I love the school immensely because the people are just friendly and it is definitely my 2nd home. #abbeyislife."
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at the Abbey and I could not be happier with my experience here! The classes are interesting and the teachers really care about each student. Very happy with my college choice!
Freshman,5,The little time I have spent at this college has been amazing. Every single class is extremely engaging. And all the professors are here to serve and help you to truly learn and understand yourself and the work. One of the perks of the Abbey is the great community within it. One of my personal favorite things about the Abbey is that it is directly connected with the monastery on campus. Any time you can just walk up to a monk and have an insightful talk.
Sophomore,5,I love all the varied opportuinties to get involved in campus life. I needed an atmosphere of a small Catholic school that challenges me to become the best version of myself. I feel at home though I am ten hours away from my parents. I definitely  look forward to coming back after each break.
Freshman,5,"Coming from a small high school, Belmont Abbey is a great place to be. The college is not too big where you don't know people, but small enough where you have a variety of different friends. The dorms are nice and the people are welcoming. The class sizes are not too big so you have the one-on-one with your professor. The sports teams are also a great way to get to know more people as well. I love this school!"
Works Here,5,"Great working environment, very small and close community.  Love the location being so close to Charlotte!"
Works Here,5,BAC is a great place to work! Excellent community and co-workers. I love the small town of Belmont and how close to Charlotte we are.
Freshman,5,The life at Belmont Abbey is absolutely wonderful.  The professors are top of the line they are very interested in everything you are doing.  They are the first to offer help if you are struggling with a class but put it on the student to ask for help.  The coaches really care and make sure that the athletes have the best care.  The dorm was not the cleanest when I moved in but no other complaints.
Sophomore,5,"I have truly enjoyed my experience at Belmont Abbey College! Although it is expensive, the college has both met and exceeded my expectations. First and foremost, this is a college founded by Catholic Benedictine monks, and thus it is a Catholic college; however, the student body is only about 50% Catholic, so a variety other faiths are present. The classes I have taken are all very engaging and interesting; each class is infused with the core Benedictine values and virtues, and the professors are truly wonderful men and women who are excited about what they teach and want you to enjoy learning. The campus itself is small but absolutely gorgeous; many of the buildings were constructed in the 1800s, so they are very old but also very beautiful."
Junior,5,"This is my third year in College, two of which I spent at Belmont Abbey.  My experience reminds me of the credit union slogan of which my mother is a member...big enough to serve; small enough to care.

Belmont Abbey College is beautifully situated in Belmont North Carolina and is perhaps the most diverse catholic institution anyone can imagine.  Its faculty and staff are warm and caring and always accessible.  The environment is picturesque and neatly nestled in a small town but yet only minutes away from some of your more large scale conveniences...Walmart, Target, shopping malls, etc.
 
The ""raise the red"" sporting mantra is one that gets everyone excited and involved even if you are not a student athlete.  I am glad I chose the ""Abbey""."
Sophomore,5,"I love going to a small school! BAC is a great place to find lifelong friends and find a major you love. The professors are super helpful and easy to contact. Everyone knows everyone at BAC, from the president of the college, to the kid you pass everyday on the way to your T/Th classes."
Niche User,5,The professors are really helpful and the community is tight. The campus is beautiful. They have daily Mass & Confession and an Adoration Chapel.
College Sophomore,5,"l love going to a small school! The classes are so small, and I feel like more than just a number at this school. The professors genuinely care about your success. The courses are a good difficulty. They require you to do your work if you want to get an A. Catholic views are incorporated into each class in some way or another, but that is because it is a Catholic school."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is generally crime free. I feel safe walking across campus by myself at night. The campus police are easily reachable, as well as Resident Life."
College Sophomore,5,"The athletic facilities could be improved, and they are being improved. As for athletics in general, they are great! All teams are great at what they do. Most are nationally ranked teams. The fan support varies by sport, but most have a good sized crowd. The school spirit is incredible. Everyone loves it. When something good happens in a game or match, the fans go crazy. I've never seen so much spirit and excitement."
College Sophomore,5,"At first, I hated it. I'm not going to lie, but now, I couldn't see myself anywhere else. It is a place like no other. Anytime you walk to class or the dining hall, or for athletes the athletic center, you will know someone, and they will say hi. Everyone on campus is so friendly, from the professors to the cooks in the dining halls. The friends I have made so far are forever friends. The professors are so caring and compassionate. They are willing to do anything it takes for you to pass their class. Everyone is so approachable, and I love it. There are loads of student activities; everyone supports the athletic teams, and everyone simply wants the best for one another. Now the small school scene isn't for everyone, but it sure is for me. If I could do it all over, I wouldn't change a thing."
College Sophomore,5,"Sports and athletics are a big reason many students attend my school, so it is a big part of our campus. The  students, athletes and non-athletes, and very supportive of the other teams! The facilities are not the best, but they are nice. We are more about working hard and being the best athletes we can be and focus less on how good our facilities are."
College Student,5,"Our school is 60% athletes everyone goes to support the other sports programs. A lot of ""School Sprit"""
College Student,5,Have never had a problem
College Student,5,I know of no one on my team using them because we get tested and my school is 60% athletes
College Student,5,I like the change in seasons since I grew up in Florida where its hot 10 out of 12 months
College Student,5,Most of my friends are athletes here at the school. I am on the men's soccer team
College Student,5,Everything is close by for me to get to.
College Student,5,"I like fly fishing and there are many area to go with in an hour to fish. Being outdoors person there's a lot of places for me to go hiking, camping and do things with my friends and teammates. Charlotte has a lot to offer with pro sports and concerts for me to see."
College Student,5,All up to date equipment and training facilities
College Student,5,Brand new dorms with all new furniture and appliances
College Freshman,5,Received partial tuition scholarship through Honors Institute
Freshman,4,"Belmont Abbey has a lot to offer; from great academics in the classroom to championships in athletics.  The Abbey welcomes everyone and truly feels like a home away from home.  Something that would be nice to see changed is more options for food, but that may be it!"
Junior,4,"Belmont Abbey College is your typical small private school. If you socialize enough, you will always see someone you know around campus. This can be a good or bad thing, you have to keep up a good reputation of yourself, or people will talk. But always knowing that there will be someone you know in every class eases the tension of college. This school is literally what you make of it so if you go out and participate in school activities, you will have a good time, but if  you bum around and don't try to have a good time, you won't."
Alum,4,"The strengths of the school are the handful of world-class teachers, the quality of friendships among students, theatre, and the Benedictine/liberal arts atmosphere of the school. All of my close friends are from the Abbey, and I'll treasure them forever. The biggest weaknesses of the school are safety (that's a lawsuit waiting to happen), transparency, declining standards, and prioritization of athletics."
Freshman,4,"Belmont Abbey College is a great school for an athlete who loves a sport so much that they want to play at the next level of competition. It is also an amazing school for anyone who wants to further their knowledge and love in their Catholic faith. Even though one does not have to be Catholic or an athlete to attend, but it sure helps. Just being a freshman, one can already tell that I am going to build relationships with the people here that I will have the rest of my life. Because most people are athletes, everyone is from different places so there is a lot of diversity brought here for such a small school. I also am able to pursue my faith and learn more about it each day. After only being there for such short time, I know that it will teach me so many important things in my life."
Senior,4,What I like about Belmont Abbey College is their Adult Degree Program. At the time I enrolled the schedule and classes were ready available. Over the course of a year the classes are getting harder to come by and high turn over on teachers.
Senior,4,I love the small class sizes and individualized attention from professors who are experts in their field and truly dedicated to the success of the student. The campus is beautiful and perfectly located for all the entertainment and employ opportunities a college student needs in order to find his niche.
Senior,4,"Belmont Abbey is a small community where everyone has a purpose! You are not just a number, you are a person with a name. The faculty and staff truly care about the success and well-being of each student. The student involvement here on campus is also really great, there's usually a lot going on all the time. Also, with being so close to Charlotte, you can always go explore the big city that's right in our backyard."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed the campus. It is very small and has a lot of character. It is kept up with well and the maintenance is very neat. The people who work there are like no other, they always have a smile on their faces and are willing to help."
Junior,4,"It is a small Catholic college on a very nice campus.  If you wish to take part in it, there are plenty of opportunities to grow in your Faith, daily Mass and confession, etc.  The monks are great and the academics are amazing.  GREAT Honors fellowship and a good mix of extracurricular activities.  A+ theatre department. They could work on the housing situation, especially the res life office.   My dorm is great, but I know others have pretty bad housing situations.  That is my biggest complaint. But overall I'm glad to be here and enjoy the school."
College Junior,4,I originally came because of Athletics but fell in love with the professors and the small school community that is alluded all throughout campus!
College Freshman,4,The professors are great! You can easily speak to them after class or at their office. The curriculum seems dull until you get into your major.
College Freshman,4,"Because it's a Catholic school, it is very strict. This however, does not affect me."
College Freshman,4,"We have active campus police. Because BAC is fairly safe, there is not a lot to worry about. However, there are many unlit stairs, which I have fallen off of a lot."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't started on my major yet because I'm only a freshman. But so far, first semester has been great. There isn't homework, but a ton of reading and papers."
College Freshman,4,"More than half of the school are athletes. I am not one, so I do not have many comments on them. However, I do know that a few people go to watch the games. Soccer is probably the most popular sport in the school."
College Freshman,4,"The freshman dorms are typical college dorms. They are extremely old, but in very great condition. There is A/C in each room. There are also apartments available. Two new dorms were built recently. They are very beautiful, but more expensive. The cost for the freshman dorms are not a lot. It's also easy to get to class if you live in the freshman dorms. You can get to class in approximately 5 minutes. The housing process was fairly simple. Social atmosphere? There are a few people who usually get together in the Quad. However, campus is usually quiet."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is very old and so many of the buildings still have old designs and are worn out, but my campus is still beautiful. There are flowers and trees and green space in many places. The facilities aren't the best, but they work. Our school does a great job providing events for the students and all of the students truly get along very well. The student life is a fun and loving community. At the end of the day, I would rather have great people around me than great facilities."
College Freshman,4,Overall I love my school and the people around me.
College Freshman,4,Curriculum is basic liberal arts education. Professors are generally good
College Freshman,4,Very good biology department. Good preparation for MCATs or grad school.
College Freshman,4,"Situated between two cute small towns and very close to Charlotte, NC"
College Freshman,4,"Many policies that students do not agree with, but are not very strict with. Presence policy allows you to get in trouble for being underage (not drinking) just being in the presence of alcohol."
College Freshman,4,"Wide variety of students; many homeschoolers and religious who dress conservatively, many athletes who dress as athletes, and then just typical students. Athletes make up a large portion of the school."
College Freshman,4,"Many fast food locations in Belmont and Gastonia as well as nicer restaurants. Many nice restaurants in Charlotte, which is only 25-30 mins away."
College Freshman,4,"North Carolina weather is very fickle; one day it is 70 degrees, the next it is rainy and 30 degrees. Overall good weather though."
College Freshman,4,Suite style living with four bedrooms that share a bathroom in most buildings. Opportunity for true suite in newer dorms or apartment.
College Freshman,4,Some classes on secondary campus. Transportation available but sometimes late.
College Junior,4,"We only have shuttles for getting to the extra Sacred Heart campus for class, but nothing provided by the school for social off-campus transportation. A lot of people have cars since parking is free, but it's not necessary to have one, and many don't. It's very easy to find a ride if you need one, and Walmart and downtown Belmont are in walking distance from the school."
College Junior,4,"The health care isn't great, but it's nice to have as an option. I always feel secure."
College Junior,4,"I have the Honors Institute scholarship, which requires enough courses to basically be an extra major. I absolutely love it. Great curriculum, great scholarship amount, great teachers, and great classmates. Study abroad for each class in the summer after their junior year - they cover more than half the cost. I'll be going to Ireland and Italy for five weeks. It's kind of like a big (kind of nerdy) family. Mostly consists in courses in philosophy, literature, and the great books.

When I was unable to afford to come even with the scholarship, they were a great help in finding extra financial aid for me."
College Junior,4,"I'm not sure how the math major compares to other schools', but I like it. Limited faculty (three math professors, but most of the upper levels are taught by the department head). Workload is not too bad."
College Junior,4,"It was super easy to get into my math major. I basically told the department head that I was doing it, he said okay, I chose him as my adviser, and he signed the paper I needed to declare. I had already taken Calculus though."
College Junior,4,"The ""very poor"" to ""excellent"" scale doesn't really work here.. Most of the buildings are very old, but there are two new ones. And I don't think that has much of a negative effect on living. There could definitely be more washers and dryers. Very close to classes. Pretty strict - no boy/girl visitation after midnight, some dorms are dry. The housing process was annoying this past year, but that's because they changed a lot and made mistakes, so I think it should improve next year. Suite bathrooms are cleaned for us every day."
College Junior,4,"North Carolina is kind of bipolar - I was wearing shorts yesterday but today it's cold and rainy. It even snowed for about two minutes earlier. Some years we get snow once or twice, some years none at all. It's the South though, so in general it is not as cold as it could be. I like it."
College Freshman,4,"The campus location is very convenient, and academic programs were just what I was looking for."
College Freshman,4,"I like the local weather, I don't think affects the campus."
College Freshman,4,"It is average, I don't think policies affects students academic to the contrary promote a better performance."
College Freshman,4,I have not heard about any safety and security concerns about this campus.
College Freshman,4,I live very close by the school and housing is great.
College Freshman,4,I have work as legal assistant and have voluunter as religion teacher at my church.
College Freshman,4,"Was simple, just filed out everything I need it online and received a package from college explaining my award and the steps to follow. "
College Senior,4,I enjoy being in the Educational Studies Program at Belmont because the professors are from varied backgrounds and have vast experiences.  The program offers a vast history with monks living and interacting with students on campus.  The grounds are beautiful with creative detailed structures placed throughout.
College Senior,4,Belmont is a small town with many amenities.  There are plenty of employment opportunities for students desiring to work part-time schedules.  Belmont is also only 20 minutes away from Charlotte North Carolina for those who need a little taste of city life every now and then.  Many of the students live near and around the local area and are more than happy to assist students.
College Senior,4,The professors are highly knowledgeable of their subjects and passionate.  The school is catholic but higher instructors from various religious backgrounds so that students can experience a variety of teaching perspectives and styles.  The school trusts students abilities and choices.
College Senior,4,The guys and girls at Belmont Abbey College are mostly settled individuals that are goal oriented.  They are there mostly for two reasons either on scholarship for athletics or adult students seeking a degree.  These are focused individuals.
College Senior,4,Parking is good.  If you arrive 15 minutes prior to class you should be on time regardless of where you park near or far.
College Freshman,4,I'm in Belmont Abbey College majoring in Biology. I absolutely love my professors. While the course load is very rigorous I am always well challenged by my professors. They are amazing teachers and very accomplished in that particular field of study.
Recent Alumnus,4,There wasn't a cost for parking but you had to arrive on campus early so you could get a decent parking spot. Your car would be butted if you didn't have an update parking decal & I think there's a fine for that. I needed a car on campus because I was a commuter.
College Freshman,4,"Charlotte is a great city with lots to do. You have tons of malls and areas to shop at as well as exciting attractions such as the White Water Center, Uptown, and much more. Also, you have the luxury to relax and get away from the city by enjoying your own town Belmont."
College Junior,4,The workload is based on your availability if you have time you can make very good grades.  The courses are valuable and the registration process is very easy.
College Sophomore,4,there are lots of options and they love when students come in and they always discount our meals
College Sophomore,4,The instructors are your personal champions.  The entire registration process was relatively painless.  My course load is tailor made to fit my schedule.
College Sophomore,4,Presently my set up is progressively slow since I am re-entering academicia.  It is paced specifically for the adults as we progress into our major it will rapidly increase according to our own individual set goals.
College Sophomore,4,"Keep on top of your paperwork.  Make sure admissions has everything they need, test scores, recommendations, etc. Give yourself enough time to apply for scholarships."
College Senior,4,"I'm in the elementary education program and the profrssors are amazing ladies who have all held jobs in the school system, many in this county, at all levels. The workload is difficult, but managable. Many projects that I have completed in previous years have been put to use during my field experiences and student teaching."
College Sophomore,4,"Small Town, but Near Big City – In a small town, but near Charlotte and there is a lot of things to do there."
College Freshman,4,Good Coaches – The coaches here understand the definition student-athlete
College Sophomore,4,"Small School, Faculty Knows Students – The school has either athletes or scholars and in my case both!  The student body is small and most people have their social groups through athletic teams or academic groups.  The faculty is involved and approachable.  They are strict as far as parties and noise level.  The campus police are present daily and there if you need them."
College Freshman,4,"Even though the school is catholic, it accepts students from different religions. The school is very diverse culturally, also."
College Sophomore,4,"Spring Comes Early – The weather is great. It stays warm longer and get warm faster which is great. The winter is cold, but there is minimal snow and anytime it snows a little bit school is canceled. The only negative is the rain. If you go to Belmont Abbey you should invest in a pair of rainboots."
Junior,2,I would not recommend going to this school if you are serious about academics. Multiple professors I’ve had were absolutely horrible.
Sophomore,2,"School is way to small, the people are all so negative and two faced. I’m a Sophomore and yet to have A good experience. Some professors are good some are just not useful.m, but you find that at every school."
Senior,2,"My experience is with the evening  program, majority of professors have other day time jobs (not real professors) poor academics. 
The college is catholic but it doesn’t mean that the faculty is or that they represent those values. In  years, I have not experience those values from the faculty staff. “With the exception of the Theology instructors”, other than that I mean just “business” to them.
The Monks don’t run the college or the Theology professors because you will then truly live the mission statement. The school promises to you at the time of enrollment and during your firs year, doesn’t exist after you have enrolled. The choices for classes are one, two or none, I was forced to be flexible with them, when they offered flexibility. When I encounter a problem caused by the school, there is no accountability, it becomes my problem. If I were to do it again I will not chose this school to invest. 
The good: I enjoyed the Theology professors..."
Freshman,2,"I am an athlete and member of the Honors College. So far, my experience hasn't been that great. Athletes make up about 50-60% of the student population because every sport has a varsity and a JV team. *MAJOR WARNING* the athletic department supposedly won't release transferring athletes to play sports at their new school, so be wary of that.
Pros:
-small classes and personable professors
-Charlotte is nearby with lots of things to do
-potential to meet lifelong friends
Cons:
-hardly any funding so many of the buildings are rundown and the resources are outdated
-drama runs rampant, especially on the sports teams
-student body consists of 2 extremes: either Catholic homeschoolers or partying athletes. It's a combination that doesn't really work, and it's nearly impossible for them to coexist peacefully
-doesn't have name recognition or prestige of any sort
-a feeling of confinement can easily arise, especially if you don't have a car"
College Sophomore,2,"Our Greek life is fine, but our school is small that our Greek life is not very well known or cared about. The sororities and fraternities at our school are the sports teams."
College Sophomore,2,most of the students are the athletic that play sports they don't shower like they should but are nice once you get to know them
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone is allowed to have a car on campus, but the necessity of one just depends on your extracurricular activities. Parking passes are free, but that means the fines are rediculously high. Students are only allowed to park by the residence halls because they campus is attempting to ""go green"" so you have to walk everywhere on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Greek to Greek – The Greeks are made up of mostly athletes anyway so sometimes it's kind of a wast of time and money when you're only going to be hanging out with people that you have to see everyday for your sport. They don't have their own housing and many of the fraternities and sororities aren't even national. But Greek Week is fun and you get to be involved in a lot of charity and volunteer work.
College Sophomore,2,"Cheap, but Unhealthy – around campus we have a number of fast-food restaurants all of which are cheap, but decidedly unhealthy.  we also have some very nice restaurants, but they are all too expensive and go unnoticed.  we need more mid-budget places which offer a healthy alternative to mcdonnalds"
Junior,1,The online classes were horrible. Some of the professors were completely unresponsive the entire course. Multiple things were never graded until the course was over. Every time I reached out they simply wouldn’t respond.
Junior,1,"this school is literally terrible. if i could give it no stars i would. if you think you're going to a real college run away as fast as you can. dont even think about doing normal college things on campus bc they'll write u up, fine you, and make you go to AA meetings. the dorms are disgusting and filled with mold that'll make you extremely sick. the cafeteria food is probably all a health violation bc they serve raw meats and have very few options that dont look like they'll run off your plate. some professors HATE athletes and essentially make u fail the class by not excusing absences for games/travel. unless ur an extreme catholic that enjoys religion shoved down ur throat is basically every class you'll probably hate your life. dont even think about transferring either bc those credits will not"
Freshman,1,"This campus is charming I guess, but the social aspects leave much to be desired. The school is overrun by the athletes. They take up at least 60% of the student body. The students that don't play sports are either extremely religious Catholics, socially inept homeschoolers, or airheads that are only there because it has a 99% acceptance rate. Cliques are formed by default from all of the different sports (which have JV and varsity teams). On top of all that, the rules can be extremely strict, as birth control is considered contraband here. There are almost no real parties, there is high school- like drama, and it's impossible to find a genuine person that you can trust as a friend."
Freshman,1,Everything about this school sucked. Only a handful of students actually stay all 4 years. At first the school was great after a year. Worst decision of my life
Sophomore,1,"A HONEST OPINION AND FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE COMING HERE 
Part 2
Also there are no parties and if you drink in your dorm the RA's will write you up. It's not really a college experience and the women are kinda stuck up and think they are too good so they aren't fun at all. Although I have had some good times with the boys it's hard to do because how strict they are. As far as sports go the trainers are awful and are not helpful at all, they treat you like crap when you ask for help. Also this school makes you hate your own sport which sucks because I didn't even know that was possible. I'm being completely honest and not  exaggerating, I'm a normal kid and I'm telling you if you wanna hate your life come here but if you don't go somewhere else. Even limestone(our rivals) is better than here!"
Freshman,1,"A HONEST OPINION AND FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE COMING HERE 
Part 1
The school is pretty religious. You have to take a bunch of pointless classes as a freshmen and even if you decide to transfer after your freshmen year none of your credits transfer to other school so you basically have to start all over. The cafe is awful and it's a very boring school. It is also having  accreditation problems and is on probation. You can look that up if you type in Belmont abbey probation on google, first thing that pops up."
College Freshman,1,Nothing good happens after twelve.
College Freshman,1,"PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW IT WILL HELP YOU. This school is a trap. I am a bright Biochemistry major with a full 18 credit hour workload, I am not a half-student coasting through college. However, the school has seen it fit to do the following:

1. Charged with drug paraphernalia for having a never used, still in the box Zippo lighter.

2. Handcuffed and harassed for explaining to an officer why me and my friends were outside on a warm October night. We all had not touched one illegal substance or partaken in any illegal activity.

3. Force me to do over 30 hours of community service for having:

A ping pong ball in my drawer (they called it alcoholic gaming)

A small, completely legal knife (worth $125, they took it and ""destroyed"" it),

Being in a car with a 22 year old who was legally moving alcohol in his car.

4. Harassed weekly, sometimes daily by the Residential Assistants. They do this in the form of abuse, threats, and forced illegal searches on any item you may have. 

5. Even though the handbook clearly states that all forms of tobacco are allowed on campus, you will get written up and potentially fined for owning a legal hookah. 

The school also lied about their meal plan (a Jewish friend of mine is about to sue because he hasn't been able to eat according to his religion), the fitness center (it's never open), and the administration has personally lied to me about taking the police officer who harassed me off duty. I saw him the following weekend patrolling.  

There is more then this as well, but the list goes on and on. stay away from this school."
College Sophomore,1,At Belmont Abbey the Greek life is small and there is not much to join
College Sophomore,1,"there is no parties,RAs suck, campus police is cool they will hook you up if you get in trouble"
College Sophomore,1,Stereotypical School – The Abbey students follow many stereotypes. It is predominantly white. Southern and affluent prejudices are certainly apparent. Many girls that don't play sports join sororities and their main goal is to find a husband. The only black students are on the basketball and track teams (we have no football team). The teams mainly hang out within themselves or ther male/female equivalent team.

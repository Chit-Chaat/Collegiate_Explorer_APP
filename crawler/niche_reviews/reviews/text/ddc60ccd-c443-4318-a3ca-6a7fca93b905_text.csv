Freshman,5,The classes that I had of to take online were online because Covid is around and most professor's don't really feel comfortable around everyone right now. But they work and the learning style is actually easier than how I thought It was going to be. The professor's actually work with you instead of leaving you struggling by yourself.
Freshman,5,"Pine bluff is actually a good school. I thought it wasn't really going to be the best fit for me at first but it is good. UAPB has many very helpful people who are willing to make sure you achieve all your goals and many more, they push you to strive for success."
Alum,5,Learning online is a lot harder then learning in class but here if u need any help what so ever you can always get in contact with your instructor for and further help and they will help you.
Freshman,5,Iâ€™ll prefer in class than online because i like more hands on assignments and visual learning but i think its safe and effective to do online classes during this pandemic.
Freshman,5,"University of arkansas at pine bluff is a very diverse place, they have alot to be involved in. The only thing that i would like to change is the requirements of off campus housing other than that its perfect."
Junior,5,I wish there where scholarships were sophomores and juniors can apply for that couldnâ€™t get them their freshman year.
Senior,5,The professors are very helpful and enjoy teaching students. The staff as a whole are willing to help and everyone I have met at the University are friendly.
Senior,5,"I am having a great time being involved in extracurricular activities and hanging out with friends. The campus has a family-oriented environment, and the teachers are friendly."
Freshman,5,I started UAPB Summer 2019 as a Freshmen. My experience has been awesome thus far and only getting better. The professors are very approachable which makes it easier to learn. The only thing I would change would be Freshman dorms and parking
Freshman,5,So far it has been a very great experience at the university. The teachers are all easy going. Everyone here is like family.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff has been nothing short of amazing. The professors are hands on, the environment is great, and campus life is amazing."
Sophomore,5,"At the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, they have a family like atmosphere. The professors are wonderful when it comes to helping students really understand the material and the students are always helping each other. The parties are great! The school is small so you donâ€™t have to do too much walking. It is overall a great place to be!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that the school has the family vibe that makes everyone comfortable. Because letâ€™s be honest the high seniors have no idea what theyâ€™re about to step into, so it was easier to adjust with the school being family oriented."
Junior,5,"I had plenty scholarships and full rides to other schools and schools in further states from my home town.  I chose to come to UAPB instead because it was not too far and not too close from home.  I am currently in my third year at the university, and I could honestly say I would not go anywhere else. I am happy with my decision and I am so ready and excited to graduate from this illustrious university, May 2020.  I was accepted into the nursing program and currently in my seconde semester of it. Its hard but it keps me discliplined and I WILL make it out and I thank Gof for getting me through it."
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that everyone here at the university is for everyone, meaning everybody feels like one big family. Majority of the students on campus are very close knit and that's what makes a lot of nervous incoming freshman feel comfortable in their new environment. The only change I'd like to see is getting a few of the buildings on campus remodeled, some ore the dorms could be modified, and the cafeteria space could be expanded."
Junior,5,"I am from Atlanta, Georgia so coming to Pine Bluff, Arkansas was defiantly a shock. But it was very pleasurable and still is. It is more of a slow paced environment, which I have come to love becuase I am able to foucs more on on me and my growth with the school. The school it isself, I love attending the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. I love my professors and the people you met. The criminal justice program is amazing! Financial aid is still some what slow as far as getting with students and helping them understand. But the school has made huge strides in online managment of the students courses and degree layouts and plans. The school still has a lot of growing to do. But it is an amazing school that I am proud of attending!"
Niche User,5,"My experience here was wonderful. Iloved the vibe of the staff, and students. We take pride in who we are, and where we are from. Itâ€™s a Very exciting and energetic through the campus. there were allot of programs that brought student together."
Senior,5,"I loved the vibe of the staff, and students. We take pride in who we are, and where we are from. Itâ€™s a Very exciting and energetic through the campus. there were allot of programs that brought student together."

Itâ€™s a family tradition to go to UAPB, and anyone Iâ€™ve ever known that went to UAPB has succeeded beyond measure!

Junior,5,Excellent Professors. The professors really care about the students. There is a lot of school spirit. I can't really say anything bad about it.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at UAPB has been amazing. Starting out, it was kind of hard adapting to college life but it was still enjoyable and I was able to earn all A's and B's and a 3.67 GPA. I like that the teachers, students and administration on campus are all exceptionally friendly, helpful and treat one another like a family. I also like that there are tons of clubs and organizations to get involved in and the campus' school spirit is untouchable. Everyone is extremely supportive of one another's ideas and goals and work as a team to make sure the campus is safe, clean, and fun and academically at the top of the charts. There are ample opportunities for scholarships, internships, jobs, travelling and simply finding a place to fit in. If I could change anything it would be a more modern campus, nicer dorms and for administration to do a better job at letting students know about campus events, deadlines and other important information because we find everything out at the last minute."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about UAPB ðŸ’›ðŸ–¤. I wouldn't change a single thing about it . They have great leaders, excellent academics, different cultures, and etc."

Junior,5,"I love UAPB, especially their nursing program. The instructors really attempt to do everything to help lead you and guide you in the right direction."
Niche User,5,"My Experience 
     This university is a wonderful place to further education. Never have I experienced a more intelligent field of study. Academics and athletics are from a variety of foreign professors who enjoy teaching and have a sensitive style of maturity. Dorms are well groomed and entertainment occurs on campus weekly, including party scenes. As far as safety goes, qualified police/security officers make sure the campus is protected from any disaster. The local area of the campus is located by a freeway which gives access to others coming from a different city than and  enables students in Pine Bluff to have good distance between home and school for learning purposes. Food here is amazing because there are ten categories to choose from in the cafeteria that are fresh and healthy to eat. Students feel appreciated by the investments they receive after all of their hard work is done. So far this is my experience."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff has been extraordinary. I have learned a lot about myself and experienced things that I never would've experienced at home in Canada. As for the academic portion of my time at university, the programs I have taken have been lead by spectacular professors that understand the needs of their students."
Freshman,5,A really great university. The staff are like family and they make sure you have what you need. They want you to succeed.
Senior,5,"I have been at the University since 2012. I am currently a senior, planning to graduate in May 2017. My time here has been eventful. I have enjoyed being here. From the freshman experiences to now. I have grown not only as a student but as a person because of this university. I have learned so many things and I am glad I chose this university."

College Senior,5,"The career fairs we have at the school are very helpful. We are able to network with a lot of the alumni, while also networking with companies that attend the career fair."
College Senior,5,"One of the greatest experience I've had, at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is, Lion Fever Day! 

What makes MY HBCU unique? How much pride we has for Dear Mother! One thing I can say is that the students at UAPB love their HBCU, and we will forever and always bleed BLACK and GOLD! 

If I could do it all over again, I would most definitely choose UAPB. I love being a Golden Lion, and I can honestly say that my experience is one to remember!"
College Sophomore,5,I love how the student body can come together for events for the school.The school spirit is so encouraging to the other students.
College Sophomore,5,On the campus of uapb they have internships and jobs fairs they provide a lot of support to the students
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are average the professors take their time out to help and explain things to the students the quality of those are excellent the courses are very useful and you can tell that the professors actually care for the students instead of just sitting in a classroom and talking the classes are comfortable and they are in an awesome environment
College Sophomore,5,Living and being on the campus of Uapb is very safe the staff teachers and police officers are there to help us if we are in danger and or if we need them they honestly care about the students well-being

College Freshman,5,Greek life is one of the reasons why people come to the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.
College Freshman,5,"Careers and degrees are highly valued at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. We have a program called Career Services that helps students set up Resume's, and go on interviews to help prepare us for the real world. It also sends students on numerous internships and the quality of Career Service is superb and it is highly used by students."
College Freshman,5,Despite minor setbacks the school is really a fine institution.
College Sophomore,5,My courses were fairly easy. my professors were the BEST. They were ALWAYS there when i needed help and pushed me to not settle for less
College Sophomore,5,"I love my HBCU. They have plenty of opportunities for students to pursue their major. What makes my school unique is the fact that everyone there is considered family. I would definitely choose my school over again from the events to the academic opportunities, UAPB is the best!"
College Student,5,The safety and security on campus is great. They are always around and very helpful if you ever need them.
College Student,5,Greek students around campus are all great and being around them is very fun. They try to get everyone involved in everything they do on campus and off campus. I do not think we have any Greek housing.
College Student,5,If I had to choose my school all over again I definitely would because it is a great school and everyone is very helpful around campus.
College Freshman,5,I love everything dealing with Greek life!
College Freshman,5,The professors are always ready to teach
College Freshman,5,The Delta complex is the place to be for girls
College Freshman,5,The greeks are the life of the yard.
College Freshman,5,Everyone gets alone. We were told that we are a family and when you step foot on campus you will see we are a family.
College Freshman,5,MR Owens regulate very Well
Freshman,4,"So far I have loved my experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, The staff has been very helpful"
Sophomore,4,"So far I am having a great experience with Pine bluff, the staff is friendly, everyone has open arms and they have the best interest for the students at heart."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience is simple, the instructions are clear on the websites, and if you have a question they are always there to help. Getting started online was simple, the teachers have the content extremely clear so when you take the tests or quizzes it is easy to pass."
Alum,4,Moving to Pine Bluff was a big change for me but the people here helped and made me fell welcome and thatâ€™s my number one thing that i Locke about being at this school.
Junior,4,Being a student at Pine Bluff is very different from being a student anywhere else. At this school the faculty will use dialect that of which has long been forgotten. When faculty speak it comes with respect and culture. This school focuses on the students and getting them somewhere.
Senior,4,I love the fact that I can continue my education online and they have a program for this. I am a nurse and it is very hard to work and go to school on campus. The instructors make the lesson plan easy to follow and are available via email or phone to answer any questions.
Senior,4,I don't mean to sound redundant. I love the fact that I can continue my education online and they have a program for this. I am a nurse and it is very hard to work and go to school on campus. The instructors make the lesson plan easy to follow and are available via email or phone to answer any questions.
Sophomore,4,"It has its ups and downs like every school, but this a family school. Everyone is friendly and loving. Most people are from the area so they already know each other, but you will find friends if you aren't from there."
Sophomore,4,"I love most of the people here. A lot of people care and are tough on me because they know I have a lot to offer. Everyone is caring and for the most part understanding. As long as you surround yourself with the right energy you could achieve so much and I believe that goes for any place. Positive energy can go a long way. If I could give myself a piece of advice before attending, I would have told myself to open up. There are more people than you may think that actually care about you and your success. There are so many benefits given and all you have to do is open up and communicate."
Sophomore,4,I like how the professor push the students to do they best  and how the students on campus are willing to help one another
Junior,4,I like that the university has smaller class sizes so it is easy to connect with teachers. The institution could improve on the settings and surroundings.
Freshman,4,"One of the main reasons why I chose UAPB is to experience my culture more. From the different fields of study to the different organizations. It's interesting to know that when I walk out, I will more than likely see something I never seen before in person. I have the most understanding professors. They have helped me out a lot as  get used to the transition from high school to college."
Sophomore,4,Great staff. They help you out a lot when you need it the staff never gave up on you. You will have really good memories and create life time relationships. Also the professors do everything they can to make sure you Succeed. Coming from a big city itâ€™s a adjustment but with the right friends youâ€™ll be fine.
Sophomore,4,What I like about UAPB is the interactions thatâ€™s students have with each other and getting along well. What I can see change is better communication with staff and students when handling application and etc
Sophomore,4,The Professors care about their and job and the students. They are always willing to help students when they needed and infromative overall. I would reccommend this University to anyone.
Sophomore,4,I liked how you can get exactly what you want which is academic quality while being able to have a bit of fun. My experience was very great and Iâ€™m glad that I am able to attend such cultured place. This HBCU does not disappoint when it comes expectation.
Sophomore,4,"I will be returning to the university as a sophomore in the fall. My college experience has been challenging however I am making the best of it. The only problem, specially, I struggle to overcome is my financial hardship. My education is extremely important to me and with support I know I will succeed."
Senior,4,"I have had an amazing experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. I have all my life after college to be a minority, but attending an HBCU and seeing successful BLACK students/professionals who look like me and are in positions that I strive to be in, gives me the confidence boost I need to finish strong. There is so much hidden talent at this university and the professors really want to see their students succeed by giving them the tools they need and going above and beyond in and outside the  classroom. Giving us students their personal number to call them for help outside their office hours is what I love the most! I definitely have that Golden Lion Pride!!"
Freshman,4,"The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff has a very diverse and friendly environment. You'll definitely feel at home and safe here. This is my first year attending the University, and I love it. The upperclassmen are nice and helpful to new/transfer students."
Freshman,4,That everyone is friendly and willing to help you reach your goals as a whole. I wouldn't change anything about the school personally.
Sophomore,4,"I love the dorm that I stay in on campus which is the Delta complex. I love the BCM on campus really loving people and know their word. I also like some of the professors and advisors their , some really really want to see you be successful.  One thing I'd say needs improvement is the organization some of the time. They are not the most organized but I think that is with everyone."
Sophomore,4,"The Classes are smaller which makes it easier to talk to professors and interact with students.  Learning smaller classes helps you to understand the criteria of the classes better, and finish assignments at a steady pace."
Freshman,4,It has been a great experience so far. I have some awesome professor. I have also met some really nice students. The professors are always willing to help you with your school work. They will stay after class to assist you when you don't understand.
Sophomore,4,"So far at The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff I have had a very good experience. I enjoy the environment of the school so much. If I have the chance to change something about the school, I wouldn't do it."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is amazing! I love how it's campus friendly, family oriented, and how everyone on motivates each other to succeed. In the future I would like to see more diversity on campus, and I would like our graduation rate to go up. We are a good school, we have good students, but some of them do not have the drive to graduate. So, in the future I hope to see the graduate rate grow tremendously."
Junior,4,The school is great tuition price and kinda small classes professors are wonderful. Administration needs a little improvement and financial aid when contact students about transfer credits and so forth.
Junior,4,"So far, my experience at The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff has been good. Ive met people from all over the world. The campus is like a family . There is a lot I would change about the university though . There is no privacy nor gate to separate the university from the local community. There have been times where locals have simply walked on campus freely because security isnâ€™t struck enough"
Freshman,4,I found this institution to be a very good to attaend for the higher study in computer science as a fulltime student. There is an ample scholarship opportunities for the new freshman student.  Thanks
Alum,4,My overall experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) was pretty good. While like any university there is always room for improvement this institution was not perfect. If I could see anything change it would be to see more student involvement in bettering the institution. Also Pine Bluff is a small city and there is not much to do there as far as fun but on a positive note Little Rock is not too far away if one was looking for fun activities to do with friends. I think the best part about UAPB is how family oriented it is and how much support is provided for students.
Junior,4,"The school is great. Teachers and professors are very motivating, they want to the students to achieve brighter future."
Niche User,4,"Good environment, great staff and friendly people. Great clubs that really help you out of your comfort zone"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is the proudest Historically Black institution there is in the south. They are very family oriented and really do care about doing the best for their students. The professors really take the time out to get to know their students and let them know that its okay to come to office. There is no place I would rather be, the staff at this university will make sure I have everything I need to make my college experience great. Some things I would change would be the campus is not gated and itâ€™s not really secure besides the campus policeman."
Senior,4,I Loved the experience of College Life I also Joined a Sorority SGRHO and The Education that I have received has been wonderful I love all of my Professors !!! they have made college life Quite the experience.
Freshman,4,What I liked about the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is that all of the faculty members there are like a family and they care about each of us and want us to excel and learn the way of life.
Sophomore,4,"UAPB does offer many internship opportunities and resume building opportunities for students. They offer many ways for students to get a job after graduating. We do need improvement in cafeteria food, parking spaces, organization when it comes to clubs, and safety around the outskirts of campus because we are right next to a neighborhood."
Sophomore,4,The academic and professors are great with the exception of a few. The career services team has a lot to offer. The area and safety leaves a lot to be desired but itâ€™s worth it if you have a scholarship.
Junior,4,"Im a transfer student from kingsbough community college, so ive only been here  one semester but I really enjoy it here. The professors are friendly, if you need help there will to help you. The school is very athletic base."
Freshman,4,As a freshman I find it different. I always attending mixed schools. Now that Iâ€™m attending a HBCU itâ€™s a good experience
Freshman,4,"My experience at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff now is going great. I have gotten expose to a lot of things that I did now know about. For example I went to UAPB Museum, and found out there was female who was an administrative and she was the only one. It great that you can get exposed to things on your campus. If I had the chance to change something I would not because UAPB is a great college to be at, and I am a proud student to be there."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a sophomore here at the great University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff! Coming all the way from Detroit Michigan, my love for UAPB is genuine. I am proud to be apart of this University's marching band, The Marching Musical Machine of the Mid-South. I am a nursing major and in 2020 I will graduate with my Bachelors degree and I will become a Registered Nurse in Pediatrics. This University constantly motivates me to become great at what I do, and to strive for the best. I am honored to be a student here at UAPB!"
Sophomore,4,"First off I'ma start off by saying ""I Love My HBCU"".... Pine bluff is the perfect school for me . I fit right in and have had a wonderful time since I've been there. There's no other school in Arkansas that I'll choose over uapb . We have the most wonderful Instructors ever. They make sure we are doing what we supposed to do also helping us with long term goals ."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy this  institution. The atmosphere is great. It has a family vibe and the  faculty knows you by your name. They are willing to come to touring if you need them to be whenever you don't understand the assignment.
Sophomore,4,"As a student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is amazing experience, because you are not just being welcome as a student, but a new complete family that will push to be a better student as possible.  You will be able to have great relationships with your instructors, professors, and especially with your advisors. However, when it comes to opportunities on campus you must jump on them ahead of time and put yourself out there, if not, then you miss a great opportunity."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is the community envolvement. I've noticed countelss number of organizations like, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, love to participate in volunteering in the community."
Sophomore,4,This University has treated me well!  The remember me by name! I am more then just a number here at UAPB!
Sophomore,4,"With University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff being a HBCU, there are multiple aspects that both aid and deter students from attending here. First, the area in which the school is located is not the best, but if you remain on campus and try not to venture out at night by yourself then you will be fine. Second, the student life on campus is high energy and fun. The school tries to host different events on campus in the Student Union for those who live on campus. Thirdly, this university has a family feel whether you are a student or faulty. I can proudly say I have truly come to love my HBCU with all the goods and the bads that comes along."
Freshman,4,I'm having a great experience here at UAPB. The students and teachers make it an encouraging and fulfilling place to attend. The only thing I would change is the financial aid process. It's very slow and hard to get in touch with the people you need to talk too.
Junior,4,The athletic programs are all pretty good. The band is amazing. The school is very old school but it's a nice old school. The academics could be more tedious than they are. I feel like I am still in high school in regards to the learning curve.
Freshman,4,I love my HBCU! butttttttttt..... It is a lot of problems with mold in the Plex ( Freshman dorms) Staff is very nice! j
College Sophomore,4,I personally feel safe on campus. We have officers present all around the campus.
College Sophomore,4,So far the Greek Life is the best in my experiences.
Junior,4,"At the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, I've experienced a lot . I had to learn for my self that class was more of a responsibility and not something youi had to show up to . Going out and partying  is not always fun. Especially when your barely getting by . I wish they would open more doors for students on campus like other schools do . It's a great environment and only positive vibes . UAPB Is really a family. Over a course of the summer, I lost my choir scholarship because of baseball . Now Im looking for money to pay for school because my family is not able to pay all that money . UAPB has not only changed me as a person but as a Black male figure in the city of Pine Bluff. "
Freshman,4,"The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff is a great school, I really do love it. This is a HBCU, but the rest of the student body is full of people from all over the world. This school is located in a small area that is some what in a country setting so it's not much to do are the city.As for the college it self, every week there is some event party or guess on campus. The dorms are not the best since they are kinda small but there is a new dorm for girls called the delta complex. Which is the best yet hardest dorm to get in due to how early the application are able to go in. From a sports point a view, you'll never be bored, even though one specific sport that they have could be better. Student life, professors, and party scenes are the most top notch things on campus. As for safety, I rate it a 9/10 because there are campus police that are around 24/7 making sure nothing happens so it's pretty safe. The food is pretty good, it's not your mothers home cooking but it's pretty good."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is average size (not too big not too small). I think the campus is great because with is being average size, it builds a relationship with professors and other students"
College Freshman,4,So far all my college professors are welcoming and thrive with energy on their subject of expertise. They encourage for us to ask questions and be involved in the class.
College Freshman,4,The males side of greek life is that their are many different ones to choose from. As me being a freshman I have plenty of research to do and to keep your opportunities open.
College Freshman,4,"So far the education portion is great. The dorms are something that need work, may be health and safety issues."
College Freshman,4,I do believe through career services from what I've heard that there is a great deal of opportunities available here on campus.
College Freshman,4,so far everything has been great easy to access and comfortable feeling.
College Freshman,4,I have had little to no experience about this topic at the campus but I can only hope and believe that there are things put in place as prevention.
Junior,2,The school could improve as far as dorms and the financial aid office is poor when it come to getting a person on the phone to handle financial matters.
Junior,2,I am not really learning as I would if I was in a classroom setting. The professors do not respond to emails and if they do it is weeks later.
Freshman,2,"Currently, All of my classes except one are online. It's been pretty hard getting the hang of something so new."
Alum,2,You can find really good professors that care about their job and teaching the students but it probably be 1/8 teachers that fit it.
Senior,2,"An unnecessarily frustrating school. Due to everything being disorganized in the admin department, class selection and the chances of landing a competent professor usually err on the low side. Not to mention how unfriendly this school is towards those with disabilities. Even for an HBCU, this school is severely underfunded, and this makes for a rather cumbersome experience for those who were expecting great things from a highly ranked HBCU. My experience here was for the majority an annoyance and constant stress, although I have also made great friends and had some valuable experiences. A plus side would perhaps be the uniqueness of the student body and the close knit campus; however these things are overshadowed by how overcomplicated and arduous things are be at this university."
Junior,2,"While some of the faculty and staff are extremely helpful and make the experience attending the University very memorable, other faculty and staff can be very rude and unhelpful which can be discouraging."
Sophomore,2,"I want nothing more than to love this school but i does not care about me. As small as this school is there focus is not on its students. They only care about their athletes (non black especially) and the pine bluff natives. There are more scholarships and opportunities for people that are from pine bluff. Also, if you want something done you have to call your parent and have them raise hell to get it done. The staff have bad attitudes and their are too many teachers that you cant even understand. They waste so much money and i dont feel like im getting the education i deserve and that im paying for. You cant even get involved on the campus because everything is about popularity and who you know not what you have to offer. and this town is dirty poor and offers literally nothing."
Sophomore,2,"My experience at UAPB was nothing like what I expected. The town that the school is in is super small with little to no stores around it, which makes it hard for students who do not have transportation. The faculty needs to be replaced and upgraded because the way they treat students who are enrolled there is boarder line disrespectful. The athletic program needs improvement also. The professors are okay and they help you when you're having a problem. The food can definitely make you feel sick afterwards so that needs improvement also."
College Freshman,2,"There can be ants, ridiculous visual spiders, and mold in the bathrooms ( which they say they plan on doing something about) hopefully soon."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many options here. Nothing fancy, just the usual fast food restaurants."
College Freshman,2,A little more variety would be great. The food is the same every single week. The so called salad bar sucks. Not too many options
College Junior,2,"My financial Aid process was bad, the lines were always long and they acted like they really didn't want to help."
College Freshman,2,Pine Bluff is not the best town.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel as if there aren't enough officers on campus. The ones that are on campus don't seem to care that much about safety.
Recent Alumnus,2,There aren't many places to eat in Pine Bluff. At night you'll have a hard time getting anything but McDonald's. Not really a stay open all night town. We don't get student discounts.
College Sophomore,2,I don't feel that safe on the campus all the time but I just pray and I feel safe again.  Campus crime isn't as bad as the local crime.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is horrible , it's always chicken usually and it never taste good. It's not a lot of variety."
College Sophomore,2,"To live in the dorms I stayed in last year , they treated you like babies and gave you no freedom. The best thing about living there was that you had a roof over your head and the worst was that the rules were too strict for college. The social athmosphere was pretty nice though."
College Sophomore,2,computers are accessible at UAPB but the wifi is not really good. when the wifi works the speed of the network is really good but if you don't have wifi you really can't access anything on campus
College Sophomore,2,the only positive thing about having a meal plan is that you get to have flex dollars. the campus is not really appetizing everyday people eat it anyway
College Sophomore,2,"The housing is really intolerant. Most buildings are not in very good condition and there are many pest issues. Janitorial cleaning is very lazy. Also the cost is ridiculous,  but that's pretty much any college. Other than the looks people seem to look past it an enjoy their time."
College Sophomore,2,"Students need their cars on campus. Instead of dealing with the hassle of buses and asking others for rides, students rely on their own cars to get them around."
College Sophomore,2,"In order to move off - campus, one would have to find a house in the area and/or city. There are only one complex of off - campus housing for the students. The apartments are not really in top shape for the price they're letting then go for, which is expensive for a college student."
College Junior,2,They're always too busy to help and act like they have an attitude with students. Not much help.
College Junior,2,"Summer is RIDICULOUSLY HOT and HUMID, I have gone to the hospital for heat exhaustion and dehydration numerous times. The winter is extremely cold and when it snows, the streets are extremely dangerous. One extreme to the next."
College Junior,2,"I hated living on campus. Not only are most of the students inconsiderate as far as noise, but the rules are way too strict and the cost is way too expensive! Not worth it!"
College Sophomore,2,they dont apply anything on time. constantly have to check and see if loans have been posted to the account. they never answer the phone
College Freshman,2,It's utterly stupid! You have to be in a dorm to get the meals here!! 
College Freshman,2,I finally received the financial aid I asked for but I had to keep trudging back up to the campus!! When I called on the phone it seemed like none of the people in financial aid wanted to be bothered with someone who is trying to do the right thing! There are long lines outside of their office and it is frustrating that there is only one financial aid office in the entire school.
College Sophomore,2,There's absolutely nothing to do off campus. The mall isn't very amazing. The hangout spot off campus is Wal-Mart.!!!!! Not many places to shop. No good parks or nearby attractions. 
College Senior,2,Our university is old. They are slowly but surely getting the university up to par for the students.
College Sophomore,2,I am a 3.25 student and no one knows where i can find scholarship money.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't go out to parties without a safe designated driver to and from. The parties i recommend are the parties on the school grounds.
College Junior,2,"I live in the all girl dorm where we have our own cafe, i love the convinence, as well as the selection we have to eat. However the price of meal plan is ridiculous seeing are cafe is  only open during the week and we have t go to the main cafe on weekends"
College Sophomore,2,"The freshman dorms at Pine Bluff University aren't the greatest. The dorms are very old and in need of new plumbing and wiring. It's very convenient getting to and from classes, this is great when the weather is inclimate."
College Senior,2,"Our campus dining is a bit below average, its improved from over the years but they still have a long way to go. In terms of healthy eating, the only thing that that they have done to contribute to healthy eating is install a salad bar, which is great, but it isn't enough."
College Senior,2,"Our facilites are mediocre and could definitely use some updates. We don't have a workout facilites for students that aren't athletes, and we have alot of practice conflicts because we only have one gym. We couldn't definitely have more campus activities, we do things every now and then, but our advisors can be very close minded to our ideas."
College Sophomore,2,I really don't know because I stayed in campus most of the time. I think campus is safer with  camera.
College Sophomore,2,"At the University, there's not many places to go. The few places that people go most are out of walking distance. There's a metro bus that the school provides that takes us to Walmart. It runs at certain times throughout the day, but has been known not to show up and leave students stranded at Walmart on occasions."
College Junior,2,"Honestly,this is another topic i can not speak on. I was too focused on my work to worry about what was happening in the world of athletics. If i am to peak on the behalf of those that can speak on it, i would say that it is a very big part of their school life. Students flock to the stadium as if the Grand Dame of all Circuses was in town."
College Junior,2,"I give the dining this grade,because of the preparation of the food. It,a lot of the time, is not necessarily healthy for you. Example too much salt in a lot of the chicken and sometimes too greasy pizzas. If you break past those types of foods and for the salads and sandwiches,and days of certain pastas, would be pretty light to the taste buds. As for your flex dollars,it all depends on the plan you choose,but a tip for flex is to use in moderation. You should eat at a cafe if you do not have to go anywhere at the time to save it. Trust me students shoot through flex like a bullet through paper."
College Junior,2,"The computer labs should have more availability. I also don't think there should be a page limit set on printing. If I'm only allowed 10 pages, but my professor assigns a 15 page research paper, how am I supposed to print my work?"
College Junior,2,"I give the campus a C- on dining because the food in the cafeteria is not very appetizing on most days. It has its good days at times, but for the majority, it is not so good. Also, we don't have any variety. We just have to eat in the cafe or Checker's and Italian Trio. It's the same thing everyday."
College Freshman,2,Honestly with strickness at UAPB it depends on what event is going on. If its an event where there is adults and students then the police aren't strict at all and you one every so often but if it's an event with a lot of students and no adults the police are strict and when the event is over there will rush us out and want us to leave early.
College Sophomore,2,The weather is very tricky. One minute it can be storming then a few seconds later it can be sunny. I never know what to wear. Classes are rarely canceled here and if they are you don't know until after you're already in the class.
College Senior,2,"The relationships are unstable, there are usually a lot of arguments, he say she say things. The appearance are not always pleasant, meaning people like to wear pajamas to class, hair not always combed, and sometimes dirty or wrinkled clothing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"One Minute it wonna be hot outsid, then the next 2 hours it would be cold."
College Junior,2,"We don't have a lot of off campus housing options, especially ones that are close to our campus. There are a few places that could be considered ""off-campus"" housing, but none of it is worth living in. With the lack of off-campus housing, we are forced to live in dorms that provide average living conditions for an extremely high price."
College Sophomore,2,"Pine bluff is not the most popular area to be in because of the simple fact that there is nothing to do around in this area. Pine bluff is 30 minutes out of the main city. So there is reall y nothing but dirt roads, but the bright side is that if you have a car you can go anywhere you want."
College Senior,2,Unless you pay $30 for a parking sticker be prepared to walk to class from a far distance
College Sophomore,2,"Bad Quality â€“ The food on campus it is rarely good, most of the days you can't eat too much because everything that the school offer is greasy food and you can get extremely fat with it as much of the students. Restaurants are close to the campus, so if you have a car you can go to eat somewhere else. Also the big city, which is Little Rock its near from Pine Bluff, just 45 minutes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Never Interned Before â€“ At this current time of my life, I'm more concerend about completing graduate school."
College Student,2,"If you are coming to UAPB, make sure you stay on Financial Aid's butt with your money. Trust me, you do not want to sit in the long lines the frist week or two of school. Its really better to handle everything in the summer if your able to."
College Junior,2,"Don't Ask â€“ One word ""cliques"" students often clique up by what city they are from or what Greek organization they want to become a part of. This school is no different from my highschool, and I think my highschool was more mature. Im basicaly paying for highschool. Caucasion students get the upper hand in some ways they recieve scholarships for being the minority, but be prepared to be harrassed, a few of my friends are not coming back to this Univeristy."
College Junior,2,"The food has no variety, they close when they feel like closing. So if it closes at 7pm, doors will shut at 6:30pm. You can only use flex dollars on Checkers, that gets old, and this Italian place that only stays open a few hours. P.S. there is no gym available for that freshman 15 you might gain so eat wisely."
College Junior,2,"Not Professional â€“ Teachers are not qualified to teach classes, especially in the Mass Comm. Department. Dont let anyone fool you this department is a joke when you are up for an internship or job you will be ashamed that you have wasted your money."
College Freshman,2,Not Enough â€“ There are plenty of spaces to park for teachers but none close enough for students especially when its hot.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process was difficult because the people who were supposed to assist us were lackadaisical with getting the information processed.
College Freshman,2,Pine Bluff â€“ Pine Bluff is a medium sized city with lots of friendly people
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Much to Do â€“ In Pine Bluff Arkansas there really isn't a lot of things to do here. Even thought there isn't much to do here I love the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff because of the atmosphere. The people are very helpful and caring.
Alum,1,"Attended the university for all four years and the quote that can sum up my experience at it ""If it makes sense it won't happen"". Everything is done is very slow. That means funds, basic paperwork for housing, and getting any type of communication with anyone. I would not recommend this school to anyone there plenty of amazing hbcu out there but this one is not worth putting your education and college experience at risk."
Freshman,1,"This is probably one of the worst college experience I've ever had. The people were awful, the students were childish, the staff was lackluster, the food was terrible, and the surrounding area was dangerous. Internet was piss poor, it was hard to research anything cause it went down so often. Even if you have no options left, do not pick this college. It's not worth."
College Freshman,1,I've been at UAPB for a month now and it's the worst experience of my life. I live in harold complex fisher hall. The dorms are very unsanitary. We are living with roaches and other bugs. The bathrooms have mold. The school its self is unorganized. Financial services are always giving people the run around. Majority of the time the financial services employees doesn't know what they're talking about. I do not enjoy being at this school.
College Freshman,1,Make sure you handle any and all financial issues as soon as you possibly can!!! DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!!! THIS SCHOOL IS HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY MATTERS!!!!!!
College Junior,1,You want to get fat and eat fast food all day? Those are your options.
College Junior,1,Hound hound hound. Nothing ever gets done at this university.
College Junior,1,"Unless your African American, there is no party options."
College Junior,1,This school is a doing a terrible disservice to their students.
College Sophomore,1,Ridiculous rules for this to be a college
Recent Alumnus,1,"I don't party, so I'm not sure."
College Sophomore,1,"The local people kill too much. I don't really leave the campus but the mall is okay , never have to wait in line because no one is hardly ever there"
College Junior,1,"Coming from a big city, I really dislike the atmosphere. There is nothing to do here, the shopping areas are terrible, and everything is limited."
College Sophomore,1,They need new security and the nurse is alright.
College Sophomore,1,It's not diverse at all.
College Sophomore,1,I wouldn't recommend this school to anyone... ever.
College Sophomore,1,If you don't have a car you have to pay for the bus
College Senior,1,"Since the new chancellor here at the university transportation has been a big issue, but it is being worked on. We usually have a bus that students can ride for free as long as you show your student ID."
College Sophomore,1,The program was recently canceled and I have to transfer school next semester
College Sophomore,1,Its horrible I am already 2 weeks into the semester and I'm still waiting on the financial aid to provide me with a award letter.
College Junior,1,"Parking for students is at a minimum, Parking permits are mandatory unless you are will to pay a $30 ticket everyday. The parking lots are horrible they have way to many pot hole or lose gravel! However, when you do find a good spot it's pretty close to class"
College Sophomore,1,"What the city offers is horrible, but the student's and the fun we create is pretty awesome."
College Freshman,1,This is a historically African-American college so there are not many other races on campus.
College Freshman,1,They have okay computers but you need to bring your own with your own Wi-Fi because its always messing up
College Sophomore,1,if you do not have a car there is a local bus that goes all around town. All you need is your student ID because the cost of bus fee is covered in your tuition. If you need to go further there is a cab service but it sucks
College Junior,1,The Greek life was given a D- because if your not greek your nobody.
College Junior,1,"Pine Bluff financial aid system was given the grade of a D+ due to its unprofessional staff, the decreasing of scholarships provided to the students once accepted, the extended wait process of the financial assistance, and their lack of accountability for financial strain."
College Freshman,1,I believe your first parking sticker should be free.
College Sophomore,1,You have to have a decal or you will get a ticket.
College Freshman,1,There are parties every weekend but most students have no transportation.
College Sophomore,1,My tip would be to keep going back to the financial aid bulding and ask  for everything you know you need to ask about. try your best to be patient and soon they will give you everything you need.
College Senior,1,The best club in pine bluff is Walmart laughing but very serious
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Healthy at All!! Mostly everything around UAPB is extremely unhealthy and too far to get to. Your best bet is going grocery shopping for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
College Junior,1,"I'm completley honest when I say the Mass Comm. dept. is a joke. I have learned very little and they are very un-organized, I wish I transferred sooner."
College Freshman,1,Our financial aid people are slow and they always mess something up with your financial aid. Then you have to wait literally all day and still don't get anything finished. They need some different people to work faster.
College Junior,1,"The Pine Bluff Atmosphere â€“ Personally, I have not much great to say about the town of Pine Bluff. There are no attractions for tourist. The most culture I've seen is on campus with the students. There are little activities going on within the city that doesn't involve the school. I will say that overall, while in Pine Bluff, I do feel safe. Most of the crime that happens is not in Pine Bluff, it is usually in Little Rock. People from Pine Bluff have a mixed attitude toward the students. I have heard the student body referred to as ""implants"" and I have heard them referred to as the life if the city. There is very little shopping, but it is getting better. With the town, it is as much as you make it, the weather is great."
College Junior,1,"The parking at UAPB is HORRIBLE ............ their are times were i'm going to class, and I cant event find a parking spot. Then you have this lot that the school doesn't own and its gravel!!!!! Many of my tires have been eating up by the gravel. It sucks!!!!!! need more work on the permits costs, tickets and fines when you cant even park anywhere."
College Sophomore,1,"Rent Houses Are Expensive! The number of rent houses are very few in the Pine Bluff area. Myself along with three of my closest friends are trying to move off campus. The process is difficult and the few that we did find are very expensive, especially the ones close to campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Not So Many â€“ The diversity here sucks, they have only few minorities and they play sports if they are here."
College Sophomore,1,"No Room â€“ All of these students are enrolled, but they don't have a place to stay.  Quit letting all these student enroll."
College Sophomore,1,"So-Called ""FOOD&quot â€“ The food here is oh so horrible, and when they feed us they feed us like little children.  Sometimes, the food is either burnt or dry.  They could do a lot better."

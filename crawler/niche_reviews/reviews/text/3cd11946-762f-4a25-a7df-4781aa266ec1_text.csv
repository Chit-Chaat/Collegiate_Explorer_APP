Senior,5,The community is still excellent even though everything is online. The faculty is still very helpful
Senior,5,"Calpoly has an amazing lecturers, the architecture programs that CalPoly has offered are varies from architectural practice to architectural theories. The lecturers are diverse in terms of design style."
Alum,5,Cal Poly offered amazing resources to stay ahead of classes. Being a student-athlete and pursuing a degree in construction management was doable because of all the support provided by the school.
Alum,5,"The location of San Luis Obispo was incredible! Campus life offered plenty of resources and groups to meet other students. Overall, the best experience!"
Junior,5,"Cal Poly is incredible because it truly embodies its ""Learn by Doing"" motto and is located in the best place. The city is so unique and cozy and the people are brilliant. I've enjoyed learning from my professors and meeting new faces. Digging in and getting my hands dirty has proven to be the best way for me to learn and Cal Poly has definitely provided just that and more."
Alum,5,"I did not have to take any classes online. However, any work I did online used easy to manage software."
Alum,5,"I had excellent teachers, always accessible and eager to mold minds. The campus is beautiful, the nightlife is exciting with all the bars and activities lined up just 10 minutes from campus (walking, less for driving)."
Senior,5,California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo is a wonderful school with a friendly community and passionate people. The school and staff are all devoted to helping the students while the learning environment is peaceful and inspiring.
Senior,5,"I have taken several courses online and the professors I have encountered have all been incredibly adaptive with the platform, doing their utmost best to provide the most efficient learning experience for the students. During this pandemic, the professors have all been understanding and there for the students who needed extra care to stay on top of the courses. The courses have also been specially tailored to better suit online learning platforms. The online learning experience is overall wonderfull."
Junior,5,"Loved it! I thought they did an amazing job, especially under the circumstances. All of the teachers I had were very accommodating and still made sure we were learning the material we needed to learn for the course."
Alum,5,"Great teachers who really care about their students. Loved the hands-on learning which has really helped me in my career. It made me realize I could handle whatever problem came up at work, because I knew how to find answers and engage other people to help solve them."
Alum,5,I didn't take any classes online so I can't really comment on this learning modality. I know they offer more online now.
Senior,5,"After a long, drawn out process of choosing between different college choices, I was worried about choosing the wrong one. After attending the school for several years now, I am so glad I chose it. The professors are amazing and incredibly qualified. The students are intelligent and the location of the school is beautiful. The people in San Luis Obispo are incredibly kind, and I am now hoping to live here after graduation."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, from the friendly staff and students to the beautiful campus and San Luis Obispo area."
Alum,5,"Great integration into major classes right away. The ""Learn By Doing"" motto helps you integrate what you are learning in class into the labs you do and can translate into real world skills. Also, the school is in a great area with tons of activities to do and areas to explore."
Freshman,5,"Best school ever. I am so happy I went here. It’s nice and very pretty, small classes but still a big school, and slo is the best college town there is."
Freshman,5,"I just got into Cal Poly Slo, which is also considered one of the most underrated schools in the nation just due to its ""CSU"" title instead of ""UC"". In fact,  Cal Poly slo has much lower acceptance rate and retention rate than many of the UCs in California. It has outstanding engineering programs that are known by many people."
Niche User,5,Wonderful! The campus is excellent and this university really helps out for life! Coming out of here with a full portfolio and ready for the real world is one of the best things to ever experience.
Alum,5,"Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is a great college and university. I had the greatest experience there. Amazing people, caring community, healthy culture, and all with the charming ""small town"" feel of San Luis Obispo. With the mountains on one side and the California coast on the other, the campus sits in a perfectly situated area and provides tons of open space to enjoy the college experience."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the ""Learn By Doing"" philosophy, where most of my classes have labs that teach me about how to do hands-on activities to further my education. It is really applicable to the workforce to get this hands-on experience, which is why Cal Poly gives me the resources I need to easily find internships while still in college. I am very happy to attend here and represent Cal Poly through all the award-winning clubs on campus. This is an excellent place to get involved with clubs, intramurals, and San Luis Obispo activities."
Niche User,5,Went on a college visit and really felt at home from the very beginning. I love the surrounding environment and could see myself attending.
Senior,5,Cal Poly is a learn by doing campus. I love the hands on approach to learning. I find the quarter system to be a bit challenging though. Professors are very approachable and available. San Luis Obispo is a perfect college town.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy being a student here especially an Animal Science student. Cal Poly's academic statement is ""Learn By Doing"" and this is no scam. We have many animal facilities where you receive hands on learning so you are fully prepared to face the industry head on upon graduation. Additionally, Cal Poly as a unit has supported me so much in work and school."
Sophomore,5,"Oftentimes when you have a ""dream"" school there isn't a chance it will live up to your expectations. Cal Poly SLO has exceeded my expectations all the way! I am living my dream as a student at SLO."
Niche User,5,I believe the campus maps could be a bit more descriptive with directions on how to navigate the campus and the clothes in the spirit store are rather expensive and I feel like the football stadium is rather small overall though the environment is great and I love the atmosphere of the campus
Freshman,5,"It is an amazing school! The classes are small, the students are so welcoming, and the surrounding area has everything you could ever want."
Sophomore,5,"Cal Poly is an amazing university. It is academically challenging, but with amazing support from . it's faculty. Students are driven and focused, but very welcoming and make the school feel like a tight knit community."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Cal Poly. This year, I have fully thrown myself into many projects in the Kinesiology department, rushed a sorority, and found myself going out of my comfort zone much more. Cal Poly gave me the confidence to realize I can achieve anything I want to, and has truly given me so many of the opportunities to get to where I am today."
Niche User,5,"As a student interested in mechanical engineering, Cal Poly SLO's mechanical engineering program of 'learn by doing' truly stands out to me. Speaking with several students there, I learned that the environment is one that is collaborative, and the students are willing to help each other, which is what I enjoy. I also learned that even though some of the classes may be large, the professors try to know each student personally and gain a connection to them. Coming from a small high school, one thing I would want Cal Poly to change is the class sizes, since I enjoy a very personalized learning environment. Additionally, I would like to see Cal Poly grow the female in STEM representation, which is a problem with mostly every school."
Sophomore,5,"Good teachers and community, engaging clubs, numerous opportunities to engage with industry and alumni."
Senior,5,"I transferred here from Stanford and I could not be happier. I find the classes and professors great, students interesting, and such a beautiful campus on an amazing location."
Alum,5,If you like Learning by Doing then this is the college for you.  Most classes offer labs where you will get to put the skills you learn in class into actual projects or learning situations.  The campus is located in beautiful San Luis Obispo and the school tries to integrate the student life with the community.  By far an excellent college experience where you can make life long friends and set yourself up for future success.
Freshman,5,"Imagine obtaining a respectable degree from a school that sits right on the beach, but is surrounded by expansive mountains and hills, and sunshine pours over the campus almost every day. Committing to Cal Poly has been one of the best desicions I have ever made. First of all, the university is highly admired and graduate students are quickly grabbed up by employers because of their solid reputation. Beyond excellent academics, the people that attend Cal Poly make the experience what it is. People live a healthy and fit lifestyle, and adventure is flowing through everyone, but students are also very dedicated to their studies. The location of Cal Poly, in San Luis Obispo, is legendary. San Luis Obispo, California has so much to offer: an endless list of hikes, gnarly waves to surf, beautiful beaches, thursday-night farmer's markets, a welcoming downtown area, and the sweetest locals. Cal Poly literally checks all of the boxes."
Niche User,5,"I loved the motto “learn by doing”! Cal Poly encourages all of their students to learn and earn their degree by taking action and actually doing what their career paths are, whether that be in class or on their own!"
Niche User,5,"Cal Poly was a dream that came true for a person who wanted to be an engineer. It was a dream for my mother, who attended this campus. It is a dream from a first-generation woman who became a Professional Engineer and the first engineer in the family. She has become a role model for me, a Cal Poly graduate who inspired me to follow her path."
Junior,5,"First and foremost, I love the schools motto of learn by doing. We really get to apply what we learn in class in our labs to better prepare for our careers. The labs make it easier to learn because it really keeps you engaged. One change I hope would occur is that professors consider if midterms are truly effective or only reflect how much a student can cram in the days before the exam."
Niche User,5,Great Engineering program.  Like the emphasis on hands on experience. Also like the relationship between the school and private industry.
Freshman,5,Cal poly SLO is a great school that gives a wonderful education as well as many resources for in and outside the classroom. They also provide a great number of clubs for literally any interest you have wether that be for your major or just a hobby.
Freshman,5,You learn by doing instead of sitting in a lecture hall with 500 other people in it. Everyone here is committed to helping you academically or in any other way. There are plenty of opportunities for every major and a wide variety of clubs and everyone will find a few clubs that they are interested in. It's a very safe campus. WOW week is a great way for those who are introverted or shy to make friends and not feel lonely while at Cal Poly. The campus is clean and isn't too confusing. The recreation center is fantastic and has plenty of things for people to do there. The food is good and not too expensive either.
Niche User,5,I took summer courses here and it was challenging but not overwhelmingly stressful. Poly is definitely not a super diverse campus but the people are pretty friendly and the professors are I had were really understanding.
Niche User,5,Great campus! The Agriculture department are so friendly and the tours are worth taking especially to the twin unit and dairy house.
Junior,5,"Phenomenal college! One of the most underrated in California is not the West Coast. If considering, I’d  definitely suggest a campus tour. You’ll be hooked!"
Niche User,5,I absolutely love the campus and small town feel of SLO! The campus is beautiful and the downtown area is also very nice with plenty of shops and great restaurants.
Junior,5,"Cal Poly SLO is not only in a great location, but the people you are constantly surrounded by truly make the college experience worth while. I have never been surrounded by such positive kind people, and this aspect distinguishes Cal Poly from other schools. Additionally, this campus and town is extremely safe, which made a huge difference in my application process. When visiting other campuses, I do not feel nearly as safe as I do in San Luis Obispo. Along with high safety, Cal Poly also provides all the tools to put yourself out there and meet people. Everyone is so kind which makes the social aspect easier. On the other hand, the campus food could use some work. Most of the food is located in one area, and has never fully reached my satisfaction. There aren't too many options, so dining could definitely use some improvements. Besides that, I am very pleased with my decision on attending this college, and I would not have wanted it any other way."
Niche User,5,I absolutely loc Cal Poly SLO. This is my dream college. The energy there is so relaxed and when I stepped on campus I felt at home. The people in the town and on campus are the nicest people you will meet. They have an amazing engineering program that i want to experience.
Freshman,5,"This college is great! They are so freshman oriented and work very hard to help incoming students adapt to college life. Also, the new dorms are great! It’s awesome to see colleges incorporating gender-inclusive areas to make all students, including those in the LGBTQ+ community, comfortable in their living spaces. Cal Poly’s “learn by doing” motto is taken to heart by the staff and faculty members, meaning students are truly encouraged to put themselves out there while incorporating their learning into life. The one complaint I have in the disorganization of the student portal. It’s pretty difficult to navigate if you’re not accustomed to using it."
Freshman,5,"Have absolutely loved every single aspect of going here. The people, professors, classes and campus have all been great. The town is also really fun to be in."
Junior,5,"Cal Poly is the perfect school for me, it has a great balance of social, recreational, educational, and leadership development activities. The students here are very friendly and approachable and I have found my experience to be fantastic!"
Junior,5,"I am a huge fan of CalPoly's ""Learn By Doing"" philosophy.  This is a school that teaches the value of exploration, learning from failure, persistence, and resourcefulness.  Failure isn't a soul-crushing concept here; it is simply part of a student's growth on the path to success.  CalPoly recognizes that in order to grow, one must overcome many challenges."
Niche User,5,"I visited Cal Poly for a field trip when I was in eighth grade through a club I joined known as C.J.S.F. It was a great experience, I really enjoyed how outdoors and how many clubs there are available to students. The energy there was just great. On the plus the beach is nearby plus there are doors. I would recommend you to visit the campus because it's a sight to see."
Alum,5,"I loved the location of Cal Poly SLO. If you are interested in outdoor activities, there are many walking, hiking, and biking trails around the area. The downtown area is very nice as well."
Niche User,5,"When I went on a college road trip in 2018, Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo was the nicest and most beautiful college that I saw. The campus was beautiful, the tour guide was great and the experience was even better. The thing that really caught my eye was their rec center which is one of the largest in the country"
Junior,5,"The decision to leave everything 3,000 miles away and come to Cal Poly sight unseen was the boldest and best of my life. As an architecture student, I am studying at one of the best institutions in the world for what I do at a fraction of the price of competing institutions (literally 1/2 USC tuition even as an out of state student). On top of that, it gave me an excuse to move to the beautiful central coast where I have never had to go over half a mile from my front door to reach a trailhead."
Freshman,5,"Excellent school, great area and weather, nice and safe, if somewhat outdated campus. The rec center and new dorms are pretty though. I love how there's always something going on on campus--it feels ""alive"". There's also lots of things to do in the surrounding area, especially if you like outdoorsy stuff. And although it's not especially diverse for a California public school, it's not homogenous by any means. Overall, I would highly recommend Cal Poly."
Freshman,5,"I am excited to attend, they have many options for concentrations and minors within a degree. Love the ""Learn By Doing"" motto!"
Junior,5,"Cal Poly has so many opportunities to get involved and buff up your resume.  There's incredible professors teaching valuable material, and giving you the chance to learn hands-on."
Junior,5,"Coming from a big city I was worried that SLO would be too small of a town for me, however, I've fallen in love with this little town. With a cute little downtown, the beach 15 minutes away and amazing weather, whats not to love? The campus is a bit on the older side but has the cutest charm and love how hands on the learning environment is."
Freshman,5,The campus is very nice and the weather is great all year long. I just wish they had more chain restaurants to eat at.
Niche User,5,"After visiting Cal Poly for the first time, I can definitely say that my first impression was a major decision in choosing to attend this school for the next semester. Cal Poly Royale was one of the most memorable experiences I’ve had there."
Niche User,5,The happiest city in America. It is truly an amazing place. All the people there are happy and helpful. The views are great. Clubs are many in number. It is rigorous so it's a good education. It isn't a waste of time and it is worth it.
Freshman,4,"Cal Poly has a really tight knit community. From wow leaders and upperclassmen welcoming you and guiding you to become familiar with cal poly to the teachers that care about you, cal poly has a balance of having fun and rigorous academics. The cal poly parents even have a Facebook group to discuss cal poly matters."
Freshman,4,"Teachers are actually super accommodating for online education -- they understand when there are technical difficulties with zoom or having wifi issues. In addition, teachers have always been checking on the emotional well being of students and always ask if we need to talk and open the class up for discussion. I really enjoy online learning at cal poly and i've heard schools have done a poor job with the transition to online learning but it isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. Teachers have always tried to make the most of the experience by allowing us to have conversations with students in our class through breakoutrooms."
Freshman,4,Modifications are continually being made to create a good experience and provide students with support they would normally receive for in person classes.
Freshman,4,"Great school over all, and the university is adjusting to online classes and campus well. Great sense of community across campus."
Junior,4,"I am currently taking online classes, and its been difficult but i find a way to be able to stay on top of my tasks."
Junior,4,Cal Poly is in desperate need of diversity but im glad that there are great faculty support available to students.
Junior,4,"I would like to see more organization for transfer students. They have improved a lot but, I think there should be more opportunities for them to feel at home."
Junior,4,"This will be my first time experiencing Cal Poly online, but I think they will do great because the professors really care about their students."
Sophomore,4,Transitioning online was definitely something different but the teachers and students handled it well.
Sophomore,4,I love the people here and everyone is very friendly. I am only a sophomore and I have so far met the loveliest people and the professors are all very helpful.
Senior,4,"Professors do try their best during the time of taking courses online. There is a large learning curve for both sides of the party, and with everything happening during these hard times, I felt that my professors were very helpful and understanding."
Alum,4,"I only took one class online. It was for a GE. The class I took was Sport and Gender. It wasn't particularly hard. A pretty standard asynchronous online class, where you do some reading, write some essays. I don't think I ever actually did the reading after the first few chapters, occasionally skimming to just answer the prompts. It is helpful to have a friend in this class, if only for the final project which would be annoying to do alone or have to find a partner when you haven't really met anyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love Cal Poly. There are so many educational opportunities. The professors are very helpful and want you to succeed. Overall, a very friendly and relaxed school."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are clear and great at communicating with students! Overall, online is a transition but it has been very doable as the quarter prolonged. Of course, in person is way better but I still feel that I am getting a great education."
Senior,4,My online learning experience wasn't too bad. I had a mixture of classes that met at a certain time (synchronous) and others that I worked during my own time (asynchronous). My professors have made sure that they accommodated students the best they could and were always open in communication. I also was not totally void of interaction due to group projects and group discussions during class. My only concern was that I wish there were more feedback available for us on our assignments/projects though I understand it was hard enough that the professors had to completely adapt their original teaching plan/format on a short notice. I also feel like quizzes and tests were made much easier than they normally would have been (as a result of being online AND the stresses of current situations).
Senior,4,"The relatively smaller class sizes compared to other universities make it much easier to communicate directly with professors. The professors I've experienced are typically excellent and generally care about their students (I can't speak for all departments and all professors though). The ""learn by doing"" approach is something they are proud of here. This place is especially great for those who enjoy the outdoors as there's plenty opportunities for hiking, going to the beach, and other means of being active. Diversity is one of the biggest concerns people have in coming here as it is a predominately white school so be aware of a potential culture shock if attending. Overall my educational experience has been great. Negatives also include the terribly high cost of mediocre off-campus apartments and terrible on-campus food."
Junior,4,Cal Poly is great in some majors and does not do very well in others which makes changing majors very difficult. Do not come here if you’re looking for a sports school. SLO is one of the most beautiful places on earth to live.
Sophomore,4,"This review is from a Cal Poly student who just finished freshman year. There's a lot going on at Cal Poly. The professors are helpful and want students to succeed. I'm still getting emails from a professor I had last year about advice when it comes to my major even though I am not emailing him back. The dorm life is pretty mediocre with the majority of the housing buildings being pretty old. The food is also mediocre and you eventually get tired of eating the same thing every week. There are, however, a lot of clubs and activities on around campus. You usually can always see something going on at Dexter Lawn in roughly the center of campus. Outside of SLO, the area is really beautiful for outdoor activities and there's also the farmer's market in downtown every Thursday night. I never got the chance to go."
Freshman,4,"I loved the atmosphere WOW provided when we came for Orientation. It really allows connections to occur so you feel more supported. The teachers seem to really care about us and how we are doing overall, not just in class. The courses are difficult but there are a lot of support systems to reach out to for help."
Freshman,4,"The courses are very rigorous and push students to excel to really understand the material. The hands-on philosophy provides another dimension to learning that is overall very useful. However, the student body itself isn't very diverse and can sometimes feel polarizing."
Graduate Student,4,"Great education, housing was also very good, but could use a lot of work when it comes to improving campus diversity."
Graduate Student,4,Took classes online during COVID-19 pandemic. Classes offered through zoom and were generally pretty well organized.
Senior,4,"Cal poly's unique motto of Learn by Doing is a great way for students to learn and stand out when applying to jobs or graduate school programs.  It allows students to develop skills no other university would provide. 
I would like to see Cal poly offer a more diverse set of graduate programs or concentrations for majors in STEM."
Freshman,4,i don’t know yet because i haven’t started school there yet but i will find out when i start school in the fall
Freshman,4,It’s a very nice campus but i haven’t started school there yet so i don’t know what my experience will be like
Niche User,4,"Cal Poly SLO has provided a lot of help in my college choosing, they tell me the benefits I would have ad honest Cons too."
Freshman,4,"There is so much to do here in SLO, especially outdoor adventures. The school has very challenging and rewarding academics through their Learn By Doing mentality."
Niche User,4,Our son started this past year in Math and Science.  It is an amazing school. The academics are rigorous.  Campus is big but very easy to navigate
Senior,4,"Cal Poly's lean by doing approach has been an amazing and practical way to develop new skills and experiences. The campus is an enjoyable environment and lives insides a wonderful and beautiful local community. The school, however suffers in terms of diversity and acceptance issues, but is working to improve."
Junior,4,It is a very beautiful campus and nice people but there is barely any diversity barely any minorities
Freshman,4,"I've been at Cal Poly for about 2 months, and my experience here has been really good so far. All my professors are very passionate about the subject they are teaching and are very dedicated to helping their students succeed. Having so many resources and services on campus is extremely helpful, especially for first year students. I know that if I ever feel lost, I can always go to the Academic Advising Center and get my questions answered. Living in the dorms has been a great experience as well. At first, I was afraid of sharing a room with another person, but it turned out to not be as bad as I thought. Cal Poly has definitely provided me with a safe and comfortable place to live in for my first year here. While there are many positive things I can say about my school, there are some changes I would like to see as well. For example, I wish there was more diversity on campus. I wish in the upcoming years, I will see more people from different backgrounds!"
Sophomore,4,"There are multiple reasons why I believe this is one of the better schools. In terms of academics, the vast majority of the professors are very knowledgable and are mainly here, not for research, rather to teach and help students. The motto of Cal Poly is ""Learn by doing"" which is, in my opinion, a very good way to learning some new subject. Then of course there is the student life which is great as well. There is about 400 clubs which should definitely give you the chance to find something you like. Finally, the town is very beautiful with lots of things to do."
Junior,4,"The weather is beautiful, stays around 70-80 degrees. San Luis Obispo has a lot of outdoor activities to offer such as hiking, kayaking, line dancing,etc. Also every Thursday there’s a farmer’s market that sells a lot of great food, fresh produce, and is a just a great way to tour downtown more. One thing I would like to see more is diverse food options, aside from Thai food, sushi, and Panda Express there’s not much variety of food to choose from."
Niche User,4,"Cal Poly is a definitely great campus. Near Pismo, we are one of the ""happiest towns on earth"". The students are great and the teachers are even greater. Although it's very competitive, each and every one of us strives to ensure each others success."
Junior,4,This school is heavily academically focused its hard to write a holistic review without talking to the whole student body but lots of people feel forgotten. There are major diversity issues among other issues. overall its a good school for the location and the academics
Sophomore,4,It is a very nice school. The campus is very large so it feels like you're exercise wherever you go. The great thing about Cal Poly is that the class sizes are smaller where you are able to get to know the professors more as well as get closer to some classmates. I wish there would be more diversity at the school but I know the school is working on that more. I hope to be able to be part of more clubs as well as attend more school events. Overall a great school and a great place for education.
Sophomore,4,Cal Poly SLO has great academics and a good student life.  For those who would like to be involved on campus there are many options and opportunities.  A large portion of the campus is based around outdoor activities which adds the culture of the student population.  I would like to see more diversity on campus and in classes.  As of right now there is a lot of education on diversity but with little action.  For a change to occur administration needs to make bigger actions.   I think that a good start to adding diversity on campus would be to begin with having a more diverse staff.  If the group of people running the university have a wider range of perspectives and knowledge more change would be seen campus wide.
Senior,4,"Cal Poly SLO keeps true to its motto of ""Learn by Doing"". Courses at this university give you hands on experience in your field of interest, which in turn, prepare you for your career more than students from other universities. Professors are extremely knowledgeable on the subjects they instruct. Unless you're an engineering, business, or math student, many of the buildings and facilities are outdated. The food on campus isn't that great either."
Junior,4,"Academics and job prospects are very good for almost students especially for those in an engineering or business field. Campus life is good, but if you're looking for big school spirit you won't find  it at Cal Poly SLO because of the lack of good sports especially in football. The party scene is pretty good as long as you're in Greek life. Most of the professors are good, but definitely pretty difficult courses."
Junior,4,"California Polytechnic University is a good school overall, however, the academics are fairly rigorous especially in stem and architecture. None the less, if you graduate, this school's name will help your career out a lot especially in California. Most other aspect of the school are good. Student life is fun, there are many things to do here, from sports, all the way to video games. There is something to do for everyone and you will never get bored here. I would recommend focusing more on sports and academics and less on you social life. While socialization is important, it should never interfere with your work life. Overall cal poly is a fun school but you will be pushed academically."
Junior,4,"The school has a great academic environment with everyone being competitive and passionate about their major, including the professors. However, there is a lack of cultural diversity which does make it difficult to fit into any type of party scene without being involved in sports or Greek life. When you make friends the school makes for a great college life with the location being close to so many natural picturesque beaches and shores."
Sophomore,4,We are very involved in diversity and making all students feel included. It starts at SLO days when students are placed in groups for two days in around July just to get our feet wet at Cal Poly. Then we have WOW week where we are in groups for a week and learn about many of the Poly activities and Poly pride. All this this gets students prepared for their first year at Cal Poly and gives them many ways to address their problems.
Sophomore,4,"Great classes and the Learn by Doing life is real! There are so many labs to choose from, especially if you are a STEM major. It is only 4 stars because campus food is not that great"
Junior,4,"While Cal Poly SLO excels in its academia, there is room for improvement in terms of its campus environment. I'd like to see more racial diversity and inclusivity on campus as well as additional resources for minorities."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the campus and everything SLO has to offer.  I also really like the way the program is run and how you are immersed into classes for your major right away.  This allows you to not only make sure you like what you are studying, but it also prevents you from getting bored of all the GE's.  The food on campus isn't the best, but they have been making some noticeable changes and will hopefully continue to do so.  A dining plan is required for freshman, but after that you do not have to worry about on campus food if you do not want to."
Sophomore,4,Thus far I've had a pretty good time at Cal Poly. The school has a lot of support programs and professors are generally helpful. The campus is beautiful if it weren't for all the construction but hey they're trying to improve. Food is terrible. Learn by doing is definitely ingrained in every program and you'll never hear the end of it.
Freshman,4,"It has a really nice atmosphere, and there 's always something to do here.  Great places to hike and roam around."
Junior,4,Overall I have had good experiences with this university. Most professors want to see you succeed and will go out of their way to help you if you're having a difficult time in life.
Freshman,4,"The view is amazing! And the ""learn by doing"" motto is perfect for my major which is civil engineering. The motto is truly reflected in the curriculum. Everyone is friendly and nice and so are the professors. The food is meh but it's improving."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love how my department treats everyone as a person and every professor is willing help all my peers. My department is the smallest at Cal Poly but nonetheless, so many of my professors have stuck their neck out for meetings with me. It's a great feeling knowing that your professors know you more than just a number. One thing I would like to see changed is getting into classes easier. I've had a difficulty getting some classes I need due to the high number of students at the school. This just makes it that much harder to finish on time. A few suggestions would be to increase the number of highly impacted classes or reduce the number of students coming into Cal Poly every year."
Junior,4,"The curriculum is of the highest standard, as are expectations for students. Do not be naive and think that because this is a state school that your classes will be easy or that your professors will be accomodating. ""Learn by doing"" is more of a learning to fail and then make up for it system. This can be great to get you to really do learning on your own, but for some it can be too hard to not have professors help you.  I just wish the professors cared more about student success than their own research. Dining has been revamped twice in my three years at Cal Poly but they have only refreshed the face of the dining places on campus and have done nothing to provide even mediocre quality food to their students. This is where the biggest improvements must be made, otherwise all students are already at a disadvantage when is comes to their success."
Freshman,4,"Very good school. Parking is horrible and the meal plans that freshmen have to be on is ridiculous. The new dorms are very nice, but those are the only good dorms. Classes are small and professors are helpful. SLO is a great city, but housing is expensive."
Freshman,4,I love the teaching by doing motto! I enjoy biking to school and being so close to the beach as well. The campus aesthetic and lack of vegan options is the only reason why I don't give it full stars
Junior,4,"The school has a lot of really great people who you can connect with and whose lives you can become a part of.  Many of the students are willing to look past the surface and get to know you.  Nearly all the Business professors I had were people who sincerely want you to succeed in education and life in general.  There are a lot of bad sides as well (blackface, stereotype Halloween, Greek life in general), but it doesn't have to make the experience bad."
Niche User,4,What I liked about Cal Poly SLO the most was how amazing the campus is! It is so beautiful and open. I always love spending time at the university. There is never a dull moment on campus!
Freshman,4,"I have had a great time getting to know the campus and the surrounding areas. The classes are not always easy to get into, but professors are engaging and care about what they teach."
Freshman,4,"So far, the professors, the dorms, the classes are pretty much going well. However, there are several things I would like to change is the food, the diversity, and the professors wanting to make their classes hard so the students do poorly on."
Niche User,4,"Cal Poly is a beautiful school and the teachers and classes are all very good. Considering the relatively low price to attend, the amount of people who are recruited for industry or go into high paying jobs is extremely high. While it is a public school and so may seem unsatisfactory, this school is extremely good for engineering students."
Niche User,4,So far it has been a great experience out here. I am majoring in engineering and the professors are great and I am understanding everything they are teaching me. I have met many people and made new friends. Sometimes it is pretty hard for a person who is new to an environment that they are not used to but the students on campus are really nice.
Freshman,4,Cal Poly is a great school that focuses on academics. There is a great community here between students.
Niche User,2,"I struggled here, Great College with a lot to offer. Excellent facilities and staff. I wasn't ready for College and needed guidance and counselling to choose my path forward. That guidance was not available to me on campus"
Alum,2,"I liked the education, not the school climate. I was a sociology major and most of my professors were brilliant, and fueled my love of learning. However, I am lesbian and a lot more than once, I felt uncomfortable as a minority at Calpoly. Most people are pretty accepting, but some aren't. There is a lot of closeted ignorance that comes out in different situations. With 54% of the student body being white and a good chunk of the student body being well off financially, the school has a weird climate. One of privilege. Don't come if you're a minority."
Sophomore,2,"California Polytechnic State University SLO has many positives and negatives. I truly fell the campus and town are beautiful and there are copious amounts of activities you can do. However, many instructors do not feel obligated to actually teach the material in an understanding manner. They usually rush through it and you have to do most of the learning outside the classroom on your own time.  Cal Poly also lacks diversity. It is predominately white with less than 2% black population. This is very concerning and makes the school feel as if it adheres to the white community. This school really needs to higher their diversity and start integrating  more cultural things onto their campus."
Freshman,2,"At Cal  Poly you can always find a good party, but trying to find diversity is hard. The school really tries to make minorities feel included but it singles them out even more. 

The professors are hit or miss."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, frat parties do not accept guys in any case, making all frat parties the fraternity and a lot of girls. There are a lot of fraternities, though, so it is, although difficult, altogether possible to join a fraternity and partake in said festivities. A word of caution, though, is that some fraternities are known to partake in, shall we say, unethical party behavior. The system needs to be changed."
College Sophomore,2,"I like that Greek life isn't huge, but there is a definite line drawn between Greeks and non-Greeks"
College Sophomore,2,There isn't that much diversity in ethnicity or economic background due to the area Cal Poly is located. It is so expensive to live here while going to school that discourages those with less money.
College Senior,2,"Campus housing in the towers is not that great. As an incoming freshman, I wish I had signed up to live in the red bricks, which are still not as spacious or nice as the Poly Canyon Village (PCV) apartments. However, PCV is very far away from campus, so I wouldn't recommend living there as a freshman either."
College Junior,2,"Huge binge-drinking issue on campus, if you don't drink you're left out"
College Freshman,2,The cost is too expensive. This isn't resort style living.
College Sophomore,2,The apartments and towers are the best. The redbricks are horrible. Having a triple in the redbricks should not be allowed. The windows let in minimal ventilation and gets very stuffy. The restrooms are disgusting due to the behavior of the students not knowing how to clean up after themselves.
College Sophomore,2,"Cal Poly seems to me to put a lot more investment and time into being more of an academic school than athletics. This doesn't mean anything bad about the school, but it is just different."
College Student,2,"The Greek life at Cal Poly has a pretty bad rap. There's been sexual assault incidents and a lot of sexism. I try to avoid anything that has to do with Greek life event wise. The people in greek life tend to have a better-than-thou attitude, but I know they also do great things for our community."
College Freshman,2,Most of the sports teams are not very good.  The crowd is not very large.  It is one of Cal Poly's drawbacks.
College Senior,2,"I'm pretty biased against the Greek Life on campus, but I have my reasons. I'm sure there are pros of joining Greek Life such as the sisterhood/brotherhood and networking events. However, the sororities and fraternities at my school have gotten themselves in trouble many times for excessive partying, incidents of date rape, and party drugs. 

Greek Life is on campus at Cal Poly, except for the few fraternities and sororities that have been kicked out. The fraternities have a slightly more positive reputation than the sororities. Every weekend, at least one fraternity throws a party or two. I discovered that those events are mainly popular for freshmen and sophomores. Most people, like me, get burnt out after their first year. I've been told by guy friends that many join fraternities because it's hard for guys to get into parties. Most of the fraternities seem pretty normal and the members blend in well with non-Greeks in the school. I can only think of one or two fraternities that are extremely cliquey and the members don't get along well with non-Greeks. 

Sororities at my school are for a very specific type of girl. Unfortunately, it's the type that movies and other social media portray. There are strict rules about the appearance the girls have to have, which includes the color and style of their hair, the clothes and colors they wear, and how they present themselves. To many non-Greeks, the sorority life seems cult-like. The gals in sororities seem to be okay with their life-style though, so I'm sure they have a more positive outlook on it."
College Freshman,2,"The soccer team here is great, but there's not much school spirit going around."
College Freshman,2,Greek life seems like a cult on this campus that almost everyone is part of.
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the on campus housing are inconveniently far from classes and dining. From my experience, I had to take long walks in order to get food when I was hungry. Most of the dorms are ugly and lack space in their rooms. The social atmosphere depends on the type of housing, whether it be an on campus apartment or dorm; it also depends on the people living there. The social experience differs for everyone."
College Freshman,2,"Housing experience varies greatly from dorm to dorm, most people in PCV/North mountain seem to have very negative experiences while those in the Redbricks and towers are generally positive."
College Freshman,2,Don't expect to go to ANY parties (regardless of your year) unless you rush. Most of the fraternities/sororities seem to have a pretty negative image among the rest of the student population.
College Freshman,2,"Soccer, basketball, and baseball seem to be big, but the rest of the programs (including football) seem pretty small relative to other schools."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus housing is terrible, but they're building new dorms"
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are good, but the bathrooms are terrible"
College Junior,2,There are not a lot of good options. A lot of places also have bad landlords that only care about money. Parking is also pretty bad. The housing is relatively close to campus and I am able to walk or ride my bike so I love that! It is very costly to live here.
College Freshman,2,"The food options aren't great, but I love using Plus Dollars at Starbucks, Einsteins, and Jamba Juice."
College Freshman,2,"The food is so average hurts. Plus, there's many stories of people getting food poisoning."
College Freshman,2,"When I was a freshman, we had no healthy options."
College Sophomore,2,"I was not impressed with Campus Housing. I was put in a dorm I didn't select, and was very unhappy. I got in trouble for things I didn't do."
College Freshman,2,it seems like they try to make the food taste bad at Metro. the food options don't really change.
College Freshman,2,"Very different experiences than a lot of other schools, very little emphasis on real philanthropy/academic rigor (lots of photo ops for show, though)."
College Freshman,2,"If you're a guy who isn't in Greek life, your chance of getting into a party is basically zero. I've seen groups with maybe a dozen girls and one guy where the guy's still turned away at the door. For girls, you're treated like prey. The goal is to get you as drunk and pliant as possible."
College Freshman,2,I feel like it makes me sick pretty often and it gets really boring eating the same things over and over again.
College Freshman,2,"There's been a lot of bad publicity recently involving fraternities, some are worse than others. Greek houses can vary between nice to bare"
College Freshman,2,"the way administration approaches the party scene at cal poly is all wrong. The off campus housing is not well maintained and every time there is a party out of hand, they immediately put greek life on social probation."
College Freshman,2,"It's tough finding something actually appealing, especially healthy options. The few good quality places have very little selection (though I have not personally tried all possible restaurants), so you quickly get tired of them. For available vegetables? Only various forms of salad."
College Freshman,2,Campus food is bad but it could be worse.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is superficial and harbors underage drinking and dangerous activity.
College Sophomore,2,Usually everything comes out to be more expensive than living on-campus. Alot of people don't know that off-campus has 12-month lease and on-campus has 8-month leases.
College Sophomore,2,"I've gone party hopping downtown and got charged several times (I'm a guy). If you're a girl obviously it's more fun, but as a guy it's not worth it. Chico is alot better, but they are getting really scary with drug and gang violence. It's better to stay in your apartment or dorm and go drink and smoke at split tree and enjoy the view."
College Freshman,2,There are a few good places to go on campus. I live in the dorms and the closest thing to my dorm is VGs.
College Freshman,2,"For an agricultural school, there is almost no fresh fruit available. I often resort to going to the frozen yogurt outlet on campus to fill a cup up with strawberries and blue berries."
College Freshman,2,"Ask any student attending Cal Poly SLO, and they will all agree that the food is sub-par.  Most of the dining halls serve questionable food that leave most students feeling sick to their stomachs, and it's difficult to find healthy options."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus food could definitely use an improvement, however the university has recognized this and is slowly implementing changes"
College Freshman,2,The food is just plain bad. I've felt sick just eating it and several of my friends have gotten food poisoning from it. The food is not always cooked thoroughly and they serve the same food at pretty much all of the dining options.
College Junior,2,Can't find a spot to live.
College Junior,2,Go to the secret herb garden.
College Junior,2,The food is not at all good.
College Freshman,2,"I am a vegetarian, and although there is a claim that there are many options for us, there are none that have a healthy side to them. Most of the year I have been spending excess money at many different grocery stores to supplement my diet, while I cannot choose a different, lower costing meal plan. The school is taking all of my parents money while I never eat any of the food. I think that this is very unfair and that the meal plans should have a much different structure to allow for people with special diets to have more flexibility."
College Freshman,2,"Cal Poly students tend to be pretty similar. Ethnic diversity is rare, but diversity is more than just skin color (as everyone here likes to say). Political beliefs vary, as do religion. Being gay I can speak to the LGBTQ atmosphere, which is lacking. Steps are being done to improve it, but if you identify LGBTQ and are planning on finding a giant accepting population with a huge dating pool, look at another school. Theres plenty of other strong STEM colleges with a better queer atmosphere. Cal Poly's policies are generally mid 1980's, and I don't see any large changes coming soon."
College Freshman,2,Greek life has a bad reputation here due to many incidents.
College Junior,2,There needs to be more variety.
College Sophomore,2,Campus food is mostly used as an as needed basis. If you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle there is not many options on campus. I only eat there when i am stuck on campus all day.
College Senior,2,"The rooms are super small, the RA's are over barring and make you feel like a child, and the cleaning people make more of a mess than they clean, plus the apartments are long walk from any classes."
College Senior,2,"I don't go out and party or drink, so I don't know what the party scene is like here."
College Sophomore,2,"Renting off campus is cheaper than PCV but not that much cheaper. If you don't party, it would probably be better to just live on campus. If you have a car and are willing to commute, there are cheaper, not-as-shitty housing options in Atascadero and Grover Beach."
College Senior,2,"Our administration puts way too much emphasis, especially lately, on anti-part initiatives."
College Sophomore,2,"It's hard switching majors. When applying to the college you must declare a major which is good and bad. Good because you can start classes toward your major quickly, but if you don't like the major, it takes effort to change."
College Sophomore,2,"It's extremely expensive and usually just run down and crowded, and they force you to buy a meal plan to eat their bad food with the housing."
College Sophomore,2,"Several of my friends and I have had food poisoning from the uncooked and ill-prepared meat. Everything is low quality and most students found it disgusting. Although, we couldn't complain, it's all we had to eat when we were hungry. Thankfully, there is Starbucks and Subway to satisfy our hunger."
College Sophomore,2,most of the campus is white. it is actually something the school and students comment on a lot. they almost act like being white at the school is wrong. people are genuinely angry that the school is not diverse.
Senior,1,"Spare yourself the 4 years of trauma that come with attending this university. If you aren't white or christian, you are an outsider, and the student body and administration will make sure you feel that way every day you walk on campus. With the administration turning a blind eye to incredibly obvious acts of racism (fraternity brothers in blackface and dressed as cholos with teardrops drawn under their eyes and expletives on their arms, and flyers posted around campus giving ""scientific proof"" as to why black people are subhuman -- you can google these incidences, they made national news) and masking them as ""free speech,"" this university endlessly perpetuates the vicious cycle of racism. They also invite speakers that seek to take women's rights and access to healthcare away by ""making abortion illegal again."" I will not be looking back on my time here fondly. Please share this message with any- and everyone you care about. DO NOT GO HERE. There are prestigious programs elsewhere."
Sophomore,1,This school sucks I am currently a second year here. All of the admin/staff/student service people are so vastly unhelpful and know nothing. Registering for classes is so much harder then it should be. I once got sent across campus to four different places just to have one simple question answered and it still wasn’t really. Ridiculous and definitively not worth the money. Also the students here kind of suck.
Niche User,1,"What they advertise is wildly different from what it's really like. Felt unsafe even in my own dorm room with the door locked. Friend received death threats. University is indifferent to criticism, only gives fraternities light slap on the wrist for rampant misogyny and racism. Only cares about university image, students be damned.
If I could give a negative amount of stars I would. Don't apply unless you're a white cishet male."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In my years at Cal Poly, Greek Life has been a main source of problems for the University. While many individuals in the Greek system are doing positive things for their community, the overall message Greek Life sends out seems to be destructive. Non-Greek students tend to view Greek students as perpetuating the stereotype of drunken, inappropriate, party-goers."
College Freshman,1,I have a strong opinion against greek life and I think that most of the problems on campus could be solved if there wasn't a greek system
College Freshman,1,"Feels like only straight, rich, Christian, white people go to this school."
College Freshman,1,"This school feels very close-minded. There is VERY little diversity, it's rare to find creative students or classes, and the county is trying to get rid of their ""college town"" reputation by shutting down every party with a noise complaint and monitoring the dorms often. The food is terrible but you are forced to get a meal plan for your first year and they will not refund any leftover money. If you try to take classes outside of your major they will warn you to get back on track or they make registering for the next quarter impossible for you, which doesn't make any sense. If you are not successful at this school, it is very obvious that they want you to leave."
College Sophomore,1,A lot of people drink. If you don't drink you might feel left out but it depends on your personality
College Freshman,1,There are mainly white people on campus.
College Freshman,1,Almost impossible to enroll in my required classes
College Sophomore,1,"Poor quality, and poor health options."
College Freshman,1,"So awful. Be prepared to either gain weight or starve. Regardless of which you choose, you'll constantly feel like crap. It's truly shameful how bad the meal plan is here."
College Freshman,1,Actually want to puke at most of the food on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Honestly this is such a great school but the food is terrible. Wannabe Mexican food is bland and tasteless.
College Freshman,1,Honestly its really bad. Although its SLOWLY getting better.
College Sophomore,1,Terrible food quality and dinning set up
College Sophomore,1,Campus dining is the worst aspect of freshman year.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining is possibly the worst part of freshman year. VGs is the most convenient and most frequented place to get food, but is horrendous quality. Metro is buffet style, decent food at times. Einstein is far away from the dorms, but easily the best quality."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is expensive and scare.  The parking authority is very strict.  However, the bus system is good and I would recommend using that."
College Junior,1,"I take the bus this year because the permit cost is outrageous and there is never parking. Most of my friends come to school an hour early because it'll take them that long to find a spot. If an on-campus event is planned, the likelihood of finding a spot is nonexistent. Why are we paying this much if we can't even use the lots the permits allow us to?"
College Freshman,1,"Coming to college, I now partake in alcohol consumption, mostly because of observed peer pressure."
College Freshman,1,"There is always lots of nightlife to join in in SLO, whether it's underage nightlife or going to bars and clubs."
College Freshman,1,I am changing schools because of the lack of creative room in the program and for the fact that I do not want to be a graphic designer for the rest of my life.
College Freshman,1,There is very little ethnic diversity on campus and in the general San Luis Obispo area. It is difficult and easy to feel very out of place as a minority myself.
College Freshman,1,I have not received or found any scholarships for this school
College Freshman,1,"Not a fan of Greek life and all they do is party, so if that's what you're into, hang out with those kinds of people"
College Freshman,1,Seriously hate the Frats around here. They don't let any guys into parties and creep on all the girls
College Freshman,1,"The only thing I dislike about Cal Poly is on-campus dining. Its actually awful. I didn't believe it coming in, but I sure do now."
College Senior,1,"Campus housing lacks any concern for the students and focuses on cramming the maximum number of students (specifically freshman) into dorms and apartments.  They specifically like freshman because they are required to pay for an expensive meal plan and are offered less financial aid.  They are the most profitable.  As a side note, I also work for campus housing and get an inside look at how ridiculous the housing department is."
College Senior,1,"Mostly white middle/upper class republicans. I've seen the same 10 black kids on campus in four years at Cal Poly. A few hispanic and asian kids, but not many."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking here isn't that great. There is a lot of traffic on campus depending on the time of day. You have to give yourself about 30 mins to find parking on campus and park pretty far away from your class. So at that rate you might as well walk or ride the bus. The bus is free with your Poly Card, I park my car a couple blocks from campus and ride the bus to school which drops you off at the Library or the PAC Center- two locations that are pretty central to everything on campus. Way faster and more efficient."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining sucks. It is doable, but just barely. The university affiliated options do not taste too great, and the remaining places are mostly fast food. in addition, the markets on campus are ridiculously over priced. although cal poly does host an einsteins and jamba juice, those options are all the way in pcv and require a very inconvenient trek. The only positives on campus are the starbucks and chik-fil-a. to be honest, dining is probably the only bad aspect to such a wonderful school."
College Student,1,"The campus dining program here is well below average!  If you are at all used to nice food where you come from, or simply want to eat something that doesn't have the potential of giving you food poisoning, be prepared!  VG's Cafe is the absolute worst.  The other dining facilities are actually alright, but be aware of VG's!  It is completely student-run, so the service, quality, and preparation are terrible.  There are so many articles in the papers and online about how Cal Poly needs to reform their dining facilities, simply Google it.  Otherwise, the food is fine at other places but for the most part it is definitely not worth the money."
College Sophomore,1,Terrible Campus Food... Subway boosted grade to D-
College Sophomore,1,There is practically no diversity along with this school being very conservative. makes it hard for me to fit in. it is like 90 percent white people.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Dining is AWFUL! but luckily they have added some chain stores that making living on campus as a Freshman easier. Campus now has two Starbucks, a subway, Jamba Juice, Einsteins, Peet's Coffee and they are opening up a food court in a new building next year. "
College Sophomore,1,"Most of SLO is predominantly Caucasian.  Of course, there is also plenty of other different races, but they are very minuscule compared to the population of white people here."
College Freshman,1,"Campus food is horrible!  There is very little diversity in the foods they serve and I often feel sick after leaving the dining hall.  You can get good food with plus dollars at Subway or Jamba Juice or a drink at Starbucks, but they do not take meals."
College Sophomore,1,"Many options, but almost all are unappetizing and all are poor quality. Resorted to the salad bar most of the year. We're an agricultural school but our on-campus dining is disgusting."
College Sophomore,1,"If diversity is what you're looking for then Cal Poly SLO might not be for you. However, there aren't any problems with having beliefs that differ from others.  I am of Mexican descent and have not experienced any problems with other students regarding my ethnicity."
College Sophomore,1,"The value of campus dining is horrible. Everything is overpriced, except Subway. The quality of the food is average at best. There are very few vegetarian options other than a salad bar."
College Freshman,1,"The dining areas that you can use your meals at are horrific. The only place with decent food is Subway, Einstein's, Jamba, or The Avenue. Everywhere I else I will not even step foot in."
College Freshman,1,I've heard a lot of people talk about smoking weed and drinking alcohol in their dorms without getting caught.
Recent Alumnus,1,there is absolutely no diversity at Cal Poly and they are fully aware of that fact.
College Senior,1,"On campus dining is gross, but it is also part of the Cal Poly freshman experience, and at least there is the new RecCenter which makes it easy for you to work it all off. Its been a few years since I had to eat on campus so things may have improved. Back when I was a freshman the best place was Sandwich Factory. If you have a lot of extra plus dollars at the end of the year, be a good person buy other people their food, or their Starbucks, also head out to the store in PCV to get some kitchen supplies for your future living situations."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cal Poly is predominantly a white university. There is some diversity, but not enough."
College Sophomore,1,"All White Caucasians – If you are looking for somewhere that is 90 percent white students from California then you've come to the right place. Every race and ethnicity is present, but not as much as you would like to see. Very few hispanics and african americans, decent amount of asians."
College Sophomore,1,"Pretty Rigorous Academically – In a place that is so beautiful and has so much to offer, Cal Poly tries to keep its students indoors studying as much as possible. 2 quarters of academic probation (lower than a 2.0) could get you recommended for dismissal from the school. Engineers graduate with a gpa close to a 2.0, I don't know how they handle the pressure. Alcohol is prohibited on campus, and some police officers will even write you up for having alcohol in your system while walking back to your house."
College Senior,1,"Hard to Party...Ticket Free – There are laws in SLO that should not be applicable to any college town. Unruly gatherings of 20+ people, fines doubled during holiday weekends, noise violation standards, bike cops car cops foot cops. WOW is not how it used to be because of the cops cracking down on any type of social gathering. Of course, law enforcement should help and help prevent the horrible cases of alcohol poisoning concentrated during WOW and the first weekends of school, but are taking unnecessary measures that are infringing on the school's social nightlife...and college experience. 
That being said, students do find one way or another to beat the system and throw successful parties, but do so with caution..or just go to bars!"
College Senior,1,"There is honestly VERY little diversity at Cal Poly. I know a handful of non-whites, but they are few and far between. I could count on one hand how many diverse races I know personally. I would also so religions are fairly not diverse. I know there is a strong Christian movement on campus, but I havent heard much about anything else."
College Senior,1,I don't know what good things to say about parking really...it's empty in the mornings and that's when I usually come to campus.
College Junior,1,"No Divesity – Cal Poly is literally the whitest school and SLO is literally the whitest town you will ever visit.  No one is racist or anything it is just how it is.  Look up the statistics and I think our campus is .9% African-American, so not even 1%.  As a whole it is around 70 some % white and that is all you see."
College Sophomore,1,"If You Don't Need It, Don't Bring It – 1) Parking space is difficult to find
2) There are only a few parking spaces and all of them are on the edge of campus
3) You will be fined for doing the smallest of things (and quite a bit)

The only good thing I can say is that if you're living on campus, the parking is close and the parking passes don't cost a lot of money."
College Freshman,1,"Although there isn't very much diversity on campus, this does not mean people are not accepting.  Since there is a lack of diversity, many people appreciate the small amount we have."
College Freshman,1,"The food at V.G.'s is pretty good in spite of its bad reputation, though the Mexican food is pretty bad. It's also slightly overpriced. Metro seems like to best deal but the quality varies from mediocre to downright bad."
College Junior,1,"I think the biggest problem with off-campus dining, at least for students, is the fact that there are no drive throughs. Many of my friends complain that after a long night of studying, they just want to be able to drive and grab something to eat, without getting out of their car. If there were drive through's in San Luis Obispo it would definately benefit students and help them get through studying and not have to worry about ordering their food, going in and waiting for it to be done."
Recent Alumnus,1,"almaost $100 every 10 weeks... living in dorms or suites give you walking distance, but a problem when you leave for off-campus activities.  University Village - ample parking."
College Freshman,1,"Parking passes cost 94 dollars a quarter, and even if you own a parking pass, you still need to arrive 20-30 minutes before your class to assure you have a parking space."
College Junior,1,"Parking Pass? I'd Rather Go to a Concert – Do not get me started on how expensive I have to leave my car in the valley sun. It is excruciatingly hot. It seems like everyone likes to park close, why not get some exercise. We do have two legs."
College Senior,1,"The lack of ethnic and racial diversity at Cal Poly is quite possibly its most unfortunate aspect. My school is overwhelmingly Caucasian. I hope in the future Cal Poly is able to become a more diverse campus because it is truly a great place and would only benefit with more ethnic, religious, and cultural representation."

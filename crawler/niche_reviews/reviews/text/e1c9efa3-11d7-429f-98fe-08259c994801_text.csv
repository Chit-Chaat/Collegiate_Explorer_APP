Freshman,5,The teachers are amazing and understand that this is a tough time! They are here for you and do their best to make sure that you understand what is being taught! They give more time if needed and are always open for zoom calls.
Freshman,5,BYU Hawaii is an amazing school to attend online or in-person! I have found that the teachers are there for my best interest and reply very fast! They make learning fun and answer any questions you have. Also when Hawaii is open it is always fun to relax at the beach!
Junior,5,"I love the diversity in this school. You learn of so many different cultures and discover countries that you never knew existed. The Aloha Spirit is evident on campus wherever you go, with smiles that enlighten your day. Due to COVID, campus is closed but you still feel the aloha spirit radiating through your zoom calls and virtual meetings. There is pretty much nothing I would change about this school, for it makes you feel at home."
Junior,5,The system that we are using is exquisite. Even though I do prefer face to face than online. The staff and faculty are doing their very best to meet our needs.
Sophomore,5,"With the new learning style due to the outbreak of COVID-19, they've helped take a lot of stress off our shoulders with being understanding and flexible. Super grateful for staff members that help make an getting an education less of a burden and stress!"
Sophomore,5,"Professors are very understanding and flexible. With the new learning style due to the outbreak of COVID-19, they've helped take a lot of stress off our shoulders with being understanding and flexible. Super grateful for staff members that help make an getting an education less of a burden and stress!"
Freshman,5,"Teachers are very nice and understanding. The school gives you tons of resources for school projects, essays and research. It seems they really care about our success as students and as people."
Freshman,5,Teachers are doing the best they can and are very understanding at these times which is much needed.
Alum,5,"A lot of mainland kids think that BYU-Hawaii is a party school a.k.a easy going when it comes to academics, but it is actually difficult to get an A or even B if you slack off."
Alum,5,BYU-Hawaii is a diverse university with students coming from all parts of the world. Professors are highly qualified and knowledgeable in their expertise.
Senior,5,"BYU - Hawaii is a great place to study and meet a lot of students from all over the world. The campus is also close to the places where we can meditate or hang out with friends like the Polynesian Cultural Center, the beaches, hikes, and many more. As soon as you arrive on the campus you will feel the ""Aloha"" the love or their welcome to you. In the campus everyone is ""Ohana"" family and there is only small chance of being homesick because you will meet your new Ohana here. The only thing that I want to add or change is BYU Hawaii should have more possible courses and I wish it offers graduate programs too."
Alum,5,"It has great value. The tuition is insanely subsidized, and you get to study in Hawaii. They have a merit scholarship program where if you get decent grades, you automatically get part or all of your tuition waived, depending on how high your cumulative GPA is: (3.650 - 3.749 = 1/4 Tuition scholarship, 3.750 - 3.849 = 1/2 Tuition scholarship, 3.850 - 3.949 = 3/4 Tuition scholarship, 3.950 - 4.0	Full Tuition scholarship). Also, the school isn't that academically competitive.

Basically, if you get good grades and work part-time, you can graduate debt-free.

That being said, make sure that they have your major because the school is small, so they don't have every program. If they don't have your major, you could always go there to get your general ed requirements done, and then you could transfer to another school. A lot of my classmates did that, but I ended up graduating from BYUH.

I'm definitely glad I went there.

It's a religious school, so alcohol/drugs aren't allowed."
Niche User,5,I love the culture and the spirit of aloha. BYU Hawaii offers a welcoming and richly diverse environment filled with beautiful scenery and beautiful people. The small class sizes are conducive to one on one learning with educated and caring professors. The student activities are frequent and enjoyable. I am so excited to attend and embark on the adventure of a life time.
Junior,5,"I like the Iwork program about the school to help international students have a better education. I had the privilege to work a PCC which is right next door and to experience the different cultures of the islands was just amazing. Byuh is such a diverse university that makes one's boundaries to be stretched. I learned to understand others from different backgrounds. The school is amazing, it is remoted but since the school only has 2500 students, the interactions with the teachers are more personalized. Sammler than usual campus, it provides a good education in a learning and happy environment."
Sophomore,5,I am an international student I have been here for 1 year 7 months. I love this school. It is safe spiritually and the education system is really good. Perfect place to finish what you started.
Freshman,5,I love that I feel included in every aspect of this college. The staff treats me with the utmost respect and are considerate of many things. The environment of this college is very welcoming and friendly. The diversity is astonishing on this campus.
Senior,5,"It is great school for those who are used to close community type of environment. It is a small school, underrated accounting and entrepreneurship academic program."
Freshman,5,The family feeling at Brigham Young University- Hawaii is unparalleled. I feel connected and loved. I feel at home even though I am thousands of miles away from my home.
Sophomore,5,I love my time here at BYUH! My only complaint is administration is slow and unresponsive. Housing is also a big issue
Sophomore,5,"It is small in terms of space, but it is very diverse and a very loving environment between all the students from all over the world with great Professors, leaders and a great and loving community (La'ie). A place that has no place for racism etc but, very focused on the building up of each student in becoming great leaders in both spiritually and nationally."
Niche User,5,very nice university. such a nice diverse feel. people from everywhere come and share their background. really stunning.
Junior,5,"BYU-Hawaii is a very diverse school to be in. Most of the students are from all around the world. I feel that students who graduate from here are more likely to be hire around the world because of the diversity of the school. Also, most of the students work at the Polynesia Cultural Center which is an advantage for HTM students"
Niche User,5,"Aloha!!! I'm a return missionary. I love new education. "" ENTER TO LEARN GO FORTH TO SERVE "" that is my dream. I had been learn for 2 years BYUH distance class. It gave light to my life. I've never been to Hawaii before. But I feel and know that BYU Hawaii campus,  class,  Laie  Hawaii Temple, Polynesian cultural center and Worlds largest Tide pool etc...That's amazing peace and holy place.
In my life One of my biggest goal was to study in  BYU Hawaii. I sincerely want to learn to go there."
Sophomore,5,"This is the most amazing school. Every professor has been wonderful and there is a spirit on this campus unlike anywhere I have been. I have met students from all over the world. Because the student body is not large, students are able to make friends easily. Night life is nonexistent but who needs it when we have so many cool things to do during the day. Also the beach is a 5 minute walk which is a plus. There are no sports whatsoever, Seasider Sport intramurals are terrible and unorganized. P.S housing is completely unaccommodating. BUT In all I love it here:)"
Niche User,5,This is a wonderful school. The diversity and opportunity to experience many different cultures is just one of the many great things about this school. Hawaii is also such a wonderful place to live.
Alum,5,"BYU-Hawaii gave me the most unique and well-rounded education I could ask for. With an intimate student body coming from over 70 countries, the one on one learning I was able to get, and highly trained faculty, it allowed me to cater my education and degree to exactly what I wanted and needed for the career that I want to pursue. I thoroughly enjoyed my learning there and felt challenged to do better and be better in every way."
Freshman,5,This is totally my dream school. I even like the Honor Code since it makes campus extremely safe. Though I do wish they'd change certain provisions in it. Very beautiful location and I like my teachers. Getting a part-time job is easy. LOW TUITION
Freshman,5,"Brigham Young University-Hawaii is an amazing college. Students at BYUH represent over 70 countries from around the world, making BYUH one of the most diverse campuses in America. It's a very unique experience to go to school with students from such different backgrounds. I get to learn about cultures and countries I knew nothing about before coming to college. Aside from the students, BYUH is a great place for learning. The class sizes are small, which gives students the opportunity to make connections and interact more with each other and teachers. Teachers are truly interested in helping students succeed. I have been able to form close relationships with my teachers. I talk with them often on how to better prepare for my future and they are able to help me figure out the best path to meet my goals."
Sophomore,5,I love BYU Hawaii. There is such a wonderful spirit here. Everyone is happy and says hello as you pass by. Some days it might be rainy but a lot of the time its sunny. the staff is great and the food isn't bad. It's so diverse and you get to meet people from all different parts of the world. You meet people you would have never met before
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my experience here! It had smaller classes, which meant that the professors were better able to connect with the students, and I felt that they wanted to get to know us, our challenges and how to best help us succeed as students. The campus itself is beautiful and provides many places to study, inside or outside in the beauty of Hawaii. Living on campus is nice because there is a small shopping strip about 20 minutes away, so it’s the best of both worlds. A short walk to and from class, and work if you work on campus, as well as a short walk to local off campus shopping facilities. There is also a bus system that is fairly cheap if one wants to explore the island or travel to larger shopping facilities like Walmart. One of my favorite things is the diversity of the students body. I could walk down the main hallway of the main building and hear many different languages, which was amazing!"
Junior,5,"Brigham Young University-Hawaii is one of the most culturally diverse schools in the world. It has a beautiful campus on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii and has been helping improve the world one student at a time. It is very affordable and for a good reason. It caters to the students in the Asian and Pacific Regions on the world with the purpose of educating them so they will be strong influences when they return home to their native countries. BYU-H has a huge focus on the business programs in order to build up economies around the world through teaching students to create and follow their passions and dreams."
Junior,5,This is an amazing university. There is so much robleanr from professors who really care about individual students and from the generally kind and very culturally diverse student population. Right now the school is working on many campus improvements which is very needed I think. It would be great If some more degree or class options were made avaliable
Sophomore,5,"Such an amazing school, with great diversity. There are so many opportunities for grow, meet new people, and make unforgettable memories. Plus you're in the most beautiful place in the world, so who can complain about that?"
Sophomore,5,"Brigham Young University - Hawaii is a school that is very very diverse. There are several students from Asia,  the Pacific, the U.S and everywhere. In this school, you feel like you belong with everyone else. No one is above the other. Everyone is treated equally. It may be owned by the Church however students are free to act in their own ways but they must uphold the standards of the school. Most of the students feel protected in this school. The professors are really helpful and their teaching strategies are excellent. Other from academics, there are beaches around or near the campus. It is a good place to visit when after all the stress from school happen. I am grateful that I am here to invest in my education so that one day I can be able to help someone else succeed or reach out and help others who need me."
Senior,5,I have loved my experience at BYU Hawaii. I am from the mainland and adjusting to life on the islands was difficult at first. I grew to love the school and its teachers. I love the cultural diversity and the small classes that allow for a more personal leaning experience.
Freshman,5,Brigham Young University- Hawaii is a great school to study. There are over 70 different nationalities studying in this campus. This school promote diversity and equality. All of the professors are friendly. They have a big emphasis on balancing spiritual and secular learning.
Sophomore,5,I loved the great amount of diversity in the students at Brigham Young University-Hawaii as it really helped to open my eyes to the different cultures and ways of life outside fo North America. I really enjoyed getting to meet individuals with such unique background and unique personalties. This helped to shape my worldview and gain perspective as an individual.
Graduate Student,5,"The best part about BYU-Hawaii are the opportunities for intercultural interactions.  There are people from 75 different countries represented, and a student can learn quite about about themselves and others through this.  Classes are also small, which means that a student can have a relationship with their teacher.  All of my teachers knew my name and my goals.  This was incredibly important for getting letters of recommendation."
Freshman,5,I love Brigham Young University Hawaii mainly for the diverse culture on campus and having people from multiple countries and background being able to sit at the same table and have a conversation while having dinner. I love that the school encourages positive standards for the students which keeps them safe and makes the environment a comfortable one to learn and grow/.
Junior,5,"I love BYUH! Class sizes are small which allows for a lot of opportunities to do cool things in your major. The faculty are so willing to help and work with you. It also does not hurt that the school is located on Oahu! There are so many things to do at the beach, in the mountains, or in town. I've been swimming with dolphins more than I can count! And this school offers no shortage of awesome people to do things with! The student body is made up if kids from all over the world but most predominantly from Asia and the Pacific. As a church school it is pretty incredible to see the different perspectives that your peers have on different topics and discussions have always been welcome in the classes I have taken. It is really a unique place to go to school and I absolutely love it!"
Senior,5,My experience here at BYUH is indescribable and I have never being in such a safe environment before like being on this campus. The diversity is one biggest great thing about it where everyone loves and share their culture with each others. Academically is very high and all that I dreamed for is in this university. If  I want my children to go to the university I would love to send them to Brigham Young University Hawaii because I know it's a better yet a safer place for them where I don't need to worry about them.
Freshman,5,"Byu Hawaii is a dream come true.
I love! It is a safe, honest, happy university that really cares about your success. It also has a large number of foreign students, which makes it special and I can call it from my home.
Coming here was not easy, nor fast, that's why I take advantage every day and I appreciate this opportunity to be here.
This is my first semester, and because of being the first, recently arrived in Hawaii and several expenses, I am applying for this scholarship that would help me to settle down and sleep peacefully.
ByuHawaii offers several scholarships, but it is after the first semester.
I will be very grateful to be lucky to win it.
Thank you for the opportunity!
I know that education is important and of great value."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the hands in experience.  The price of this college is cheaper than any I been to. I have experienced teachers who are willing to help with the progression of the students. The teachers are willing to be open minded when A student is struggling with turning assignments in late, I just needed to let them know ahead of time. Most of the students I know are goal driven and know what they want out of life."
Alum,5,"I loved attending this school, however I realize that it is absolutely not the school for everyone. I loved how diverse it was, with students, staff and faculty represented from all over the world. I believe that this aspect of the school makes it a unique learning environment, where I was able to further my education, continue learning about my religion, and learn about diverse cultures and ways of thinking."
Niche User,5,Everyone there is very nice and friendly and of course the campus and the area around the campus is absolutely breathtaking. Also parents of students who have previously went there have said that they loved it and would go back if they could.
Alum,5,Great faculty and student life. The professors really care about your education and want you to succeed. The university provides many activities for the students as well as encourages student participation in campus wide activities and events.
Freshman,5,I have loved being at student at BYUH. It is a small campus but the area and the student body have a lot to offer. Strong LDS culture and values.
Sophomore,5,"Byu Hawai'i campus is one of the most, if not the most diverse college's in the world. Students from all over the world, dozens of countries it's not hard to fall in love with BYUH. The campus is small but the education you receive  and life in Hawai'i is something that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Truly an unforgettable experience."
Senior,5,BYU-Hawaii offers a small student to faculty ratio that leads to a higher learning than at other universities. The Peacebuilding program is one of a kind and should be a reason to attend.
Senior,5,"I love it here. I love my classmates and the professors. This school is so diverse and I have the opportunity to become more familiar with different cultures. Because this school has a very small student body, I have had so many experiences I wouldn't have at a large university. I have worked as a tutor for math as well as physics, participated in intramurals, and stay active in my church."
Sophomore,5,"BYU-Hawaii is is set on a beautiful campus tucked away from the crowds that plague much of Oahu. Located on the North Shore, it hugs the sea and nearby mountains, with many beaches and waterfalls within walking distance. 

As for academics, class sizes are generally small and professors work hard to get to know students on an individual basis. The student body itself is rather small, less than 3,000 total, but very diverse. More than 70 countries are represented at the school, which gives students the opportunity to learn from many different cultures. 

The school is a church funded institution, sponsored by the LDS Church and students are expected to abide by it's honor code. However, the rules at this school seem to be more relaxed than those of other church schools. 

The Polynesian Culture Center is right next door and is a major tourist attraction that receives visitors from all over the world. It is mostly run by students at BYUH."
Sophomore,5,"My experience here has been nothing but amazing and spectacular. Although I'm not Mormon, everybody here is so friendly and open-minded. Not only that, the environment here is very conducive for learning. The school population is made up of diverse backgrounds with people from all over the world, especially from the Polynesian islands and Asia. With that, I have learned so much about other different cultures. The school also provides a safe living environment since alcohol, drugs and smoking is strictly prohibited here along with gender-allocated dormitories which prevents any sexual misconducts from happening here. Crime rate is low in the area. There are also a few beaches around the area which are all within walking distance and this provides leisure time and convenience for getting away from stress for a while."
Sophomore,5,"Besides the fact that it is located in paradise, BYUH is a college that is dedicated to giving their students the best possible experience. I love how diverse this school is. The opportunities and experiences are endless and I wouldn't change my experiences here for the world."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity here on campus. People come from all over the world to study here and the programs and student involvement encourage growth and secular excellence.
Sophomore,5,"So good!  Teachers are very personable and willing to help.  Good on campus resources for academic help.  Good atmosphere, close to the beach, nice people."
Freshman,5,It has been a great experience applying for and getting excepted to byu Hawaii. It's an awesome campus with a dedicated staff and student body. Great town.
Freshman,5,BYU is a great and welcoming school. It is so cool to see such a melting pot of cultures and backgrounds all on one campus.
Freshman,5,"Great student body, healthy atmosphere and helpful classes and teachers.  Community also is a good place to live, though it would be nice to have some more school sports opportunities."
Alum,5,"BYU Hawaii is a wonderful university full of culture, experience, and amazing faculty. It is truly a unique college experience that will expand your horizons and make you feel like part of something bigger than yourself."
Alum,5,This University allows for you to recieve an excellent education as well as meet students from tons of places throughout the world. They have cultural activities to help you adjust to the different cultures you meet and help you adjust to college life.
Sophomore,4,I loved the location of BYU Hawaii. It is so beautiful and uplifting. I loved the size of the school and classes. It made it easier to have one on one time with professors and really step up my academic game. The one thing I would change is to bring back sports. That was one social aspect I missed was the opportunity to go experience a college-level game.
Senior,4,Online programs in Brigham Young University - Hawaii is a great opportunity too as they give you flexible hours on doing your homework or meeting up with the professors too online.
Junior,4,It is a good campus with small class sizes and great professors. I do wish credits were more transferable to other colleges though and vice versa.
Sophomore,4,I would not have had the chance to pursue an education without the fear of debt if it wasn't for Brigham Young University Hawaii. There are so many kind people who have a desire to help you. The chance to be here and take part in the opportunities they offer is great.
Sophomore,4,"Extremely diverse. Helps open people up to different foods and cultures which is hard to measure. Overall, great school."
Alum,4,"BYU Hawaii is a great small school with a good student to professor ratio. It would be great to see better food in the cafeteria, similar to BYU Provos Cougareats, but overall, BYUH is awesome and I would definitely recommend to people who are willing to follow the honor code and other requirements."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere of the BYUH campus and the smallness of the classes. I feel like we have a very unique campus that is very diverse, it is always a blast talking to people from other cultures. The thing I would change is that some of the buildings/equipment needs to be updated and advance as more technology advances."
Junior,4,Great people and very kind. Some school buildings are really old and run down. Some school administrative workers are not prompt with answering questions and resolving issues.
Niche User,4,My older sister goes to BYU-Hawaii and she really enjoys it. I hope as a senior in high school that I will be able to continue my education through BYU. I have had a good experience with BYU. It seems like a very enjoyable and relaxing campus to be on.
Senior,4,"I love it here. Its in Hawaii, so that's an obvious bonus. One thing that's really unique is the international student program. At least half the students are international, representing over 100 countries, so you get to learn about a lot of different cultures. This knowledge and experience isn't something you could pay to take a class for elsewhere. It's cheap for Hawaii, since it is a private university and doesn't have out-of-state tuition (about $5,000/semester ). It's a small school, which I like, but it means there aren't as many class sections so scheduling can be hard and often only one teacher teaches each class. The biggest downside to me, is that although it's close to the North Shore, which is great for having fun, it's a bit isolated. There aren't a ton of restaurants or stores."
Freshman,4,I recently was accepted into this university and start my first year this fall. Upon enrolling I found that I had many questions about the process. I also found myself having to make many phone calls and emails for those questions. Every staff member that I came in contact with was more than helpful and polite.
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the spiritual and academic environment here. Most of the people are here because they want to be here. Most of the teachers here have real life experience in the fields they teach, and they have done high level or prestigious work in their fields."
Freshman,4,"It's a very world wide diverse University where people from all over the world can meet and mingle together to learn and grow together. With so many diverse backgrounds it's very interesting to see different views on similar subjects and to be able to understand global English. 
Something that I'd like to see changed is an increase in technical majors."
Freshman,4,"The small class size and diverse student body is great, along with an amazing location.  The classes and programs could use a bit of cleaning up and adding on though."
Senior,4,"I love Brigham Young University-Hawai'i. The campus is beautiful, small class sizes make it easy to develop a rapport with your professors, and the ethnic diversity is special. My sole complaint is that it is difficult at times to receive assistance for anything pertaining to the school. You will often find yourself on a wild goose chase for answers to questions that should be easily available. In order to get answers and, quite honestly, to get things done in general, I would recommend doing it in person."
Sophomore,4,"This university has helped me feel like I am not just a number. It is so easy to get lost in the crowd of a large school, but here, the classes are the perfect in allowing you to feel connected with the teacher but also to learn from your classmates. The environment at BYU Hawaii is very peaceful which I find important, with all the stresses that come from being a college student. It’s definitely a once in a lifetime experience to live in paradise while gaining an education, and I would strongly suggest attending."
Sophomore,4,"The diversity of the school is wonderful! It rains a good amount, but it stays nice and warm. Everyone is so friendly, and because of the small student body, students have the opportunity to really get know fellow students and their professors very well."
Sophomore,4,Brigham Young University - Hawaii is a very culturally diverse school. There are so many different people from around the world who attend this school. I love the people and the city. One thing I'd like to change about this school is having a more organized school system that won't set things off to the side for too long.
Sophomore,4,"Brigham Young University Hawaii is a wonderful environment to study for people who want a unique campus environment with a lot of diversity. Located on Oahu, the relatively small university of Brigham Young University Hawaii offers a relatively limited amount of majors. While the majors are limited, the classes are smaller and the teachers are able to help students and focus on their needs. By doing so, the professors are able to help the students have a better drive to learn. 
       While there is a variety of food in Hawaii, the cafeteria on campus is small and very limited as far as food and open hours. Being a college student, it would be very convenient to be able to eat at the school cafeteria after nine o'clock. Even with the limitations that the school has, attending BYUH is a unique experience in college schooling. It gives students the opportunity to participate in and enjoy many new things."
Sophomore,4,"Brigham Young University Hawaii is an incredible university. The atmosphere is very welcoming and there is a rich amount of diversity among the students and staff who attend. The location is in a small community that is safe and beautiful! I love that the university is small because students have the opportunity to develop more of a personal relationship with teachers. The motto of the university is “Enter to learn, and go forth to serve.” I am reminded of this often and it is the foundation of my motivation."
Junior,4,Such a beautiful school. I like that it is small and the professor to student ratio is good. However this isn’t really a school for math or science degrees. I do t think it will prepare you for further education if you are in a stem major. Otherwise the programs are great and the school is amazing .
Senior,4,"Great multicultural student body with many opportunities to learn about different cultures. There is a shortage of staff and so there are not very many class or teacher options, but the teachers are very caring for the students. The location is perfect and housing can be okay if you live off campus."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love this school. What I enjoy most is how incredible the professors are. They are highly experienced in their field and genuinely care about each student. It is a smaller campus so the classes are smaller allowing you to have personal relationships with them. They are more than willing to do whatever it takes to help you succeed.
Freshman,4,It was amazing! The professors are understanding and want what is best for you. It is a very intimate setting with loads of stuff to do for fun!
Freshman,4,"Small school, so you get to know the professors. Better for one on one help, less struggling in college. More communication between professor and student"
Alum,4,"I loved going to BYU-Hawaii. I miss it terribly and would go back in an instance. The location made it amazing. The faculty was great, although the staff wasn't the best. The diversity was incredible and the opportunities are amazing as well. I love all the different opportunities they give you as a student there, both to learn from different cultures and to grow as a person."
Sophomore,4,BYUH is a great school! The classes are smaller and the diversity among the students is amazing! I love being here!
Niche User,4,"Everyone you meet will either be a local or they're from the other side of the world. BYUH is also connected to the Polynesian Cultural Center right next door; PCC is a nonprofit organization which the students can benefit from to pay for their education. You can either dorm on-campus or off. It is a little pricey, but hey welcome to paradise. It is in waking distance of the Laie, Hawaii Temple, lots of local beach spots including Pounders Beach that has the trampoline, a local shopping center and many more. You can also drive to Sunset Area for cool surfing competitions, snorkeling areas or drive down to town."
Freshman,4,"I am so thankful to get the opportunity to attend such a wonderful university. This school is one of the most ethnically diverse universities per capita in the nation. Not only do I get a formal education but the cultural diversity adds for a more in depth and intricate education. I learn so much from the professors and also my fellow students whether they be from the same country as me or from the other side of the globe. All though the school is smaller than what I am used to, there is a strong sense of unity between the students, faculty, and even community members. I definitely made the right choice by coming here."
Freshman,4,"Brigham Young University- HI is a great environment, based on religious standards that students can uphold. These standards ensure a friendly society. The diversity is one of the highlights of the school; people from all over come to BYUH to further their education, and so it brings a melting pot of different cultures, that adds to the color of the school. Though there are not many majors offered here, the classes are small, and the professors do a great job at making sure they help you succeed. If your major is offered here, I'd recommend you to check it out. BYUH is has the perfect location, far from the city, yet in an area where many tourists come to visit and admire. The community is welcoming, and friendly as well."
Senior,4,I love Brigham Young University Hawaii because it is an extremely diverse campus. We have multiple students from different countries in every single one of my classes and it gives a great perspective to class discussions.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this school!  The staff is hardworking, and helpful. I love the people here, and being able to learn about and make friends from different cultures. I feel safe on campus and I'm glad I choose to come here!"
College Junior,4,Great location with great people.  Teachers can seem a bit unqualified at times.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not ever lived on campus.  Most of my friends have though.  They all have had nothing but good things to say about the housing.  It is a very social place to live.  The rules that BYUH has implemented are always obeyed.  People that stay on campus always feel safe, especially because they have campus security."
College Freshman,4,The Brigham Young schools have connections in many major industries. They have many options for internships and careers.
College Freshman,4,"With such a small campus student body, there is a very safe and secure feel. Everyone watches out for one another."
College Freshman,4,They refurbished the dorm rooms recently so everything is new and comfortable.
College Freshman,4,The athletic program is great. The students are all very encouraged to participate and be involved.
College Sophomore,4,The school is very into sports especially when the community supports the school. The school also supports the High school sports. The team of course will have its ups and downs because everyone is different. Because of the schools standards they try to have a high standard of professionalism. For the facilities they have good well kept facilities for both athletes and non-athletes so everyone can get the work out they need.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on this campus and the quality of academics is amazing. You just need to make sure your on top of finding a job and other parts of collage. You also need to be on top of you school work. Just because the school is near a beach doesn't excuse you to be distracted.
College Sophomore,4,Not once have I felt uneasy walking around in or outside of campus
College Sophomore,4,It took me only an evening to get all the paperwork done. Then I had a couple of interviews and I was in
College Sophomore,4,ive never felt unsafe or even uneasy on campus though i know there are still bad things that can happen
College Sophomore,4,i mean idk for sure but it is relatively cheap for a good degree
College Sophomore,4,thers still problems at the school
College Sophomore,4,I know that there is a general feeling of safety here on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I do enjoy where I live, however I wish that we could have kitchens in each dorm room. I would like to see that because without one you are required to have a meal plan. I hate eating at the caf, I do not know anyone who does not hate it."
College Sophomore,4,Alumni network is great. It's easy to find international careers from here. There is a lot of networking done.
College Sophomore,4,"It's right in the middle of paradise for one. Second of all, the professors are generally helpful people who have your education in mind"
College Junior,4,We learn great things from our professors. Study areas are comfortable and quite.
College Junior,4,The school and students are very diverse and polite to anyone.
College Junior,4,We have wonderful professors in our school who help us get more knowledge and experience.
College Junior,4,We can find internship opportunities if we look for it early.
College Junior,4,The campus life is secured. I feel safe living and studying on campus.
College Junior,4,The social atmosphere is great. We have different activities to make it better.
College Junior,4,Learning from many international students makes the school unique.
College Junior,4,The student involvement and school spirit are great.
College Sophomore,4,"This school is a wonderful place to grow both academically and spiritually. Here, I've been able to develop myself as a person as well as a student. The atmosphere is full of love and light. It is truly a pleasure and a privilege to attend BYU-Hawaii."
College Junior,4,I've never used many of the career services but the career center is very active. They host a lot of activities and advertise internship and recruiting opportunities. They also offer one on one counseling sessions to answer student questions and offer personalized success tips depending on the student's situation and interests.
College Freshman,4,"choices of majors are limited. classes are small and professors are great. you learn a lot of great stuff. work load isn't bad, and its super chill"
College Sophomore,2,they  need better apartments off campus and actual apartment buildings instead of living in comunity member houses
College Junior,2,"Housing here is reasonably priced but the upkeep is horrible.  Mold, broken outlets, etc., make is a pain to deal with.  No matter how many times we have shampooed the carpet it still smells of pee.  There are hundred of apartments for students and faculty with only two maintenance workers who can't keep up and run around putting fires out.  Management is a nightmare."
College Sophomore,2,Yeah I've been waiting on a scholarship I won in 10th grade. Not gotten it yet. I NEED THAT MONEY
College Student,2,"The athletic program is beginning to diminish, so no one pays much attention."
College Sophomore,2,"The police every aspect of your life. There's not much you can get away with. But everyone signs a contract saying that they'll follow the rules so if you don't like the rules, get out."
College Junior,2,"The building I live in was built only a year ago and it has tons of problems already. The elevator has been broken for a month and a half and nobody came to fix it until a week ago, but it still breaks even after being fixed. Our lights have stopped working occasionally and the wifi here is horrible. I am paying extra to live in this dorm, but the only perk is having a private bathroom."
College Junior,2,"The school changed things on my FAFSA that they were not supposed to, and that changed my amount of aid. I had to jump through tons of hoops just to get it changed back to normal and get my expected aid back. I don't think it's right that the school had control over what was said about my living situation at home before I went because they don't know anything about that."
College Junior,2,The houses look really beat up and they don't look like nice places to live in.
College Junior,2,We are Isolated from everything. Civilization is an hour away. Gas gets expensive real quick
College Sophomore,2,Well Waikiki or pro surfer parties like for real… but i mean the local college students throw some fun dance parties that usually get shut down at 11…
College Sophomore,2,We are currently undergoing a phase out for our athletics so pretty soon we won't have sports to go to and we will be an intramural sport centered school.
College Junior,2,Studying at the library. Haha. Unless there is something going on at the cultural center or a dance.
College Junior,2,Very Expensive. My husband and I were looking for housing when we got married and it was hard to find one in our budget.
College Senior,2,"Taco bell and pizza hut are basically your options. Oh, and Subway"
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are old and musty smelling, luckily they are building new dorms for next year. Also, the dorms have lots of unnecessary rules because it is a private school, which is annoying. Such as, no opposite genders in the dorms, quiet hours 24/7, and you will have a bedtime."
College Sophomore,2,"The school requires a large list of general courses, including 6 religion courses, which can be quite annoying. Each class starts with a prayer and is tied into mormon dogma. The science courses do not meet university standards, as none of the professors believe or teach that humans have evolved from any other species. The business programs are respectable, especially the international business program. The psychology department has some very gifted professors and students have the opportunity to lead their very own research with the guidance of the staff. If the research is published, the students are listed as the primary authors (usually the professor would be). The classes are limited by the English language comprehension of the international students."
College Freshman,2,The housing is horrible. The housing office isn't helpful at all.
College Senior,2,If I knew what I know now I would go to a different school for this program. The teachers are unorganized and unprofessional. Outside of the education program I have had some amazing professors. I am speaking solely of the school of education. They really need a complete revamp and to get rid of at least 2 teachers.
College Senior,2,"Whatever happened to the little Plantation store in the Aloha Center? They need more on-campus dining options for students. The cafeteria has pretty decent food, but the prices are ridiculous. Seasider's food is basically muck and the prices there are horrendous. The little ""store"" at the Seasider is okay, but again, prices here (anywhere around here) are crazy. Vending machines around campus help with quick snack fixes, but you can't live off of muffins and candy bars. It'd be great if they could offer some kind of little ""market"" in the Aloha Center, with offerings like a regular grocery store but on a smaller scale. Maybe get rid of some of those bajillion offices, no one knows what some of those are for anyway."
College Senior,2,"For the most part, students and locals get along pretty well, but there have been incidents where they've clashed. I feel like some students believe they have special privileges around here because they're paying money to be here, but they need to respect the local community, or their years here will be a nightmare. This is a small, very tight-knit community, and if word gets out about someone being difficult, the whole community will know within a few hours. That may sound like an exaggeration, but trust me, I've lived here my whole life, I've seen this firsthand. Little things like checking for cars before you cross a street, or riding your bike without obstructing cars driving around you, can make a HUGE difference. Too many times I've come so close to hitting students with my car because they cross the street without even looking up from their phone or whatever electronic device. Students need to be aware of their surroundings. Locals DO NOT and WILL NOT baby you; if they have a problem with you, they will make it known. Have respect for them and they will happily return it. Don't come here expecting to be catered to."
College Junior,1,There isn't really anything going on here.
College Junior,1,The only parties here are school dances.
College Sophomore,1,The athletic program is going away so it is not a great program.  The area that BYU Hawaii is located is remote and not a lot of people attend athletic games.  It is reliant on the student body and does not get a lot of support.
College Junior,1,Why is this survey asking about Greek life when I clicked that we don't have Greek life at this school?  I'm forced to make up how the Greek life is on campus.  This data is getting you guys nothing.
College Junior,1,All of the athletics programs will be cancelled this upcoming year.  Nobody knows why either.  It's a shame.
College Sophomore,1,We literally have zero Greek life.
College Student,1,I have never been to a party here at BYU-Hawaii
College Sophomore,1,"There are none. There is nothing to do in Laie. If you want a party scene, you have to take a 2 hour bus ride to Honolulu or make a friend with a car. There's always the beach, but usually that's for couples making out at night."
College Sophomore,1,"It's so much more expensive than buying groceries like a normal human being. The food is nasty and I swear it's not real meat. I live off of grilled cheese (with fake American gross ""cheese""), bagels, and stale cereal because I can't stomach whatever it is that they label as food. The hours are awful and I'm always starving at night when it's closed, especially on Sundays. There's not a lot of variety and it's all around horrific."
College Freshman,1,We don't really have fraternities or sororities.
College Junior,1,"We are getting rid of athletics in two years, and nobody really pays attention to them. We don't even have football..."
College Junior,1,"We have really good teams, but they don't try to get people involved and they are getting rid of our sports in a year."
College Junior,1,They don't take student input and they simply don't care about our generation. We are different from them. They only think of themselves and not relate to us.
College Junior,1,Everything is closed at night except taco bell about half mile away from school.
College Junior,1,I hate dealing with the housing office. They make more work for you and you have to fight them on everything
College Junior,1,This is probably the dumbest thing. They have signs up that say if you park in certain places you can get a ticket. Ok simple enough don't park there. So I park where there are no signs at all. Guess what I get a ticket. You have to buy a byu student parking sticker or they give you a ticket even tho legally they can't
College Junior,1,We don't have one. We have culture clubs. I am in the Tongan club.
College Freshman,1,"The school policy of having a parking permit is ridiculous at BYU-Hawaii.  Many of us students do not have enough time to always update a parking permit, and when expired, then they tow your car."
College Freshman,1,We actually don't have any Greek housing at all. There are no fraternities/ sororities.
College Senior,1,"We are a religious school in the middle of the country. Any real nightlife includes the occasional house party, maybe once or twice a semester, or a friend gathering."

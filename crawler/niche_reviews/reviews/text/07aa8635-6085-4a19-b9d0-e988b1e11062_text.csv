Senior,5,My professors tried to do the best they could due to the last minute switch to Zoom. Alvernia was kind enough to try and provide training to the professors as best they could the weeks leading up to the transition. Alvernia's IT support was greatly appreciated during this transition.
Freshman,5,The welcome luncheon for scholarship recipients was amazing.  It was nice to see how well they organized the event.  Receiving the scholarships went quickly and smoothly.  Speakers were very knowledgeable and for all who attended received an additional for CollegeTown.
Freshman,5,This was my first experience with on-line learning.  The professors were amazing and the zoom worked great!  I would highly recommend on-line classes during COVID-19.
Senior,5,Everyone is very dedicated in helping you succeed in your classes. I love the small classrooms. The teacher are always available to help with any need.
Senior,5,The learning experience is very great. The software provide step by step detail on how to login and how to do your work. The instructor are always available to assist if there are any difficulties.
Junior,5,I have a great support system that have been guiding me towards my goal. The professors and staff members have been wonderful in guiding my to learn to my potential and explain the material in a productive manner.
Junior,5,The Professor and staff members have guided me to excel to my potential and they have been a wonderful support system.
Sophomore,5,So far I have had a wonderful time attending alvernia! With the smaller class sizes I am able to have more one on one help from my professors and they are all very dedicated to my education. The administration is very kind and helpful as well.
Sophomore,5,"Alvernia provides a small classroom setting and leadership opportunities. The teachers know your name and truly care about your success. The campus itself is beautiful and the perfect size for walking distance. There are plenty of opportunities for volunteering, work-study, and leadership positions."
Senior,5,My experience at Alvernia University has been awesome. The professors and staff are so welcoming and makes education worth coming there. There honestly hasn’t been one bad thing there that I didn’t like. It’s always clean and they always make sure they greet you either with words or snacks
Junior,5,"Currently I am a nursing student at Alvernia University and I love it. Despite the program being very challenging, most of the teachers make it a good learning experience. If I had to make any changes it would be for some of the teachers to try and readjust some of their teaching methods for students to have a better understanding and also to have grades in blackboard on time so you’re not wondering if you’re passing or failing by the end of the semester. Other than that my overall experience is pretty great."
Freshman,5,I love the teachers and students and how they set up the education system there!! I love the campus there too!
Freshman,5,"My experience at Alvernia University has been really fun, wonderful and unique one. Every staff member is very welcoming if you need help with anything they will find a way to help you with it.  I would not change a thing because everything is excellent."
Freshman,5,"Alvernia University, is a one of a kind place. During orientation, you get connect with your first year seminar class and start the year with more confidence than any other student. This school is geared toward, the students as a community, while having Catholic  values. Each student has to have forty hours of community service before they graduate, but this allows students to feel connected to the community and the joy of helping others."
Sophomore,5,Alvernia university makes you feel safe and makes you feel like you’re at home away from home. The professors are connected with their students and want to see everyone succeed. The campus is not too big and the diversity is great.
Graduate Student,5,Alvernia University provides excellent programs to young scholars in a plethora of fields and allows each and every student to get hands on experience by doing what they love and overall improving the community around them due to the heavy involvement of community service.
Freshman,5,"Alvernia University is a great private college. I enjoy living on campus, getting the full college experience. I am involved by doing community service and being a manager for the football team. The professors I have had so far are great. However, there are some tough professors here. I love being in the mountains/hills however, the beach seems nice sometimes. The student body is awesome and growing by the year. For an example, my freshman class grew a huge percentage than the previous years because we are in the process of building a football team. I think it is great though. Alvernia is also in the process of growing and adding more buildings for more classes and dorms. I am looking forward to expanding my connections, involvement and education here."
Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is welcoming to whoever walks by. Whether you are a student or someone just passing through, you feel a warm welcome as soon as you walk on campus."
Freshman,5,When visiting the campus for the first time I couldn’t help but really enjoy the short stay and the realizing my love for the college when seeing students in their classes.
Junior,5,"I love that Alvernia University, Philadelphia campus is designed for working adults continuing their education. The classes they offer are seven week courses, available online, during the evening and Saturdays. The staff are very helpful and are always on top of things."
Senior,5,I chose to attend Alvernia University because I was told by others who had attended that they had on of the best behavioral health programs in the United states
Junior,5,Class advisors work hard to meet the needs of online students. So far it’s been a great experience since I’ve been out of school for almost 10 years.
Sophomore,5,I have been taken classes at Alvernia for a little over a yesr now and have absolutely had the best experience. I do distant learning and everyone has always been so helpful.
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at Alvernia University.  I am on the cheer squad there.  I am a PreK-4 Education Major.  My professors are very nice and they help me when I need it.  Whenever I need help, I always go to my education professors or my advisor.  They are great listeners as well.  At Alvernia, the big thing there is basketball in the winter and lacrosse in the spring.  The library always has what you need and the librarians there are always willing to help you whether you need a book, or need help using one of the computers there or a printer, they will help you.  The campus is beautiful.  It's a little on the small side but I love it because it is easy to get around.  I love going here."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Alvernia in 2001, and I received a top notch education there. There were many opportunities to be a part of campus life, the campus is beautiful and growing, and you have excellent professors who care and develop relationships with their students."
Alum,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Alvernia. Everyone is so friendly and their campus is ever expanding. There is a friendly face everywhere you go, and all members of faculty and staff are looking out for your success."
Senior,5,What I like about Alvernia University is the teaching and the learning curriculum. The small classes and getting to know your Professors on a more personal exchange is great. What I would love to see changed is more of the main campus-getting  involved more into the Philadelphia campus.
Sophomore,5,"Alvernia is a great, small private college. The community is great and the classes are small enough that you always make connections."
Senior,5,I have enjoyed attending Alvernia University. I feel like God has opened many wonderful opportunities for me here with internships and work. I value education and how it betters the lives of students. I'm glad that I transferred and am close to home now. My professors have been really good to me and I have created strong relationships with them. I know that they genuinely want me to succeed and become who God has called me to become. It has been a wonderful journey thus far and I look forward to graduating in the upcoming year!
Sophomore,5,"Alvernia University is an excellent school to receive a quality education. Since it is a smaller school, students are able to get more out of their studies. This is due to the smaller class sizes, which allows for more interaction with the professors. The school culture is also a positive aspect of the school. Alvernia is a community, and since it is smaller, students form closer relationships with their peers."
Sophomore,5,I love Alvernia because everything and everyone us very personable. You can always get help directly from your teachers because they are here to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Alvernia University has been very good. I have met a lot of new people that I know I'll still connect with once everyone has graduated. I also played basketball and connected with coaches and my teammates. I've traveled places that I've never been just off of playing basketball. Some changes that I wanted to see, that are now starting to come to existence is a football program and another gym that students can get some extracurricular time in. Also, another change that I hope happens is that they continue to add more parking spaces for students that have vehicles. That's a main problem that students usually run into. Other than that, I love my University."
Alum,5,"I love the adult education program! Everyone works together, both staff and students, to assist with having the best educational experience possible. I also like the intimate size of the class population! I recommend Alvernia highly. Excellent experience! Wishing I could have my Masters experience there as well!!! My only complaints is that I wish the Philadelphia Campus had more activities for students and more interaction with the main campus."
Freshman,5,"I am a current college student at Alvernia University and I have to say, the experience is like no other. Teachers and students are welcoming and helpful from day one. From your connection day to your first day of class to your last day of class, they are there to help you succeed and feel welcome. You can go to anyone with any problem and they will listen and help you through it. The programs are rigorous and fast but not so much as to overwhelm the students. This college's programs challenges its students as well as keeps them involved."
College Sophomore,5,Alvernia University is a great place to go to school. I have never met teachers who care so much about their students and are willing to spend the time it takes to make the students as successful as possible.
College Junior,5,I have never had a problem with safety while at school. We always have two security guards on duty and students must buzz themselves in using ID badges.
College Senior,5,Very easy process and the university provides support along the way.
College Freshman,5,The enrollment counselors are phenomenal.
College Junior,5,We had to take a few classes to further learn and understand the importance of these issues
College Junior,5,"You definitely get your money's worth out of going to this campus. From the classes, technology, and educators, to all the people you meet along the way."
College Junior,5,"You definitely get your money's worth out of going to this campus. From the classes, technology, and educators, to all the people you meet along the way."
College Freshman,5,We took classes that would educate us on what sexual assault truly is and where could find support. The public safety crew is extremely nice.
College Freshman,5,The courses are great challenging but not unfair. Professors are very kind and care about the students.
College Freshman,5,I have enough privacy and lots of space to meet new people and create new friendships. The rooms are very spacious. It is nice the way the dorms are set up because the people in my hall all have similar classes to me.
College Freshman,5,Living in the dorms is great and it gives you the opportunity to bond and create life long friendships around you.
Recent Alumnus,5,"My overall experience is rated as ""it's the best"" for many reasons. Alvernia University provides its students an opportunity to explore each course and evaluate it to ensure that it was relevant to individual students' academic pursuit. The hands on in learning each course was profound. The knowledge acquired in class was in alignment with the experience each professor brought to the class."
College Senior,5,"I have experienced the power of a school family, and by that I mean my peers in my selected major are like a family to me.  The teachers I have are the best role models and support system I could have ever asked for.  The campus is a beautiful place to be and everyone is friendly towards each other.  You would definitely get a sense of community while being there."
College Sophomore,5,"I knew when i stepped onto the campus of Alvernia it was for me.  I think what sold me was how close everyone is, amazing part of Alvernia is the students helping each other.  The campus itself is so cute and homey"
College Freshman,5,My school is super small and personal unlike the other schools I've visited. It has an amazing vibe and everyone is friendly there. I couldn't be happier with my choice.
College Freshman,5,I love that my school is very focused on community service. I feel that giving to people in need is some of the best things you can do.
College Freshman,5,it is the best i love it
College Freshman,5,i love it it economicaly the best
College Freshman,5,"Although I have just finished my first year as an OT, the program is still relevant and important with certain classes like A&P, despite it's difficulty, it is still important to prepare yourself for the more challenging classes ahead. Everyone I know in the program loves it, and find that the opportunities through fieldwork in their junior year, and the experiences that go along with it are very meaningful."
College Freshman,5,Campus has many computers available
College Freshman,5,The drug safety on campus is evident. The health and wellness center provides many activities to avoid drugs
College Freshman,5,"I've met great people, and I love the small environment"
College Senior,5,In order to get in to the program that I am involved in you have to have a 3.00 average or start with transfer credits like i did from another school.
College Senior,5,It is good because there is alot more people who are enrolled so it makes the classes very interesting.My major falls hand in hand with the job that i currently do.
College Senior,5,I love the professors they are the best.They are very intelligent and there curriculum and there expectations are very high for all students. They are always open and ready and willing to help.We have a great registration process and they are excellent.There is availability for special needs is great as well everything is great.
College Senior,5,this school is very strict when it comes to these things that can ruin one's life.
Sophomore,4,"Alvernia is overall a great school, it has a lot of majors and minors that you can choose from.The sports are good they have almost every sport that you can choose from. I do not live on campus, but I heard that the food was not great."
Senior,4,I enjoy Alvernia University very much. The professors are helpful and so are the staff members. I enjoy that their class. sizes are smaller. It is costly to attend. I would recommend planning your finances in advance.
Junior,4,"Since Covid-19 hit and we all moved to virtual learning, my classes online were good overall. My professors put a lot of effort into making the class as informative and interesting as possible. My professors included videos to watch and assignments along the way so that helped me learn the material."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love Alvernia! The campus is beautiful and as soon as I walked onto campus it felt like home. Everyone is so nice and friendly. The professors are so helpful too! They care so much about the students and really want them to succeed. Most of my professors make the material interesting and explain it in a way that helps the students understand/remember it. Also, extracurricular activities at Alvernia are really good. They always have events going on such as movie trips, trip to NYC & D.C, Bingo, exercise classes, and more! You just need to push yourself to get involved. Dorms are amazing here too. This school has the best housing options out of all the schools I looked at. The food is okay here. Not amazing, but not horrible. There are a lot of options, just not super healthy. Lastly, campus is very safe. Public Safety doesn't do too much, but I have never felt unsafe walking around campus."
Freshman,4,"I love the vibe in the campus, the way that we all get along with each other even if we may not even know each other. I also love the way that the professors get along with each other and with the students."
Niche User,4,I liked the campus a lot. The people were very nice and friendly. Something that I already see that it is a small campus but it is already readily increasing through  athletics and science buildings.
Sophomore,4,"A beautiful campus with a family-like atmosphere! Everyone is friendly and welcoming and there are many chances to get involved with the school, the community, and many other areas."
Junior,4,"As I haven't finished my Bachelors at Alvernia yet, it is a great experience and a great University for transfer students from different colleges."
Sophomore,4,"Alvernia University is a college where you get to be yourself, and express your true charachter. Alvernia has a diverse list of majors that will suit anyone applying. From the professors willing to do anything to help you succeed, to the fantastic students helping you through the acaddemic success center. Alvernia is a place to truly suyceed. Life around campus is always thriving. From bingo nights, to school trips, there is always something to do on campus. Alvernia changes lives for the better, it has changed mine."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed going here my first year.  The professors were really good.  They care about the students and they take the time to help them when needed.  The campus isn't big, which for me was what I wanted.  I wanted a school that I could get to know alot of people and I did.  Everyone treats you like family all the workers and teachers.  It's a really good school to attend."
Junior,4,"It is an okay experience. I do enjoy the amount of clubs and activities, yet there seems to be other colleges with more involvement in hobbies and activities than Alvernia."
Senior,4,"My professors are always helpful and available when needed. Since I take my classes online, I rely on email responses to keep in touch and sometimes it seems that I receive emails late. There seems to always be a glitch with Blackboard but is typically fixed within a reasonable amount of time. I would reccomend Alvernia to others, especially online learning."
Sophomore,4,Very friendly environment and feels like home with such a small campus. Highly recommend coming here!
Freshman,4,So far the people and staff at Alvernia are great. I personally have no complaints other than Instructors keeping their students aware of their academic standings
Sophomore,4,"Alvernia has a very close community. The classes are not big, so you can really connect with the teachers. I would like to see the tuition go down. It is very high at the moment."
Freshman,4,I love that the professors at this University truly care about the students and that they succeed. This University supports their students in their career choice and is very strong in their health care majors. There is an ample amount of support from professors and from different on-campus resources that you are able to access. This University is setting me up to be successful in my field.
Freshman,4,"Alvernia University is a place undergoing many changed. Recently, they just became the Golden Wolves after being the Crusaders for many years. They just built a brand new stadium, and added a football team. I play soccer, so I started my first year a week earlier than regular students. My team and I formed a brotherhood and share a bond like no other. We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small. I know probably half of the student body. There are only two negatives about Alvernia Alvernia is the #1 school in Pennsylvania and #4 in the nation for student debt. The general cafeteria food is generally very poor as well with limited options and sometimes bad quality."
Senior,4,"This school is small and very pretty. No matter where you live on campus you can get to class in 5 minutes top. Also the campus activities board puts on the best programs like free trips to the movies, New York City, Baltamore, DC, various zoo, bingo nights where you can win TV, go pro, $50+ gift cards, fridges, etc,. Its pretty cool."
Freshman,4,Small private school. Nice people but not a party school. Focus on self-development and charitable service. Food is mediocre at best.
Freshman,4,"On my visit I couldn't complain about anything with my school, I love it so far, but if I could change something I would make a way bigger food court/ area, with different cultures of food for you to try at lunch, in case your from a different state and you miss a specific food you used to eat with your family back home. This happening would make more people want too live on campus."
Freshman,4,"Alvernia University has a smaller campus, everything is in walking distance, but there are shuttle services to the Upland Center for classes, and parking lots for parking off campus. As a Science major I like my professors. The dorms and housing is bigger and more well kept than other schools I have visited. There are things on campus to get involved in and meet people."
Alum,4,Nice clean campus. Everyone seems to enjoy the school. It's in a nice location and the college is growing by the year.
Sophomore,4,"friendly and warm atmosphere, great writing tutors, professors who truly care about non-traditional students like me"
Junior,4,Overall great experience! Staff and incredibly helpful and caring. They prepare you for  real life experiences the best they can in a controlled setting. The school tuition although is costly.
Freshman,4,"A beautiful, tiny university! All of the professors have been very helpful so far. There is always something to do on campus, and the food is pretty good!"
College Junior,4,"I love my school because it is an adult accelerated program designed for working adults with families. Most of the students here have been working in the behavioral health field for many years, which is an overall enriching experience in itself. I enjoy being surrounded with such knowledge, especially since I will be entering this field for the first time after graduation."
College Junior,4,health and safety has been great
College Junior,4,it has been an awesome experience
College Junior,4,I have not been around greek life.
College Junior,4,Teachers and facilities are fantastic!
College Senior,4,My university has the same opportunities as many of the other local D3 schools.
College Senior,4,My masters courses are all online so it is very convenient for a working adult to continue furthering their education without stepping into an actual classroom setting.
College Sophomore,4,For a small school we have very good competitive athletes
College Junior,4,"My overall experience has been great. The professors are always well prepared, The topics in most of my classes were very interesting. I do appreciate that most of the professors are down to earth and are really here to do their best in giving the students here the best quality teaching as possible. I also like that the classes are small for hands on learning."
College Junior,4,"my overall experience with this school has been great the professors are very compassionate and helpful. The classes are 

small which helps me with getting the assistants that i sometimes need. My favorite experience was when i enrolled in the introduction to social work course, i ended up being the only student in the class. The professor was well prepared I didn't think that i would be able to stay in the class like that, but I'm glad i did. We had great conversations and i learned a lot. What's unique about this school is that it really accommodate my everyday life, i am an adult student with may responsibilities and this school great with helping me schedule class that best fits my life. If i had to do it all over again i most definitely would do so."
College Freshman,4,"Easy to communicate with professors, quick reponses to emails"
College Freshman,4,Inexpensive university for the degree.
College Freshman,4,"Rural, small campus. Its safe"
College Junior,4,Alvernia is your average Liberal Arts School. The school is also Franciscan. So far my experiences have been great. Student peers and teachers are always there to help if you need them. Sports team basically run the school and host most of the parties. It is a small school with a great student to faculty ratio. If you want a big party school this is not the university for you. Although there are a couple parties on the weekend.
College Junior,4,I don't live there but I know people who do that really like it
College Junior,4,"Everything is clean, up to date, and easy to use for anyone"
College Junior,4,It's a very good school with amazing educators
College Freshman,4,Alvernia university's school athletics are attended always by students and we always have a great team and show support and school spirit.
College Freshman,4,"Alvernia University is a great school to attend. This school has many opportunities to engage and explore in new opportunities. Everyone at this school is very inviting and friendly which is what gives a ""home"" like feeling."
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the small classes and community we are!
College Senior,4,It has the curriculum I want and allows me to have a flexible schedule because I work full time.
College Freshman,4,My classes as a first semester freshman are relatively difficult but they are challenging in a positive way.
College Senior,4,"i go to Alvernia in schuykill county its small, but some Instructors are the best. they know what they are teaching and talking about."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere is great. I enjoyed my freshman year at Alvernia University, however the food is what got to me. It wasn't that great"
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school for the student body. The people who choose to go here are what I consider to be quality people, who care about learning and looking out for others. The faculty also cares for the students and they all do what they canto help us out when we are struggling. My favorite experience was probably Orientation because everyone made us feel so welcomed and important. I knew I could go to and talk to anyone if I needed anything, which was exactly what I needed when starting a new chapter in my life."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a nice small quiet school which is great for shy people like me, but definitely not a college town."
College Senior,4,I lived on campus for a year because I wanted to feel included with my friends and be apart of of the group even though my family lived 20 minutes from the college.  I loved the feeling of being on my own and being independent and responsible for myself.  Most classes were a matter of a 5-10 minute walk so it was very convenient.  If classes were further than that they supplied a shuttle bus to take me.  I only lived on campus for a year and have since moved back home because of the expense and knowing that I would be responsible for paying the housing loan.
Recent Alumnus,4,We have a great gym that is available to anyone. Basketball games are usually the highlight of the week.
College Junior,4,Haven't had any problems usually goes very smooth.
College Student,4,The campus facilities are well kept and always beautiful
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the structure that is found at University.
College Freshman,4,Financial aid office was always available to answer any questions I had.
College Freshman,4,They offer a wide variety to accommodate all meal preferences. They do tend to serve regional influenced recipes that don't appeal to me as I was not raised in the area.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on Campus. We have a lot of security Guard there.
College Junior,4,NA at the Philadelphia Center.
Niche User,2,"Horrible counselin staff!! If you have to keep calling them after you provided documents and they say we still need said documents there is a problem
And staff waits until you reach out to mention missing info. To many schools to worry about chasing this one sets a bad example when this is the first impression."
College Freshman,2,"Although the dining hall looks appealing with its ""buffet"" or ""all-you-can-eat"" meal plan, the food choices are horrible and most of the time tastes bad. On occasion there are good meal choices. At court side and kestrel cafe the food is terrific but overpriced and the times are ridiculous."
Recent Alumnus,2,The only apartments near campus are at 525; which the police frequently visit and are small and unsafe.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If we buy someone else lunch, it should be able to count as a swipe and we should not have to use our flex dollars. The food in the Student Center is very rarely appetizing."
College Student,2,"This campus is very strict about noise and underage drinking, policies always require an AA class If you get caught for anything. Once quiet hours hit public safety cracks down and will be banging on your door."
College Student,2,It's rare that dinner is actually really appatizing.
College Freshman,2,"No one really lives off campus. You're expected to stay there all four (or five) years. There are communities and houses right outside campus, but people already live there. There is this apartment building off-campus, but I don't know of anyone who lives there, it is an option though, but I have not heard good or bad news about the place. That is essentially the only off-campus place the school offers. But there's really no reason to live off campus at Alvernia unless you're just a commuter."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not enjoy my campus dining. They try to be very accommodating to every type of person, which is fine, but more than half the school won't eat some of the dishes they make because they are not what people normally eat (this is mostly fish and certain meat dishes). Also, they're lack of consideration for people with specific food allergies is disturbing, in my opinion."
College Senior,2,"my school never informed me of anytype of scholarships ever, i went in this total blindfolded"
College Freshman,2,"It could be much worse, but it's college food so what can you expect.  "
College Freshman,2,It's hard because my school is so expensive and my parents can't get loans.  I am basically fighting for my education because I can't afford to go. 
College Junior,2,The campus itself is very small which is nice because travel isn't a huge deal.  However the school does not provide much help when travel is needed.  Cars are allowed to be kept at school no matter what year you are for free so that is helpful to those of us who own cars.  Altogether though they do not offer much aid in this area.
College Freshman,2,"It snows a lot up there, classes rarely get cancelled, which is really dangerous. Most of my classes far away from my dorm. so it's a little risky to be walking around on icy sidewalks. When the weather is nice everyone hangs outside, plays games, socialize. Classes will sometimes move outside if its real nice. It depends on the class though."
College Junior,2,There is severe winter weather and classes are rarely cancelled.  This is somewhat annoying because I live about 1/2 hour away and have trouble getting to school in bad weather.
College Freshman,2,not enough variety for picky eaters   pizza is usually gross  ellios frozen is better  not worth the $
College Sophomore,2,"The food services have been doing their best to try providing a wide variety of different foods which is great, but unfortunately the food is not very good. They do have two side cafes that students tend to go to for food while while for class which are conveniently placed near classrooms. The prices are also fairly decent."
College Junior,2,"student athletes treated like royalty, never have to make up any class work- it's a joke to the students who are there strictly for their education. Profs give them special treatment."
College Junior,2,"limited commuter parking, too much parking for upper class men"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am just returning to Alvernia for my masters degree this week but the few
times that I have been there recently, the parking lots were full but I did get 
a spot since I have a disability card."
College Freshman,2,"Alvernia University is like most colleges, where it is a mostly white campus."
Sophomore,1,Does not prepare you well for the real world. Professors test memory not application. If you want to be prepared for the work force do not go here.
Alum,1,"BA in CJ, forget about finding a job I had many teachers tell their students get out know if you can because you will not find a job or make any money boy was she correct about that. Stay away. Thanks alvernia I'm not jobless and bankrupt! I now have to start all over again with an education and a degree that I can actually put to use!"
Niche User,1,"Alvernia was a nice campus. However, everything seemed to be for show. The outside community is not very well suited for college kids. The pay is not ideal which particularly damaged my interest"
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,There's nothing to do in the city of Reading during the week and on the weekends everyone leaves campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,"We only have one fraternity, not the normal Greek life of most colleges."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The few people that do throw parties, usually get caught or they are terrible."
College Freshman,1,they said i was eligable then i wasnt
College Sophomore,1,Its free to park at Alvernia but parking is hard to come by especially as a commuter or freshman. If you live on campus its must easier to park as an upperclassmen. I would strongly suggest you have a car as there is not much within walking distance from campus.
College Freshman,1,"The parking is so far away for underclassmen its horrible!
At night its the worse, in one case there was a man who would go to the parking lot to just look at the girls and follow them ! VERY dangerous!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"There are limited options on campus for eating, but the campus is very small. The cafeteria food is not very good. However, the other 2 smaller cafes are good, possibly better than the cafeteria. Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting money on the meal plan when I eat more in my room than at the cafeteria."
College Freshman,1,"Health & Safety – ""Public Safety"" is a group of rent-a-cops that only patrol when they are called to. It is difficult to get any officer's help by calling the office and even more difficult to find one around campus. The only building security is key card opened doors, which are pretty much useless because people hold the doors open for everyone. Anyone can drive onto campus, there is no security gate anywhere. The school is also a good distance away from the city, so calling for help from the city police in any situation would leave you waiting for some time."

Sophomore,5,Professors are quick to reply and give help when students needed it. Campus buildings are easily accessible through the inside so no one has to go outside to get from one building to another.
Freshman,5,"I would like the attend Massachusetts College of Art & Design because it has a wonderful location. Subway right in front of the school, many unique restaurants around, and surrounded by different kinds of college. When I went to visit the campus. I'm glad that the school provides many little chatting/ open space for students to hang out. Many schools miss this part. These spaces allow students to meet new people easily and feel more welcoming as a student. I noticed there was construction during the time I visit. I'm excited about how it will turn out at the end. I hope the construction doesn't affect the students around the school. I visited one of my senior friend's dorms in Massart, and I'm in love with it. The dorm looks very simple but it has everything a student needs. I noticed the hallways were clean too."
Niche User,5,"I love this school, and everything that comes out of it is great. And to those who are complaining about the lack of sports... IT IS AN A R T S C H O O L! ART SCHOOL! NOT A SPORTS COLLEGE!"
Niche User,5,The facilities and studios in MassArt are amazing! I went to tour there a few weeks ago and I was very impressed. Everyone there was so happy and the environment was very cheerful.
Freshman,5,"Not only are my peers supportive, but also my teachers. Class sizes are small enough for every student to get the attention they each need. I have never been happier at a school or ever felt so supported. Even in lecture halls I know I have the resources I need to excel."
Sophomore,5,"Fantastic staff and facilities, classes are informative and enticing. I’ve learned so much about myself, my work ethic, and my artwork since starting at Mass Art."
Sophomore,5,"It is an amazing school! I would like to see more counseling programs however. The food is okay, but it is not recommended for anyone who cannot eat meat or gluten. The overall campus life is very wonderful and everyone is very kind."
Sophomore,5,"I was adamant against going to college before I first visited Massachusetts College of Art and Design. However, within the first few minutes of my tour of the school, my mind opened up to the possibilities the school offered. I have never enjoyed school. In high school especially, I struggled to reform to the strict rules and enforced attitudes. I had not dreamed of a learning atmosphere where the student's input and idea's were valued as much as a teachers, of a place that encouraged individuality and self expression to the extent that Mass Art does. I feel myself growing and discovering so much about myself as an artist, because my school allows me to trust my intuition. Massachusetts College of Art and Design give's it's  students access to incredible equipment and subject matter, but for me the most amazing attribute the school has to offer is the strength it instills in it's students, to trust themselves and pursue whatever it is that we want to explore."
Sophomore,5,MassArt is such an accepting and creative environment to study and work for. I can tell that every professor genuinely cares for their students' success.
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior in animation at MassArt and I have never felt more a part of a community. Here at MassArt I have not only found myself  creatively, but I found my true self. Through the talented and helpful professors, I have learned how to do incredible works of art through practice, practice and more practice. My peers have been absolutely wonderful; they are not only loyal and genuine individuals, they are my inspirations. Like most schools, there are a couple things that need to be worked through, such as foundation/freshman year, the cafeteria food, and the understanding and patience of freshman year professors. The liberal art classes are interesting- not your average scientist  class (i.e. Physical of music, bio art) - and the various majors offered are at the upmost functioning degree. However, above all else, it is without a doubt that the community at MassArt is much stronger and tighter than our education program."
Freshman,5,MassArt has so many classes to offer. You learn a lot and start to think in new ways. The teachers really care about their students and want them to thrive.
Freshman,5,"I love this college. I am a first-year student here in MassArt, so as a first student and as a commuter I didn't have that much experience in college life, but the college and the Professor are really good. And students are really helpful as well."
College Freshman,5,"3 Res halls right across the street from the school, beautiful view from the Treehouse Residence, each suite has good sized bedrooms along with its own bathroom (Usually shared between 4 people, 2 in each bedroom), Maitenance responds quickly to requests or complaints"
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because the professors really care and love what they do and they help me to improve my skills so much. Not only is the school itself great, the area of boston is beautiful and it's easy to travel anywhere i need to go and the dorms are very nice."
College Freshman,5,"class size is great, professors are helpful and knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,5,"MassArt really does make a strong effort to make Campus safe. Where the Residents are, there's also Wentworth's Public available to any college student, and campus police keep a presence on the road that cuts past Artist Res and Treehouse.  Also being on a frequently busy street helps keep shady people and activity on the low. I've walked across Campus at 4am before and didn't feel uncomfortable."
College Freshman,5,The small classes allow teachers to really connect with students.
College Freshman,5,"I live in the Treehouse building, which is a new building and it is spectacular. The building itself is very well-designed, always clean, and has a very good atmosphere. There is a kitchen on the third floor which is very convenient, and a workroom on every other floor for us to do our artwork."
College Sophomore,5,"Great food, but can be very expensive for college kids."
College Sophomore,5,"My major will begin this year,  cannot wait for it to begin."
College Sophomore,5,"My major will begin this year,  cannot wait for it to begin."
College Sophomore,5,Art school has a diversity all over the place its great!! People can express themselves freely all the time
College Senior,5,"The new residence hall is amazing. I lived there for a year and we had million dollar views and our dorm floors came together as communities. It was easy to make friends around the building and grab a bite at the cafe on the first floor or play pool on the third. The best option would be the treehouse, and the worst, although cheapest is Smith hall, only because of its crampness and ancient-ness."
College Senior,5,"I've lived in Boston all my life and I always knew I would go to school here. The atmosphere is great. You can walk the whole city in a day and still not see everything amazing about it. It's great for college students and just a wonderful city to be in, with a big city archetype and small city closeness."
College Senior,5,Everyone at Massart is super kind and willing to help you out with whatever you need. The community is what mainly brought me here. I love it.
College Sophomore,5,"The new dorm that Massart built is an amazing building to live in. Everything is brand new and clean. The rooms are spacious for college dorm rooms and bathrooms are attached to the rooms. The new building has a community gym and kitchen. Massart provides workrooms and lounges that alternate floors. Floors become small communities in themselves. Your floor will either have a workroom or a lounge and everyone ends up hanging out together either watching tv or making art. Housing is a bit expensive but completely worth the ease of access you have to the school, the workrooms, and the social atmosphere you won't get living off campus."
College Sophomore,5,Boston is a huge college town. There are plenty of colleges around Massart and students regularly interact. Boston in itself is not a huge city and is completely manageable when it comes to navigation. There are always places to visit and things to see.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are great, I've learned a lot in all my classes and find the subjects to be interesting. There are a lot of options to choose from and it changes every semester as some are added. Classes fill up fast especially the good ones and the required classes too, so there should be more classes opened based on the demand of classes. The workload is reasonable."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is in the general area of the school. There's other colleges and campuses within walking distance which creates more opportunities for students to interact. There is museums, bars, shopping center that are close. A lot of places to eat. There is  a lot to do in the city especially around the school and public transportation is everywhere. Its basically a college town."
College Sophomore,5,"There are specific requirements within a major that help towards the students progress in their major. There are a lot of studio options especially as a 3-D major, students have the options to take classes within the fields of fibers, glass, sculpture,metals, and three dimensional design. I think that the work load is manageable but still a lot of work which is expected. Aside from studio classes, students have to take academic requirements, there are a lot of interesting courses to choose from. I enjoy taking the social science classes, because the classes are specific and unlike most courses offered. The only downfall is the lack of regular math and science classes. There are not many offered and few options within the category."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a wide variety of people from all different backgrounds who attend massart. Diversity is emphasized through student's art work. The school has done themed art shows regarding issues of sexuality and sexual orientation. There are also gallery shows about awareness toward other types of diversity. Everyone on campus is accepting of people's personal choices in beliefs,religion, sexual orientation."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here! I have made many great friends and the classes are wonderful.
College Freshman,5,"Boston! There's always something to do. The campus is intertwined with that of Wentworth and Mass College of Pharmacy, so there's a lot of different types of people around to interact with (as well as from the many other schools in the city)"
College Freshman,5,"MassArt is part of the ""Colleges of the Fenway"".  This is a massive group of colleges all within walking distance of one another.  By being part of this group, you can cross-register at ANY of them, use the facilities at any of them and participate in clubs with other colleges. It is a totally unique scene here in Boston."
College Freshman,5,"So far my program has been teaching me that there are endless possibilities in the art world.  The workload is manageable if you have any kind of time management skills.  The facilities could use a little work, but they are working on that now and should have a new building up and running in the next 2 years.  As far as job opportunities, they are endless, and the student help center is a great resource."
College Freshman,5,"There are so many more majors in art then i had ever imagined.  The professors so far have been excellent. Most of them are very free thinking, modern, alternative people who relate with the students on a different level then any other college I have visited.  The grading system here is pass/fail.  MassArt does not believe that work should be graded with a letter, but based on merit and effort.  "
College Freshman,5,Mission Hill and BU are both great areas to find a house party and there are many bars in the neighborhood.  The T runs to all the locations in Boston so getting there is never a problem.
College Freshman,5,The instructors here are amazing.  The fact that all of them are working artists and most of them went to MassArt themselves makes it more encouraging as a student looking to do the same type of work. I would recommend this school over and over again.
College Sophomore,5,"You won't meet people like the students here anywhere else! No matter how strange your hobbies may be or how average you think you are, you will always find a friend or someone interesting to talk to."
College Junior,5,"MassArt has EVERYTHING.  We have one of the only large format Kodak cameras in EXISTENCE.  We have an iron pour team.  You can rent basically any sort of video/photo/tech equipment you can think of.  Want to do some glassblowing?  You can.  Want to learn welding? You can.  Want to take a class in making jewelry?  Yup, you guessed it, you can do that too.  Plus we have some of the greatest teachers in the field."
College Freshman,5,"Public transportation is AMAZING at MassArt. The Green E Line stops literally right outside the dorms and you can get just about anywhere from MassArt. The T lines really are not hard to understand but it does take a little exploring and a risky attitude to figure it out and get comfortable. I also recommend getting a monthly T pass. It is a little on the pricey side but if you plan to travel a lot or explore the city, take classes at other schools or are commuting it is a solid investment."
College Freshman,5,"MassArt may come off as a rugged campus with paint everywhere and seem like an art project in itself but one thing I will say is that the accessibility of equipment, technology, resources, data and information is INCREDIBLE. Sometimes it feels as though if I am curious enough that I don't need a teacher to walk me through a new topic or idea I have in mind."
College Freshman,5,"Each of the students are highly individual in both personalities and looks. If you're walking around campus, you can tell who attends MassArt, and who attends the neighboring MassPharm and Wentworth Colleges. While the latter two will mostly be seen in sweatshirts and casual gear, MassArt kids definitely put more emphasis on fashion and looks, maybe because they are all visual-oriented. Plenty of room for alternative styles, and because of this, nearly no discrimination by looks. Everyone seems to have somewhere to be and interesting things to do, but will gladly talk to you or help you out if you ask. I'm not sure if it's just the art influence, or the liberal atmosphere of Boston, but it's very unlikely you'll find someone mean-spirited at MassArt."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm in the Mass. College of Art and Design, and I've been very satisfied with my education thus far. My occupation is Industrial Design, and all of my professors have portfolios from out of the field and are very accomplished in the industry. A few of my professors have  designed armed weapons for the US military, and others made furniture and children's toys. I've had some of the best instructors who know a lot about the process. If you get to know them on a personal level, they can do wonders for you when it comes to networking or getting a job since they have connections within the state as well as out of state."
College Junior,5,"Not Strict at All – MassArt is not really strict with anything. Students aren't allowed to drink on campus and if they're caught they're just talked to by an official and the drink is confiscated. I haven't seen any harsh punishments yet, but people also don't break rules that much. Everyone is pretty great about that."
College Junior,5,"Profs Help You Prepare for the ""Real World"" of Design – I'm a graphic design major and the professors are EXCELLENT! Nearly all of them are still working in the design world so they really know how to prepare us by teaching us better presentation skills, working in groups, critiquing skills, work ethic, expanding conceptual thinking and process work, how to treat clients, and so on. Each studio class (Graphic Design, Typography, Information Architecture, Design Research) is 5 hours and includes critiques (individual or group), working in class, breaks (of course!), and an explanation of next class's assignment. Internships aren't guaranteed for everyone we're highly encouraged to get one and receive emails about new internship/job opportunities and we have them all listed on the college site so they're easily accessible to us. The workload is heavy but completely worth it. At the end of each semester we display ALL of our work and present it (juniors & seniors) for the professors to do one final critique. We call it ""Reviews"". Sophomores also have Reviews but they don't have to present their work, they just leave and the professors look at it alone. We're graded on craft, concept, process, and presentation."
College Freshman,5,"Best Library Ever – I love the library Mass Art has in the tower building, it's huge and full of great resources. There are tons of art books and there are also computers available and copy machines and research info sheets. There are also beanbag chairs and a great view of the city. It's my favorite place on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to venture around school looking for food.  One place I do know is Flames, a Jamaican restaurant with delicious food and friendly service."
College Freshman,5,No Signs of Drugs/Alcohol – So far I have not noticed any signs of drugs or alcohol abuse. I also do not party at school.  I have my own social life off campus.
College Freshman,5,"Tech Center – I am very satisfied with MassArt's technology labs.  There are several rooms with fast Mac computers and great quality printers.  However, I wish printing cost was a bit less expensive."
College Senior,5,"Caught smoking weed on campus? Expect a slap on the wrist. Sneaking onto the roof? Nothing more than a mild scolding. Living in your studio because your girlfriend kicked you out? A-ok.

Overall campus police is pretty lax, provided whatever you're doing isn't going to hurt anyone. It's art school, what do you expect?

Also, if all police officers were like Mel (one of the officers here) I wouldn't have such an issue with cops..."
College Junior,5,"Not Bad – Everyone lives fairly close to school, so the weather doesn't really affect us very much since most people walk. When it's nice outside, the entire campus and courtyard are covered in kids which makes a really great atmosphere, and everyone does their artwork outside, we even have classes outside sometimes!"
College Junior,5,"New Student Life Center – Renovations have recently been completed on a new student life center which is fabulous, our studios and labs are top of the line, our library is huge, quiet, and beautiful with great places to study, and thousands of resources, and our cafeteria was newly renovated as well. They have added a Peet's coffee and the atmosphere is now great for studying, and is very aesthetically pleasing."
College Senior,5,"Public Safety officials patrol the school at all hours. If people are in the building working after a certain time they are required to sign in at the public safety office so the office knows who is in the building and where. If anyone wants to leave the building between 11pm and 5am they are REQUIRED to take a taxi, and a $10 voucher is given to cover all or part of the taxi ride, depending where the student is going."
College Freshman,5,"They are good here. The Class sizes are perfect, and the teachers help alot. sometimes some teachers are not good but are great artsits..and that can be frustrating."
College Freshman,5,"Almost everyone has their own laptop regardless, so the school computers are always available. We have several printing labs which makes printing easy, and first year students can print in one of the labs for free as long as they supply the paper! The wireless is iffy at times, but for the most part it's effective. Not everyone necessarily needs their own computer, but it's good to have."
College Freshman,5,we need to take on avarage as little as 3 academics for all 4 years
College Freshman,5,"Again, It's Art School... Everyone Is Accepted. There is a place for everyone here. I would say most people here are white, but I think everyone is generally accepted around campus, no matter who you are or what you look like. If there was every a place where EVERYONE fits in and is able to find there niche, it's here."
College Junior,5,"I love MassArt! People at my high school thought i was weird, but everyone is weird here, we r all artists!"
College Student,5,"There are two museums 5 min away from MassArt, and admissions is free. Also if you go towards Northeastern there are a lot of restaurants. Its mostly college students around so there are tons of things to do."
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman at MassArt right now. I love my teachers and most of my classes, I love my living space (I’m in a suite in the Artist’s Residence, and it’s nicer than my actual house), I love the other students I’ve met here (A LOT of the MassArt students are LGBTQ+, so they’re all very accepting), and I love living in Boston. Class sized are very small for the most part, so you get to know your teachers pretty well. My only two complaints are that the food in the caf is pretty bad, and I don’t like that in your freshman year you don’t get to choose your classes. They have what they call “Foundation Year,” where they make your schedule for you to ensure you take all the classes that are prerequisites for other stuff. I ended up in a studio class in a medium I don’t really care about, but the teacher os great, so I ended up not minding too much. Overall, great school with a few small flaws, but I’m starting to feel at home here."
Freshman,4,"Online classes are a little hard to sit through, especially because some are 5 hours long with a short break in the middle, but I’m surprised how well my teachers have adapted. I don’t think my education is being compromised by COVID, although it’s a little less fun than meeting in person. There’s been a few technological issues for some students though, and the school doesn’t do a ton to help."
Sophomore,4,"Students and Professors adapted well to online learning when it was required due to COVID19 restrictions. But, it is an art school, so hands on learning and critique was more preferable, as well as access to materials."
Junior,4,"The professors here have all been wonderful, and I feel like I'm at home amongst my peers. However, I think they could work on being more open to student criticism of classes and such."
Freshman,4,most of the professors i have had so far have been so great. i have never been so excited to learn and just to go to class and create
Senior,4,"I am currently a Communication Design major and I have been enjoying my time. The professors are very enthusiastic about their field and provide helpful feedback. The school lacks in athletics which students can find in the other Fenway school. School food is decent, but there are better options within walking distance. My main problem is the freshman year where students are forced to take foundation classes in areas we might have no interest in, which results in only 3 years in our major vs. 4 years."
Senior,4,"It's a fairly good school, with good teacher and curriculum. It tough the first year, but when you stick with it , it's very rewarding. Has some great work and club opportunities, in a variety of positions. I started my own club (Creative Writing Cub) with about a dozen members, and also helped grow the Creative Writing minor."
Sophomore,4,"MassArt embodies a community that feels inclusive; and I know that the word 'inclusive' might sound too political, but I believe it is the word that can describe how cohesive MassArt is. MassArt definitely has its flaws, like the food and the elevators (at least one breaks every month, no joke). The food in particular bothers me, as I believe that there should be options that accommodate to most of the students' eating lifestyles. As of housing, MassArt deserves five stars; truly, the living spaces are high-quality and safe. Overall, I believe MassArt still has work to do, but its pros ultimately win over its cons."
Niche User,4,"The school provided insight on parking with the area and an excellent presentation. The students who gave us a tour were very enthusiastic, and answered any questions that were asked. The school had a beautiful campus, and is placed in a great environment. The opportunities they offer are amazing, and seem endless. The commute through Boston is bearable and has an array of things to do. They have the Boston Red Sox ,Celtics, and Bruins near by. The dorms were beautiful, and they were roomy enough for roommates. The dinning options are extremely affordable, and if you prefer outside school that is great as well.  They have a plethora of establishments bordering the schools perimeters. Overall a great school to attend."
Sophomore,4,I really love MassArt. It's just the right amount of challenging students need in order to succeed yet push themselves as well. I'm forever grateful for the fact that they accepted my application past the due date because of my previous school shutting down unexpectedly. I'm much happier here anyways and wouldn't change the struggle I went through.
Niche User,4,"My brother goes to MassArt and I visit him often. I always enjoy staying with him, and my brother speaks highly of his professors and his school."
Senior,4,"MassArt has a really tight knit community but it is an underfunded public school so in certain areas it lacks; like for example in keeping the buildings up to date, housing, and security. But as for the artists, the major professors are talented artists themselves and you are constantly surrounded by creativity. It's a school that will teach you how to think out of the box and give you the tools to do so, but it falls behind when it comes to teaching you the technical skills you need."
Niche User,4,The environment is really good for art students that want to pursuit their own path in the art world. I liked it.
Sophomore,4,"Thus far, I would say that my experience has been relatively satisfying. I've had excellent professors that were very helpful and understanding of any set-backs I had during the year. Many classes are challenging, but not impossible. It requires a lot of dedication and hard work. Also, the people there are very friendly, making it easier to deal with the work load. However, I think there are too many students enrolled, too many for the college campus to handle. This makes applying for classes difficult as they fill up quickly and leads to a lot of frustration if a student is not aptly prepared. In addition, many students were left on waiting lists. The college bit off a little more than they could chew. Overall, I've enjoyed my Freshmen year and I am excited to continue in Sophomore year."
Junior,4,"Mass Art has the capability of being a great school. The professors are great and so many great classes are offered. However, even being a public school, it is far too expensive. So many students have to drop out because tuition costs too much. I probably won't be able to graduate because I won't be able to afford senior year."
Senior,4,"Great college, really love the class i’m graduating with and the teachers i have taken, make sure to research the teachers before you take a class."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a print major and I transferred from another college because I love their facilities. The professors are very knowledgeable, I was actually recommended to this college by a professor who had attended graduate school here"
Freshman,4,"MassArt offers many student-run events and ways to get involved right off the bat. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and I've met many wonderful students and professors so far, and I have already learned a lot about art."
Senior,4,"Being in an art school environment and meeting different kinds of artists was inspiring and helpful to my own progress as an artist. While foundation year is helpful, it would be better if the school allowed freshmen to take electives in their intended majors so they could realize sooner rather than later whether or not they are dedicated to it. Overall great experience."
Niche User,4,"I had a very amazing experience during my four years at this fine institution. The faculty is top notch and comparable to almost any other top university in the world.

I had a very amazing experience during my four years at this fine institution. The faculty is top notch and comparable to almost any other top university in the world.

I had a very amazing experience during my four years at this fine institution. The faculty is top notch and comparable to almost any other top university in the world."
Sophomore,4,"Entering Massachusetts College of Art and Design, I was introduced to a whole new environment. Everyone on this campus is so open minded and accepting. I felt like I could do anything and be anything without being judged. Academics wise, MassArt has definitely challenged me and has taught me to be a better artist."
Sophomore,4,"I like everyone supports each other's art. I would like to see the school invest for art supplies for the students, since its so expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Massart has made me into a much stronger artist, the teachers are incredible and the fascilities are insane! I am happy here my only complaint is the lack of financial help"
Sophomore,4,MassArt is a great melting pot of different cultures coming together to create art. The downsides are the fact that your liberal arts classes are graded and your other classes are pass or fail
Sophomore,4,A lot so great teachers who are about the growth of their students. Lots of opportunities available for students to get involved on campus.
Freshman,4,"Profs and admin really cares a lot for students and the people here are eclectic and weird but sweet. You won't get the ""classic"" college experience here that you would at a state university but you will get the art college experience which is equally fun and fulfilling. Get used to seeing your friends and classmates naked."
Freshman,4,MassArt has great diversity and accommodation. The professors care about how you do and know when you don't come to class.
Junior,4,The classes here are great. Many of the teachers have been in the trade for longer than I've been alive and are very knowledgeable of their trade. The only thing that is annoying about the school is the process for registering for classes every semester. The web site is very unorganized and confusing. Other than that I love this school.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe walking around my campus. I feel secure and free.
College Freshman,4,It's a very open-minded and very friendly school. The people there including students are willing to help you with even the most obvious questions.
College Freshman,4,"Being a black belt in tae kwon do, I generally feel safe anywhere I go. The campus area is probably one of the more safe places I've been to in Boston so far, since it is all college kids. I've walked back from the Mission Hill area extremely late at night and nothing has happened so far."
College Sophomore,4,"It seems fine to me, except things get stolen a lot. That is more the fault of the student for leaving something in the open while they're gone or not taking care of their things. But I've also left a wallet in a classroom and had it returned to public safety also. Other than that, I haven't heard of any recent crimes on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I have to take advantage of the career development center more. Alumni and senior work in fashion is astounding and I don't know how I'm going to get to that level in a year. There seem to be a lot of internship possibilities.
College Sophomore,4,I've never lived in a dorm but all my friends that do seem happy. Smith hall is probably the worst one.
College Freshman,4,"In Boston, crime is usual, but Massart police have a twitter to update students, emails and texts when something in the area needs to be known"
College Freshman,4,"I've heard it's great, however I don't live on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The community is friendly, and the faculty are very kind, understanding, and extremely helpful"
College Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore, I can't give a complete accurate experience for this. If you're trying to look for a job, use the career resource site especially when looking for Work Studies. And of course, it depends on what Major you'll be pursuing when applying for the professional world, but the location of Boston offers many opportunities for people in the Traditional Arts and in Design."
College Sophomore,4,"It really varies from person to person. Some find art history or social studies a pain because they chose to go to a nonacademic oriented school, but each professor does have a passion and knowledge for the course they teach. The quality gets better after Foundation Year when you become immersed in your Major."
College Sophomore,4,"Both Treehouse and Artist Residence are pretty nice. You have access to Wentworth's cafeteria as well as MassArt's in Kennedy. The C-Store, despite its prices, is great because they stay open later than the cafeterias. There's easy access to the main campus, and with the new DMC building, South Hall and Pozen."
College Sophomore,4,"Certainly an immersive environment. 

The real gem is in the area, where students have unlimited access to the whole of Boston."
College Freshman,4,"With fellow students that seem responsible and fun, there has been no problems."
College Freshman,4,It's been an interesting semester so far. I've found myself being inspired by both fellow students and teachers.
College Junior,4,There are always security around the campus that are friendly. You are able to feel at ease with them. There is even a shuttle that drops people off to main locations for commuters getting home.
College Junior,4,"My overall experience at MassArt has been difficult, yet rewarding. MassArt is a college devoted to the arts, and it was the reason why I chose to attend school there. Art making has been my favorite experience as a whole because of its ability to help me grow not only as an artist, but also as a person."
College Freshman,4,"Despite being in a busy area, campus feels safe and I haven't heard about or experienced any assault or dangerous situations."
College Freshman,4,"Awesome, experienced professors, all interested in if not passionate about the classes that they teach."
College Freshman,4,I haven't used career services much yet but I've heard a lot of good things and they are active on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Decent amount of space, good community and excellent proximity to classes."
College Freshman,4,MassArt has an excellent community and great staff!
College Freshman,4,"MassArt is in a relatively safe area, and the campus is very condensed, and although I'm not convinced of the competence of the public safety staff, I still feel fairly safe."
College Freshman,4,"Getting an arts-related job is tough, however the career development at MassArt, as well as the networking opportunities, are really great."
College Freshman,4,"I think MassArt is very underrated. For its cost alone, it is undoubtedly the best value for an art school in the entire country. Though its strengths are graphic design and illustration, all of the programs within the school are dedicated, hardworking, and try their best at providing the most in-depth education possible. The location is excellent- right in Boston, surrounded by at least 5 other colleges. The community is great, and I've never been happier than I am here."
College Sophomore,4,"There are sometimes a few issues, but things are evetually smoothened out."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes have helped me a lot, there is a goof level of competition amongst students."
College Sophomore,4,"As long as you have a good portfolio, you'll get good offers. You also need to be outgoing about your work. Students here have gotten very goof opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are good, easy to meet people, although everyone is always working. Good that it's across the street from classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Helpful Professors, and good courses along with creative peers have boosted my skills."
College Freshman,4,"MassArt has opened my mind in so many different ways. My range of skills has improved significantly during my first semester although I do wish there were more drawing classes. I also wish we had the opportunity to explore more diverse areas that we may not have been exposed to in high school. Besides these two points, the professors as well as my peers are extremely talented, helpful individuals."
College Senior,4,"MassArt has many quirks, some that make it better and some that can deter from the learning experience. The people at MassArt are eclectic, passionate, fun-loving, and creative. My teachers have made the experience what it is for me; I am learning and gaining experience from working professionals in my field, and that experience is beyond valuable. Many people here are devoted to and serious about their work, but some tend to care less about it, which is extremely frustrating to those who work incredibly hard and get the same amount of recognition as those who slack off."
Junior,2,"The good:
Wide range of studio art classes.
The bad: 
Popular classes fill up quickly.
The registration process is confusing and illogical. It's not a straightforward process of registering and knowing that you have a reserved seat in a class.  It's ridiculous.
Filthy classes, studios and buildings. Regular cleaning is non existent.  Probably a health hazard breathing in all the dust/particles. School really needs to be inspected by the State.
Quality of teachers is uneven. Many adjunct professors have no training as teachers and don't know how to teach. Pedagogy here is awful -  a sign that admin aren't doing their jobs - all the way up the chain of command.
Teachers are helpful (even the ones who aren't good)."
Freshman,2,"My current experience with MassArt is this: administration claims to protect and care about their students, but they do not. The food has given someone I know food poisoning 3 times in a month, and a professor has seen roaches in the cafeteria. A girl with an allergy to laxatives was even warned not to eat the food there. The police officers aren’t armed- which means in a crisis situation, we’re screwed. They claim to be diverse but MassArt is 99% white women. Students are cliquey and cold- if you don’t find friends in the first week, good luck. Smith Hall, in which I reside currently, is a glorified prison. It has brick walls and the room I got stuck with is long and narrow and is the size of the closet at my house. The only things that would stop me from giving this school 1 star are the professors and acedemics. The professors I’ve met so far are incredible people and are truly passionate about their craft, and are very understanding and helpful."
Graduate Student,2,Facilities are really bad. Selection of professors is extremely limited and many are not that good--at their profession or at teaching (in architecture).
College Senior,2,"I did non enjoy living on campus because they did not treat me like an adult, rather a child."
College Freshman,2,"Well, it's an art school. So I wasn't really looking for it."
College Freshman,2,"We're an art school, so naturally sports are not at all a big part of the school community. There are a couple intramural sports teams- one soccer and one basketball- and all MassArt students have access to the fitness facilities at Wentworth Institute of Technology right next door."
College Sophomore,2,It's expensive and the reality fees should be illegal. We are expected to pay at least 4 moths rent up front. My rent is 1400 for a chappy one bedroom 4 miles from my school. The only way to live on mission hill is with other college students. I am older and I don't want to live with 20 year Olds. There needs to be affordable housing and the owners should pay the reality fee.
College Freshman,2,It's an art school. There are no sports. We share a gym with Wentworth. So you can run and lift weights if you'd like.
College Freshman,2,"The food is just bad. You get used to it, but you shouldn't have to. Little variety. Deep fried. Preservatives. Not expensive though and it's placed conveniently. Tastes good. Just... Not healthy."
College Freshman,2,the food tends to make my stomach hurt
College Sophomore,2,Public school don't have much money :'(
College Sophomore,2,Most athletics are through other colleges.
College Freshman,2,Not much sporting activity at art school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Have to walk a bit before getting to a location (resturant, food stand, etc.) that isn't school affiliated."
College Sophomore,2,The sport community is small to non existent at Massart. The only sporting team that we have is the basketball team and they only play two games a year. Honestly sports at Massart are nonexistent because there is almost no demand from students for them. There are intramural teams that students can join on other college campuses.
College Sophomore,2,"The kind of parties at Massart are mostly ""kickbacks"". But since we are surrounded by tons of other schools you really just have to make friends outside of the school if you want to party."
College Sophomore,2,The school is pretty white. I'm unsure about the religious background or political background but when it comes to sexual orientation Massart is very diverse. 
College Sophomore,2,"Because it's a state school you do get more of a variety of students than a high-cost private school like Pratt or RISD, but the school is overwhelmingly white, middle class."
College Sophomore,2,It is an art school so there aren't athletic teams but there are different clubs people can join that are really fun. For example: Outdoors club
College Sophomore,2,I live on campus so I haven't had to deal with it first hand myself but I know that it is fairly expensive and there aren't many spots for students.
Freshman,1,"Massachusetts College of Art and Design is good for students who want to be surrounded by only art. The liberal art classes are eh, the foundation classes have teachers that either care a lot about you or don't even know you're in the class. I did not like my time here but I did love a few of my teachers."
Alum,1,"International grad students. Stay far away. The program is outdated and stilted. There is NO exchange between disciplines and the meager resources they have are diverted to undergrads. And honestly, I have no idea why anyone would rate this diverse. Perhaps it is diverse in terms of class, gender, and sexuality but racially it is horrid. There have been plenty of classes where we've discussed race without a single black person in the classroom. As a PoC, I've also had plenty of racist encounters with faculty. There is little to no understanding of the rest of the world in this extremely isolated American college"
Junior,1,"I withdrew from MassART mid-junior year.  The Animation program is a joke and the department as a whole does NOT want students to pursue digital artwork or working on animations as a commercial job.  I spent most of my time making abstract animations that I didn't care about than actually animating.  The professors applaud abstract 'indie' style animations, and will harshly grade digitally produced character based/narrative based work.  

In my 2.5 years at MassART, I learned nothing to improve my artwork and ended up teaching myself everything.  Not to mention that the school seems to care more on outward appearances based on their recent 40+ million dollar building that has little to no use for students, and yet some of the classrooms in the school have literal holes in the walls and mice infestations.

The school doesn't seem to care about students as much as they do about their appearance to people not enrolled in the school. 

MassARtT was the biggest regret of my life."
College Freshman,1,there really is not Greek life at all in this school
College Senior,1,There are no sports at MassArt.
College Sophomore,1,We're an art school so we literally don't care. I think there are some sports with Colleges of the Fenway but I don't even know.
College Sophomore,1,"It's an art school; a few people play for fun, but it's not really a big thing."
College Freshman,1,"We have only one Basketball team, but it's kind of a joke. It's art school! There's not much demand for athletics. However there are options available to play for the teams in neighboring schools."
College Freshman,1,"In the middle of Boston there is NO parking. Occasionally you can find a spot by the Isabella Gardner museum, but that is only an option for visitors. As a student, there is nowhere to park. On the other hand, Boston has an excellent transport system so commuting is still an option."
College Freshman,1,"Similar to most of Boston, parking is a commodity most can not afford. MassArt has no specific parking so most people commute or live on campus. I walk to school everyday because parking is NOT an option."
College Sophomore,1,There are no sports. Minus the small basketball team that no one cares about.
College Junior,1,"Massart has one school sports team, a male basketball team."
College Freshman,1,"You're in Boston, you don't need a car. But if you make that mistake the dorms have a garage you can park in that's SAFE and you WON'T GET A TICKET which is great. I'm not sure if it costs anything to have a vehicle down there, though."
College Junior,1,"Learn all you can, research all you're eligible for before contacting the financial aid office because they won't tell you. They'll also not tell you upfront about any fees you might need to know about, they assume you just know even if you're a first generation student. I suggest asking in collegeconfidential or your state's fin.aid branch if something sounds or looks weird because the fin. aid office doesn't really know what they're doing. They'll also lose your mail or send it to the wrong place but expect you to pay things exactly on time or you'll have to pay a $200 late fee. Always try to be a step ahead of them or they'll make a big fuss even if you do send things out on time, they won't take that into consideration and get to it whenever they feel like. Whenever you pass their office, they're not really doing much so I'm not sure what they get paid for..."
College Student,1,"Ha What a Joke – This school wants your money!!! Don't worry about financial aid, they are only interested in taking as MUCH money as possible from YOU."
College Student,1,"not only dangerous, but expensive, difficult and miserable"
College Junior,1,"It's Boston, Might as Well Take the MBTA – In all honesty, take the subway or the bus.  I don't know of any parking close by to MassArt and form what I've heard it's not worth the costs.  The MBTA can sometimes fail you and make you late to class, but at least you will definitely get there.  You're leaving it up to chance by trying to find a place to park."
College Junior,1,"Living Anywhere Is Crazy – Boston may be full of apartments, but that doesn't mean that they are student friendly.  For starters, it is extremely hard, if not impossible, to find an affordable, clean, and safe place to live off campus that is still at a convenient distance.  MassArt is practically neighbors with Mission Hill, where a bunch of crime is always taking place.  So obviously staying clear form Mission Hill is a good plan; it's just that they prices are so low in there.  But it's not worth the potential harm to your belongings or person.  Getting an apartment along Huntington Ave would be ideal, except they are usually way out of affordable price ranges.  The cleanliness is debatable anywhere unless you are paying big bucks.  Everything would just be a whole lot easier if there was available dorm space for all the students."
College Sophomore,1,"Even though the school claims to have good wireless connection, it barely ever works. So if you plan to use internet you should bring your Ethernet cable."
College Freshman,1,"The school's medical center is useless. When I was sick they just sent me to an emergency room where I sat for 4 hours. In addition to that, the medical center is located at Wentworth, not MassArt."

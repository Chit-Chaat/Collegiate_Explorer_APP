Junior,5,"I have taken a few classes online, it worked out for my benefit since I was juggling work and school. Online classes vary based on the processor for the class. All in all, my online learning experience was amazing."
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere at Broward College. The classes are reasonably sized and there are a ton of resources available to help achieve good grades. Only thing I believe can be changed is finding better ways to help students navigate the campus. I can be a bit challenging finding certain buildings or classes
Niche User,5,"good school for basic majors. if you wanted to go here to complete your two years of general education courses then leave, i would highly advise so."
Sophomore,5,This school is truly an inexpensive gem. You can receive a quality education from an accredited institution for hf the price or less with financial aid of a regular four year institution. I highly recommend this school.
Sophomore,5,"This school is a very good school for furthering your education affordably. The atmosphere is welcoming and you are guaranteed as long as you are an active Student, to make many friends and memories. Online learning since the pandemic has been great for the most part as well."
Niche User,5,"Overall, Broward college helped me integrate into the college experience. The campus was always clean and I never had any issues with asking for help. There are so many resources to use and the staff is always open to lending a hand. The atmosphere is peaceful and vibrant. Though I am only dual enrolled, I've spent enough time on campus to know how much quality a community college can bring to the table."
Niche User,5,"Being at Broward college was truly calming. I'm glad to have had this college as my first experience. I took some courses online due to the Coronavirus, but the teachers were still friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,"Broward College has variant opportunities, including online classes, clubs and extra circular activities. This is an underrated college that can make your dreams alive fast and with dedicated work."

Freshman,5,My online experience is amazing. It is easy to handle and everything yo need is right in front of you. The professors are very nice and detail about anything. They do not judge you questions or answers.  Not only are the professors are very well mannered but anyone you come in contact with are very polite.
Sophomore,5,It was such a great college. There were so many people there that was willing to help me whenever I had a question.

Freshman,5,Broward seems prepared with online classes and none of my classes have had technical issues yet. Overall a great school and I am glad to be there.
Sophomore,5,My online experience at Broward College has been fantastic to say the least. The teachers really try to put their best effort in this new form of teaching and it shows. Even though it's not a face-to-face class the teachers are willing to assist with help in any assignments needed. Shows that they care about what they're doing and if they care about my future.
Freshman,5,"The student life is very involved, especially for a smaller campus, like North. There are events more than once a week and the library is fantastic for studying. The rec room is a great place to hang out and there are numerous places for seating outside spotted throughout the campus."
Freshman,5,"The last half of my Spring semester and the entirety of my Summer semester was taking remotely. The professors understood the confusion and poor circumstances among their students and reacted accordingly, often easing up on the normal coursework, or completely dropping an assignment. Some professors used online applications like Honorlock for exams, but not all."
Sophomore,5,"During my college experience at Broward college, I have taking many online classes. Some classes are fully online which means the students is responsible for accessing and understanding the material. If needed, the teacher can be contacted through email. Students must also keep up with the syllabus and not completely rely on the teacher to know when assignments are due. Other classes involved using blackboard collaborate which is an application that allows the professors to teach a class online. Students must log in during the required class hours and are able to ask questions and communicate with the teacher. Last semester, my classes were both changed to online because of the pandemic. While it was unusual, it all worked out great and there were no issues at all. I planned on attending school during the fall and all my classes are indeed online."
Sophomore,5,"So far, Broward College has been quite educational. Wether it involved the first visits to the registration office or the countless advising appointments not to mention was was actually taught in class. When I first started, I encountered many issues such as having to pay out of state fees and not qualifying for financial aid during my first year but the front office employee made sure I understood what needed to be done in order to qualify for financial aid and in state tuition the following year. Once that was completed I attended three semesters before loosing my financial aid due to too many classes being dropped since I was working full time, lowering the required pace set by the school's standards. Since then I have been paying out of pockets and am two semesters away from achieving my associate's degree and regaining my financial aid. The FASFA office has been of great help explaining the required steps and monitoring my progress. I would recommend Broward College to anyone."
Freshman,5,"I am extremely grateful for attending this college. I have very kind and understanding teachers, my advisor is helping me figuring out the best options for me for classes/major/university I want to transfer too."
Freshman,5,"I'm taking classes online, well remote learning, and I love it. I think it is much easier and should be an option even when covid disappears. I really like remote learning better than taking an online course, because there is an exact time that I have to show up to the class and I will actually get motivated to do my work and can ask my teacher any question, while online I can do my work at any time but I will probably end up procrastinating."
Sophomore,5,"Due to the pandemic, I had to finish my Spring semester courses online. The experience was good, however some courses like Acting  for my Program demands to be on campus. I could finish my courses but unfortunately had some issues with my Acting courses. I believe the overall experience was good.

I will take my Fall 2020 semester in a hybrid Program having some credits online on others on campus, especially to meet the new ICE rules for International Students.

I am very excited to have this experience to complete my credits to be graduated as soon as I can."
Sophomore,5,"I am an International student from Venezuela, I came to the US to fulfill my dream to graduate in an US College in the majors I love that are Theater and Education. I started my studies at  a College in Orlando but decided to transfer to Broward College for some reasons.

First of all it's location near Miami Center and also beautiful Campuses. In addition the Theater Program is the best fit for my it's offer what I want and I always had in mind to Learn.

Definitively, it's beautiful campuses, courses, programs and people are the main reasons why I transferred to BC and never regret my decision to be graduated in the College I love.

I just want to finish all my courses in the Theater Program and continue also to finish the Education program so I would have my Theater experience and knowledge to teach what I've learned combining to of my passions thanks to the learning approach Broward College has to students."
Graduate Student,5,I took only one class online and it was a great experience they give you all the materials you need to start your semester off right.

Junior,5,It’s been exceptional. My instructors are all experienced attorneys who are very adept at presenting the material.
Niche User,5,Besides being in very prime locations; broward college is the best college experience I could ask for. All the teachers teach with passion and love for their subjects and the small class sizes make it ideal to learn. I am attending the dental assisting program currently and couldnt be happier with my instructors.
Sophomore,5,I love Broward College! I attend the Central campus and what makes me enjoy it so much is the great scenery and amenities. The library is spectacular and very helpful when you need a private room to study. The food is really good and the overall academics is great as well.
Sophomore,5,Online learning was not a choice for many of us as the pandemic came along but the transition to online learning was not too bad.
Freshman,5,"All the professors, instructors, team member and advisors are very helpful and help me to be create a path that I will be able to follow and succeed"
Freshman,5,"It is very easy if you put yourself to follow a schedule, make sure you are aware of any dead lines and due dates, communicate with your instructor if you have any questions, you can also try to speak with your class-mates"
Freshman,5,"I am a first generation student that left high school in 2007. So, for me it was a little hard at first to get into the school rhythm again after such a long time. The teachers were always there to answer any questions I had, which made things clearer and easier to complete assignments on time with the right information. The teachers always ask if we have questions and we are able to contact them by email at anytime. They provide me with the same experience as if I was in the classroom.  The teachers provide us with the right amount of information to keep us occupied and on tract to complete each class."
Freshman,5,"From the day I went to the school until today I have been receiving excellent information and direction from everyone I come in contact with. The staff is patient, knowledgeable and very helpful. The overall appearance of the school is wonderful.

Sophomore,5,I really enjoy this school. Has many resources and activities as well. Many student life activities and good professors. Use the academic success center I’d you need help with classes.
Sophomore,5,I’m currently taking online classes dude to covid but everything is on d2L and there’s still resources if you need help with classes.
Sophomore,5,"My experience online was pretty neat. The communication between my professors, viewing the work, and engaging with my classmates were all really nice, organized and easy to use."
Sophomore,5,I took two online classes while at Broward College and they were rather interesting for my first time. I was able to contact my professors very easily and they would respond in a timely manner. They would help with any questions I have regrading the course work. The layout and instructions were very easy to understand and I got work done efficiently.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is great, easy to maneuver around. The students and staff are very friendly and most of the professors are very great at teaching. The professors at Broward College are very dedicated in ensuring you learn and will take the time out to ensure you understand the work. There is an Academic success center in which you have tutors that are available all the time. Great campus, great administration."

Sophomore,5,"Broward College offers every course you need for your major at a reasonable price. I was a full-time student in the fall and spring and I still had money left over for extra expenses. If money is an issue, come to this school."
Sophomore,5,"It is genuinely dependent on the professor you have chosen. Most teachers struggle in an online environment and grading can become hectic. However, it is manageable"
Alum,5,"My online learning experience with Broward College was great. It was easy to navigate and well explained. Professors were always clear with instructions and due dates. While it did require hard work and proper time management, it was definitely doable."
Alum,5,"Yes, I did take some classes online, three of them actually. I think it made my life so much easier, I barley was able to travel while I was in school because my money pretty much went to school and bills but when I took classes online I was able to take advantage of the random opportunities to take a weekend trip or a cruise with my friends, boyfriend or family and not miss out. The professors taught just as great as the professors who's lectures I attended in person."
Sophomore,5,"Though the transition from classroom to inline classes have been tough, the faculty has tried their best to make the shift as smooth as possible."

Senior,5,A wonderful college with great opportunities for students. I believe that this school and it's faculty really strive to get students the best of what's out there.
Senior,5,"The change from face to face learning was a smooth one for most students as the college was quick and very responsible with fears and concerns of students. The college provided laptops and other equipment to students within a week of the school closing and kept the platform open to other students who needed resources. The professors even though most have never taught online where also superb and effective in handling the changes. Many of them going beyond the call to even offer help at weird hours (outside of office hours) to help students who struggled with understanding materials and lessons taught. I think that Broward College did an exceptional job and continues to do so since the school has remained remote. Students are still engaged as if they were on campus but through different mediums such as Zoon, Facebook, Blackboard Collaborate etc. It's really interesting how they can keep engagement up during these times. Honestly the best college ever!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Broward College, so much resources and helpful people at the school to help you achieve and move onto higher education ."
Junior,5,The professor are here to assist in any way they can. There goal is to equip you with the tools you need to be successful.

Freshman,5,All the administrators are helpful and kind. They give great information on school and help with any concerns.
Sophomore,4,I took classes online and in person. The campus is extremely safe and well cared for. The coursework is manageable depending on the professor. There are a lot of perks and discounts available to students in the area.
Niche User,4,"I've been at Broward College for 2 and a half years now and have had very mixed experiences each semester. My advice would be to do your research on the teachers you pick. Your whole experience here really depends on if you have a good teacher who cares about the students, is understanding, and teaches the material well. I've been on the central campus and I do enjoy how small it is compared to huge universities."
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience with Broward College has been very exciting! It is simple and the professors make it easy for us to learn and complete out assignments.
Sophomore,4,Being a student at Broward College is great! I love the diversity the college has and the awesome opportunities the college provides for the students. The academics is also great. There are multiple activities to engage in and have an exciting time with classmates and friends.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at BC Central campus has been very good, the campus are up to date and clean, the services are really helpful, and the faculty staff are also very helpful and kind. I always feel safe on campus and I’m very happy attending this college."
Sophomore,4,I have taken classes online. I do not like fully online classes though. But professors are doing their best handling the remote learning classes.
Niche User,4,"for my spring and fall 2020 courses, i had to do my classes online. the professors were pretty cool and were considerate about everyone's situation."
Freshman,4,Very good staff Good teachers very clean. When first went to broward college the staff made me feel like I was wanted there. The teachers always make sure each student understands and never let anyone be left behind.
Freshman,4,I haven't took any online classes but I did have friends who did go online. From their experience they said the online class was very easy to access. The course work was very organized and put together.
Freshman,4,"My online experience with Broward College so far has been a breeze to access, each of my professor has schedules and syllabuses that include due dates, making it easy for us to access them 24/7. The professors try their best to provide us with every resource possible."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience with Broward college have been a pretty decent experience, I would not say it’s bad. I am better off learning in person then on a computer. The teachers I’ve had during this pandemic have been pretty good."
Sophomore,4,The classes were very easy online. The teachers were very helpful and always made sure to email the student before every assignment was due. That turned out to save my grade multiple times.
Sophomore,4,"The overall experience at Broward College is a great one. The professors really want you to learn so they strive to help as much as they can, we go as far as adding extra credit to make sure that if you're missing at least a little bit of points to get to an Airbnb that I can help you do so. The academics are also phenomenal. Student life is also doing stuff almost every week and it is very engaging to go to and watch."
Graduate Student,4,I liked the moments of peace inside of passionate classrooms. It was hard to find engaging math teachers.
Freshman,4,"Broward professors WANT you to succeed and leave with you degree, broward provides tutoring and other on campus assests  that you can benefit from in the long run"
Freshman,4,"I am a first-time student at Broward College starting online classes next month for anatomy and physiology. In normal circumstances, these classes are taught in person. A camera and audio will be required for classes. The college website provides several FAQ-style related information. Great for those trying to be prepared for upcoming classes and navigating online classes."
Niche User,4,"Currently, I am enrolled in the dental assisting program. Since COVID-19 has disrupted our normal learning patterns, the professors have done everything in their power to make it as comfortable as possible to learn remotely. We have many programs to talk daily, if we need to, to our professors through apps such as Remind Me, and face to face learning with D2L. They have made it very possible to learn with these resources."
Sophomore,4,"Attending Broward College is not like I am going to Mars, everything is close by and it is welcoming. It is not a ginormous school, so I do not have to walk blocks to get to my next class. Although I wish the numbers on the buildings were brighter or more noticeable so I would not get lost looking for the classroom. I also wished there to be a map in the middle of campus because that would help a lot of freshman. The campus itself is taken care of, it is very diverse and with different age groups too. Even though it is not a very big school, more food options would be in everyones' benefit in the cafeteria. To add on, whenever I need help the admissions office are always happy to help, too."
Sophomore,4,"A good experience, they are very hands-on with trying to get new students acclimated to the new environment. Its a bit tough to find good teachers."
Freshman,4,"overall, Broward college is a good college, I am just entering college, therefore, I do not know much about it but I like what I have seen so far."
Freshman,4,"In my opinion, like all online classes are sometimes really boring, but with my little experience with Broward college I can say that at least the people there makes it more enjoyable"
Sophomore,4,I liked the variety and prices of the classes. The art department is very inviting and with high tech equipment labs.
Alum,4,"Great experience, had professors that actually cared, went to Central campus mostly and it felt cozy. Felt safe on all campuses, libraries were nice and had easy access to computers. Just graduated with my AA and ready to move on with my collegiate career!"
Freshman,4,My online experience went very well and everyone knew what to do and they made that transition easy for those who have a hard time using electronics.
Junior,4,I took all of my classes online. If you’re willing to put in the extra time to teach yourself and have outside resources in learning more about the class then I highly recommend. If you’re someone who need hands on learning please take classes in school.
Junior,4,"It has overall very good. However, I did have some issues with receiving help in some of my classes. A majority of my teachers were on top of their class and very interactive with the students. But some were harder to get a hold of and less understanding when it came to major issues which ended up in me failing a class and losing one of my scholarships. Granted I probably needed to be more on top of my work, but teachers should want to help their students pass instead of make it easy for them to fail."
Alum,4,"My experience with Broward College has been good for the most part. I have more good experiences than bad with professors, along with the faculty. However, there were times when I felt that there was miscommunication amongst the staff and the few bad experiences were discouraging."
Freshman,4,This school has a lot of activities and other stuff you can join. It is very diverse and it's a nice campus.
Freshman,4,All my teachers made it very easy to complete all the work and turn it in. They were always here and ready to help.
Freshman,4,All of the professors were knowledgeable! I’m new to everything but I could tell I’ll have an awesome experience in Broward
Freshman,4,"I was there for a rather short, but I did enjoy my time at this school. The teachers were nice and helpful, and campus was small easy to keep track of where everything is."
Freshman,4,"I was there for a rather short, but I did enjoy my time at this school. The teachers were nice and helpful, and campus was small easy to keep track of where everything is. I didn't use the online."
Freshman,4,"I joined Broward college at fall 2019. So far, it’s very reliable and awarding. The classes are affordable for someone with low income. The teachers have been great so far. I’d recommend it to all my friends and family."
Senior,4,"It’s a good college, you don’t pay that much so you can’t expect much. I did my AS with them and currently working on my BS. If I had to choose again I will still be at BC. They have a lot of options for classes and campus."
Senior,4,"I almost took half of my classes online, but I got some bad experiences where the professors were taking too long to grade or it was not properly order. Overall it was good and they do have a lot of options"
Sophomore,4,"Great school! Every school has their prod and cons. People in the office are often rude however you won't have to deal with them often. The counselor are great and reach out often. The campus is large, the food in the cafeteria is actually decent. You have about five different options/places to choose from."
Freshman,4,Broward college is a great school to start off college. It gives a great experience of the college lifestyle close to home and is very affordable.
Freshman,4,Great professors foster a great learning environment where people can be up front and honestly about their issues in the classroom when attending broward college.
Sophomore,4,I attend Broward College online school and it is the most flexible and convenient option for me. The interactive database is easy to navigate and I assure you all your questions will be answered. I love how smooth completing assignments are and how the professors are always ready to help. With major self - discipline  you can be ahead whilst going over feedback and reviewing what to improve on from your professor. If you’re comfortable with teaching yourself I strongly suggest Broward College Online. You can also visit campus and get hands-on help as well. Making use of the many resources available to you will definitely help for the near future.
Sophomore,4,Broward College is a great starter college. If you are looking for something inexpensive and still close to home it is your go-to. For returning students continuing education that may have started and not finished this is also a great place for them. The environment is very engaging and supportive. The only thing I would change is the variety of degrees they offer. Although they may be only a community college I belive expanded their course variety could help in their enrollment.
Sophomore,4,Broward college is a community college it is a very affordable way to get a higher education. Most students attend this school to transfer within 2 or 2 1/2 years. The professors I have had so far are really good thanks to rate my professor. If you need an affordable college to go to than BC is a great option.
Freshman,4,"At first I didn't like the idea of community college, but now that I go to Broward there are so many activities going on and the staff is very helpful and want to see you succeed. It's a great school."
Alum,4,"I’ve had a pretty good experience at Broward college, I attended from 2015-2018 and am now returning to school in New York. I really like the cleanliness of Central Campus & the accessibility to all the tools we need to succeed."
Junior,4,"It's a very good college experience. If you prefer a more one-on-one experience with professors and a smaller classroom, Broward College is great for that."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Broward College was average, but the students are really nice so don't be afraid to ask for directions. The school campus is very big and well kept. The campus is really quiet and peaceful. Cultural diversity was fair as well. The class sizes are excellent, and most classes are hybrids so the work can be accessed anywhere. The professors are always on time and ready to go. During instructional time, the information being given is straight forward. Their tutoring sessions are great as well, 24/7 help.  I really enjoyed my time there. Looking forward to next semester."
Freshman,4,My time at Broward College was pleasant. Classes were easy to complete with the exception of one or two stubborn professors. The advising department were extremely helpful when it came to answering my questions. Overall I recommend new high school grads to spend a year here getting their feet wet in a low cost college setting.
Sophomore,4,"I have had a very diverse experience at Broward college. During my two years attending, I have had the chance to meet new people, encounter learned professors who taught me a lot and have been present at Broward’s very exiting student life events. What I enjoy most about this school is it’s enriching opportunities to learn given that there are so many campuses that are easily assessable no matter where it is you live, as well as it’s wide variety of programs that is offered to students, allowing everyone’s preferences to be met. Though Broward college is such an empowering and intellectually inclined environment, it’s parking can pose as an issue for those who find punctuality to be of importance."
Niche User,4,"My overall experience at Broward College has been positive, I like their numerous student life activities. BC has a welcoming vibe that I enjoy, the students as well as the staff have been quite nice people. I wish there wasn't as much construction, though I know it can't be helped at the moment. The teachers have been clear and fair with their expectations, which helps me focus on succeeding ."
Sophomore,4,"During the time of my stay at Broward College, the level of impact that the institution has brought me was tremendous since it gave me an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and reach for higher lengths when it came down to my education. The assistance that the school has to offer through their student services and resources left a feeling of reassurance and eliminated my hesitation to ask for help."
Sophomore,4,"It's very affordable. There are many campuses to choose from which makes taking classes and getting a reasonable schedule is very convenient. I think it's more of a commuter campus but the teachers are super helpful and there's always someone that will lend you a helping hand. It's a really great community college, ESPECIALLY if you're someone who isn't sure what they want to do for the rest of your life, you can choose classes and not have to spend a billion dollars on it."
Sophomore,4,"Since I applied to Broward College, I felt welcome by the staff; as well as, the professors. My experience there has been good, because I feel good with the people that surrounds the campus. I never had a bad experience to be honest."
Niche User,4,"I took it through dual enrollment and for the most part, it is a pretty good college. I only wish that the classes had a bit more structure."
Sophomore,4,"The best thing about Broward College is that for many students, if not for this shining school they wouldn't be able to graduate and have a post-secondary degree. For that alone it should be lauded."
Freshman,4,"It's my freshmen year in Broward college which has been a blessing. My imagination about college has always been awful, thinking it may be difficult but so far it's been easy sailing. The professors I have taken are sweet and care for an individual's education."
Freshman,4,"Broward college is a good stepping stone for university and saves a lot of money. The professors are a hit or miss, some are always willing to help you some just don't teach and want the day to be over. There are many clubs and opportunities for leadership, but most clubs are unorganized and the people who run it lack creativity."
Niche User,4,I like how the school offers many resources to help students succeed academically. I would for the school grounds to be more taken care of.
Alum,4,"Broward College was a great experience. There are a plethora of different campus options spanning south Florida, and the schedules are extremely flexible, allowing all types of work schedules to be adhered to. Online classes are easily enrolled in and offer the same academic benefit as in class sessions. Professors are held to a high standard and respected."
Freshman,4,"I go to North Broward campus. It's very close to where I live,  so location is on point. The teachers there are great they push and challenge you to be the best student you can be. Always lots of feed back during classes that will help you learn. I believe this campus has the best counselors so you know exactly what classes to take. They will absolutely point you in the right direction to reaching your academic goals!"
Sophomore,4,The school is set up very well and I've found it to be a fantastic experience. The only issue I have is the number of classes offered per course. If there were more classes offered I would be able to be more flexible with my schedule.
Junior,4,Great college for the price. Could have slightly better professors but most of them were great. Never really had any trouble here at all.
Junior,2,Soo soo horrible. Certain professors are handling it well but student assistance through online is enough to give 2 stars.
Sophomore,2,"Took me 3 years to complete a 2-year degree here, all because the staff continued to mess up my course schedule and not give me the classes I wanted to take. Each semester, they would end up canceling/not offering a class I needed to take for my degree. And each semester, I had to go visit the dean of my department in order to get new classes substituted for the ones I couldn’t register for (she was literally one of the best people I dealt with here, too).

Most of the classes I took were decent enough though, but a few gave me issues for one reason or another (for example, I had a class where the professor just up and vanished a week before finals, and we ended up not being able to take the exam because he forgot to get it set up with a proctor beforehand).

So yeah, I would really not recommend going here, even though the prices are pretty cheap. The issues you may come across are just not worth it."
Sophomore,2,Very hard to find good teachers and the good teachers tend to be very sarcastic but are willing to help. School doesn’t care about your schedule outside of school.
Alum,2,all the want to do is to mess people up and make them stay in school longer by not giving them the right classes and telling them they need this instead of what the student actually needs
Sophomore,2,I loved how the campus was so accessible but I would like to see the professors put more effort into their students and understanding them better.  Would also love to have the professors know the new programs Broward College works with for online homework.
Sophomore,2,"I liked the cost of the courses, but my overall experience has been horrible. Financial aid cannot get anything right even when you are ahead of due dates. Advisors are a complete waste of money since they don’t really help and broward college is lowley funded for the help of the disabled. If I can elaborate financial aid has lost my documents, given me false information for changing applications, and dropped my classes numerous times for the account of financial aid kicking in late even though I turned in all my correct documents. The system is messed up and unprofessional to a point they do not care if you have good professors or money to pay for school."
Niche User,2,My experience with the advisors was horrible. They do not care for the students are not proactive and drag their feet on everything.
Junior,2,I'd like for immersive majors that relate to Music and courses that cater to that demographic of student.
College Senior,2,"Personally, I do not like online courses. I prefer someone describing the information to me and a book to hold in my hand. From the classes that I was required to take online though, they were okay. Being able to focus on such things at home though can sometimes be challenging. As stated before, I just prefer the real classroom experience"
College Junior,2,Right now I haven't taken any classes towards my intended major because it is my first year .
College Senior,2,"The courses was based on memorizing, and class sizes 300 plus in each class. One professor for certain subjects was offered."
College Student,2,Broward College does not have Biology as a major which upsets me.
College Junior,2,there is nothing here besides anotomy anf physiology that ill need..
College Junior,2,I never got advice on that .
College Senior,2,I was told that the marine engineering program was going to be in the morning. After fall they switched the program to evenings.
College Freshman,2,You are so much more on your own - I ended up dropping the two I started last semester.
College Senior,2,It's not very advanced. Not much job activities about.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I attend North Campus, for the most part, it needs a lot of work. Some professors are amazing; others are terrible. One in particular, Elyse Steiner, had a problem when I opposed something she was trying to ""teach."" Apparently having an opinion in her class is not allowed. She does not teach, she reads off of a power point, which is not teaching. She may be educated in biology but has zero ability or skills to be a professor. On the other hand, a professor named James Stewart, was an outstanding teacher. He made the student really think and open their mindset, had class discussions daily and sincerely listened to students. As far as the rest of the school, like I said before, it needs work. The advisors, except for one, act like you are bothering them if you have ""too many questions."" Trying to find out the status of your financial aid is equivalent to pulling teeth. The dean is constantly.nowhere to be found. The school website is down every other week. I am so happy to be transferring to another school, and to finally be done with this one."
College Sophomore,2,"The problem with the online courses isn't limited to just Broward College. The general system across the board is using outdated, badly put together software that just cannot hold up with the quality of education that is promised. Online education from other sources online have grown and advance exponentially in recent history and should be observed to be mirrored."
College Junior,2,I would not g=choose to go to BC again. I just feel like it doesn't motivate you to better yourself in anyway.
College Junior,2,"The courses I took were straightforward. The professors were not so good. Majority of them, I felt, didn't even want to teach. You really have to search for a good professor in order to challenge yourself. The courses offered were okay. Not too many because it was a community college but it was enough for you to finish all your studies and transfer with ease."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process was annoying. BC kept constantly messing up my financial aid and kept overcharging me for things which, at times, made things very difficult for me. They were never clear whenever I had asked them for help and I felt like a nuisance whenever I did ask anyone to explain things for me. The value of my education, I feel, was not worth the tuition I paid because most of the time I felt that the professors didn't even want to help the students. There were only two professors my entire time at BC that I actually felt that they wanted us to succeed in every way possible."
College Junior,2,Broward College didn't have a helpful career center. The people that worked there usually didn't show interest in helping their students succeed so I didn't enjoy being there and asking people to help.
College Junior,2,"At the school i graduated from, academics were decent. The professors weren't the best, the class registration process was easy and the workload was easy so that's something that I wish was different."
College Junior,2,"My experience with financial aid was not very good...

Was only offered loans though I have exceptional financial need"
College Sophomore,2,"well for the culinary program there was only one person you could talk to about the course and some of the classes that were required for my program were either not offered or only offered once a year so they had to be substituted. for the major in my transfer program class, most of the classes that i needed to take weren't offered here and there were no worthy substitutes here."
College Freshman,2,I've been trying to go to school but have not gotten any financial help
College Sophomore,2,I receive very minimal financial aid and have to work very hard to save up the rest of the money to pay for my classes. I find it unfair how some students who have no internet in the class or show any desire to learn get extensive amounts of financial aid.
College Senior,2,"They don't warn you that your acedemic history, no matter how long ago, can affect your Financial Aid. I took classes there almost 10 YEARS AGO, and because I moved and dropped my classes, it's affected my ability to get aid. Not just that, but no one tells you, ""Here, this is what you have to do to get/ keep aid."" I just get an email half way through the semester that I don't have it. Bullshit."
College Sophomore,2,I will never take an online course at BC again if I can help it. The programs are shoddy the set up isn't easy to use or work on. the discussion forums are ok but everything else is not that great.
College Senior,2,The price is nice but it gets high sometimes.
College Junior,2,I had to fight for the scholarship that was awarded to me and then taken away 2 semesters in a row. Without any explanations financial aid made changes on my account and then it took numerous e-mails and phone calls to get the answers. The scholarship was finally awarded 2 weeks before the end of the semester. Huge headache and terrible communication.
College Junior,2,The registration and admissions are not friendly towards students. Some workers are rude and abrupt while students trying to complete the registration. They do not provide with a lot of useful information about financial aid or other steps to a new student. You just have to learn as you go from your own mistakes.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I honestly never had an online course and never will, because I prefer to be in a classroom interacting with the students and professor and have a live contact with them."
College Sophomore,2,"Dont really like,they are not really clear in what direction your supposed"
Recent Alumnus,2,I didn't like taking my online course because I never heard from my teacher. I would email her and wouldn't hear back until I mailed her back two more times.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very bleak, bland and quiet during normal class hours"
College Sophomore,2,"It is bad in the sense that there is a long wait and a complicated system. Also, that all the information takes awhile to actually process and get put into the system. Most of the time, the information is giving a deadline to be done, it usually is not done until after the deadline by a few weeks."
College Sophomore,2,Library smells like there is mold in the walls.
College Sophomore,2,They don't go over it much. You have to schedule an appointment and ask the counselor.
College Freshman,2,"When it comes to finiancial aid and tuition its not so great at broward college. To go to school full time for one term its 2,000 without books. They say i make to much for financial aid and or pell grants to i have to apply for scholarships which they do give to me but end up taking away because they say they run out of money which sucks!!!"
College Senior,2,They are not very helpful with that area.
College Junior,2,the advisor didn't have much helpful information. just told me to get a loan
College Freshman,2,Everybody is pretty much the same.
College Freshman,2,Getting the extra financial you need is hard.
College Sophomore,2,"Just feel like a place to learn and leave no place to really associate with others, everything is outdated."
College Junior,2,"It's not bad bad, but its bad as in there only limited amount of centers that pops up when it comes to networks and jobs ."
College Freshman,2,I WASNT ABLE TO GET ANY FINANCIAL HELP DUE TO MY LEGAL STATUS SO I HAD TO SEARCH ON MY OWN.
College Sophomore,2,"The data base is not 100 % accurate. One time I was taking an online test and noticed I selected the correct answer which was clearly right out of the book. The auto grading still marked me wrong. I don't know whats the accuracy rate for there data base but online classes do not make me feel satisfied with my grades. The professors are not help when it comes to questions. You have to try your extremely best to self learn. If you have not previous knowledge on a subject, I would recommend traditional face to face classes."
College Senior,2,This school needs to improve a lot in customer service. Train their new employees and old employees on how to treat students. Its a turn off to go to a place where you need help but you don't get it because of the lack of customer service. 
College Senior,2,"I am going to Broward College just because is not as expensive as many other schools. i wish BC would be better at customer service and treating others(students/customers) with more respect and patience. Most of the employees need to take happy pills.         they are always rude and never want to go above and beyond for anyone unless you know them. However, I also dont want to put the whole school down because there is that 2 or 3 people that would do anything for you.  I hope they put some attention to this matter. "
College Freshman,2,I don't know much about anything
College Sophomore,2,What you would expect from a community college. 
College Junior,2,I wanted to go to PBSC but BC was cheaper...I got what I paid for.
College Junior,2,"Nothing special, liberal arts so I can transfer. Decent workload."
College Junior,2,"My professors were okay but I've heard others are hard to get in contact with, ironically."
Recent Alumnus,2,there are many events that go on throughtout the month. different clubs doing activities and student life hosting events always makes for something to do 
Recent Alumnus,2,actually online classes are a lot like regular classrooms. many teachers are avaible on campu or on email 
Recent Alumnus,2,the campus is very nice and fun. theres always something to do 
Recent Alumnus,2,everything is very simple and easy. teachers at certain campuses are really helpful while others dont. 
Junior,1,The financial aid office is so far from helpful. They don't care about students at all its like talking to a wall. I know of other students who are also having a bunch of trouble with them. What a disaster.
Freshman,1,"My advisor has missed 2 appointments with me with no warning. Their online school system is a buggy mess and their IT department is a joke. They close tickets with no resolution and then tell you to use IE which they don't support. Half of my classes kick me out due to the teacher's connection status. Even before the pandemic, I showed up to class only to find out that it was switched to an online class and was somehow more expensive. I got a call that day from the finance office telling me to pay up or they would drop me. Then the teacher didn't even show up for three days and constantly changed the syllabus The administration is subpar at best. I tried to switch advisors and was told I had to switch majors to do just that. This school should be reworked from the ground up. Terrible place of learning by far."
Freshman,1,"The online system D2L is a buggy mess. Classes drop constantly. I've submitted help tickets for various issues server issues which I screenshot and provide all details of my browser settings, version and even the results of their self tests. The tickets ALWAYS end up closed with no solution or solutions that don't work. I've even call the helpdesk only to be met with less than professional responses and unprepared techs."
Sophomore,1,Online classes at broward are do it all on your own kind of deal . Teachers don’t reach out to make sure everything is well or if you need help they are always late .
Junior,1,"IF YOU HAVE FOREIGN CREDITS AVOID THIS COLLEGE! 
They will tell you to bring them in, to evaluate etc THEY WASTE TIME so you move towards the end of the degree and then tell you that are not accepted! HILARIOUS COLLEGE, I spent A lot of money for CERTIFIED TRANSLATIONS AND EVALUATIONS that they asked and then nothing!!!!!!  This is a Customer Retention Strategy (to suck you in with a promise, keep you as much as they can and drop the promise close to graduation) DO NOT FALL INTO IT IF YOU HAVE FOREIGN CREDITS, THEY WONT TAKE THEM (OTHER COLLEGES DO)"
Junior,1,"Well, my experience with this place is horrible they treat you so horrible and joke at your expense.  The staff needs to be respectable for there actions and them wasting your time and money."
Niche User,1,"I went to the location downtown  and met with Admissions advisor Oscar. He was awful. Very sarcastic, almost condescending. Since I’m not a student there he didn’t seem as though he cared to speak to me. Very short, I had to pull information out of him. Just a terrible experience. Before I went in, I called to see how I should go about speaking with an advisor, at which time I was told That walk ins are accepted from 8-4pm. With only 1 person in the waiting area when I arrived and left, and one advisor (Visibly working) Oscar was sure to let me know that “students who make appointments are priority and now that student(The one that was in the waiting area once we finished our 10 minute “advising session” had to wait because he (Oscar) was helping me.” Just a terrible experience. Wish I could give him a zero."
Senior,1,"Worst advisement ever. Not only do the advisors and employee of Broward College not know any information or answers they do not even know who would be able to help you with your issue or schedule.   They will lie to you about the credits certain course are just to be told later that it was for nothing or for a entirely unrelated event.  They misinform you almost every time you ask an employee a question.  They are so unorganized and theres no one in charge and educated for you to actually speak to.  Disgraceful college, the professors also no not care about if their students understand. Professors have admitted to purposely confusing us and not knowing the subject they teach themselves."
Sophomore,1,I would like to see more teachers who are more hands on and who actually care about their students passing.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't received much help.
College Sophomore,1,They partner with a few colleges and if you plan on applying somewhere else they aren't much help.
College Senior,1,"In some classes the online workload was a lot. The program Aleks was the most painful online program. If you got a question wrong it would give your more questions instead of giving the same question with different numbers. You have to keep up with the work online, because there are different times assignments are due. The one unfortunate part is that some assignments were opened up for a day and a half, and you had to complete it before class."
College Senior,1,School did not let students know about job fairs or such to help with their major or career.
College Senior,1,"There were test available to determine your major, but I had to search for a major of my interest."
College Junior,1,Hate it I feel like I was drowning in work .
College Junior,1,There aren't too much that BC offers
College Freshman,1,I'm only rating it poorly because I never qualify. I need financial aid so bad and I see people who don't need it get it so it's frustrating.
College Student,1,"I loathe online classes. The teachers always have too many students to deal with so it's difficult to get in contact with them if you need to. The work load is excessive, monotonous, and too easy. I don't even consider online school to be real school and I hate that taking an online class is now a requirement to graduate high school. They differ in every aspect of traditional school. You don't build a real relationship with your teachers, they don't seem to really care about you, you never do that much useless work in a traditional classroom, traditional teachers have more control over what they teach and generally have the final say in what work they assign, whereas you have to do the state assigned assignments with online classes, even if they are of little relevance to the lesson. It's awful and I hate it and I wish online school had remained a, ""last resort"" option or was completely optional."
College Student,1,WiFi is horrible through out the college. Each time I have to turn of WiFi on my mobile phone so it won't try using it.
College Junior,1,Maybe its my major but online class is terrible. I've never experience suck online class experience like this since the last time i took one in high school. For computers i advise everyone to steer clear ! you have been warn !
College Sophomore,1,"Well the school offers a beautiful campus, the school has variety of people. And most important of all the school has fantastic staffs "
College Senior,1,"Financial aid office is hell. They could be better on giving resources to students instead of just saying "" Sorry we cant help you"" Fee are ok. In general school is too expensive but if it was free nobody would be appreciative. "
College Sophomore,1,I was wrongly charged for a class. They wont let me register or transfer until I pay. 
College Sophomore,1,I was enrolled in a course I never knew about. They charged me for the class and gave me a 0. Nobody will help me. I have called every one. NOT FLEXIBLE AT ALL.
College Sophomore,1,Can't get a spot in any programs!
College Sophomore,1,I've only enjoyed a class or two. I am usually miserable with the courses.
College Sophomore,1,I do much better in a classroom setting. I like to interact with my professor and have my questions addressed without waiting 24 hours. 
College Junior,1,DON'T EVEN BOTHER. JUST SAVE UP $1800/SEMESTER AND PAY FOR IT YOURSELF. THEY SUCK. SERIOUSLY. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
College Junior,1,I like the old people who are coming back to learn as opposed to the young whippersnappers who don't take it seriously. I'm 19 btw.
Recent Alumnus,1,the wifi is pretty bad but the computer labs and printing is very good
College Senior,1,The financial aid process is ridiculous. The staff will call you everyday over stuff the FA staff should deal with. They make you show up to the school thinking something is wrong with your FA when there is no problem. This year FA was messed up for a lot of people including myself. I'm very disappointed about that.
College Senior,1,The student body is comprised of people who go to BC that had horrible grades in high school and found BC a way to claim that they're in college. Again I keep to myself and do my own thing.
College Senior,1,Well mostly from what i hear the Nursing program is good there. But other than that nothing really important.
College Senior,1,I haven't done any work in my major. And that is what i hate about BC they make you take all these stupid classes you don't need just to get to the major you want to do. 
College Senior,1,There is nothing unique about Broward College. I wish BC was a good school to get an education instead of going there to play around. Everything BC offers is what they offer. You can't change it whether you're disappointed in the college. 
College Junior,1,Broward college computer networks always crashes and/or resets. 
College Junior,1,I have not take any online classes at Broward College because I prefer the classroom experience. I'm a better learner when I'm in class and listening to the teacher. It provides me with a better understanding of the subject I'm learning.
College Junior,1,Student body consists of people who smell like weed or just haven't showered. Everyone acts like they're better than the rest. It's really annoying to walk to class when people are rude & inconsiderate. If you open the door for someone its common courtesy to say thank you. I avoid going to campus at all costs.
College Sophomore,1,its terrible it took me a year just to get into the school because of financial aid
College Sophomore,1,You didn't have time to do anything on a timely manner
College Sophomore,1,"My instructor wouldn't help me her words to be exact was if you do not understand this is not for you,"
College Junior,1,I never really got the college-y feel at Broward. Nobody ever talks to anyone else and you pretty much keep to yourself the whole time. There isn't much student body activities going on either.
College Sophomore,1,I wouldn't say there's anything unique about Broward. It serves its purpose of giving me an education.
College Junior,1,"financial aid is the worst, they dont help you to apply for financial aid nor to get scholarships and instruct you on were to look for them. tuition is expensive for a community college and if you work and make 20K+ annually you wont get financial aid"
College Freshman,1,"I am a resident and will not give me residency... I don't live with my mother but i am not ""old enough"" or ""make enough"""
College Junior,1,"The Career Services department is always unavailable.  You have to make an appointment to meet with them.  The annoying part is that there's never any avaiiabilty.  When I did talk to a career advisor she didn't help me at all.  Her only answer is ""Look at your interests and I dont know what to tell you""!  I am still  confused on what i want to do."
College Junior,1,I have not started at the college yet but the man I spoke with was very unhelpful
College Junior,1,"The professors within the faculty body is an utter dispointment. They do not get involved within their student body. Faculty need to inhance with their professionalism. Throughout, changes are must needed."
College Senior,1,"The people in the Financial Aid office should be working at Burger King because that's about how good their service is....They just tell you to go online for any questions or anything, NOT HELPFUL in the slightest."
College Junior,1,"I would like for the professors to spend a little more time to spend on tutoring. I understand we have tutoring in the schools, however the way some professors teach is different. For example, I have a math professor who shows a different way of showing us how to do a problem. I go to tutoring and the tutors are showing me a different way"
College Junior,1,"They do not help at all. They tell you to go on FAFSA and leave it at that, the center is packed and they still dont help at all."
College Sophomore,1,"I wouldn't do it again unless I have no choice, and it reminds me of high school: unprofessional."
College Sophomore,1,"Review BC – My experience at broward college has been a roller coaster. Registering for classes has been a headache the staff is extremely slow and they're NO help the teacher that I've had was wonderful, other then that I'm so frustrated with the school and I don't need a school that isn't interested in helping me progress with in the school. A college should honor there students, I come to better myself, but it's almost impossible to talk to someone, and once you do they are uninterested and disconnected. Overall I am ready for change in a professional environment. The reason why the grade was so high was because of the remarkable teacher I had."
College Senior,1,"Be Patient and Apply Early. The financial aid office is very unorganized. They obviously don't care about the students, and it's always a mess. Have your FAFSA ready, do it online. They will ask for your parents or your own taxes for the previous year. If you don't have any, you need to get a letter from the IRS that says you didn't file (that takes two weeks on the mail or they can fax it to you). If you want a loan, you will need to fill in their multiple paperwork. Remember to go there early, so you don't have to stand in line with 50 other students and waste a whole day. Check your myBC constantly. They typically disburse the financial aid package once the deadline for paying is up. If you don't have all your paperwork in order, you can re-register and wait until they pay for your classes. Be patient, and don't pay your classes for yourself unless there is no more space in a class that you really want to take because they take forever to disburse to those who pay their own classes. Also, they wait until the last minute to release information for the upcoming semester, so except to be running around from office to office if you have any issue. Do the legwork and stay calm."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It Can Be a Headache – Even though I get the paper work in on time it can still be hassle. From actually receiving money, if I can even get it. Also when you have questions about the situations the advisers can be unhelpful, sometimes."
College Senior,1,"last term when i was supposed to get financial aid the school snow balled me. also they charge for parking for online students.you mean to tell me you stay home and they charge you. my sister had financial aid and they covered her class only at the end of the term bc billed her and she hasnt been able to take classes for two years, she is still paying them. and she didnt even fail her classes"
Recent Alumnus,1,"When it comes to financial aid, this school doesn't help at all. FAFSA may say you're eligible but this school will say you're not. There can be 2 people in the household and the parents make 50 grand combine, the'll say your parents make too much money."
College Junior,1,"Community College – being a community college, it is not very well equipped for the purposes of post associates students."
College Junior,1,I applied for financial aid but did not recover it because my dad makes too much but they failed to realize that he has alot of kids and we are all in college
College Sophomore,1,"Great Fight – The education that I am getting is something that you would call standard.  Some professors are excellent while some have no educating skills to speak of.  So as long as you don't mind spending quite a bit of time researching teachers, you can get a great education.  The way that my school does the financial aid is horrendous. I spent hours in line waiting and waiting multiple times and was told that I needed to get more information that I was told I didn't need to have. The school does not offer any credit and the refund deadlines are absolutely horrible.  For someone who makes absolutely pennis, I got denied any financial aid and had to jump through hoops just to get a loan. The school does not provide any credit while your financial aid is processing and if you do not have it, you will be denied."

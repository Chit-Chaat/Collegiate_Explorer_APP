Freshman,5,I did not take any on line classes on line at Central State University but I plan to take some during the 2020-2021 school year.
Junior,5,The online classes are easier than face to face classes.  Sometimes it’s hard to get someone on the phone. There are options for getting online help if you need it.
Freshman,5,Central State University is a small but very diverse HBCU. If you are one that need more one on one time with your teachers and smaller class environments then Central State is for you. There’s literally so many activities and Organizations to join you won’t get bored.
Freshman,5,Central State is an amazing school and I would totally reccomend people to go there. Amazing professors and a good environment.
Freshman,5,"The online classes was not as bad as I expected them to be. The online classes were actually amazing. Yes, we had some bad point during the online classes but other than that everything else turned out good."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Central State University. This is a great Historically black college because the professors really care about you. I'm a returning student and the professors always make me feel like I haven't missed a beat. They take time to help you rather than just fail you. The school is very generous. The renovations that have been makes the school look excellent. I am so glad I will be graduating from this school.  You just feel at home at Central State University. You walk on campus and find the best things. I remember being in class and out of nowhere I looked out the window and there was a stage set up. They had a random step show! That was a really nice image to come to after a super hard class. I recommend any and everyone in the midwest to check out Central State. This is really a friendly, effective school. I would like for them to add more online classes, Dayton campus and more evening classes. That would be the only negative I have on this school"
Niche User,5,"This college has always been my number one college I want to attend since I was in 5th grade. When I went there to tour it was very nice, the teachers, staff, etc was very nice and informative. I loved every bit of Central state and hope to be attending there fall 2020"
Senior,5,This HBCU has changed my life for the better! The programs are great and the class sizes are even better.
Junior,5,"Central State is a great university, I have learned for much in the two years that i have attend. I'm looking forward to my upcoming junior year."
Sophomore,5,"Central State is a great environment. They truly care about you and want your to do big things . They give you a lot of information and the important steps that you need in order to pass and move on. If you ever need help, talk to someone , they are willing to help."
Works Here,5,"Loved the hbcu atmosphere
loved how everyone was friendly to people
Everything was great, no need to change anything"
Freshman,5,"I like how helpful everyone has been. I have received a lot of help when needed.  When I have questions there is always someone to offer help or at least guide me in the right direction to some one capable of helping me. If there was anything I would change is the things offered to do during our down time.I would like to see more activities offered on the weekends. The party reputation that Central once held is not true for 2019 school year. You would have to travel off campus for any activity. I would like to see more dances, concerts, plays, etc ."
Sophomore,5,Central State is the #1 HBCU of all times. It's easy to find friends and people to hang around. There are a lot of organizations you can join and lots of fun.
Sophomore,5,Central State is what you make it. If you stay in your dorms and don’t do anything and just got to class it’s definitely going to be boring.  Get out and get involved.
Sophomore,5,"I love central state university, the students at the school are great and they have a lot of organizations for you could join. The professor is very helpful when you ask them for help. Overall Central State University is a great school, but the only thing I would change is how they handle certain situations"
Junior,5,"It’s very fun if you are involved. Even if you are not involved, it’s a pretty great school over all. It’s like a big family here."
Freshman,5,I love Central State University because it’s a family type of college . For an example if one person has a problem the next person is right there to tell them it’s going to be ok . My school has very good school spirit a lot . I just wish the school was in the city because it’s hard looking for a job in country area.
Niche User,5,I love central state university .  I simply love it because it isn't to far from home and its not to  big .  They are here for students and willing to help anytime needed.
Freshman,5,"I have been attending central state for about 1 month; so far i am in love with the college itself. Most of the professors here are foreign African so it is a little hard to understand verbally, However,  The curriculum is at a understanding pace. Here on campus everyone is inviting you to what seems to be a family, Because the college its self has some history to it and have a strong upbringing from the past. Central State was the first college in Wilberforce to have there own 4 year program for African American Students that its self is welcoming and why I choose central"
Freshman,5,"Central State University is a great school to attend because staff and students are super friendly and helpful.  I love the open-arms feeling that I get on campus. Everyone’s friendly and welcoming and staff make sure you are comfortable. The school is very resourceful when it comes to those who need extra help. The book store has everything you could want and need to get through the day. Central State is an excellent school that anybody would love to attend because of the rich personalities, great hospitality, and wonderful funfilled events"
Sophomore,5,"I love that Central State University is an HBCU. That is why I chose it out of the other schools in my area. CSU gives a sense of community and togetherness. I've had a great time at Central State so far, I've learned a lot here. I also love the Family like bond you get from professors and peers."
Niche User,5,"What I like about this college is the social work program that they provide for students. While looking at the website, it showed all the important information needed for students who will be attending this college in the fall of 2018."
Sophomore,5,"I love central state university. I've been visiting the campus many years before attending in 2016. The environment is very great at the university, it feels like one big family. I've had so many great experiences at central with organizations, Greeks,etc. We have the best professors there and the staff there is amazing."
Sophomore,5,I Love This School.. Especially being a Football Player here. The community of the school is amazing. Professor are willing to help you at any time of the day. The party's are awesome.
Sophomore,5,Love the school it is very nice the teachers are very nice and they find time to take individual help so that you understand your assignment the school is very good in making sure that you are able to eat if your hour let out late there is restaurant that stay open so that you can use your campus of anytime
Freshman,5,Central state university is loving caring environment in which professors care about students and strive to bring the best out of everyone
Freshman,5,"Considering i'm a freshman i can tell you much. But i can tell you that i really enjoy this University. I enjoy it because your around people you have similarities with, you are taught by teachers who want you to show your potential. This can get tiring but the fact that they want to see you make it is reassuring."
Senior,5,"It has been an awesome experience! The professors are very knowledgeable and caring. They want you to succeed. The campus is close knit like a family. My major isn't History, but I've learned so much about my history just by being on campus. Attending Central State Universiry was the best decision I've made in my life!"
Freshman,5,When I first went I was very afraid because I didn't know anyone and I was far away from home. The students and school staff made me feel welcomed. I like the fact that they have free tutoring. What I would like to see change more tutors so that I can have someone's full attention.
Sophomore,5,I love the class sizes and that the teachers know me on a personal level. It is like a family feeling with other students and the school is not too big and not too small. I would love to see the relationship between the faculty and students get better
Junior,5,"I love everything about Central, especially my department, Education. The professors are great and very helpful as well as the advisors."
College Freshman,5,The Greeks do big things on campus and have fun and non greeks can even join in on the fun.
College Freshman,5,During football games most students go to the games and you will see tons of alumni. The athletic facilities need improvement because the weight room is terrible. The same goes for the basketball games.
College Freshman,5,Being on campus feels great. There isn't any crimes being committed on campus or near campus. The security makes sure that the students and the campus is safe from those type of crimes.
College Freshman,5,Non-Greek students love greek students. Greek life brings a different type of vibe to the atmosphere of the campus and it's not a bad vibe it's a great and positive vibe.
College Freshman,5,The school spirit at central is great I've been going there since my 8th grade year when my brother attended and it's always been the same.
College Freshman,5,My school is unique because it doesn't only teaches you how to become a leader but it teaches you to become a better man.
College Sophomore,5,I went out of my comfort zone by going to Central
College Sophomore,5,"It's the best, I send so far."
Recent Alumnus,5,"First, for those who have ill sediments regarding CSU is simply because they didn't make it! CSU offers a diverse group of socio economic AA's; you will get it all. The party scene at CSU is quite intense, I might add. If you can't balance an active social life and your academics you will FLUNK out of CSU, trust me so don't waste your money or time! So many students come to CSU with a belief that this will be a walk in the park, but the professors are avid disciplinarians. Don't show up to class and don't do your work, you will fail! I could have went to any university and I am beyond gracious of the opportunity and experience I was offered at CSU. Majority of the millennial alumni are proud Centralians who are doing very well in their profession, in addition to getting advanced degrees. ""If you can make it at Central, you can make it anywhere"" is the motto.

For Central For State!"
College Freshman,5,All the parties i go to are fun. Sometimes he crowd is larger than others but i always enjoy myself. I love partying wwith the Bruz of Omega Psi Phi but their basement can get very hot. I also enjoy the parties at union and the venue. Most parties there is transportation is  provided so that is plus.  Overall my favorite part about cllege is the parties and divine 9. If you can party and get your work done Do So. I partied every weekend almost my freshmen year and still made deans list. ITS POSSIBLE
College Freshman,5,There were fights at the Homecoming Dance and at a Frat party.  The participants were arrested.
College Junior,5,"Academics are absolutely central. the Art program here is prestige and valuable for future careers. The few art professors that are here genuinely care about you and prepares you for the real world. Before any art major graduates, they are required to organize an art exhibit open to the community. You honestly get the real experience when you ask questions and put forth the effort!"
College Junior,5,"As a communications major, I am learning things that some of my friends at other institutions are not learning. It could be better, but it is not bad. I cannot complain. I believe that I will be equally prepared for the workforce as someone from Northwestern University or USC."
College Student,5,It just gives me more help for school work.
College Sophomore,5,I Don't go out that much
College Sophomore,5,"Athletes are a major factor,"
College Sophomore,5,"they warn people  through emails, preventing fine"
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone's treated the same, Greek or non Greek"

College Sophomore,5,"Work load is difficult, program is amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"Police are constantly watching, don't do drugs."
College Junior,5,I work for transportation and its the best jobs knowing that you can provide students ride to place where they need to go
Freshman,4,I like Central State University and the professors and associate professors seem really nice.  There seems to be guidance and assistance if you reach out.
Junior,4,The teachers at this school go up and above for their students. They try to give students the resources they need to succeed at the course and future classes. They have also been known to start study groups to help their students practice for testing.
Junior,4,"Good HBCU, online classes are easier than face to face classes.  Sometimes it’s hard to get someone on the phone"
Freshman,4,The online learning experience wasn’t all that good in the beginning because the teachers was giving so much work at once. But once students expressed their concerns the teachers were very understanding and slowed down the work load and offered more help for students to catch up.
Senior,4,Central State moved all of its classes online during the pandemic. Every virtual resource at the university’s disposal they made available to its students.
Senior,4,"I like the cultural, heritage and traditions of my beautiful HBCU. I like the diverse campus life and the liveliness of residency on its campus. I like how invested my professors are with my education and how they stretch learning beyond class instructional time. I like the nuclear spirit of the students at events and the participation of faculty members in non-curriculum settings."
Junior,4,My experience at central was life changing. Central made me the women I am today. It made a believer out of me.
Freshman,4,It's ba great school and they review your admission quickly and really people if they are accepted or not
Sophomore,4,I have been at Central state for almost 3 years. My time here had been good to me. I have fallen a little bit but central state staff is always there to help and uplift when you need it.
Freshman,4,What I like about Central State University is the people here willing to help you through out what ever you going through. Here at Central they won’t shame you for what you have done in the past just wanting you to long forward towards your future.
Alum,4,"The lessons I learned while on the campus of Central State University will stay with me forever. I learned how to be a man, how to really dress, and also how to use not just knowledge learned in the classroom but also what I learned from just walking around the campus and viewing the history and beauty that has made me as ambitious as I am now. Going to an HBCU changed my life for the better and I would recommend anyone, regardless of race, to try to attend an HBCU with as much history as this one."
Niche User,4,I rate CSU a 4 because no college is perfect but this college is Amazing!!! This is a definite school i would love to bring me children to weigh out their options for college . i would love to become part of this atmostpher and this legacy school. its also a HBCU and it most definitely shows!!!
Freshman,4,Everyone was nice. There is not much to do other than party. It is three miles to the nearest grocery store.
Junior,4,"Central State University is an HBCU located in Wilberforce, OH. I am a Junior there and the school is pretty nice! The campus life is enjoyable and the students there are okay. Most of the classes have up to 30 students so you get a more personal experience with your professors. The cafe food isn't the good but it's doable. The parties are really lit most of the time. The dorms are okay but most need to be renovated since they're so old. Overall the school is a good school to go to!"
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Central State was amazing. I literally loved every single minute being there. My professors were amazing and caring. The food was good, and my dorm room was nice. Everyone at CSU is welcoming and caring. The only thing I would change is the wait time at finical aid. The waiting time sometime is ridiculous."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is nice, including administration and students! Athletics are very good. Night life is amazing!"
Freshman,4,"Central State feels like a second home to everyone on campus. Currently the school is making changes that they think is bettering the students. In reality, the changes  is also changing resident life."
Sophomore,4,"I loved how all my teachers helped out and they were all different races. Teachers, faculty, and students made you feel comfortable and that you could be apart of whatever you were comfortable with. The only thing I would like to see change is the cafe food. Good food was only served on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings. In the evening and on the other days it seem like they served scraps. Also, they closed the cafe to early. I think in the evening it should stay open until 8 or 9pm. College students are busy throughout the whole day and sometimes we do not have enough time to eat a full meal until late at night."
Junior,4,"What i love about Thee Central State University is that it may not be diverse race wise but cultural it's definitely a beautiful thing to experience. What i mean by that is coming from Chicago,IL and seeing other states like Detroit,Michigan, The DMV, Cail and even the Bahamians seeing how that other states or cities live and what their use to is amazing we get a good advantage to see more than just our cultural and we even have a greater one by giving off some of our cultural as well"
Freshman,4,What I like about Central State is that I am surrounded by people from different countries and even cultural backgrounds. I like that my peers are willing to go the extra mile to help one another. That the different experiences and knowledge each of us present is what makes us a Marauder family.
Sophomore,4,I really like the school it's affordable and safe.  The class sizes are small the teachers are great.  The only bad thing is the campus towing as you can't park pretty much any where without the risk of being towed. And the Greek life is kinda dead but the school is nice I love the good with the bad.
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Central State University. It's a fairly small university that is growing in size and culture. The HBCU experience that I've obtained at CSU helped me to develop a stronger pride in who I am, where I came from, and where I am going. I wouldn't change that for anything in the world."
Junior,4,"Central state University is a school of love and hate and can really push me to the brink sometimes, but as a student and a young adult this university has taught me things not even the world could teach me. I like Central State because I am around my own kind and the culture from each city that is provided is very groundbreaking from a person such as myself who has not been to too many places outside of my hometown. I find it amazing that I go to school with kids scatted all over the Midwest, and we all find a way to come to a common ground and realize we are all going through the same things but only in different regions. Central is only going to get bigger and I love the progress my school has made over the last three years since I enrolled here. Central State's only problem is space and opportunity, I would like to see my university expand and bring more opportunities to the school so nobody nor no one will feel left out."
Senior,4,"Central state university is a great school. Although just like any other school they have flaws. Sometimes I wish they could answer the phones a little more or be a little more organized but overall I love Central State University. They create a family environment and also  The faculty and staff become your family as well. I don’t really have family but, central state staff and students became my family. I love my HBCU"
Junior,4,Central State opened a lot of doors for me. The campus life is great i wouldn't trade it for the world. Central is a very family orientated environment from faculty and staff all the way to students. Since being at central i have changed my view on a lot of things about myself as well as life. I truly believe central is change and i am changing for the better and just to know that i am attending an luxurious Hbcu that many Black African Americans attended and paved the way.
Freshman,4,The school itself is great and it's nice and affordable. It's a great campus and I love being around the campus. And it's only a few hours away from Chicago.
Freshman,4,"Central State University is a great institution and it is very family oriented.  I enjoy the students, activities, and the professors."
Senior,4,Central State University is one of the only two historically black universities in this region. The campus atmosphere is amazing. CSU is my home away from home.
Freshman,4,My experience with Central State University has been very pleasant so far. I love how connected our student body is and we always show support no matter the occasion. The education I am receiving is also very good. I learn more and more every day and you can also connect more with your peers and teachers even in a classroom setting.
Senior,4,"I love my HBCU, its what I call home! I would like to see the growth of the campus expand. The campus needs an update, dorms, stadium, garden, etc"
College Freshman,4,The career center have two job fairs during the school year and the career services want you to come in to get help and improve your resume. They even have a closet business clothes if you need them for an interview and they'll let you keep it.
College Freshman,4,"The campus has blue phones set up around campus if you need help. Security is great too because if something does happen, they will make sure there are consequences."
College Freshman,4,The school unique because it has this feel of having a family outside of your own family.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great, the dorms could be a little bigger but they are great. The social atmosphere is great everyone gets along. The housing process was smooth, they made sure you had everything before moving forward with the housing process."
College Senior,4,"What's makes my school unique and so great is that with it being smaller university, you get more hands on experience with the materials being learned. You get those one on one sessions with professor. Where as in bigger university most of the time you don't have that luxury. Also, when you're grouped with tons of people who are together for a common goal is the feeling in the world because everyone wants success at Central State. I play on the football team so that makes my experience even better because I am subject to a lot more things."
College Junior,4,I want to join a sorority
College Sophomore,4,my professors have been great so far
College Freshman,4,the Greek life on our campus are great
College Freshman,4,I loved my school and everything it did for me my freshmen year
College Sophomore,4,its enforced everywhere . its always help for things lie that .
College Sophomore,4,30 students a class or less . class styles some teachers don't know how to speak proper English hard to understand them.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone vales their education and are professors push us to the extreme you have those who will say hey its your grade so go ahead and do what ever .
College Sophomore,4,Its  great being greek and all but most non-greek people would think most greek people are stuck up because thats how they tend to act sometimes . But overall i love the greeks they deff show up and show out!!
College Sophomore,4,die hard fans regardless of the score board especially when the keys comes out ..
College Freshman,4,i love the athletics i am planning to play football in spring
College Freshman,4,its okay the students are great staff could be some what better
College Sophomore,4,"I am very interested in Central State Univesity, I state this because I find the school very inviting and organized. As a music major I tried out for a few other schools, but the reason I picked Central State out of all of them is due to the fact that for one, I don't have to reside on campus, its around the corner from my house and the reception I received from Central after I auditioned for them made me feel very welcome and accepted.  I also feel that I could really grow attending the school.  The music department is great and as a choir member I will get to travel and perform in venues  all over the world.  This will help me to explore my future edndevour which is to one day perfrom in an opera house in Europe or in Japan."
College Freshman,4,I never lived off campus but they do have nice affordable housing
College Freshman,4,There are many places to choose from n town and they are all pretty  much affordable.
College Freshman,4,"The food is not the best, but its college so people should not be expecting it to be like the food at home. People  complain about it a lot but personally it's not that bad. i feel like if the severs and people taking your orders had better attitudes then the students would feel better about what they are eating."
College Freshman,4,"To me its a great school.yes its not the most good looking of colleges, but it is good where it counts. you'll end up learning much more than you thought in a short amount of time. when you look back at where you started you'll be impressed by yourself."
College Freshman,4,I had a good experience receiving financial aid for school. I had good grades so that also helped me out. I had more than enough money to cover my entire year. I suggest to every student coming into college to spend their second semester of their senior year filling out as many scholarships. It really does pay off in the long run and it is money that you won't have to pay back in loans.
College Freshman,4,"I like the party aspect of the campus. At parties, everyone comes together and just wants to have fun. Te transportation provided is a plus. Everyone always has a way to get to and from the parties at no cost at all. The DJ is a Central State University student so he always knows what to play. I feel that parties are a good way for students to meet and become close to other students, whether they go to the same school or not. I encourage everyone to attend parties, as long as they are able to balance their academics as well."
College Freshman,4,"Great friends, easy to maintain grades, nice major, housing is pretty good, everyone is generally nice, food/shopping options could be better"
College Freshman,4,"Political Science: Opportunities, Workload not hard, Curriculum not hard, Facilities not hard to find"
College Freshman,4,"Most people are active and have plenty of friends, many are not focused on school work until grading time. Almost everyone is friendly and some are a little wild. Upperclassmen are not mean or unhelpful. People help each other."
College Freshman,4,"Political Science: There is the Pre Law society to help you have access to potential law schools, the alumni sometimes are around to connect with and then there are teacher connections. Workload so far is pretty nice but not to much."
College Freshman,4,The only thing I'm scared of on this campus is the animals around it. Maybe a fight breaking out.
College Freshman,4,"Many times the greeks will throw a party or event, SGA does Ice Breakers that are fun, most  off campus parties are fun and have transportation provided so most people can have fun."
College Freshman,4,"Not very many options for majors compared to other schools. Most of my professors are great and I learn a lot in school. Workload is average, doesn't require much studying just the time to type up the assignments. Library or room is good for studying but most people I know study in groups in someone's room or the lobby of dorms."
Junior,2,"I have only had a couple online courses at this school. Sadly they do not offer online classes for all classes. This tends to make going to school difficult for those who commute, work, and family."
Sophomore,2,They don’t care about you. They care about your money. There are very very few professors and admin that might take the time to understand and better you. Other than that your on you own. I’ll be transferring here soon.
Freshman,2,The staff are unprofessional and rude. They often misplace files and documents at the cost of the student.
Sophomore,2,"Late with information, not reporting incidents on time to parents, false information, and food is terrible."
College Senior,2,"Crime is bad here at Central State University, theft and fighting are among the most high."
College Senior,2,"The dorms and hallways are not very clean most times, and there's not much structure and enforcement in them. Also most of the buildings are very old and out-dated."
College Senior,2,I have no comment on this subject because I don't know very much about it.
College Sophomore,2,Some professors didn't even show up to the classes most of the time.
College Sophomore,2,"Dirty, plenty of bugs. No rules are followed. Lots of drama."
College Sophomore,2,No one had team spirit. The team wasn't that bad but they weren't as great as they should've been.
College Sophomore,2,It was a little challenging having little support from professors.
College Freshman,2,I feel like the environment that I am in will not lead me down the path that I wish to go. often I'm asking myself am I really being challenged or am I being pampered. I feel like I am being disciplined everyday for other students mistakes and it makes me feel like I am not getting the full college experience.
College Freshman,2,Their are plenty of places to eat about 20 min away in Xenia but for those without a car it sucks because we aren't really near them. Only place for potential food is Speedway. No place will deliver to our campus other than a Chinese food place and Cousin Vinny's. The cost is okay but if you don't have a lot of money it's not like there's a McDonald's dollar menu in sight. Off campus food quality is bad because it's so unhealthy and repetitive.
College Senior,2,The gym is out of date. Some gym equipment is broken.
College Sophomore,2,The basketball team is probably the best team we have and has the most support. The football team doesn't get as much support even though students are there to cheer them on they don't win a lot of the games that they have which drives a lot of people away from wanting to attend the games at times. The football program is getting better due to a new head coach being hired so I feel that things are looking up for the football program.
College Junior,2,"People and administration would tell your and your parents how they make sure the campus is safe drug free, and free of crime but truth is they don't. There has been riots, fights, deaths, and a number of other things take place on the campus that should have never taken place."
College Junior,2,The most bi-polar weather you will ever experience. This weather could get you sick quickly if you have a weak immune system
College Junior,2,"When students park on the curb, the police are quick to give out a yellow slip for parking violations and tow cars when the student only parks there for a couple of minutes."
College Junior,2,The Athletics Schedule constantly conflicts with the student life schedule making it impossible for me to go to the games and show school pride. The Football team is at a rebuilding stage from losing more than one coach and trying to adapt to a new strategy. Basketball team is improving on their skills however they lose their determination within the half of the game and stop playing.
College Junior,2,"We have Greene Cats which provides service from our campus all over Xenia. This bus cost $1.50 one way and comes every hour and a half Mondays-Fridays. I have taken it in town, it is a little time-consuming but I will do it again if need be."
College Junior,2,"The only two places that will deliver to Central State's campus is Asian Buffet and Cousin Vinny's Pizza. Neither restaurant is expensive, but neither is my favorite. The food is edible but it's nothing I necessarily crave. It's usually something I eat on Friday nights if I miss the cafeteria dinner."
College Junior,2,"The weather is a bipolar roller coaster. One day it is sunny, 60 degrees spring-like day and the next it is snowing and 30 degrees. A lot of times when it is warm, it is rainy. So be prepared for crazy temperatures that might possibly get you sick."
College Junior,2,"As I stated before I am a non-traditional (older) student, so the dress codes of today's youth is some what disturbing to me to say the least.  I believe students should dress for class as if they were going into the office, with casual day on Friday."
College Freshman,2,The Wi-Fi connections aren't that good especially in the dorm rooms. The best Wi-Fi connections are in the library on a good day. Other than that it is hard to find a good connection.
College Freshman,2,The weather here does affect the campus experience. When it snows classes are often delayed or cancelled depending on how bad it snows.
College Freshman,2,"The policy enforcement is in place, but a lot of people still have a way to get access to alcohol and other drugs."
College Junior,2,I met good people in my life
College Junior,2,Not too many restaurant and so far
College Senior,2,I no longer go out. 
College Junior,2,"There aren't many places around campus to eat at we are kind of in the middle of corn fields. I guess you get kind of tired of eating at dining halls, but when you need something to eat between classes, you can't complain. Central State dining hall food is not all to bad, it just gets old sometimes. I suggest not buying a huge meal plan after freshman year, but if you don't have a car you should plan on getting the meal plan."
College Sophomore,2,"Snows and rains a lot here.But when its nice out, you can find about 3 cook outs going on along with other activities."
College Junior,2,"I was okay, I had received a decent amount to help but not enough over to get books i needed for my classes. A part of the aid wouldnt let me make changes I needed because I already started it and to try to get enough aid back. Maybe the next time I would ask for more help from the financial aid officers."
College Sophomore,2,You can find all sorts of students on campus but I would watch out for guys who aren't focused on their studies.
College Sophomore,2,"From what I see and hear they are ok, but I have no real knowlege of them because I have only  lived on campus since I have been attending Central State University"
College Freshman,2,It gets very hot and cold at Central State University. Classes are hardly ever cancelled but there are a few delays. This is sometimes annoying but you have to take what is given and move along.
College Freshman,2,"As in the rest of the world, most people are stupid and selfish. However, amidst the hordes, you can find genuine, intelligent individuals that aren't bad looking either."
College Sophomore,2,The freshman dorms at poorly kept up and so is the upperclassman guy dorms. The rules and also dorms change every year.
College Freshman,2,"The guys here are complete idiots. They are only interested in immature things. The girls are crazy. Its an HBCU of course so expect everything that would see at home, here."
College Freshman,2,Our school athletics are average. We're good but we can do better.
College Freshman,2,It's very wacky it can be hot one day then cold or rainy or snowy
College Freshman,2,The Campus only knows what is told. If no one says anything a situation will not be addressed.
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small town, so being from the city I enjoy it, the only problem with the town is sometimes you have to watch your back because citizens are well as police can be racist (although Central State students get blamed for things we weren't even around for)."
College Sophomore,2,"To get a decal is cheap, $50 a semester I believe. The issue with parking is that there tend not to be a lot of space to park during the day and if you park illegally or do not have a decal, do not be surprised when you get a ticket or you car gets towed."
College Senior,2,Finding off-campus housing is very easy. There are a lot of affordable apartments around the school and they're very close to campus. A lot of the apartments are listed with government assitance if you qualify as well.
College Sophomore,2,"It all depends on where you live. Honors dorms Fox and Johns are the best since they are only one year old. They are also the only co-ed buildings on campus. In these you live in a suite with 4-6 people and you have private bathrooms. Freshman girl dorms (Foundation Hall II) are also suites with private bathrooms. Upperclassmen girl dorms (Foundation Hall I) used to be co-ed so it's a little worn out. All male dorms are cold a lot because the heat doesn't kick in until October 15. In the Freshman male dorms (Williamson and Hunter) have community bathroom, which make them a little unclean at times."
College Junior,2,There are a lot of spots that are reserved that don't get used at all.
College Freshman,2,"Course Conflicts Are So Frustrating – There is a class that I have been waiting to take for a year that is offered at the same time as choir. I get a scholarship for choir so I can't miss that class. I can take the class at another school, but knowing myself, it would be better if I could take it at my own school. There are many teachers that are willing to move the class to another timeslot, but because this class is for my major, it can't be moved because there aren't enough people to take that class."
College Freshman,2,"Honor Dorms Are the Best – The freshman dorms at Central are okay. I lived in Foundation 2 and it is a suite-styled dorm which is pretty nice. It has 3 rooms and you share with a roommate each one, there is a living area, and 2 bathrooms. Honor dorms are luxury dorms they are the best dorms on campus. You need a 3.0 to reside in those but they are limited."
College Freshman,2,"Off Campus Partying – There are some things do at this school, but not much. If you go into Dayton there are much more party's and bars to go to. The city here are mostly for older folks not young people."
College Sophomore,2,"Food: Sometimes Good Sometimes Gross! So dining at Central State can have it's up and downs however.. It mostly has it's downs! Mercer Cafe is SMALL and there are not many food options to choose from. About 1500+ students stay on campus but there is only seating for about 500 students... This can become a big problem.. The food is OK.. The best days are chicken WED and Fish Fri which A LOT of students turn up for. The cleanliness could use some improvement, a lot of the tables are nasty when students leave them and this put more strain on the cafe staff. There are 2 other places for students to eat but usually are crowded and they sometimes run out of food since they don't serve buffet style meals. Central is trying to improve so that's a plus!"
College Freshman,2,"Boys are not allowed in all girl dorms, but I wish they were. That's childish."
College Freshman,2,"Free Van Service – Specific times are posted for drop off and delivery to specific areas for shopping, dining and entertainment. Van does not stick to their schedule. Central State is in a rural area. Only thing within walking distance is a Speedway Gas Station."
College Sophomore,2,Not as strict. However athletes can not go to any off campus parties.
College Sophomore,2,"Parties are mostly held in the Gym or in the laundry area, unless you have transportation then you can venture off campus to Dayton Ohio."
College Sophomore,2,The atmosphere is quiet the nearest town is about 20-30 minutes away. There is no where to shop in our area other than the Speedway.
College Sophomore,2,Foundation Hall – I feel like the dorms are roomy however the hall and elevators at time have urine in them and I feel like the security of the dorm should be more secure. There is not a dorm monitor so pretty much anyone can come in and out.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life on campus is really small, i haven't heard of any Greek party's or events for people to attend."
College Freshman,2,Black Students in a HBCU – there are mostly black students here. there are a few white students but that is about it.
College Junior,2,our finacial aid service could be better in some aspects . as far as communication with the students and their own staff.
College Sophomore,2,"Rural area but about 15 min away from dayton, ohio"
Niche User,1,Never got a chance to try. They wouldn’t communicate with me in timely fashion about their requirements.
Niche User,1,The admissions office took three months to inform me that I had to take pre-requisites at another college before I could take the business program. They NEVER respond to phone calls or emails. I finally found out just a couple days before the semester started that I had to take classes elsewhere and was very fortunate to be able to do it. Now they won’t tell me if I’m even in the right program. BEWARE of CSU!
Freshman,1,This was the worst experience of my life and it made me extremely depressed that I transferred from Central State University after my first ever semester of college.
College Sophomore,1,No one seemed to care. I felt unsafe. Security never really paid attention.
College Freshman,1,The people are always up and loud being inconsiderate of others
College Junior,1,"If you are apart of the LGBT community then you should feel right at home because more than half the campus is either openly or secretly gay, or bisexual. Also there really isn't any diversity there are probably about 10 students that are not black attending the campus as a whole. Majority of the campus are ""Christians"""
College Junior,1,"Life on campus is very depressing and this is coming from someone who ""got involved"" as far as organizations, social events and forming friendships. So don't let anyone tell you that you need to get involved because sometimes that is worst. Also there if you are not a party animal, or greek their is rarely anything for you to do on campus. Careful not to get sucked into the night life at Central because that is usually the only fun their is unless you plan to stay in your dorm every weekend. Nothing surround the campus so there is really no where else to go and nothing to do. Food is garbage, people are sneaky, cut throat, out for themselves, liars,  and thief's."
College Junior,1,"If you are a vegan or vegetarian then you will not have really anything to choose from except a little salad bar that has brown salad, and not so fresh veggies most of the time."
College Junior,1,The central state university transportation was recently cut out of the schools budget because there was a liability notice for work-study students driving the vans recklessly causing the transportation man to lose his job. Now students have to rely on taxi-service which cost entirely too much for college students and a bus shuttle that don't come at a convenient time for off-campus students which forces commuters to leave class early. I recommend you have your license and drive yourself.
College Junior,1,"How are we supposed to get our schoolwork finish when the wi-fi disconnects every five minutes, the printers in the library have been broken for weeks, and the computers break down it seems as soon as the wind blows. Thankfully, I have my own computer, but I feel bad for the students that don't. This is utterly ridiculous and something needs to be done about it."
College Sophomore,1,Off campus dining is expensive 
College Junior,1,Cafeteria food is just digusting
College Junior,1,Their no off campus housing at Central State
College Junior,1,I feel off campus students and employee should not pay for parking permits
College Senior,1,:-(. Sodexo is a horrible company.
College Senior,1,"There is the cafeteria, taco bell, and they're the grill 155. The cafeteria closes at 7pm and the food is not good at all. Most of the time you will get disappointed. Taco bell closes at 8 or 9pm. That's just like a regular taco bell with only limited things you can get using your id to swipe for it. Grill 155 is a burger place, closes at 11pm and again there are only limited things you can swipe for. Not to mention you can only eat 3 times a day because that's all your card will allow you to swipe!!!!!"
College Senior,1,"Campus housing is not at that great. They have new dorms that are ok just a little small, and they're far away from class. Not really a good option for the winter."
College Senior,1,Off campus is far you will need a car. Driving in town there are only fast food. You would have to drive 15-30 minutes away just to go to a decent restaurant.
College Senior,1,"Food is not good, and there is not a variety. The only time worth going to the cafeteria is for chicken Wednesday's and Fish Fridays."
College Sophomore,1,There aren't any clubs nearby. You have to travel to Dayton or Columbus if you want to have a good night out without seeing the same people all day.
College Junior,1,I attend a HBCU so my University is predominantly African American but its a few different races here  but you know people would have there own views but far as what I've seen it hasn't been anything as bad but their are ignorant people out there.
College Sophomore,1,Students are required to have a student parking decal. If they do not then they receive a ticket and cars may be towed. The decals are roughly between $30 and $50.
College Sophomore,1,There are no programs but the students are told that not to and if they get caught they just get in trouble
College Freshman,1,"Tastes terrible, low quality, limited options. Get a mini fridge, milk and cereal to get by; ramen noodles are a staple as well."
College Sophomore,1,"Most places that do deliver, won't cause they are scared of blacks. You have two options Cousin Vinny's or Asian Buffet, unless you have a car then you have chain fast food, Perkins, and Roosters...unless you're willing to drive to Fairborn."
College Sophomore,1,"No one really seem to care about this, in fact I have people that live right on my floor in my residence hall who I can smell marijuana almost every night."
College Freshman,1,About 85% of Central State University smokes.It is supposed to be a drug free school but the authority does'nt step up to make a change.
College Junior,1,"The food is sometimes goo but at times the food can make you sick,literally and figuritvely."
College Sophomore,1,"A lot of people drink and smoke marijuana here. I have heard of a few cases where students were popping pills, but it usually sticks to alcohol and marijuana, sometimes mixed together."
College Sophomore,1,Don't use it if you don't have to. Most of the time they are late taking us to and from Walmart and Kroger and they promise to take students to the airport and bus station during breaks but most of the time do not provide service or they deny a student based on the size of the bag they are carrying.
College Sophomore,1,"One word, schizophrenic. In the morning it might be warm and sunny and by lunch it's cold and rainy and by the late afternoon it might be warm again."
College Sophomore,1,Police don't do anything unless you are parked illegally or bring marijuana on campus then they want to ask like police officers. Rarely does anything get resolved for serious offenses.
College Sophomore,1,"They claim to be strict and they are harder on freshman, but typically you can do whatever you want to without punishment."
College Sophomore,1,"It's very repetitive and inedible. If you are a vegetarian like I am, you will get stuck eating flavorless pasta or veggie burgers and fries everyday."
College Sophomore,1,"It's an HBCU so it's like 90% African American, with that being said I feel as though if you are of another race, or of mixed descent, people will tend to single you out or they will be overly kind to you, to pretend that they are not racist."
College Sophomore,1,"Half the time the computers on campus are not working properly, or there is no printer connected to them. If you do find a working computer, 90% it's occupied by someone who is one Twitter or Youtube."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus shuttle takes students to Walmart, Kroger, and K-Mart or Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It is free, but only comes like from 2-5 and most times it is late to drop students off. Greene Cats Public Transit is worse. It only comes like every 2 hours but only .50. If you don't get your bus, you could get stuck in Xenia. Taxis are reliable but it $5 for the call plus $2 a mile, so a ride to Wendy's end up being $12."
College Sophomore,1,"Marijuana is very present and it is not hard to get some. Alcohol is prevalent too, but you have to go off campus for it, since this is a dry campus."
College Sophomore,1,Campus police are never around when something actually happens. They are more concerned about giving out parking tickets than protecting students. I almost got raped at a party and campus police who were supposed to be there for safety did nothing about it.
College Sophomore,1,"The food on campus can be so much better. The best servings is on Chicken Wednesdays and Fish Fridays. That is about it. The norm is salad, chicken sandwiches, and pizza. You are going to get tired of eating the same things."

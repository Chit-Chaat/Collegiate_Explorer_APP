Sophomore,5,"JBU is a great school with excellent staff and faculty. The campus is nice and not too big. Academics are challenging, but usually interesting and informative. Staff members are always willing to help and everyone is very nice!"
Freshman,5,"The people there genuinely care about the success and well-being of their students. No one is alone in anything they go through, as the campus and people are open and inviting."
Sophomore,5,"Online was great because I prefer to do online classes. It was a great experience, and I hope that we go back online this coming semester."
Junior,5,"I am currently taking summer classes online right now, and the course work is doable and not very hard. It depends on what classes you  are taking and the professors your taking them with. So far, the summer classes are going great."
Junior,5,The community at JBU is like none other! They really practice what they preach in regards to loving one another and living out the gospel. There are opportunities to grow personally and with friends as well as in academics and fine arts.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love JBU! It is an incredibly supportive community that focusses on building each other up and helping each other grow in Christ.
Senior,5,"John Brown University is a school full of caring professors who will desire nothing short of growth for you. As an online student, the classes are very structured, and you cannot mentally check-out. Paying attention and learning is a must, and because of that, you get what you pay for."
Sophomore,5,John Brown is the definition of community. Come visit us and ask us about Chippy P and Warm Cookie Wednesday
Niche User,5,I have been for two visits and recently received admission offer. Such a beautiful campus and the overall atmosphere is so desirable. I love the opportunities provided for students as well as the overall mission for Christ!
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and the integration of faith in all my classes. As a biology pre med major, it was really important for me to continue learning without forgetting where it all came from. And all the professors and students have constantly reminded me as has helped me grow."
Sophomore,5,The community is wonderful. Everyone here is so friendly and we are all like a big family. There is little to no drama and the professors treat you like their own children.
Junior,5,"This college has allowed me to do all my classes online, at my pace. Though it is on the expensive side, it is worth the money. I am hoping to graduate in a timely manner and its been a very interesting time. Getting to know teachers and doing things in a timely matter has taught me to be more productive."
Sophomore,5,"John Brown University is a happy, welcoming, diverse school. The professors care greatly to make all their students feel comfortable and confident about their college experience."
Sophomore,5,As a non-traditional student John Brown University was the best choice when I decided to go back to school.
Alum,5,I enjoyed John Brown.  My class in the advanced program was great. I made some great friends and memory's.
Freshman,5,"If you have the means to go to a semi-expensive private school, I would recommend John Brown for sure. The professors are all great, the dorms are great (I was in Hutcheson), and Siloam Springs is an adorable town."
Freshman,5,"I am a 2nd semester freshman at Johns Brown University, and I have loved it so far! It has a beautiful campus and is located in the little town of Siloam Springs. I know that it is a very cliche thing to say, but community is definitely one of my favorite things about John Brown. John Brown has been expanding its programs, and has a high academic expectation, keeping to a good level of challenging while not being too hard. It has met and exceeded my expectations of good academics, engaging student life, helpful professors, and good friends."
Graduate Student,5,The admission department was so helpful. There were more than willing to be able to be reached and answer any questions had. There wasn't ever a time that I didn't send an email or make a call with the admissions department that I wasn't reach back and answered in a timely manner.
Sophomore,5,"JBU is a genuine, godly place with a friendly community and professors who care about your individual education. The academics are challenging, and it's not hard to have an intelligent conversation. Not to mention, the area is so beautiful!"
Junior,5,They teach every subject from a Christian world view. Teaching their students how to I corporate faith into everything. They work with you on fanicial and academic issues.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to JBU. I am a general music major, and I love every single one of my professors. The atmosphere here is amazing, and I can't wait to spend the next 3 years here. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate, and downtown Siloam Springs is a wonderful place to spend free time."
Graduate Student,5,"This is an excellent school that has wonderful, caring instructors, and a great atmosphere for learning. All the students that I have met are super nice, and always willing to give a hand when needed."
Alum,5,"I loved attending John Brown University. I did feel, however, that my professors did not help much with preparing me for applying for grad school or future jobs. This is one of the promises stated during enrollment and one of the things that helped me to decide to attend JBU, so I was a bit disappointed."
Freshman,5,"I have loved the community here at JBU.  Our teachers really care about us and are willing to help whenever I have questions.  They sincerely want us to do well.  The school is not intent upon forcing us to believe certain things, but giving us the ability to make up our own minds and grow as individual people."
Junior,5,The teachers always have time to help each individual student due to the small class sizes. The people you deal with on campus are generally all around decent people and really make it a really good experience.
Freshman,5,"I was a transfer to John Brown this semester and everyone here is so welcoming and kind. There is always a faculty member or staff member who is able to talk when you have things going on or need assistance. The classes definitely challenge the student, but the professors are available to help and want you to succeed! There are plenty of ways to get connected on campus."
Freshman,5,I love JBU. They were quick and helpful in answering all of my questions. I wouldn't change anything about except maybe have a little better financial aid package.
Junior,5,"The professors are wonderful and so invested in you, your education and your future. The focus on Christ is uplifting and really helped me focus on the Lord and grow as a person."
Freshman,5,"There is no other college that I would want to go to. The environment here is fantastic! All of the teachers are completely invested in their work and in their students. Sometimes I wish there was more student activity and involvement, but there are still many activities to attend to. Chapel services and the spiritual connection is great."
Junior,5,"John Brown is unique among Christian schools for its total commitment to open-minded discussion on campus about even the most difficult and controversial topics. The school is big enough to have real connections and opportunities for its students, and small enough for students to really engage with the professors and staff. As the guy who convinced me to go to JBU told me, you get out of this school what you put into it. I love John Brown."
Sophomore,5,"I love JBU! The location is perfect for enjoying the outdoors, and the professors really want you to learn. What's not to like?"
College Student,5,The Application process at JBU has been the best. Everyone I have talked to has been so helpful. I have had access to advisors at all times. I ven had my very own parking spot when I went to go visit the campus!
College Senior,5,"The professors are experts in their fields, care about students, and work hard at their job."
College Sophomore,5,There are always events for students to get their foot in the door with recruiters and businesses.
College Sophomore,5,"Very, very good.  There are few incidents."
College Sophomore,5,Dorms are amazing! Great place to live.
College Freshman,5,Professors are so helpful and caring so long as you put in the effort
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe at my school. Its on the smaller side and we have round the clock Campus Security. They drive around, have guards in the main buildings to just watch over along with cameras. I don't have a fear of sexual assault at JBU."
College Freshman,5,"These professors are so passionate and experienced in their field. It is incredible to just hear them speak in class because their knowledge on these subjects is astounding. I'm excited to learn more and granted, I don't particularly like some of the professors, but every college has that."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Walker Residence and its heavenly. So spacious and there aren't a ton of people on our hall. I'm located right in the center of campus and some of my classes are even in my building, so it makes it very convenient for me. The California Cafe is also in Walker and that makes me very happy."
College Freshman,5,"The teachers genuinely care and want to help you, the school is small enough that you get to know most people, but large enough that you can get lost in the crowd if you need to, great events/speakers come all year, and the community on campus is awesome."
College Freshman,5,Class sizes are reasonable. Profs truly care about you. They really do want you to succeed even if it doesn't always feel like it. I love JBU.
College Freshman,5,JBU is home. There is now place I would rather be.
College Freshman,5,Higher and more challenging academics than normal!
College Freshman,5,Really great preparation for the future
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel very safe on campus with our security and the updates I get on my phone.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love my school because the professors make you feel wanted and they help us figure who we are in the troubling time.
College Sophomore,5,Everything about this school is designed for me to succeed. I appreciate that ever course requires an evaluation at the end of the semester and that the evaluations are taken seriously by both the administration and the professors.
College Sophomore,5,"I couldn't imagine myself at any other school. I had a very rough first semester because of circumstances outside of my control and the entire school community, including faculty, surrounded me with support and understanding. The school shows a real desire for the students to succeed long term."
College Junior,5,"It is one of the best school experiences that I could imagine. My dorm has been one of the most forming experiences in my life; my best buds there will stay friends with me for the rest of our lives. I even met my girlfriend there. The teachers are brilliant, and take timeout of their off-duty hours to personally help you succeed. The president of the school is loved by all; we are loyal to him."
College Freshman,5,I love how everyone is so welcoming of the freshman and goes out of their way to make JBU home.
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus, it is so much fun. Everybody is friendly and the RA's are great."
College Sophomore,5,I was granted more scholarship from JBU than any other school I applied to.
College Senior,5,"I love the Construction Management program, the teachers are great and really teach you a lot about the field of study we are planning on going into."
College Senior,5,Internships vary widely from commercial construction in the field or office to residential construction and even international missions internships. Pay varies with the job but all jobs offer great unique experiences.
College Senior,5,Most professors are very great at teaching their subject. Best professors usually are in your major courses. They are very knowledgable and care about your learning and creating a relationship with you.
College Senior,5,For my major (Construction Management) companies come to visit us to interview with us and most of us have had two internships by the time we graduate.
College Senior,5,The Financial Aid office is very helpful with trying to find scholarships for you and seeing how you can apply for more aid. They are also very friendly and want the best for you.
College Freshman,5,"I live in the oldest dorm on campus so my dorm is slightly outdated compared to the rest of resident life. However, the university updates building frequently and keeps them beautiful. My dorm is close to campus, really relaxing, and very social. There is great community life in my dorm as well as great respectfulness for dorm mates. The RAs are very personal and really drive each hall's social atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,"Siloam Springs is rated one of the best small towns in the Nation and it has lived up to it. Its the sweetest little town I have ever seen. The shops downtown are really friendly, unique, and eventful. There are many city events and festivals which most of the college students attend. So far it has been such a homie and relaxing stay."
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any online classes. I have friends and teammates who are currently taking summer classes online and they said that they are different than traditional classes for sure, but they enjoy them."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are great at John Brown University. Since it’s easy to have a personal relationship with them, I am more engaged to learn. John Brown offers a small and unique community which helps you grow as a person. Life in the campus’ city is not exciting or entertaining, So if partying and entertaining activities in the city are important parts of college for you, then John Brown is not the place for you"
Niche User,4,"Although I have not yet attended the school, the help out with anything that is needed in the application process, make sure that I have everything that I need, and provide and help that  I may need. They are always there to contact for any support and/or questions that need to be answered."
Sophomore,4,Going to John Brown University has been wonderful. There is a close-knit community of college students which makes classes much more enjoyable. It would be nice to have a larger variety of all-campus activities.
Junior,4,"The environment is amazing and the people here are great. Chapel is an awesome part of the school's culture. The food could be a lot better, but other than that, most of the professors are great and very passionate about their students' learning."
Senior,4,"I am going to be a senior this coming fall, and so far I like JBU. I love all of the professors, they are always willing to help when I have a problem and its easy to have strong relationships with them. The dorms are nice as well, they all have great communities. Plus, the campus always feels like a safe place, I can walk from one side of the campus to the other at night with little fear.  My major issue is the lack of diversity on campus. Many people on campus can be extremely conservative (this goes for both students and faculty). To some, this may not be an issue, however, it's not great for someone who thinks outside of that ""conservative"" box. Something as simple as calling myself a ""feminist"" can ruffle some feathers. For those in the LGBTQ+ community, this school continues to believe their lifestyle is completely against Christian values. Consequently, many that identify as LGBTQ+ might run into some problems."
Sophomore,4,"If you desire an education that puts Christ at the focal point, then this is the best university I know for you. John Brown chooses professors who desire to teach in a way that will prepare their students to use their gifts to glorify God. They've got the best art program I've ever experienced, and everyone on campus is aware of how important each major is to serve in Gods kingdom and better the world. 
However, if you are a person who wants to party in college, John Brown is not for you. John Brown only requires you to not participate in things like drinking, gambling, premarital sex, or anything that might lead you to participate in those things for the time that you are enrolled at John Brown. 
I've never seen a college like this. Everyone I've talked to who has experienced public colleges says that they are relieved and refreshed by the JBU environment. It's very hard to find a place like this in the US. I've had the best experience."
Sophomore,4,I really love the professors at this school. The campus is beautiful and the buildings are almost completely updated. Some of the programs need more resources. I love the school as a whole.
Junior,4,"The students here are focused and don't get distracted. They put they're work above trivial matters. Everyone is friendly and invests in the lives of those around them. The small class sizes here allows easy one-on-one discussions between students and professors, leading to greater rates of achievement."
Sophomore,4,"I am loving John Brown so far! I am currently a sophomore photography major. Transitioning to college is hard, but John Brown has made it much easier for me. The community of students and faculty is amazing! Everyone is so nice! The professors are so helpful and always willing to sit down and talk if you ever need anything. They genuinely want to get to know you as a person. Campus is so beautiful! It is a great size because its not too big to where you feel lost, but its big enough that I feel like I can always have the opportunity to meet new people"
Senior,4,"I have truly enjoyed my time at JBU.  I have learned so much and have been able to make great friendships.  The Professors at JBU are top notch, they are kind and professional.  They enjoy what they do and it comes through in their interactions with students and other faculty.  The only thing I would change is to offer more scholarship opportunities.  The cost of attending is out of reach for so many."
Senior,4,"I am so grateful for my own experience at JBU- my professors have been phenomenal and I have experienced so much growth. My friends of different racial or sexual minorities have not shared this same positive experience, which is my only real cause of concern."
Junior,4,I love the community and campus activities. It's nice being able to walk into the cafeteria and know that you'll know someone.
Senior,4,"John Brown University is a small, private, Christian university full of friendly, helpful people. There are many majors to choose from ranging from Outdoor leadership to Nursing and Engineering. There are four major dorm buildings two of which are co-ed as well as a handful of town houses and apartments for upperclassmen. The faculty and staff boast many award winning professors, researchers, and authors. Graduate schools adore JBU graduates due to their preparedness for the real world and real world problems."
Junior,4,"The people really do make jbu. The professors work together with students and other faculty to make the most out of our time at the school and there aren’t many colleges out there where the class is small enough for the professor to make dinner for and actually have a real and lasting relationship with their students! Overall, I have loved JBU and my experience there!"
Junior,4,My three years at John Brown University have been pretty fun. The classes aren't too big and I get to meet people who for the most part have the same beliefs as I do. JBU is a small but comfy campus that is relaxing to walk around.
Freshman,4,"Great college. Professors are very engaged and genuinely care about the students. Very small class sizes, which creates a close-knit environment. The tuition is high, but it is a very good quality education. One complaint is the meal plan. There are currency 3 different meal plan options. They differ in the number of meals per week and amount of DBD's usable in the campus cafe'. However, each meal plan is the same cost! You cannot get a cheaper meal plan until you move out of the regular dorm.  The meal plans are expensive. Overall, great college! Definitely recommend."
Alum,4,"Proud and thankful to be a JBU grad! A Christ centered and hugely supportive faculty and staff was just what was needed as a middle aged single parent returning to school with small children. I was challenged, educated, and encouraged to become my best over the entire 4 years. An unfortunate mistake occurred by one department and person only upon my graduation (cum laud) that put my name wrong in employment packets and prevented me from being considered for employment, when I and my kids needed it the most. It took over a year for me to find out why my packets were being discarded, as they spelled my name different ways on the different documents sent out from JBU. I forgave and moved on and eventually fixed it all and got a job, but it shouldn't have happened at all. That is my only complaint about the school and entire experience."
Senior,4,"JBU is an excellent school for those who prefer a private, faith-based college experience with fairly rigorous academics. With a student body of about 2,000 and quick access to the city's downtown, JBU facilitates close-knit community both on campus and between students and the local community. Many owners of small businesses are alumni of JBU, and many students become employed in the Siloam area prior to or upon graduation.

JBU is very expensive, and though the academics alone do not sell me on the investment, the relational rewards have almost compensated for the hefty tuition. The faculty are friendly and mentoring, and many are eager for personal relationships with their students. This is key to the flourishing of students, and greatly aids their success both in studies and in networking for internships in their field.

Overall, if you can afford the financial investment, JBU is a good place to be if you enjoy a small town, a close community, and an environment of faith."
Freshman,4,"JBU has changed my life, even though I am just a freshman I have already met some of the greatest people. I have been challenged in my faith and pushed to go further with relationships. JBU does not just focus on your education but your spiritual and physical walk."
Senior,4,"A rigorous, yet fun, university that is constantly improving majors, campus, and education.  The professors are the greatest asset to this university; they are professional, highly qualified, and genuinely concerned with their students' success.  
It is an investment, but staffed with people dedicated to ensuring finances do not limit a student or their experience.  
A beautiful campus with plenty of amenities but still small enough to feel easily accessible.  Located in a prosperous area of Arkansas, in a small town with great people."
Senior,4,John Brown is a great school! I feel I have learned a lot during these last 4 years. Professors encouraged and cared for me which helped me become a great engineering student with a lot of practice with hands on experiences.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at JBU. I know many people say this about their professors, but they actually care. In my physical, mental, and spiritual struggles, the professors have been willing to talk and help me with more kindness and willingness than I ever expected. I also love how I am pushed to try my hardest, think deeply, and integrate what I learn to other areas of my life."
College Student,4,"Campus crime is very low here. With a relationship with Jesus being a common thing with most students, almost everyone has good morals and knows the difference between wrong and right."
College Student,4,Everyone I know that has graduated from JBU has been able to get a job quickly. The internships are great and the career services ar so helpful.
College Student,4,Living on campus is great. You are always close to class and the dorms are good sizes and clean. Especially if you get one of the newer dorms.
College Student,4,JBU has great team sport a s well as intramural sports. The team sports are important but don't overshadow the rest of the college experience. All students are encouraged to participate in sports in some way.
College Senior,4,JBU has a reputation and has been voted number 1 Christian College in the South. A degree from JBU comes with the expectation of quality work and commitment to the job as alumni have proved.
College Senior,4,JBU has worked hard to create a safe environment. We have procedures and actions in place for a variety of situations and the campus is safe.
College Senior,4,"Overall, my experiences at John Brown University have pushed me beyond what I thought I could achieve, encouraged me to pursue excellence in my academics and spiritual life, and have given me opportunities to meet people that have become instrumental in my development."
College Junior,4,I love to learn and JBU really fosters that. They challenge us to take courses that will help us in our majors but also just in life. The professors are personable and try to get to know you. The faculty and staff are there to help students and always provide as much help as they can. The classes are small and so there is a more personal feel to them.
College Junior,4,JBU does a great job of trying to prepare us for a job after college. They hold career fairs and bring in outside professionals from many different companies for us to meet and get to know. They want to set us up to succeed. They help us to get internships and make valuable connections.
College Junior,4,Our campus is very safe. I have never felt unsafe while being on campus. As for sexual assault that question is hard because so many people don't want to believe that it happens at Christian Schools. I think my school could do a better job with explaining Title IX to its students and also providing more awareness that just because this is a Christian campus doesn't mean sexual assault isn't real.
College Junior,4,Because it is a small school I feel like I get a very personal experience. My professors are great at being one on one with students when they need something.
College Sophomore,4,Almost all professors are great.  I have had two bad experiences with adjunct professors.
College Sophomore,4,Teachers are great.  There are too many resrictions
College Freshman,4,There's a handful of diversity on people but everyone is welcoming
College Freshman,4,"As an Illustration major it is already difficult to find jobs, but the Career Development Center is so helpful and really genuinely want to help people. They know how to get you started and on your way with your major."
College Freshman,4,"I am an Illustration major and sports aren't really my thing, but my roommate is a soccer player on the Varsity team and she always has so much to tell when she comes back from a game. Also, you can't miss the AMAZING toilet paper game we have for our first home basketball game every year. Its on ESPN. We're cool like that."
College Freshman,4,"I've loved the experiences I've gotten to have here at JBU. From being in Cinematography major's films to visiting art galleries right in the school every month or so. It's incredible to experience so much at this school and all of the people they bring in to chapel is phenomenal. Lecrae even spoke to us in chapel and JBU has great connections. JBU doesn't have one bad major, they have stronger majors and good majors, but not a bad major. I feel very blessed to go here and I know this is the right school for me."
College Freshman,4,"There are a few stories of sexual assault, but nothing that I have heard of happening to a friend or even a friend of a friend. There are awareness and safety measures, but Siloam is generally a safe town and the campus is in it's own bubble so I generally feel safe. They do make sure everyone knows who to contact in the case of sexual assault and there is security that drives around campus."
College Freshman,4,"Basically...

Mayfield: girls dorm, great community life, communal bathrooms, building old and needs to be renovated/ torn down. Close to most buildings

J. Alvin: boys dorm: great community life, building high quality, great layout that encourages interaction, I hear they have a climbing wall in the basement, close to everything, long legacy of awesomeness

Walker: Very new and high quality, closets have no doors?!?, easy access to all of campus and same building as Cali, mail, student center, etc. less rowdy community, suite style bathrooms

Hutch: chill community life, people friendly but stereotyped as introverted, nicest rooms, furthest from most things on campus (to get to the cathedral takes 8 minutes), athletes like to room here, suite and communal bathroom options, nice lounge areas."
College Freshman,4,Crime rate is low. I feel safe leaving my laptop and back pack in the library if I need to run to the caf for lunch. I have never had any issues.
College Freshman,4,JBU is very respected. Employment is typical following graduation.
College Freshman,4,"I love campus housing. I am living in Mayfield. It is definitely an experience, but I love it."
College Freshman,4,I love being in a big dorm like J. Alvin!
College Freshman,4,Crime is low but not non-existent
College Freshman,4,"I have had good and bad but overall, teachers care"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is very academically rigorous, you have to put many study hours into your classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have had amazing professors during my time at JBU, I love the professors that work at JBU."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I loved living on campus, there was a great sense on community."
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletics department is amazing at my school they take pride academics and make sure our athletes are attending classes and looking at their futures. Our community supports the sports played and our students love attending the games. My school is also famous for the yearly technical foul that has been shown on ESPN the Toilet Paper game. I work for the athletics department and have seen the back ground works and know what our faculty does to make each game amazing.
College Sophomore,4,"Because it is a Christian school, the career prospects within the Christian community are excellent. It is hard to determine the degree's value outside of the Christian sector."
College Sophomore,4,Mayfield dorm needs some serious updates. The building itself is old and lacking as compared to the other dorms on campus. The other dorms are very up to date and nice.
College Sophomore,4,"The school has some very strong athletic traditions, such as the Toilet Paper Game, but outside of that the best athletic experiences from a spectator point of view are the club sports, such as rugby, and the intramurals."
College Freshman,4,"I think it's good because I live in the nicest one, Walker. Mayfeild and J Alvin are rapidly deteriorating, though. Hutch is pretty nice, but feels separated from the rest of campus sometimes."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of people tend to go to soccer and rugby games, but not so much basketball."
College Freshman,4,"There is minimal campus crime, and campus is small enough that there's always someone around."
College Freshman,4,"You do learn a lot, but it is challenging. You can't fall behind in anything or you can't catch up. Missing class leads to death."
College Freshman,4,"JBU has good connections with lots of big companies based in Northwest Arkansas, such as Walmart and Tyson chicken."
Alum,2,"While I made friends, enjoyed some of my classes, and liked most of my professors, the culture and education at JBU does not prepare students for the workforce. Because of their explicit faith angle, certain topics and issues are not talked about in an open and real way. Staff, students, and faculty alike are terrified to be authentic and honest lest the administration punish them. I can recount multiple times when the exploration of ideas was stifled by this fear. This hindrance can be detrimental to education. Additionally, the school's anti-LGBTQ policies and lack of diversity caused tension on campus and drove many students away. Aside from their worldview, I also found some of the curriculum to be outdated. There is something to be said about the size of the school allowing professors to form relationships with students and invest in them individually. However, they are not equipped to help prepare students for the current job market."
College Sophomore,2,"It was bad this year, but it will be remolded."
College Freshman,2,There's not really a party scene instead just hanging out with friends and doing stuff on our own.
College Freshman,2,Not really a thing but finding a good groups of friends makes it more fun
College Freshman,2,There is nobody out past 8pm
College Freshman,2,"Essentially everything in Siloam shuts down after dark, so if you want fun you have to create it for yourself."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many large-scale parties,and the ones we do have suck. It isn't to far to the U of A, though, which has plenty."
College Freshman,2,"There is no Greek life, but each hall is a bit like your own sorority, it's just easier to opt out."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are only allowed to live off campus if they meet the many requirements--therefore, it is expensive and unfortunate for the rest of the student population."
College Sophomore,2,There are mostly fast-food restaurants around campus.
College Junior,2,I have trouble with financial aide hard to talk to some of the counselors 
College Freshman,2,"I am not interested in this topic personally, but I am aware that in Siloam Springs there are no options for students who enjoy the night life. "
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing is good, but I don't understand why you would want to go off, it is very nice on campus"
College Sophomore,2,I like it but I'm sure there are people who wouldn't
College Sophomore,2,There is not a whole lot of options besides walking unless you have your own vehicle.
College Senior,2,"LOcals are very friendly, unless you don't speak English. A couple instances of immigration issues and racial slurs but not at all widespread.
As far as the campus concerned, lots of little clicks; social, racial, cultural but most students interact well with others. JBU is a school of missionaries and homeschool christian kids looking to be sheltered from partying and other indiscriminate activities."
College Junior,2,"Most of the computers are really good (mainly the newer ones with i7 processors), they're fast and it doesn't take very long to log in. The engineering computers, however, can sometimes take 5-10 minutes just to log in, plus another 10 minutes before you can load any of the frequently-used programs"
College Freshman,2,We have one dinning hall and a small cafe. The food is like any other cafeteria.
College Junior,2,Not much going on on campus at all. Drinking and partying are prohibited.
College Senior,2,"There is hardly anything in Siloam Springs worthy of calling a nightlife location. It is a dry county, so there are only two bars that I am aware of near campus. However, students are not allowed to drink alcohol while they are attending the university. Fayetteville is 40 minutes away and has a promising nightlife, but most students find that there is little time for partying hard when the demanding curriculum is taking most of their time."
Niche User,1,"I applied to JBU from a community college. The transfer guide says I'd have to take 15-30 extra credits to meet their gen. ed. requirements. I was concerned  since JBU's costs $35,000+/yr. When I asked the admissions counselor said core/major courses are taken together each year for 4-year JBU students. She looked at the classes I was taking this fall and said quote, ""You don't need those classes at all so that's 12 hours wasted."" EXCUSE YOU! They're NOT wasted classes! I specifically chose those classes for various reasons. Obviously, JBU is another school that says they're Christian, but then they don't actually treat people that way. Maybe she didn't mean for it to come across that way when she said it but too bad. You don't tell someone who's looking at transferring to your school that their hours are ""wasted."" I told her to cancel my application. I will definitely NOT be attending JBU and I advise you to not attend either if you don't want to be treated like crap."
College Freshman,1,"As far as I know, there are no parties"
College Sophomore,1,Social life is pretty quiet on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The wifi can be very slow at around 11 pm.
College Freshman,1,I give JBU a D for food but that doesn't matter because next year we are hiring a new dining company.
College Senior,1,Most internships are not paid and students are left to find their own. The communication between potential internship offers and the student development is non existent.
College Senior,1,There are college vehicles to rent but they are expensive. There is no transit or public transportation. There is not a taxi service available.
College Junior,1,I hate that you are required to purchase a meal plan when you live on campus. They are quite expensive and I hardly use it because the food is terrible.
College Junior,1,"My school is strict concerning things like drinking alcohol, doing drugs, or violating any other ""covenant code"". You only get a warning if you get a DWI or something of that nature, but after the second or third time, you will probably be kicked out. We are very strict on when mixed genders can be in one another's rooms and how far the door has to be opened (45 degrees). We do not have curfews or anything though, in comparison to other Christian universitis, we are pretty laid back."
College Sophomore,1,"There Are No Greeks – There is no Greek system at JBU, but people still are somehow able to form their own ""clicks"""
College Freshman,1,"This Is JBU – JBU is a Christian school and a good Christian school. The students that attend, myself included, don't participate in these types of activities, nor do we want to. The rules are strictly enforced."

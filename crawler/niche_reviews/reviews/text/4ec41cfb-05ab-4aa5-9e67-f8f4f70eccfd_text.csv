Freshman,5,I only have one class online and it has been fantastic.  The end of my senior year in high school we were abruptly moved to online due to Covid-19.  I struggled with those classes but thankfully maintained my high GPA and successfully graduated.  I was dreading having an online class my freshmen year at Wilmington College but the experience has been completely different.  My professor is very engaging.  We have zoom meetings weekly and can get in touch with her any time we have any questions at all.  I have an A+ in her class and I have no doubt that it is because of the time she invests in each of her students.
Freshman,5,"The moment I stepped on the campus at Wilmington College I knew it was the school for me!  Everyone was so welcoming, the facilities are amazing and the campus is beautiful!  There is nothing I would change about Wilmington College.  It's a safe campus where everyone knows everyone!  It's family and I love that."
Senior,5,I have greatly enjoyed my time a Wilmington! The best advice I can give to a potential student is: don’t be scared to get involved!
Freshman,5,"What I   like about Wilmington College is the people and environment, everyone is very welcoming and and inclusive to all people.  Also the campus is very pretty and easy to navigate."
Freshman,5,Very great college. Works with me on any campus questions I may have. The entire campus is a great size for those of you who enjoy the smaller size colleges. All the professors are great and friendly to work with. The sports programs are great for those of you who play sports as well.
Senior,5,I loved coming here to the small town atmosphere. I have made great lifelong friends and have had the opportunity to know many people around campus.  The class sizes are small and the professors know the students and are willing to help.
Freshman,5,"Even though I've only just finished my first semester, I can tell WC will definitely be my home for the nest 3 1/2 years. At WC everyone makes you feel at home and its easy to settle in, all the professors help you with transition the best they can, even if you're a transfer. Also the professors will quickly become your friends and treat as the adults you are and in out of class conversations will usually treat you as a peer."
Sophomore,5,Wilmington is a very beautiful  campus. It’s very small so you can get individual attention that you need. Something i would change is maybe lowering tuition a little and adding AC to some of the dorms because it gets really hot.
Senior,5,"Best D3 parties, better than most big schools great part life. Teachers want you to succeed and you’re not just another number. Everyone is extremely nice."
Sophomore,5,"I love Wilmington College. My siblings are both alumni to this college and that was my biggest influence to choose Wilmington as my home for the next four years. I love the small school feeling and how caring staff members truly are to students. As a student, I would like to see younger professors and more hands on learning."
Sophomore,5,I really like that Wilmington College is very open and willing to help anyone. It is also a small college which I enjoy because I didn't want to go somewhere that was very large. The staff help you out a lot to get you where you need to be.
Senior,5,"My personal experience with Wilmington College - Cincinnati has been nothing but enjoyable.  As a returning adult learner, the professors really take time to help you understand the material at hand."
Sophomore,5,I like Wilmington because my program was hands-on in the very 1st year.  I like the smaller campus and how friendly everyone is.
Junior,5,Wilmington College was and still is my dream college. Our Education Program is known to be one of the best and I am so blessed to say that I get to be apart of it.

Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Wilmington College! I am a freshman, early childhood education major. I feel comfortable and safe at Wilmington College. I am excited  to continue my education here!"

Senior,5,"My overall experience with Wilmington College has been wonderful! I have been learning new things and skills throughout all of my classes. The staff is helpful and kind towards their students. If you need help with something, they are willing to help you. Most tend to encourage you to come and see them for when you need help with your work. The classes are small, none are much larger than 30 students and the style of class varies. Some classes are more hands-on while others are mostly debate and note-taking classes."
Niche User,5,Wilmington is a nice small campus with Great sports medicine major. The town is a nice small town and is fun to hang around.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Wilmington my junior year of college and am currently in my second semester there. In the short amount of time that I have spent at Wilmington college as a commuter student this school and the faculty and students there have earned a special place in my heart. I have always wanted to attend Wilmington because it is very close to home for me, I never imagined that it would become a second home."
College Senior,5,My college experience is going great!
College Senior,5,There are only 2 schools in Ohio that offer Agriculture. Here you get hands on experience and skills to do everyday tasks in your field of study.

College Sophomore,5,"The professors and classes are easily Wilmington College's Strong suit. The college has, in my opinion, some of the best professors in the area and almost all of the genuinley care about you moving forward with your goals."
College Freshman,5,There's always a safe place to go to talk. To see our on campus Doctor is free and so is the counselor.
College Freshman,5,"Workload isn't too bad, it really depends on the major but if you study, you will be fine."

College Freshman,5,It's great. There are more and more opportunities for people to further themselves.
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus and getting to meet new people. The rooms are spaceish and very home like. I love the housing!!
College Freshman,5,I love Greek life. They are all great people and I hope to join this semester. Also Greek life does a lot for the community.
College Freshman,5,"Wilmington College has been a really good experience so far, I only have a few problems and that is with their Wi-Fi and their food doesn't necessarily sit well with my stomach."
College Freshman,5,I always feel super safe on campus. I have never heard of or experienced anything uncomfortable or unsafe. There is help for all issues across campus.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are super small so the professors really care about their students. I love all of my professors and classes and there are many fun classes to pick from to complete education requirements.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. I would definitely choose my school again. Nothing compares to the relationships I have with fellow students, professors, and administrators. It is so easy to get involved, met people, and make campus your home."
College Senior,5,I love this college and everything about it. It's small and everyone knows each other and cares about you.
College Junior,5,I love it here! I have a family away from my family back home. It is so easy to get involved on campus and the professors are all so helpful and they want to see you succeed!
College Freshman,5,All of the staff are friendly and willing to help.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, it is my second home. The campus and town are the perfect size and everyone is like one big family there, it is amazing!"
College Freshman,5,Perfect fit for me and everything I was looking for.
College Freshman,5,They are awesome staff and get back to you right away and always are there to assist or give you a direction to go if they dont have the answer
College Junior,5,Greek life on my campus is one of the best things they have to offer. There are many different diverse types of Greeks and they do most of the community service and have a lot of activities on campus. All the Greeks have healthy competition between each other and come together as a big family that had each others backs.  Everyone is very accepting of each other and helps lead the campus.
College Freshman,5,You meet all of your friends at the sporting events and make a lot of memories there cheering on your classmates.
College Freshman,5,The majors that are offered are very diverse and range from education to animal science and veterinary.
College Freshman,5,My major is so awesome to be working for and the class size and work load is very little but you are still getting every thing you want out of college and your degree.
College Sophomore,5,It's easy to be involved in multiple activities.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is friends with everyone.
College Sophomore,5,Wilmington is a lovely small town.

College Sophomore,5,Wilmington has an amazing psychology program.
College Sophomore,5,We have a wide variety of international students.
College Sophomore,5,Professors go out of there way to help you.
Niche User,4,The college visit that I went on was very nice and welcoming. All the advisers and students that I met were nice and showed me what was around and the professors are very welcoming with new students wanting to come into the college.
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed Wilmington. I myself am a total introvert and the college has challenged me to come out of my shell a little bit, and it has helped a whole lot to do that. The staff is incredibly friendly and I do not regret a second of time here."
Sophomore,4,"I love most of the professors at Wilmington College, especially the ones in the agriculture department! I would say the worst thing about the college would be the office people at not always as helpful as you would like them to be, or getting information in a timely manner can be difficult sometimes. However, there are some great people who work in the office there."
Sophomore,4,I love all of my professors and really appreciate all of the one on one time they five to every student. The class sizes are small which makes learning the subjects a lot easier. The only thing that could need improvement would be updating some of the older buildings.
Junior,4,I love how Wilmington feels like home.  I love that it is a hands on college & a lot of people get very good opportunities from going there. I wish there was a nursing program & a better food selection.
Freshman,4,My favorite part about Wilmington College is that it's a small campus and the student to teacher ratio is around 15 to 1 and that's great when students need help with learning the material. Wilmington College also provides the best resources for its students and make sure the student success rate continues growing. The college can work on giving a better variety of food(s).
Niche User,4,I really liked the campus and the way that it was a small campus when I visited there. This is a place i would recommend to other people.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy my time at Wilmington College. I am involved in volleyball, lacrosse, and Kappa Delta sorority. The friends I have made will last a life time. The professors truly want you to excel and will do anything in their power to ensure your success."
Freshman,4,I am currently enrolled at Wilmington College and they have great hands-on learning! The teachers are the best on putting the student first and are open to help anyway they could.
Freshman,4,"Wilmington College is a fantastic school with a very open atmosphere and living situations. Everyone is super friendly and willing to help you, no matter the problem. The campus is smaller, however, that gives everyone a better opportunity to get to know the campus and eachother better!"
Senior,4,"I love the professors and the opportunities they can bring. Their food is terrible and they are expensive. However, I feel they provide and excellent education."
Freshman,4,I have truly enjoyed my first few months at Wilmington College. The upper classmen and professors all make you feel very welcome. The class sizes are perfect for individual one on one with the professors when needed. There are many different clubs that you can join on campus no matter what your interests are.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe and secure here! Everyone is super friendly and helpful.
College Senior,4,Its a very friendly school that makes you feel at home.
College Junior,4,Safety is important to campus sercurity
College Junior,4,They are flexible and always ensure that safey measurements are taken seriously.
College Junior,4,"Like any other school, sports can be important when it comes to games and practices. Academic is my school's priority but sporting events are just a cherry on top."
College Junior,4,"I am a transfer student from OSU and the faculty along with students on campus has done nothing but made me welcomed. When I am on campus, I feel at home."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience with Wilmington College has been wonderful! I have been learning new things and skills throughout all of my classes. The staff is helpful and kind towards their students. If you need help with something, they are willing to help you. Most tend to encourage you to come and see them for when you need help with your work. The classes are small, none are much larger than 30 students and the style of class varies. Some classes are more hands-on while others are mostly debate and note-taking classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Wilmington College's campus is safe. I have never heard of anything terrible happen on campus while I was there. We have red phone boxes that are scattered around campus, if you need to call campus security (which is on duty 24/7, I believe)."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly do not have much to do with the athletics at Wilmington College. I have never been actively interested in sports. Though, our school spirit towards our sports are great, there are kids always making signs for the athletes to help cheer and support them through their games."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy being a student at Wilmington College. At first, I was not sure about how I felt about college and moving away from home. The atmosphere at Wilmington College is wonderful and smoothing. The teachers are friendly and are also willing to help you out. I remember how I would go into a teacher office to ask her a question then we would probably talk for 20 minutes about college and other things that are relating to the communications. I love out-going our RAs were and how many activities or free food sessions they put on for our freshman building. Overall, my college is wonderful and I am so pleased that I choose Wilmington in the end."
College Freshman,4,Internships are available freshman year. Alumni are very prominent in giving back to the school and the students. There are some major corporations/employers looking to hire and for internships. The career services center is very good at evaluating resumes for students to best represent themselves.
College Freshman,4,the school offers lots of activities for the students to take part of.
College Freshman,4,I'm pleased with what they offer.
College Freshman,4,In all honesty I do not pay attention to the diversity on campus. I mind mine own business and do my own thing.
College Freshman,4,I have never seen drugs at my college. I have never been peer pressured to take drugs or drink.
College Freshman,4,I feel the campus is safe and have not heard of any issues.
College Freshman,4,The professors I have had are great and accommodating to my sports events.
College Freshman,4,I love in the dorm and I enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,"We are division III, but take pride in our athletics"
College Freshman,4,"I love my college. It is small, but I like that because you get more one on one attention when needed. My track and cross country coach is awesome and very helpful and supportive."
College Freshman,4,Frat houses are always fun to go to. Everyone is friendly and just want too have a good time.
College Freshman,4,The party scene doesn't have a negative impact on student life. The weekends can be very fun if you actually go out.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are always willing to work with students if the students are working with the professors. They won't just hand out A's, but if they can tell you're really trying, they will work with you."
College Junior,4,The teachers are very hands on and always looking for ways to apply what we are learning to things in the real wold
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on the major, you are attending one of the best colleges in the nation. Athletic Training is easily one of the Top 10 in the nation while agriculture, business, and even science follow closely."
College Sophomore,4,"Being that i play varsity soccer, i can say the athletics are great and really offer great oppurtunities. our sister school in sweden brings in alot of soccer players and also creates some professional ones. The sports facilites are easily one of the best quality ones in the Midwest. Students are avidly involved in athletics."
College Sophomore,4,"Everybody is very friendly and helpful. The school size is realistic and easily managable. Very straight forward with lessons and expected work. The only down side is that the main focus is agriculture and athletic training, and majors are somewhat limited, still a huge selection but nothing like a Division 1 school."
College Freshman,4,"Being a small school with no government funding, it is hard to find a lot of classes but the criteria for your major makes sure you have a busy schedule and it is easy to get accepted into those classes. The professors are really helpful and understanding."
College Freshman,4,"I went Greek and I love it but for non-Greeks it is hard to understand why it is so amazing. Looking from the outside in, you can never explain it. Greeks do throw parties but we also have higher GPA's and do the most amount of community service."
College Freshman,4,Wilmington College is great. Professors are very approachable and i have learned a lot. Plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I do like this school. The people i've met already alone is a great experience. However, the school has a lot of extra activities going on. That wouldn't necessarily be bad, except that it holds the activities for the whole town. It also requires for a freshmen class to attend certain events. The reason I say this school is okay is that I am not a social person and do not appreciate these required events. However, The school does so much more, like have a math and writing center for students, that far outweigh this minor complaint."
College Freshman,4,"The security on campus is very good. Considering Wilmington is such a small college, it makes the work of Campus Safety much easier. With them, I definitely feel safe on campus/"
College Freshman,4,"The professors here really do want to make sure their students are succeeding. The professor has plenty of knowledge in the fields that they are teaching. Being a liberal arts college, there are many courses that can be taken. Also, there are many courses in whatever major a student desires to study. The class sizes are relatively small, but the styles of class really depends on the professor."
College Freshman,4,"It is easy to change rooms if you want a new roommate. Halls are like big families, and there are lots of nice event put on by RAs in the building."
College Freshman,4,Greek and non-greek live together easily. Many of the leaders on campus are a part of greek life and tend to have a positive effect on the community. Pledging is somewhat difficult but worth it in the end
College Freshman,4,many talks are given on safety around campus
College Freshman,4,career services give job and internship opportunities
College Freshman,4,"Small classes, easy to get help, professors who care"
College Freshman,4,I like the Overall Experience it is just the right size because in the school majority of us know eachother  and the classes are not to big
College Freshman,4,"I love it here, everyone is friendly and it's small enough to feel like home!"
College Sophomore,4,My school is really great. If I had to chose again I would still go to Wilmington College. I love how close the whole community and college are. I feel like I am at home even though I live 3 hours away. The teachers actually know who I am and care about me and not just about if I am passing their class.
College Sophomore,4,Wilmington College is building a new Sports and Science center with an indoor field. Other than that the facilities are older but still in great shape but only having two courts proves difficult for people wanting to shoot the basketball while teams practice.
College Sophomore,4,"There are options when dining off campus but to find a new restaurant you have to look for one. In addition, most places close down before 11 so the only option during a late night is Burger King. But the prices and discounts are good especially when dining at local places."
College Sophomore,4,The school is lenient when it comes to parking and having visitors on campus. But when it comes to alcohol and drug use they are strict and are cracking down more in the campus commons and the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,It was easy for me to get my scholarships confirmed and renewed and like I mentioned earlier the cost is the biggest issue so paying for this school can be difficult.
College Sophomore,4,"Although Wilmington College costs more than most schools they do offer many scholarships to help with the costs. The building are older, haven been built after World War 2, but with a new president renovation projects are underway. The small campus allows for an easier travel as it takes less than 3 minutes to cross the entire campus by foot. The students are always friendly and the Student Government Association is there for any student with help along with the Student One Stop which can answer and find any information that a student or prospect needs."
College Junior,4,The administration here is understanding and vested in their students' lives and interests.
College Junior,4,The one thing Wilmington does really well is provide financial aid to those who need it. I personally receive a large scholarship and I enjoy it.
Junior,2,"The college is an open environment however, they have teachers as advisors which is inconsiderate because they have to spend time on their classes and you receive less time being helped with advising.  The professors in the education program highly lack communication skills with students.  Overall, I have had maybe one advisor my freshman year that seemed they wanted to help me but when I switched majors they also switched me advisors(because they use the professors in your major as advisors.) I haven’t been to active in the life on campus but it never seemed to be my people.  During COVID 19  there was nothing put in place to help students who had trouble learning with a virtual experience.  Also , MOST of the programmed here are not credited. This means credits may not transfer to other schools if you decide you don’t want to go here anymore."
College Freshman,2,To cliquey for me I would rather be in the general population and dorms
College Freshman,2,There are no student discounts at the surrounding restaurants.
College Junior,2,Sodexo running The Top (our cafeteria) is probably one of the reasons some people decide not to attend Wilmington.
College Freshman,2,"My rating may change as I transition out of freshman housing. The freshman dorm is awful. For the amount of money that we pay to go to Wilmington, basic amenities, like decent wifi and air conditioning should be free. The wifi is terrible and you have to pay ridiculous amounts for a simple window air conditioner. The building is old and drafty in the winter and hot as heck in the warmer months."
College Junior,2,There's very few options other than chain restaurants. And the only thing open after 12am is Burger King.
College Junior,2,"dorms are extremely out of date. The wifi is, at most, half the strength it should be to support all students and staff. the meal plan works out to costing about $12 a meal if a student eats 3 meals a day, and it is not worth that price. The people are nice. The housing office plays favorites when it comes to enforcing rules. And there have been multiple complaints about the cleaning staff that have not been addressed. At least to the point where no improvement has been seen."
College Sophomore,2,Almost every student uses some form of a drug.
College Student,2,it is a long process with alot of paperwork needed to send in.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm only saying it's bad because of all the snow we have been having! Plus, the city thinks that the college needs to clean campus streets whereas the campus thinks it is the city's job."
College Junior,2,The technology at school and not very good. There are tons of improvements that need to be done to even get up the standards on where we should be with the technology.
College Senior,2,I wish the branch campus had more options as far as majors.
College Junior,2,"They get the job done and have all the software you need, but are old and slow"
College Junior,2,I don't know of any other than maybe a taxi that you would have to call
Recent Alumnus,2,"Certain buildings have limited parking and hard to park at unless there early, but some students don't buy parking stickers and abuse the visitor and other non-sticker parking"
College Freshman,2,"Not Really Off-Campus – Wilmington College has two apartment units, the Campus Commons and the Campus Village. The Village apartments are nicer than the 
Commons, but are located just across the parking lot of the Freshman dorm. Wilmington College doesn't allow students to live off campus unless they are a commuter."
College Sophomore,2,The Campus Security here at Wilmington isn't too strict most of the time. They are always patrolling the parking lots and building but if you get caught doing something you aren't supposed to be doing they will write you up.
College Sophomore,2,"Sports at Wilmington – The Athletics Department is less than stellar. The basketball teams do very well, the soccer teams do pretty well but the football team doesn't do well at all. They are a work in progress. The school spirit here is very high. Many of the students go to the sporting events held on campus. The facilities are very nice."
College Freshman,2,Could Have Gone a Lot Better – Not many scholarships were given. You could'nt apply for Wilmington College Scholarships either.
College Sophomore,2,"People Like to Drink – If you don't drink or do drugs, no big deal. No one will force you and you can still go out. However, the majority of campus does at least one/both and it is very difficult to make friends if you don't go out or are not in a club/on a team. Frat houses are usually decently occupied Wednesday-Sunday, but being a small school you'll see the same people again and again."
College Freshman,1,"Students are required to live on campus all four years unless they have children, married or live with parents within 30miles of campus."
College Freshman,1,For many students including myself financial aid is needed yet is not given to the full extent but families with a lot of money are getting more aid than students from single parents families.
College Freshman,1,"It tastes awful, there isn't very many options, you are lucky if you actually get served warm food."
College Junior,1,"The dorms are all 40 years old and there are very few campus owned houses/apartments. They do not allow off campus living unless it is your parents house, you are 23, youve gone through 8 semesters or you have a child."
College Sophomore,1,There are plenty of times that students will skip meals because of how terrible the food is.
College Sophomore,1,"The buildings, except Boyd, are very old and outdated."
College Sophomore,1,The wifi is awful! It is always slow and the campus blocks a lot of sites.
College Freshman,1,Nothing going on after the first 2 weeks of school. Party with friends in your dorm room.
College Senior,1,"Horrible Problems – Financial aid went well my first year - I secured several scholarships and grants and only had minimal student loans despite the high tuition.  I ended up getting stuck here an extra year because my advisor steered me wrong in a few classes.  I talked to financial aid and they assured me it would be no problem.  I only needed 3 more classes, but they weren't all offered in one semester so I had to come back another whole year.

Fall went fine and I took 2 of the classes I needed to graduate, as well as 3 other classes that would help cut into my deficit going into grad school.  However, the first week of Spring classes I got a letter saying I had been stripped of my financial aid and would have to pay something like $15,000 within 2 weeks to continue.  I hassled with them over this for quite some time and they refused to do anything to help.  One class away from graduation, ALL financial aid was taken from me.  They said it wasn't their choice, it was coming from FAFSA.  I contacted FAFSA and they told me it was entirely the school's choice and that all they do is distribute funds as the school tells them.  The school wouldn't relent, even when I asked why they were doing this to me while I had friends who had also been in the same situation and hadn't had a problem.  I'm having to transfer to another school to finish my education (and put in another whole year) just because Wilmington wanted to charge me $15,000 out of pocket to graduate."
College Senior,1,"I majored in Agriculture with a concentration in Equine Studies, since equine is not offered as a major on it's own.  However, no one told me coming in I could pair the Equine Studies as a minor with practically any other degree on campus, and I would have much preferred pairing it with something like Business or English.  Overall, I have hated most of my Ag classes, due to poor teachers and being stuck into a classroom where it is expected students grew up on a farm and already know what's going on.  Some really basic Ag classes would be helpful for students who are new to most of the subjects.

Looking into grad school, I have found that our program requirements are far less stringent than other schools, and I will need to take at least an extra year of math/biology/chemistry to even meet the requirements for most graduate programs.  Highly disappointed."
College Senior,1,"Horrible in Snow – Once had a level 3 snow emergency and class was not cancelled.  It was illegal for commuting students and teachers to drive, yet the administration said since 2/3 of the students live on campus they saw no need to cancel classes.  In 3 years, classes have only been canceled due to snow twice, even though they should have been several other times.  It's a problem when you have teachers who dock your grade for missing a day, yet you can't drive in to class."
College Senior,1,"Horrible Professors – I've had a couple professors I liked, but few in the Agriculture department.  They are impossible to reach outside of class time and have extremely high expectations for students entering the field.  The Equine department only has one full time staff member, and the rest are brought in on a semester by semester basis.  The only good thing is you will have the same Ag professors so many times you will know them in and out by the end of four years."
College Senior,1,"Must Have Car – The transportation at Wilmington College is terrible. The college owns several 15 passenger vans that can be used by clubs or classes to take field trips but that is it. Most students have cars on campus which makes parking an issue for all students. Wilmington is also spread out so in order to go to the store or off campus at all, some form of transportation is a necessity. There is also a campus farm which is the location for some agricultural classes and a few art classes. Without a car, it is nearly impossible to get to and from classes unless you find a ride with a friend or take the scenic bike path. This is an issue that I believe Wilmington College should be looking into for their students."
College Freshman,1,"So Annoying – So annoying! They will be screaming outside the dorms at 3AM for pledging or whatever, and then act as though that makes them special. They are very active on campus and I would say its a big part but not a big deal if you aren't a part of it. BUT, I guess it could be worse."
College Freshman,1,everyone goes home on weekends nothing to do unless u are in a faturnity

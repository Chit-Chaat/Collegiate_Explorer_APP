Junior,5,"Each class is not only informative but also applicable to life. La Verne not only teaches theories, but they also teach theories that can be immediately applied and relevant to life."
Junior,5,"It is my first semester here at the University of La Verne, and I absolutely love it here. It is a grand school. I know my professors and they know me, and they care about me. As a first-generation student, I have found the guidance I need here."
Senior,5,Because of covid it was required classes take place online. It has been difficult but for the most part professors have adjusted swiftly to the change and acknowledge the stress students may be in.
Senior,5,La Verne has a beautiful campus and greatly cares for their students. They offer many resources. Classes are small so can have a more personal relationship with your professors. I really like how they have advisors you meet with often to ensure you are on the right track to graduation. Very pricey but worth it.
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online with ULV so I cannot accurately have a say on this matter. From what I did hear though, the classes were well taught and the professors did their best to teach their students online."
Alum,5,Studying at ULV was a great experience.  I met a lot of new friends and amazing mentors. Each professor I had was friendly and welcoming.  If ULV had a Masters in ABA I would have been back.
Alum,5,I didn't take online courses while attending the University of La Verne but I heard they were good!!
Junior,5,"I love ULV becuase it is a small school that has a lot to offer. The academics are amazing at this school, and the staff are great. The overall feeling of this school is a small town feel with everything you need in a perfect size campus. They have many majors to choose from, and the sports are pretty impressive as well for a small private school. You can develop very good relationships with professors, and this school has small class sizes. a 14:1 student to teacher ration on average each class."
Junior,5,I am taking classes online and the professors make it very manageable for the students and are good at communicating with the students.
Senior,5,"It has been my second year at the university of la Verne and I love how helpful the campus has been. I love the environment and how well they are willing to help you in any situation. The class sizes are great and the food in the cafeteria is amazing. Being apart of the basketball program, I met a lot of my closest friends and great coaches/ mentor that I will forever respect."
Senior,5,With learning online it has been very difficult but professors are willing to do anything to help with any technical difficulties or any life situation that occurs during these times.
Senior,5,Even with some professors adapting to the change as we have it’s great how well it came together. They are very helpful and the school itself has done tremendous strides in getting students prepared for the online classes
Senior,5,Great campus with a lot of great professors who really do want to encourage change and positivity. Campus food is good and even with me not having free meals the price and range of food you can get is pretty good. The online classes are great as I do most online due to the commute but the campus is very well balanced
Junior,5,Beautiful campus and a wonderful overall atmosphere. I love the professor to student ratios and how those numbers allow a relationship to be formed with the professors instead of just being another number
Junior,5,"Going into LaVerne online I was a little scared that I was not going to be able to get the same kind of connection to the material , and teaching the professor would be a harder task. However, after taking a few online courses I was pleasantly surprised to see that accommodations such as immense organization, open discussion forums and encouragement to reach out were available"
Niche User,5,"I took a tour around the school, very friendly environment! I loved the campus! I enjoyed the environment and town around it."
Niche User,5,What I liked the most about the school was that it was a small school where you can get to know the people on campus.The student to teacher ratio is what a lot of students would like.There isn't many students in the class so that allows students to talk more to there professors and understand the material.
Niche User,5,The campus is really nice and clean. The food choices are good and cheap. The dorming houses are really nice and big. They provide a lot of help for the students.
Niche User,5,"It hays a great environment, very friendly and helpful. Everything is so close by and  very safe with the fire department right next to the school. It in a cute little town, everything is walking distance. The campus life seems full all the time showing how involved the students are. Overall, it's a really good school."
Sophomore,5,I love how private the school is! The classes are usually small so students develop better connections with the professors. And the learning is more intimate. The smallest my class has been was 7 students including myself. If it is not that small it is like your average high school class size.
Graduate Student,5,I have only interviewed at this school but for the little time spent there I had such a positive experience. There were such incredible and nice staff in the MSPA program!
Freshman,5,"Overall, just being on the campus of the University of La Verne has made me feel like this university can truly be my new second home! The professors are so nice and easy to talk to as well as all the students on campus."
Niche User,5,Great and I love it. I would not want to go anywhere else other than here. Beautiful campus and great people and staff.
Niche User,5,"This college is essential for the best private college. It ha diversity, and also is high in academics."
Niche User,5,It is a great school with a lot of diversity and peaceful students. It is a perfect learning environment where teachers and students enjoy the atmosphere of acquiring new knowledge
Senior,5,The University of La Verne is a small private university that is known for it's recently implemented PA program and also it's education program. It is a good school for students who want to study in those fields.
Sophomore,5,Really welcoming university. I am a member of the ULV Pep Band and I instantly felt like I belonged there when I joined.
Sophomore,5,"It's really idyllic and peaceful, beautiful surroundings and clean interiors. I've been coming to this school for a least 2 years now and the faculty have always been more than willing to work with me, with any problem I might have had. That is because they genuine want you to succeed, and that support is well appreciated. If there is anything I would change, it would be to make living on campus cheaper, as I can not afford it currently."
Alum,5,"I spent my first two years of college at the University of La Verne. There, I played collegiate soccer and was a Biology major. I spent a lot of time with many of the athletes from all of the sports teams. La Verne is a very small, close knit campus with classrooms the size of about 20-3- students a teacher. I loved the personal relationships and one-on-one time that was accessible with the professors. Because the campus was so small, everyone knew each other whether it was friends you made in the classroom, via playing sports (including recreational), the on-campus events, attending athletic games, people you met in the cafeteria, or even by joining a sorority/fraternity. If you were shy and didn't meet people on your own very easily, it was so easy to meet people through mutual friends. Being at La Verne was like being with your family every single day, which made school a lot more fun and enjoyable. I highly recommend attending ULV when pursuing your college career."
Freshman,5,Very supportive environment. Playing football for Coach Krich is amazing. Having the ability to play football and do music courses is a blessing. Professors go out of their way to support students and older students are encourages to help younger students.
Sophomore,5,My personal experience at the University of La Verne has been amazing! I love the small campus experience and I have made so many great friends here. The classes are smaller than the ones I had in high school and I love the professors from my department. I would fully recommend going here.
Niche User,5,"What I like about the University of La Verne is that it is a private school that is local to where I live and it has a really nice campus that isn't to big  and has many good majors. For the University of La Verne everyone starts off with a minimum scholarship of 10,000 I believe."
Senior,5,"I am absolutely inlove with my school. I feel it was a perfect choice and fit for my life. I am in the capa (accelerated adult program), and it has truly catered to my needs. I am a mother, Artist and hold a steady part time job and I can still balance church and school. Great choice, in my opinion."
Freshman,5,"Very nice small school with a small average class size. My classes are all smaller than a high school class, so you get lots of time to ask questions and talk to your professor.  The campus is very nice and easy to get around, parking passes are free, and the housing is really nice."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my university. Diving head first into a masters program outside of this university, makes me miss it more and more each day. I loved every aspect of this small community within La Verne. I truly felt more welcome than at any place or school so far in my life. The faculty provides hands on experience and aid to those that really need it. Professors were mainly just a phone call or text away. Student body was very diverse and the mindset that embodied these individuals was very intuitive and creative. The only thing I would change about this school would be the dining hall food!"
Junior,5,The atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly. As a night student in the CAPA program there is support to assure I will succeed and reach my goal.
Junior,5,The process of getting into University of La Verne was very simple. This is a great University to attend and everyone has been very supportive along the way.
Alum,5,"Being a part of athletics at the University was the best decision I made. There was always a sense of community throughout campus, but especially among the other athletes. I loved the quaint little campus with a nice little downtown for more food options, and being located in La Verne means you are within an hour of the beach, Disneyland, the mountains and the desert. I felt that I was provided many opportunities with internships and community service and was able to solidify my career choice and take the next step towards it!"
Senior,5,"Love: The professors at University of La Verne are dedicated to helping students achieve academic success. I think it's cool too that they have multiple campuses like MT SAC and online to help students manage their schedule. 

Improve on: Customer service inside the financial aid office. They make you go back and forth to receive help on their phone line and some of the staff is short tempered/dismissive."
Freshman,5,"Im still a freshman but the campus is so beautiful. There is only one parking structure so that will be a hassle, but i believe you can park in the neighborhoods as well."
Junior,5,"University of La Verne is one of the few schools that was able to give a long time ex-student a second chance at achieving her bachelor's degree. Even though I've been in the work force for years, I faced a moment in my career where I found the opportunity to potentially return back to school. While it's been difficult for me financially, it's been well worth it receiving the incredibly useful knowledge that this university has to offer. I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a fine higher education establishment."
Sophomore,5,The teachers are very supportive and accommodating to students’ needs. They are very understanding to student’s personal lives and go out of their ways to help students. There are several events that go throughout the years and at various times of day so that all students are able to enjoy the events.
Sophomore,5,"The University of La Verne has a wonderful way of making students feel welcomed and comfortable. The faculty and staff are very kind and interested in each students learning experience. Since the school has a much smaller population that most schools, this makes it easier for faculty and staff to become involved in each student's academic life. I have found this to be extremely beneficial because it is always helpful to have someone checking in on you and making sure everything is going well in your academics and maybe even your personal life. Additionally, having a closer connection to professors helps you better understand the material, as professors are easier to approach and discuss confusion with. The school itself is a highly safe environment and feels homely.  Overall, the University of La Verne is a phenomenal little school and I highly recommend it."
Junior,5,"It is a small school but provides lots of opportunities to grow as a person. I am transferring in from junior college and could use all the money i could get. The school is filled with friendly, smart students and faculty and they create a positive culture for everybody."
Junior,5,"Attending the University of La Verne has by far been one of the most exciting and interesting experiences I've had throughout my entire college career. The atmosphere is comfortable, the instructors are helpful, and overall an amazing place to pursue your degree."
Freshman,5,"LOVE IT! The campus is very beautiful and green, the teachers are very devoted to their students and many events constantly to include all the students."
Graduate Student,5,"I like how helpful the staff is and that their goal is to help you succeed.  Because of the staff’s aid, I was able to graduate a semester early.  They always made sure my schedule was perfect."
Freshman,5,"It's a great school, in a safe area, and while the campus may be small, it's very open-minded and great. There are many clubs that someone can join and be created. The professors, counselors, and everyone who works here are very nice and super helpful and they do their best to help every student who needs it."
Freshman,5,My experience has been quite amazing. There is such a great sense of community and camaraderie. The campus is beautiful and surrounded by a plethora of shops and stores to fit everyone's needs. The staff and faculty make the students their first priority and dedicate themselves to doing everything they possibly can to ensure the best experience possible. The only thing I would change is the parking setup because there are times when there is absolutely no parking on campus and I am late to my class because of it.
Senior,5,"I am able to obtain  my education on line which is wonderful for working people.  The communication with professors is transparent and they are willing to help in any way.  Again, I can do school work in  my office at home, that is what's so important to me.  I am thankful for the option to attend school at home."
Freshman,5,Since coming to La Verne I have grown a tremendous amount academically as well personally. The vibe that the university gives is very peaceful. Also the sense of community on campus is like no other. Also all of the resources are easy to find and attain.
Graduate Student,5,The university of La Verne offers a lot of convenient options to help students complete their degrees.
Senior,5,"My overall experience at University of La Verne has been great. Being a transfer student, coming to a new school could be intimidating. From the first day I felt very welcomed here. The University of La Verne is a small community of people with similar goals and all are willing to help. This goes for the staff as well as the alumni. It is important to feel as if one has support at the school they attend. It is something that some schools may lack. I love how close it is to home and how you don't have to walk any more than a few feet to reach your destination. There is always parking and things just seem very calm and laid back at this beautiful campus. The University of La Verne just feels like home away from home. This why I love attending ULV i would not change anything about it."
Senior,5,This university is great for those students that want to focus on their schooling and make some friends. The area around the university is safe and enjoyable. The only thing I would change about the campus is an upgrade of better WiFi.
Senior,5,"La Verne is a great school for returning and new students. The classrooms are small and engaging, the online enviornment is user-friendly, and it is especially military-friendly."
Junior,5,"My experience with this institution has been superb. As myself being a most recent transfer student, wanting to attend University of La Verne was the best decision I have ever made. When I say this, I really do mean it in the most sincere way. Right now attending this institution, I'm enjoying the education I am receiving and being able to interact more with my professors and other students. As I have previously stated, deciding to transfer to this institution was the best decision I have ever made, not only to receive the best education possible, but to also grow as the best person I can see myself being."
Junior,5,"For me, absolutely every experience has been amazing. The professors are great at what they do, the involvements and organizations on campus make the student life so much fun and make college worthwhile."
Freshman,5,Who has been great.  I've been able to get involved and a couple of clubs and have great access to peer tutoring.  The brand new dorms are nice I wish that they were more suite oriented.
Senior,5,"From the moment I applied, I immediately had help, support, and motivation from advisors and faculty. Transferring into La Verne from a community college was so easy and I love all the resources La Verne has. The La Fetra College of Education has amazing professors, I love how many classes are offered online and the University is in a great location."
Sophomore,5,The University of La Verne is a very hands-on personal college experience. Class sizes are no larger than 25 students and the professors are very qualified and helpful. The school is very small and so is the neighboring city. La Verne is a safe community located 25 minutes away from Los Angeles.
Alum,4,What I liked about the University of La Verne was the diversity and how inclusive the school was towards many students regardless of their religious or cultural backgrounds.
Freshman,4,I start this Fall 2020 at the University of La Verne as an undergraduate student. I hope I have a good college experience at the University of La Verne.
Niche User,4,"I took online, mixed and in-person classes. Despite my initial fear that online classes would be more vigorous and the teachers would be less helpful, this was not the case. Compared to other styles of teaching, online classes are more personally challenging as you are forced, in some cases, to learn without the teacher or students around. However, this does not necessarily mean that these classes are more difficult. They are generally more flexible for those with outside commitments which allows for a diverse life. Additionally, these classes allow for one-on-one teaching through email or video call which can be more helpful to those who struggle with certain concepts or subjects. Online classes were created for greater opportunities!"
Niche User,4,"During my experience at ULV I found that the teachers are incredibly passionate, helpful, kind, and qualified. Classes were small and help was easy to receive during office hours, before or after class or even through email. Though some teachers neglected to respond to emails within a week or did not post grades until after finals, most of the teachers were accommodating. Overall, ULV has a great staff, incredible students, supportive communities, and offers facilities like no other. The many events allow for bonding between all ULV members and encourage life-long learning and friendships."
Senior,4,"Professors did an amazing job of changing the in-class curriculum to online in only a couple weeks. They continuously checked-in to see how we were all coping and did their best to adjust without forsaking our educational experience. For classes where meeting in person was a necessity, some professors provided lab work so students would have the opportunity to see experimental procedures rather than just reading about it."
Freshman,4,I am incoming student to University of La Verne and I am already excited for this year because of the amazing things this campus promotes and demonstrates of the academics and activities they have on campus.
Freshman,4,"Due Covid 19, University changed to online classes in March.  Online classes went well for me.  Professors found nice ways to provide information and University kept students informed and update on any changes."
Freshman,4,My experience at La Verne University has been positive.  I enjoy the campus environment and like the smaller campus atmosphere.  I am enjoying my college experience.
Sophomore,4,"As of right now, I've been a student at the University of La Verne for at least a year now. So far, I quite in enjoy it. The campus has a rich history as it's been around for over a 100 years, and over those years, the school has made great leaps into cultural and ethical diversity and acceptance. Alongside that, being on campus is quite enjoyable and comfortable as there is usually some sort of event going on that everyone is welcome to enjoy, and you don't feel unsafe due to the proximity of the police station to the school and the many emergency telephones surrounding the campus. La Verne has been great!"
Senior,4,"Online was very easy to follow along with and the instructors were helpful. The school uses Black Board for a platform, which is not my favorite, but it was easily navigable."
Senior,4,Instructors are flexible for the most part and curriculum is relevant. Terms were 10 weeks which allowed me to earn my degree minimum time. I have attended several schools and La Verne was one of my favorites.
Graduate Student,4,"I really like La Verne, there are small class sizes and many teachers and counselors who are willing to help and provide feedback. One of the downsized is that is quite expensive and sometimes I feel I should be getting more out of my investment. However, I love my courses and how hands-on it is and it is well known for my degree program. Everyone is friendly and willing to help."
Freshman,4,"The university is pretty small but the amount of support you are given by almost every teacher and fellow students, is spectacular. I am glad I chose this university to start my college experience; I wouldn’t have it any other way."
Alum,4,I enjoyed being at the University of La Verne due to the size of the school. It was a nice small intimate community which I felt very comfortable quickly. Student life was great and everyone was very friendly as well as professors. They really care about their students and helping to give them the best experience possible.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore attending ULV, and I am so happy I made the decision to go to school there. The people are so nice, the professors truly care about you, and the campus is beautiful. What makes it better is the fact that the people who go to school there actually want to be there and earn an education, unlike the last school I went to."
Alum,4,"Homey, comfortable, great faculty with an amazing breadth of knowledge. depending on your program it will be a different experience, of course. So, if you have the chance to tour the school and meet your potential faculty, please do!"
Niche User,4,La Verne is located in a small quiet town that is very welcoming. It is very good and the staff is welcoming to incoming students.
Senior,4,My overall experience with the University of La Verne was great. My academic advisor was able to help me get the classes I needed so I could graduate on time!
Junior,4,Being a student at the University of La Verne I have seen great community service work and the student life involves everyone. The teachers are also excellent and are always there for you and make space in their busy schedule if questions arise. I would like to see changes in diversity not only with students but with the teachers.
Sophomore,4,"Great university, has great majors to study in and a great support system for academic needs. University needs to make more changes in being more inclusive and creating a safe environment for everyone to safely express their views."
Freshman,4,"Great atmosphere, staff and professors are very friendly and care for student's well being, plenty of opportunities are offered here for academics, jobs, and unwinding.  Allowed my transition from high school to college to be very smooth.  Would highly recommend this university to people uncertain about their plan for after high school."
Junior,4,Detachment campuses offer accelerated courses with flexibility. The counselors helped create my educational plans that cut my time and tuition in half. The staff are very understanding when it comes down to work and school.
Niche User,4,"i went on a tour of the school once i was accepted into the university, and i was very impressed to what a small campus could offer its students. They do need more academic and major choses to what they offer now"
Junior,4,"I really enjoy this school! The professors are amazing and really care for us students to succeed.  The academic advising could be a bit more helpful, but with the internet I suppose we can find the information if we seek it out. Overall, I would highly recommend ULV. It is a bit pricey, but it is a private school."
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE HOW LA VERNE IS ALL ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS AND THEY REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE STUDENTS. LA VERENE ALSO SUPPORTS STUDENT DIVERSITY, MAKING IT A COMFORTABLE ACADEMIC SETTING."
Freshman,4,The campus is small and feels like home because all the classes are walking distance. They also are very involved in bringing diversity to the campus.
Alum,4,"I was very involved and enjoyed most of my undergrad experience. However, unless you're a business major they won't help with networking or finding a job. It's also pretty pricey when you could get the same education at a state university."
Junior,4,"The University I currently attend to is a small campus and easy to go classes. Also, there is so much diversity which is great! Everybody I see are very kind and respectful!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of La Verne is a small campus so everything is close by. Running to your next class is never a problem because you have enough time to get to the next building. There are tutoring services offered to students who need help with subjects, homework, etc. The professors have an open door policy and enjoy when you meet them for office hours. Everyone on campus is friendly and there are events held by the campus club that allow you to get to know the other students."
Graduate Student,4,Bakersfield campus is small but upkept very well. Most professors are good and the workload for classes isn’t too crazy. I love having 10 week terms.
Freshman,4,"As of right now, my schooling has been a good experience. Although I am an online student the staff and peers are very helpful. I like the fact that the staff such as advisors and recruiters contact me from time to time to check on me. they are not pushy, they message me over email which is great. My professor is always available and she comments on my work. that I really appreciate."
Junior,4,"I've grown quite fond of the University of La Verne. It has a quaint and peaceful feeling to the campus and its a plus that you can pretty much study or do homework anywhere without bothering anyone. The only issue is that the Law School in about half an hour away in Ontario and that means when I do have a class in the Law School and on the main campus, I have to go back and forth. But aside from that minor inconvenience, Im keen to recieve my degree from La Verne soon."
Graduate Student,4,i enjoy the small intimate feel of our classroom and the attention the professor gives to students. It makes you feel valued and heard and the experience is amazing due to that and much more
Niche User,4,The thing that I like more about La Verne was the campus on how big it is and how beautiful it is. For the first time that I saw the campus I did not thought that I would love a place like this. The thing that I found interested was that a lot of students prefer to stay and live on the campus. I would not change anything because it is a beautiful campus.
Senior,4,"Overall, I like La Verne. I do wish they would be more helpful in the financial area.  It always seems like financial aid is trying to get you off the phone in a hurry without answering all of your questions. And then when you still don't understand they just transfer you to someone else. Other than the financial aid department, the rest of the school is very helpful."
Junior,4,I love ULV and all the professors. They really do want to see you succeed and are always willing to help. I love the location of the school and the overall size of the university. It doesn't make it seem so overwhelming
Junior,4,"Do not let the fact that La Verne is a small school. La Verne offers students a chance to create new friends and share new memories. La Verne is close to the LA County Fair and Raging Waters. The school has many student ran events such as our most praised one, Lavernepalooza. This is a concert where we have at least one famous artist come and perform on stage at our school. Last year's it was Ty $ign. Even though it is small La Verne offers a little bit of something for everyone."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far was very good. I kinda felt left out because I started in the spring instead of starting in the fall like everyone else but I made great friends who helped me fit in.
    I was able to dorm on campus at OAKS and it was such an amazing experience. I was on a freshman only floor so I was able to ask them questions and bond with them. It was also super convenient and the rules are there to help you have a great and healthy college experience.
  The teachers are extremely professional and friendly. I was able to be given the chance to work with fantastic people who contribute in many ways to society.
    I honestly really do love the school and the opportunities I was given."
Sophomore,4,"I like that it's a small college, so you get comfortable fast and everyone knows everyone. The people there are nice and there's always somewhere there to help you. Also the university puts a lot of time in to help students, its just up to you to seek help."
Senior,4,Amazing professors that are genuinely interested in not only teaching but helping the student achieve their individual learning objectives.
Alum,4,La Verne provided me with so many opportunities I never thought I would be able to have. I was able to study abroad twice and graduate a semester early through the honors program. Financial aid was very helpful in getting me through school. Going through student services can be very exhausting and lead to nowhere sometimes and all in all most often the school can be unhelpful or take too long to communicate and help resolve issues.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy how small the university is and the intimate class sessions. I know every one of my professors and they know me by name. It’s easy to make friends because the campus is small enough that you see familiar faces all around.
Alum,4,"Great campus, great professors, small classroom environment which offers more one on one feel, very over priced but other than that I had amazing experience at ULV"
Alum,4,The staff at La Verne are always willing to help students be succesful in their field. The advisors find great ways to propel students to become successful.
Senior,4,"I am an online student, active duty military. The school has been very helpful to Mr in my pursuit of a degree while I have a very busy schedule and an on the go. Professors are understanding and knowledgeable. I do not have any complaints, they do their best to ensure we all succeed the right way."
Freshman,4,"My experience at the University of La Verne was great. I made more friends than I did in high school. All the people are extremely nice and caring. All faculty  do their best to help you. Groups are easy to become a part of. For the most part, semester classes are not too rigorous; however, Jan-term classes are very tough."
Alum,4,"My experience at La Verne was short and sweet. In the 18 months I was there I really got a chance to learn more about myself and my major, as well as meet some nice people. The campus is open and in the community and again the people are very nice and helpful. I also have very encouraging and respectful professors. The only reason why I didn't give this school 5 stars is because of the cost and the fact that I wasn't there long enough to really get involved with things on campus the way I had hoped. But overall I did enjoy my time spent there and I would attend again if I could afford it."
Freshman,4,The University of La Verne has a great staff and nice campus. You can truly get that one on one attention from professors in the classrooms. There are also many fun activities for students to engage in while being on campus
Senior,4,University of La Verne is an established University with a lot of history and has been a significant part of the community. They offer great academics as well as clubs and sports.
Sophomore,4,"Great professors and academic advisors. however, one of their Philosophy professors degrade you if you are Christian."
Sophomore,4,"University of La Verne has great professors that are easy to learn from. I came in with AP credit which was accepted so I'm starting my second year, taking almost all major and minor classes, and I will graduate a year early. ""At La Verne, Anything Is Possible"" and that is the truth. La Verne is a great commuter school because most events are either middle of the day or after 10 pm. If you want the private school experience, go to La Verne. Students are not required to live on campus, financial aid is friendly, and the academic advisors are well-informed and helpful."
Sophomore,4,University of La Verne has been great the first year!! I really like the small school atmosphere which provides small class sizes!! I just wish the school wasn't so expensive!
Sophomore,4,I like the environment. Kids here aren't too smart but some try hard. Others don't seem to care at all. Professors don't care all that much either except for a select few.
Freshman,4,I personally love The University Of La Verne. It is a very welcoming and comforting school for anyone. I love how diverse it is all around and how great the professors truly are.
Senior,4,"The University of La Verne is great for people who are looking to become very involved on campus. Since it is a small school, it is very easy to become familiar with other students, join organizations and even develop relationships with faculty. I appreciate that the University strives to make us responsible global citizens who are aware and how they include voluntary service work as part of the curriculum. However, Greek life is extremely popular at this University. Considering that it is so small, it feels like a majority of the student body is also Greek and monopolizing in leadership positions as well as participating in other organizations. If you do not particularly like or would like to join Greek life, this might not be the school for you because it is such a central part of campus and student life. "
Sophomore,4,University of La Verne is a great college campus. I feel welcomed on the campus and I've been able to have a fresh start and make new friends.
College Junior,4,I attend an off site cohort. The experience is diffetent from the main campus.
College Sophomore,4,The professors I have had take an interest in what they teach and are extremely helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of options to reach out for career prospects, but i have not used any yet."
College Sophomore,4,There is low campus crime and I feel generally safe waking alone and have not encountered any problems.
Senior,2,"I went to ULV for music (if you are thinking of majoring in music, PLEASE go somewhere else) and the program is ridiculously small and underfunded. We have decent choir programs, sure, but as someone who plays an instrument - a classical stringed instrument - there is very little for me to do on campus.  My private lessons are excellent as they manage to scoop up great coaches, but my ensemble experience has been dull. I have three major complaints about ULV. One; financial aid is extremely hard to get a hold of and when I can get to them, it takes weeks to solve an issue and I end paying late fees either way. Two; as a student employee, it takes AGES for them to give you your paychecks, so you're better off working locally if you can. Three; FLEX is DUMB. It is a waste of valuable time that could otherwise be spent on classes you actually need for your major/GE's. My experience was even more useless because I ended up in one that wasn't my major."
Freshman,2,"For how much you pay and the education quality you are getting, it is not worth it at all! I will admit that it's a an okay school but there is NO party scene, no football games (they aren't important), and I feel like no fun campus life. They try to have activities for students, but by the time you're through the line everything is gone. I wish my high school had prepared me more for affording college because it is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. I have a large scholarship and am In the honors program, and STILL it is over priced."
Junior,2,The school is in a good area but it's a commuter school and the students who dorm suffer for it. The food sucks and the dorms are bad.
Sophomore,2,I hated my experience here. Close minded people who don’t understand creativity. It feels like a small town so gossip spreads. I didn’t even have to try in my academics and somehow manage a 3.5. No party scene and nothing to do here ever. Most of the people who think like me left and I’m transferring too. Not worth the money.
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot coming and going.
College Sophomore,2,No one goes to the games. There is only one small section of bleachers on our tiny field.
College Freshman,2,It's D3 no school spirit at all...
College Freshman,2,"We have had several power outages, and maybe 2 lock downs during the duration of my first year."
College Freshman,2,"As far as athletics, I really dislike them. The football games are in the middle of the day so no one really attends them. The gym is confusing and has terrible speakers. Other than the people that play they sports no one seems to care about them. There is little to no sense of school spirit whatsoever."
College Junior,2,I don't really see or hear anyone excited about athletics in general.
College Freshman,2,Overall I don't wish that I had to attend this school. Athletically I thought that coming here would be good. But it sucks here
College Freshman,2,"La Verne is overpriced, overpopulated, and not what I expected when I came to college."
College Sophomore,2,"As a Division 3 school, we mainly focus on academics. There is not a real scene for sports, and the moderately sized athletics group as a whole plays for the fun of the game on the side of their studies."
College Freshman,2,It's a complete commuter school. I live 8 hours away (by car) so it's not easy for me to go home like most of the students. Everyone I've met lives at least 30 minutes away. The social aspect of the school is awful. The professors are the only redeeming quality.
College Junior,2,My school is very strict and its something you can't avoid if living on campus. But if living off campus the strictness goes unnoticed.
College Freshman,2,"It's nearly impossible to find somewhere to live if you're a low income college student in La Verne. There's mostly pricey, old houses. There are some apartments, but those are pricey too. To find cheaper apartments you will have to go out of La Verne and check nearby cities."
Recent Alumnus,2,There is school spirit in the pride rock.
College Junior,2,Very spread out and the parking is immensely confusing and tight.
College Freshman,2,"Waaaaay too strict. A whole floor got written up for being ""too loud"" at night. I live on the floor under them and I do not believe their noise warranted a write-up"
College Freshman,2,The players are rude and immature and the facilities are crap. Hopefully they will be redone with the new field off of Wheeler
College Sophomore,2,"I hate that i cant recieve aid until i am at least 24 OR struggling in life. i Still have not recieved any aid, and i am struggling!"
College Student,2,"Not many options around, you have to drive to have different options"
College Junior,2,"There is a small shopping village right by La Verne but there only seem to be dine-in restaurants and none of them are chains, which I prefer since I am a routines type of person."
College Junior,2,"ULV is diverse in religions, political beliefs and sexual orientation; however, not all clubs or organizations are very forthcoming with this information. Every month there will be a minority club to demonstrate other cultures, or a religious group."
College Junior,2,There's not many close off-campus dining areas There is about 3 places to go from a walking distance.
College Freshman,2,Parking can be such a hassle if you don't arrive at the campus at least thirty minutes prior to class. This is the same situation for any student in any grade.
College Freshman,2,"Theres a few hotels or apartments not too far off campus, but not many, and fairly expensive"
College Freshman,2,"It is difficult to find parking at the school, because of the vast amount of commuters, the inability to park in the streets for more than three hours, and the very strict parking enforcement."
College Junior,2,"Permits cost about $95, and it was $30 for the year. Price increased. I never go a ticket so I am not sure about the cost of them. But parking enforcement has gotten stricter. You have to be there at least 30 minutes ahead of class time to get a spot."
College Sophomore,2,"La Verne is a small town with very few activities to offer. In La Verne a main attractoin is the University of La Verne, which is centered in the middle of the town. Old town La Verne seems to be the main attraction to the people of La Verne and tourists."
College Freshman,2,"ULV doesn't have the best athletics, but we make up for that in volleyball. That's the main sport that the school thrives in."
College Freshman,2,"La Verne is a small town that doesn't have a lot to offer for the nightlife, because the majority of the residence are older people.  So, to have fun during the evening time, school parties or students' parties are the best options to have fun."
College Freshman,2,"This is a very sleepy town. The only exciting thing is the LA county fair. There are restaurants, but other than that not much to do. It's a small, safe, old people town."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty safe to say that It is a ""dry"" campus in a sense that alcohol is not allowed and smoking is designated to small areas; it doesn't help to have a police station a block away! To have access to parties we must go to neighboring Cal Poly or Mt. Sac."
College Freshman,2,I feel like its an average school its not particularly special
College Freshman,2,"Permit costs seem reasonable and cheap when compared to other schools. It is also neat that they can be used for a full year. Where I imagine other permits only can be used during the school year. I don't know anything regarding ticketing,fines, or the need for a car so I can't say give a valid opinion. The availability and convenience of parking spaces is a bit difficult to find even with a permit. At first without a parking permit me and my family would have a hard time finding a convenient place to park and not worry about being fined. I also see parking spots available in parking lots but those lots are filled most of the time. Parking in La Verne can sometimes be as bad as parking in Los Angeles. But since it is such a small campus it seems reasonable."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly People Who Appear to Be of Spanish-Speaking Countries – For the most part it looks just like my high school. Mostly tan people and people who 'look' like they are from Spanish-speaking countries. Some fair-skinned individuals. Some Asians, even fewer dark-toned individuals, and a sprinkle of Middle-eastern people."
College Sophomore,2,"Weed&Booz Are a No, No – Ciggs are okay on campus, though there are designated areas for smokers. Getting caught with weed and/or hookah in the dorms will result in severe punishment. Some people still do try to hot box their rooms, and  sometimes they will go uncaught for the first or second time however eventually those regular users are almost always caught and punished. Same goes for possession of alcohol"
College Freshman,2,Greeks? What Greeks? I went through the first semester at La Verne under the impression we had two sororities and fraternities. Apparently we have seven. They are not very active around campus. There is maybe one Frat and one Sorority that everyone knows about but not a lot to say about them.
College Freshman,2,Boys Are Limited – There is way more girls at this school than boys. If you are already in a relationship your man can rest assured there is not much to be jealous of here. There are a few good boys but you have to find them. Hang out with the mens water polo team they are the most fun.
Graduate Student,1,"I did not take online classes but assuming from what I experience in person and in class, it’s the equivalent of teaching yourself because these teachers are no help at all."
Graduate Student,1,"You don’t get what you pay for. So expensive for teachers just to read off of PowerPoints, have labs unorganized, an not willing to hear you out. Any complaints and/or concerns are not taken seriously unless escalated to the provost. Save your money, go to a community college or another private university. Biggest regret of my life and now I’m $45k in debt lmao. Seriously run the other way."
College Freshman,1,"ULV in one word is lacking. Housing really sucks and overpriced I kid you not it looks like the projects, one in particular is called Stu Han. Commuters are neglected and cut out of whatever the ""la verne experience""  Social bubbles are hard to break out of, especially with the flex iniaitive, the intentions are good but not working... I don't see the value. IT really needs a bigger endowment because this is ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,Career services are a joke. They barely started an alumni network no too long ago... They barely started on LinkedIn..
College Freshman,1,SLUMS. WHAT A WASTE  EXCEPT VISTA WHICH IS OVER PRICED
College Freshman,1,"The price tag doesn't match the value. I'm all honesty it's very quiet, and if you're looking to party YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE I PROMISE YOU. CAEREER SERVICES is a fail and  this school is acting like something it's not. La verne you try too hard and under preform. IT FEELS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL ALL OVER AGAIN. IF YOU COMMUTE AND HAVE A JOB GOOD LUCK HAVING A SOCIAL LIFE ."
College Freshman,1,There are few black females here that i have seen. Granted its a pretty small school but i very rarely see new people.
College Freshman,1,"Access to drugs is easy. You just have to know the right people. If thats your thing, I'm sure you can find someone."
College Freshman,1,Expect dirty bathrooms and an expensive place to rest your head
College Freshman,1,The frats here are so annoying. Don't join them they are bad
College Junior,1,I do not pay attention to Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,ULV's off-campus housing is the Sheraton Hotel. It's inconvenient to live there unless you have a car. The Sheraton is far from campus.
College Freshman,1,"My building is the worst on campus. There is no air conditioning, on several occasions I have seen roaches and spiders, it is constantly noisy, we do not have a kitchen or a sink to wash our dishes in, the condition of the room furniture is poor, rule enforcement is nonexistent, and the people who live in the building are rude, inconsiderate, and obnoxiously loud at inappropriate times of the night."
College Freshman,1,"Parties are few and far between. Even if there is a party, it is about a 15-20 minute drive to the house. So much of a hassle to get alcohol, get a ride, and drive there. Only plus is that they do not get shut down"
College Freshman,1,Teachers and advisors are no help. I have emailed my advisor multiple times and called him once but I have yet to get a response. I've had one good teacher. The rest are messy and never have their mind on class.
College Freshman,1,"There's nothing around campus. I usually go to bigger universities to visit friends and go to parties on the weekend (UCI, UCLA, USC, etc.). The only things around the campus are fast food places. Very few nice restaurants. There's a cool spot that overlooks the city of La Verne that is fun to go to every once-in-a-while"
College Junior,1,"The area surrounding ULV is mostly residential houses. Unless you plan on living with roommates, it is hard to find a good place with good rent without being broke. The surrounding cities are easier to find a place, but there will still be a bit of a commute."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is not necessarily big at La Verne. They have many Greek organizations, but it is not nearly as big as television makes it seem. They do not have their own house."
College Freshman,1,It's $99 for an annual permit and the lots fill up FAST.  The lots that do have parking more often are right where the city parking by permit area ends so the permit ends up not being worth it.  The shuttle is a bit inconvenient because it has to pass a traffic light and some train tracks so you have to make sure you've got plenty of time.
College Junior,1,There are rarely any parties and there are no clubs near campus.

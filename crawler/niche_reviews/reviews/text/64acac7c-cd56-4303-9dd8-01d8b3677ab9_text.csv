Freshman,5,"I am a bachelor student in the Technology and Applied Composition Department, and I have loved my time here so far. The teachers and faculty are very knowledgeable and considerate of your goals. Also many great opportunities for on campus work if that is something you need."
Graduate Student,5,I've had an incredible time at SFCM for my graduate studies. The facilities are super flash and my teachers have expanded my musical potential so much more than I imagined.
Sophomore,5,I love the student to teacher ratio and the quality of professors.  Being able to chat with the best scholars of your field is priceless and so inspiring.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love this school! The environment is so welcoming and open and people are so nice. The teachers are dedicated to teaching the students. Everyone here supports each other and wants each other to do the best they can!
Graduate Student,5,"SFCM is an amazing place for networking and creating your brand. Being surrounded by such proficient musicians who are not afraid to collaborate is so important, as well as regularly interacting with staff from SF Opera, the San Francisco Symphony, and more."
Graduate Student,5,I am currently a first year Master Student in Voice Performance at the Conservatory. The voice department and faculty are very caring and will guide you to be the best version of you. All voice teachers are very knowledgeable and internationally renowned performers and adminstrators and are very dedicated to using they wisdom to groom the next generation of singers. This also goes for the coaches and other staff and admins in this building. Anyone would be lucky to go here.
Graduate Student,5,"SFCM has undergone some amazing transformations in faculty, facilities, and access to local arts institutions which is quickly establishing this conservatory as one of the top student destinations in the country. SFCM is located in one of the greatest cities in the world, gives students access to the world-renowned San Francisco Symphony, as well as the SF Opera, SF Ballet, and SF Jazz. I love the community found within the walls of the Conservatory. The students are very friendly and supportive and the administration really cares about its students. In addition to performing, there are tons of opportunities to teach or gain arts administration experience. With the expansion of the Bowes Center adding practice rooms and performance spaces beginning fall 2020, SFCM is giving its students and unparalleled experience."
Graduate Student,5,"SFCM is a great environment. The faculty are absolutely golden and as a graduate student you generally have lots of time to focus on honing your instrumental and musical skills. As present it is beginning to get quite packed for the main building, so the new Bowes Center to be completed in 2020 will be a welcomed expansion. The close ties to the San Francisco Symphony and the SF Opera are wonderful especially making use of free tickets to those concerts."
Graduate Student,5,"The Conservatory is the perfect place to hone in on your craft! There are so many opportunities to perform and collaborate throughout the year. You are walking distance away from SF Symphony, SF Opera, and SF Jazz!! Having the chance to work with Marcie Stapp on my diction has been eye opening! She helps you figure out the correct way to understand diction while also acknowledging that your thoughts are valid. I recommend taking ALL of her classes and buying her diction book!"
Junior,5,"My favorite thing about SFCM is it's proximity to some of the country's most significant musical establishments, such as the SF Symphony, SFJAZZ, and the SF Opera."
College Sophomore,5,"Directly surrounding the school, expect low quality or high cost. Really great food for little money is easy to find a little farther away from school if you do the research."
College Sophomore,5,"San Francisco is an awesome city. Food culture is huge here. Its constant fun, even if the tech invasion can bum you out a bit."
College Sophomore,5,I have had an amazing experience at the conservatory so far. My voice teacher and coach are both wonderful and all of the faculty that I have worked with are great. I love that the school has a unique fusion of baroque and new music.
College Freshman,5,"No problems with that on campus. If people want to drink, they go to the bars and underage people aren't allowed there anyway."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is so kind, mostly well-dressed, they have good taste in fashion. People are cool and really communicative, they do stuff together. Most common is to do music related things, but there is tons of other things to do together, like sports or cooking etc."
College Freshman,5,"Campus is really safe, guards are nice and friendly. The school neighborhood is just a little bit sketchy."
College Freshman,5,"Enough computers in the lab, but it's always good to have your own. Printers are okay, but sadly there is no color printers. the closest one is in UPS store and that's expensive."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are all great - very educated, friendly and they have a lot to teach to the students"
College Freshman,5,"It's really nice, many different classes to choose from. Student jobs are offered. Facilities are beautiful! Not enough practice rooms though, as a musician this is still very important."
College Junior,5,"It's usually sunny, rains sometimes, and stays between 50 degrees and 75 degrees all year."
College Junior,5,It's San Francisco.  It's an amazing city with something for everyone.
College Senior,5,The security staff is friendly and always vigilant. 
College Senior,5,"Students get a heavy discount on MUNI. If you live on the East Bay it can be more costly as the pass doesn't cover BART, but all-in-all a good value for the convenience. It's also extremely easy to walk in SF."
College Junior,5,International students are welcomed and excel here.  There are students from all over the country because entry is based on talent.  I have a very diverse and cool group of friends.
College Junior,5,"I am new to this school as a grad student in vocal performance.  Orientation week and the following auditions were highly stressful, but after that everything settled down and we got back to enjoying what we do.  The academic classes are good and the amount of performance opportunities is great!  If anything, they let in too many new students this year which made auditions more competitive and practice rooms harder to find.  I love my classes, my teachers, my friends, and this city!"
College Junior,5,"Beautiful new building with decent classrooms and nice rehearsal/performance spaces.  The concert hall could really use a pit though!  Practice rooms are very nice, though there aren't always enough to go around.  The faculty are wonderful and supportive and so are the students."
College Sophomore,5,Scholarships are for talented students and they are very generous cover only half of the tuition costs.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many majors. Composition department is very strong and has 5 professors that are accomplished composers. They give all their attention to the students. Composition workshop and Composition Seminar are the best classes for the student composers. There are many festivals for student composers, competitions, and also many opportunities to perform your works. Instrumental departments are strong. Woodwind, Brass, Harp, Strings, Guitar. Opera. We have professors who play in the San Francisco Symphony, Opera, Ballet. There are many opportunities for the students to perform. There is a school orchestra that and any instrumentalist must play in it and there are about 6 orchestra concerts every year. We have student opera productions few times a year performing. Also, electronic music department where students learn how to create music for video games, cartoons and movies. After this school if you work hard you will get a job in the field of music easily."
College Sophomore,5,"Very Good – Very good restaurants, cafes, and fast food places around the area."
College Sophomore,5,"We have many practice rooms that have grand pianos in the for students to practice. We have three concert halls. One is for the Symphony Concerts, second for Chamber music, third for Solo recitals. We have a reception hall  for after the Concert. Great music Library, Computer lab, Student cafeteria, This building has 6 floors. On the sixth floor we has an outside area where you can seee the sun and enjoy the fresh air. There is open air you can see the Sky. The conservatory is located in downtown of San Francisco."
College Sophomore,5,Very comfortable to be around musicians all the time. I am musician and I feel like I am home.
College Sophomore,5,"Not Too Many GE Corses – Because this is the music school there is the limit to the GE Courses. We have mostly Music, Theory, History, Musicianship, Major Instrument courses, School Orchestra, about 15 different ensembles that play different styles of music. Specialized Music courses like Counterpoint, Orchestration, 20th century music and other. Opera theatre at school. Some GE classes are English, Poetry, Drama, World History, US History, Physics and Sound and other related courses."
College Sophomore,5,We have a 24 hours security officers on duty in the building. The security cameras monitor every room and hallways. The officers patrol the building. All officers are Uniformed. You must carry your Student ID all the time and show the security whenever asked. At the entrance you must show your student or the faculty must show their faculty ID. Strangers are not allowed. If you bring your parents or relatives thaey must sign in at the security. For the public Concerts at the Conservatory the general public must come 30 minute before the concert to sign in with the security. Every student has a conservatory health plan. There are 1st aid kits on every floor.
College Sophomore,5,At the Conservatory there is an order. You have to dress in the way like you are going to the job. Anytime someone from the symphony can come in and see you. The San Francisco Symphony directors visit the conservatory all the time so as San Francisco Opera director. You want to look professional. It is O.K. to wear jeans and other clothes but must look professional.
College Sophomore,5,Performance Oppurtunity – This is the greatest school iif you want to perform. As a composer I have the opportunity to find student musicians here and form my own ensemble and write music for it. For the musicians this is the best school because they have many opportunities to perform. There are student concerts going on all the time. If you are ready to play you can join the concert on any day and perform. Some of the concerts are required and are graded by the professors.
College Sophomore,5,"We have all the music majors possible. Instrumental performance, Composition, Opera department, CHamber music, New Music, Percussion, Woodwinds, Brass, Strings, Guitar. I am a composition student so I see that the composition department is very strong some of the professors here write music for films, opera, ballet and even San Francicso Symphony and New York Philharmonic."
College Sophomore,5,"We have students from all over the world. From different countries, ethnicities and social backgrounds. We are very diversed community."
College Sophomore,5,General Education – I personally don't know because I am a transfer from Sacramento State University where I did my GE's but I heard that San Francisco Conservatory of Music offers some very good GE electives.
College Sophomore,5,"We have great computer lab that has Macs and PC's. The programs are WindowsXP and also has PDF Acrobat and Adobe, Microfost office 2012 and tons of music programs for composers who want to compose music and print it in sheet!"
College Sophomore,5,"A lot of great concerts at the conservatory. The musicians are coming from around the world to perform here. Also the conservatory has three concert halls. One is the biggest one compared to the Davies symphony hall. Holds many hundreds of people. It is like Carnegie hall almost. The symphony performs there. Second is a chamber music concert hall for small concerts and third is a studio for solo recitals. There are many concerts almost everynight. Many concerts performed by students and faculty, and also the Ethnis music Concerts from India, Africa, China and other countries. Musicians come all over the world to play here."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the conservatory. I study Violin with Professor Wei He, and am very happy in his studio. My peers at the conservatory are extremely driven and this is, as any college experience should be, a very inspiring environment. Some of the academic coursework can be really challenging. Western Civ (required for all undergrads) is one of the best classes. Professor Hohmann will turn you into an intelligent human being as long as you put in your best effort. Be warned though, this course will take more time than you have, and you will have to sacrifice a lot of your sanity in order to keep up with all the assignments. 
I think the administration should avoid scheduling students in western civ and Music History at the same time. I also think they should reformat the scheduling for concert cycles so that you are able to participate in ensembles without dying of sleep deprivation."
Freshman,4,"The SFCM has many advantages to those wishing to develop expertise in the field of music. There are classes in technique, ear training, music theory, ensembles, music history, ect. All of these classes have highly esteemed professors who devote many hours to teaching their students to perform music at a high level. The school is small and most of the students know each other making it easy to collaborate."
College Sophomore,4,"If you want to party, San Francisco certainly has the resources."
College Sophomore,4,You really get a sense of what it is to fend for yourself as a musician in a city right away.
College Sophomore,4,"Beautiful, new building. A lot of good resources in the library."
College Sophomore,4,We've recently employed new security guards. I've heard most are ex-military.
College Sophomore,4,Its not like a university. No frat culture.
College Freshman,4,"A lot places out there, but the prices are seriously high. Landlords are very different, mine is very nice. Transportation good, no need for a car except when you live further away, then it might be a problem to get home, but there is always a taxi you can call"
College Freshman,4,"Mostly sunny or there is a lot of fog. No big variety in temperature, it's normal and nice most of the time. Winter times it rains for few weeks and then it's back to the usual."
College Freshman,4,Transportation network is great. MUNI could use some new busses and trains so that they could run even more often and wouldn't be stuck because of technical issues.
College Freshman,4,"I got financial aid from school. Right now I'm looking for more scholarships, but there isn't so many where an international student could apply."
College Freshman,4,"A lot different places. Prices are okay, haven't found any student discounts though."
College Junior,4,"I still haven't been able to go to a lot of places, but I've liked the places I have been.  San Francisco does not lack night life."
College Junior,4,The best part about the Conservatory is private instruction.  The ratio of teachers to students is exceptional and each student can get the attention they need to learn.
College Senior,4,I've had no problems. Easy to access the lab and the wireless has always worked.
College Senior,4,"I found my place within hours using the Conservatory's housing list-serve. This is far from a common experience, but I think most people understand the challenges in finding housing in San Francisco--it's a popular place to live. Luckily, the city is compact and the transportation options are many, so there's always something."
College Senior,4,Close-knit community that's very supportive and a non-competitive atmosphere. Great connection to the arts scene in the city with a focus on professional development.
College Senior,4,Great cafe with good prices and run by seasoned French cooks/bakers.
College Junior,4,"It is hard to rate the campus strictness, because it is mostly graduate students, and not many people live in the dorms. However, we are all required to show our ID's when we enter the school, and if we don't have it, we have to give the security guard our drivers license. So, the campus feels very safe, and there are no issues with crazy parties, etc because of the lack of a large ""dorm community"" on campus."
College Junior,4,"Great size of school for the 400 students that attend. Performance spaces have great acoustics, and there are various student lounges, including an open rooftop area to sit. 
Conservatories don't usually have much of a ""campus"" feel, but this one has a great sense of community and a friendly atmosphere."
Alum,2,"Don't be misled by the fancy website, it's like an Instagram star, all photoshop and the right angles. The 6-yr income of $25k for grads is real. Tuition is $45k/year and goes up by 2%/year. If you start today as a 1st yr your BM will cost $185,472 and with that debt you'll owe $193,818.62 1 year later at a 4.5% interest rate which becomes $275,629.57 at year ten. If you can only pay $300 a month on an Income Based Repayment plan, it's impossible to pay off your debt–bankruptcy can't even resolve it.

The school forces you to live on campus to fill their beds for part of the time because otherwise they will lose money on their dorms. The rent for the tiny micro studio apartment is higher than what you could find in the city on your own and the neighborhood is one of the unsafest. Don't get me wrong, the faculty are great. The conservatory works hard to blind you into coming though less than 70% of students ever finishing."
College Sophomore,2,Don't drive. San Francisco is a dense city. There are way more people than parking spots.
College Sophomore,2,Muni is notoriously bad; an outdated fleet of buses and streetcars. Invest in a bike if you need to get around fast.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing in San Francisco is incredibly difficult. The ""dorm"" that the school is affiliated with is actually a converted hostel/hotel and the building is very run-down. The rooms are very small, and expensive for what you get, like everything in San Francisco. The only plus is that the dorm is only a five minute walk from the school."
College Junior,2,The Cafe Creme (the cafe in the Conservatory) isn't very good at all.  It's expensive with mediocre food at best.
College Sophomore,1,"The San Francisco housing market is kind of a disaster, as well as competitive, due to socioeconomic issues. Expect to pay a lot, live with a lot of people, or live pretty far from campus."
College Junior,1,It's a Conservatory of Music...there is no athletic program.

Because of the small community, you do get a personalized education with small class sizes and get to become friends with professors."

Siena has given me the best friends of my life, and I have learned so much from all of the unique experiences I have had on campus and off campus through the school.  Obviously my senior year was not what I had originally planned for, but Siena has done their best to make it as great as possible."
Sophomore,5,"Siena College has a very welcoming community where everyone feels at home, their extensive diversity and student activities make the college experience unforgettable. Being an international students, I had not visited the campus before I joined Siena and was planning to transfer for the second year.

I am so glad I came to Siena college and I wouldn't choose to change my experience so far for anything in the world!"
Junior,5,"No where else I'd rather go to college. Siena has exceeded my expectations. The amount of resources Siena provides is what I am most thankful for. Shout out the the Career Education and Professional Development office for making me feel prepared for the career fair, making sure my resume and cover letters are perfect,  and getting my professional headshot for my linked in account."
Junior,5,"I’m a junior at Siena College and I have had a great experience since my freshman year. I’ve had the opportunity to have 55+ hours of experience in the field that I’m studying (which is education). I also am involved with so many clubs/activities , such as Dog pound, ambassadors, make a wish, and peer tutoring in the writing center."
Junior,5,"Siena was the best choice for me. I knew applying to colleges that I wanted to go somewhere that values community and the people who are a part of them. This is the Siena difference and what puts so much value on the education here. I love going to a school where my professors know and care about me, and would choose to come here again if I knew then what I knew now."
Senior,5,"Siena is the perfect community and offers a home away from home. You can do well academically, while engaging in extracurriculars to meet new people and expand your knowledge and skills. Everyone at Siena wants you to succeed, and that support makes Siena exceptional."
Sophomore,5,Siena fosters such a positive and welcoming environment!! Professors genuinely want you to do well and they are always willing to work with you. The campus is beautiful (especially during the fall) and the quad is always busy with students doing things which creates a great social atmosphere. Wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. So thankful to spent four years here and dread leaving Siena already.

Professors are always available if you have any questions, and love to hear your thoughts about how to do things differently."

Everyone is incredibly friendly, looks out for others and wants the best for those around them.

Freshman,5,"The overall process of applying, visiting and moving into the dorms at Siena was seamless. Siena was the first college to reply and sent an acceptance within days of submitting my application. When My parents and I visited we were treated like we mattered and it felt like home. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We even had a one on one meeting with my potential advisor.  On Move in day Siena Saints were waiting for freshman arrival to help unload and bring items to each individual dorm. In Covid conscious times, I  very confident in Siena’s handling of procedures and guidelines. I love Siena and made the right choice!"
Junior,5,Siena College is my home away from home! Everyone here is kind and friendly and the college does the most for its students! There are so many resources here for the students and the opportunities that Siena has given me are endless!
Junior,5,I have taken a few classes online. I liked this option because it has given me a more lenient schedule. Professors are fair with due dates and they are also always willing to help out when needed!
Junior,5,I am a fully remote student for the fall semester of 2020. My professors have went above and beyond to make sure I am receiving the best education. I have had a very smooth and successful experience with online class so far.
Junior,5,Siena is a welcoming close community where students excel in academics as well as social life because of Siena’s caring faculty.
Junior,5,Siena trained all of the professors and administrators on how to use our digital platforms. Professors got trained on all the features of Zoom and our online forum Canvas. They are understanding and are learning among side the students.
Junior,5,"As a current student at Siena, I cannot complain. The community is beyond welcoming and everyone hears cares about each individual student. It truly is my second home. The professors get to you one on one and become such a great resource to have!"
Junior,5,"My time at Siena has been filled with great memories and amazing people. Everyone here is caring, welcoming, and looking out for your best interest. I couldn't have asked for a better 3 years so far, I never want to graduate. I can guarantee that if you do decide to come you'll have an amazing time."
Junior,5,"Siena has acclimated to this new online format quite well. I won't lie when we were first thrown into this back in March there was definitely an adjustment period, however, the staff quickly adapted and overcame this obstacle. Being back on campus has meant so much to everyone and they are doing everything they can to make sure the students and staff feel safe and are protected at all times. I have yet to feel uncomfortable."
Senior,5,"So far I've had a great experience at Siena! The professors are always willing to work with you to help you thrive in their class and all classes are faculty taught! I also love the sense of community that's on campus. Out of all of the other schools I visited, this was the only one where I really felt like I was at home.

Freshman,5,Online learning at Siena is positively involving and a great experience and opportunity.  It is not stressful at all and the professors go above and beyond to help students succeed.
Senior,5,"Siena College has provided the foundational skills vital for a successful future. From a diverse variety of course work, knowledgeable professors, and the small personalized class size, it has been an outstanding journey throughout the past four years. The school offers a variety of majors, minors, and custom degrees which allow students to build their course of study. This unique degree allowed me to focus on pursuing Entrepreneurship and Corporate Finance under a Business Major."
Senior,5,"Online classes offered by Siena are unmatched. Professors are extremely hands on, and communicate their desire to see your academic success. Through Zoom calls, interactive videos, and assignments, the online courses offered allow students to experience a course while working or interning."
Senior,5,"This school has help me so much over the past 4 years. They are really all for their students. I remember thinking my only option my senior year was to drop out because I was unable to financially support myself but they help me the best way possible. I am forever grateful. The Siena community was like my home. I met so many amazing friends who became family. The teachers are beyond helpful. My overall experience was great. I am going to miss Siena, I cannot wait to say my goodbyes since I was unable to walk the stage this year. Forever a Saint 💚💛"
Freshman,5,"I was nervous about attending because since it is a small school, I haven't heard of it before. Best life decision I have made so far. As a biochem major, I have already gotten experience using high tech equipment that even some graduate programs don't offer and when they say the teachers care, they truly do. My second semester was getting a bit tricky between getting low grades and moving to online. After help from my professors, my grade went up 2 letter grades in the span of 2 weeks and I was able to make corrections on studying and testing habits. Also, it is very easy to go to the professors for extra help as they have specific times designated for office hours and if those hours don't work, you can easily make an appointment. They are also super approachable and understanding."
Freshman,5,"It was a hard adjustment for both the students and the professors but because of the circumstances, they were super understanding about it and were even available for private meetings to help discuss solutions. I know I had a really hard week one time, having three exams and 2 quizzes and emailed my calculus professor in tears, who then made a private zoom call to help discuss what is happening and how he can help. Not only did we sort out my grades and a plan to stay on top of things till the end of the semester, but he actually listened to what was going on and helped me figure out a way to sort everything happening."
Freshman,5,I never thought choosing Siena would be such an amazing decision. This school goes out of it's way to help students have a successful school life. The professors are amazing and there's an impressive amount of resources for students. I definitely recommend Siena for anyone who loves a small school and loves to be part of a caring community.
Sophomore,5,"Siena college is the epitome of a community. The professors and adult figures WANT to see you succeed. Everyone who works at this school, truly goes above and beyond to make it an exceptionally experience in every way. The students at Siena are some of the most hardworking young adults you’ll ever know. Whether it be in academics or athletics, the students try their hardest at everything and it shows. Thank you Siena for setting me up to succeed!!!"
Alum,5,Best decision I ever made.  Was the best four years of my life.  Made life long friends and have memories that will last a lifetime
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus and the community. The college has great academics as well as sports and clubs. The students are welcoming and willing to help each other.  Teachers are very dedicated towards helping the students achieve their goals and get good grades. The campus is beautiful. When the weather is warm and sunny, students will bring blankets outside and study on the grass as well as play games with friends."
Sophomore,5,"Siena has been a great fit for me.  When I toured different schools, I found I preferred the small to medium sized.  
I have found my professors to be approachable and accessible; course work can be challenging.   
The school community is rather close knit.  Many students are from upstate NY, Long Island, and the surrounding states.  There are students from elsewhere in the US as well as international students.
There are clubs to meet a wide variety of interests.  If you want to start a club, the administration is open to new ideas."
Alum,5,Siena is a wonderful school with respectful students and a sense of diversity on campus. It is a very welcoming school with a strong sense of community.
Alum,5,Great campus. Well rounded education. Some of my fondest memories are from the four years I spent at Siena.
Freshman,5,Siena is amazing! A small school with beautiful scenery and amazing people. Students look out for each other and faculty and staff care about our wellbeing and concerns. There is something for everyone here at Siena. It’s definitely worth it.
Sophomore,5,"I love Siena College!! Being local, I grew up around and on Siena's campus and have always planned on attending.  I have met my best friends and enjoy the classes.  Siena is welcoming and allows you to find your own on it's campus. No one feels left out and everyone has their niche."
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high school, and have applies to Siena College. From the tours, people, and overall vibe, you can immediately tell how close it is. I do not even go there, and yet I already know how much the administrators and teachers try for their students. This school really just wants the best for you."
Senior,5,Transfered here my junior year and LOVED the Environmental Science and Studies Department immediatley. I have gained so much experience in the field and in the lab and have made amazing friends along the way.
Niche User,5,Siena College is an amazing place to learn in addition to gain many opportunities. My family has personally been connected to the school since 1970! My mom was involved in there Mentoring Program and my older sister graduated from Siena in 2008! I have personally been enrolled to the Mentoring Program since I was 3 years old and worked there for 2 years and plan to attend their college one day.
Freshman,4,Siena is a beautiful campus that gives students plenty of opportunities to explore their interests. Move-in day was incredibly smooth thanks to the volunteers that brought up everyone's belonging right to their dorm. It's definitely not the normal freshman experience with COVID and all but I think they're doing their best. The college has done an amazing job of setting guidelines to protect students and staff to make us all feel safe on campus. Due to COVID most of my classes are online through Zoom but so far it hasn't been an issue learning the material.
Freshman,4,"I am taking most of my classes online due to the pandemic. I had never used Zoom prior so I struggled a bit at first but now I am comfortable with it. For the most part, I haven't had any issues learning the material online. Most of my professors have drop-in office hours via Zoom to answer any questions."
Senior,4,"My experience with Siena has been very positive and I have gotten a lot out of my time here. The biggest, and often most overlooked, aspect of the school is the community feel it provides. This definitely feels more like a home than a school in terms of how the students, faculty and staff interact and coexist. You feel like an actual member of something bigger compared to just being a number in most case for other schools. Siena wants you to be involved and actively contributing to the campus which makes a huge difference in how you experience your 4 years here. My only wish is that there would be a bigger education department so that they could offer it as a major. Otherwise, Siena has been nothing short of a great 4 years and I highly recommend attending for those considering it."
Senior,4,"Online learning is absolutely a challenge for all parties involved but my professors last semester as well as this current one have done all they can to retain some level of normalcy. Adaptions have been made to continue on Siena's striving goal of group work and active participation in the classroom that would normally exist in the physical classroom. As for many institutions, the technology isn't perfect but it was been embraced as best as possible by everyone involved in the Siena online learning experience."
Junior,4,"The online learning has definitely been different, but that being said I am still learning all the information I would in a classroom setting! I like how some classes are a mix of online and in person, while some are strictly online. I personally prefer the in person setting, but online has been made tolerable."
Freshman,4,"Of course online learning is not ideal, the professors have really been helping a lot ever since we've gone online. They are very understanding and are willing to help you more than ever during this time."
Junior,4,"I LOVE siena, I am involved  and happy on campus. The campus is beautiful, I have met the best people from this school and so grateful for my decision on coming here. They professors care, the dining hall workers care and everyone on campus has such a love for this school and it shows!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Siena College & all of the opportunities offered. Additionally, I love the community and it’s welcoming aspect. One thing I’d wish to see is more diversity around campus."
Senior,4,Siena did everything they could to make online classes smooth and accessible for everyone. The professors adapted quickly and were very understanding during the switch
Junior,4,"Although the situation is not ideal, Siena has tried their hardest to make sure that professors and students are making the most of their online learning experiences. The ITS team is always just an email away that can answer any questions or solve any problems that arise."
Junior,4,"As a junior, Siena College has already presented me with so many different opportunities. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been incredible, and you can tell that they genuinely care about their students' health/wellbeing while still giving them the education of a lifetime."
Senior,4,"I took some of my classes online and some of my classes in person.  It certainly was not the same to have online classes, but the professors did their best to make classes engaging."
Freshman,4,The professors have been very good with taking precautions in terms of the pandemic. It is a little rough not being able to converse with fellow classmates because of online learning  but I think Siena is keeping up with it fairly well.
Freshman,4,The professors are fantastic! Very responsive and organized even during the current Covid Pandemic. I love walking around the campus too! It's gorgeous. THe only thing that's keeping ths from a 5 star review is the food... I heard it was better before COVID but I was hoping for more diverse offerings.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and staff at Siena College are being of immense help and support during these tough times. It is definitely tough for the students and professors adapting to the new circumstances and still doing well, however most professors are being extremely flexible when it comes to assignments for classes."
Junior,4,Siena's Professors have done an amazing job with shifting to online classes. They are so patient and understand this is a difficult time for everyone.
Junior,4,"I can tell that all of my professors are doing their best. With that being said, I have a hard time learning online so my overall experience isn’t great."
Senior,4,"I love the small class sizes, professors truly care about you and your success. Siena is perfect because you get access to so many opportunities without needing to be on a huge campus."
Senior,4,Online classes have been made the best they can be considering the pandemic. Professors still go above and beyond to make themselves available to students.
Junior,4,"Online learning is hard anywhere. Luckily, the school invested a lot of money into making each class on campus accessible to remote learning. I felt like all of my professors were prepared for teaching in a new era this fall semester."
Senior,4,Siena has done a good job in a trying time. Online learning was not something I ever expected but my professors did a really good job accommodating us.
Senior,4,Overall my experience with Siena has been good. I chose to come because I had heard so many quality things about a Siena experience from family and friends. One of my favorite things is that the alumni network can not be beaten!
Freshman,4,In my time at Siena College I've been able to find some really good people and everyone is really nice. From holding doors to just being really accepting the community here is amazing. The faculty truly want to help you succeed and there are lots of ways to get involved and make friends even if you're really shy.
Senior,4,"Online learning is an adjustment. Everyone is trying to offer the best support possible, but it seems like there is a learning curve. It lacks the personable components that you are able to get in a Siena classroom."
Sophomore,4,"I had to takes some classes online due to COVID. Professors were really good about it, and still made themself available through office hours. All my professors also did their best to make classes engaging. I personally prefer in person classes but was still able to get a lot of the online classes."
Senior,4,Siena College goes above and beyond for their students. The community feel on campus can be found around each and every turn. The staff is polite and respectful and will do anything they can for their students. The students are friendly and caring and love welcoming new people to their community. The campus is safe and beautiful and it overall a great environment for just about anyone.
Senior,4,It seems every professor has a different strategy for teaching online which can be difficult to manage at first. Once the semester gets going it is pretty easy to manage and classes go smoothly.
Freshman,4,Online learning is something new that everyone is experiencing so you're not going to get it right the first time. Somethings with online learning aren’t the best but overall good it has worked out
Senior,4,Online learning was a hard transition but the professors are really giving it their all and trying to make the process as seamless as possible.
Freshman,4,A great school for anyone who wants to be part of  a small community that is closely related and helpful in promoting student success!
Niche User,4,Faculty are strong and do a good job in a challenging environment...! Support programs are good but support through athletics is poor.
Senior,4,"Taking online classes this semester was not how I expected to end my senior year but despite it being on line ,my professors made it as interactive and fun as possible. Although it was not the same as being in a classroom physically but I was happy my professors were there for us every step of the way and were very lenient because they understood the difficult time we’re all going through."
Niche User,4,"It is a very beautiful and welcoming school. Professors are very friendly and helpful. The student activities are great ways to make friends and become more comfortable in your environment. Food is amazing, a wide variety and exceptional service."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman accounting major and I am local and I love it here. The campus is small, even the farthest buildings are only a 5-minute walk. there are lots of places to eat and the professors are good and have office hours and it is all a big community feel."
Junior,4,What I like about Siena is that it's a college where everyone feels like family. We all in some way know one another and truly seem to care about what's happening on our campus. What I would like to see an improvement on would be to have more opportunites for students of color while also hiring minority professors.
Sophomore,4,"I had a lot of trouble socially my first semester, however, after I joined some of the multitude of clubs they have there, like the Environmental Club, the Italian club, and the club rugby team, it was a lot easier to assimilate. Now, I have a great group of friends, excellent and committed teachers, and sense of community when I'm on campus. I would advise any incoming students to join the clubs that interest them so that they don't have to stress so much about being alone."
Sophomore,4,"Academically, Siena has 3 schools: business, science, and liberal arts. The business school is one of the best in New York, the school of science is very good yet very challenging, and I have not heard much about the liberal arts school. Division 1 Athletics makes Siena great for talented athletes and sports fans. Small classrooms! The housing is among the worst of any college I have seen.  Safety is not an issue. Siena is ranked as one of the best colleges in the country for Return on your Investment. The campus is very small and each walk to class will take less than 5 minutes. Siena is NOT a party school. The local area (Loudonville) is very nice, but you cannot have a car on campus freshman year, so I have not explored much yet. Campus food has a bad rap, but I don't mind it at all. One big dining hall open from 7:30am to 7:30pm. Nothing open after midnight. Overall, Siena is a good college, especially for business/science majors and athletes."
Freshman,4,"Being from a diverse setting like New York City it was a culture shock to walk into Siena. However, once I started to communicate and meet friends I couldn’t ask for a more peaceful and relaxing campus. The change in setting was actually a very good transaction. Not only that but the professor strive to make everyone succeed. Since it’s a small school student get the attention they need to build acquaintances and relations to better their future. Siena was the right choice for me."
Senior,4,"Siena College has been a great experience over the last four years. I've gotten the opportunity to meet amazing friends that I've spent all four years with that have become family. The biggest struggle over the years has been the professors. They are really hit or miss, some are much harder than others (drastically) which I found to be unfair."
Sophomore,4,"great and caring school with lots of good people. Some of the dorm buildings are out of date but still a great opportunity for an education. As a biology major the professors here really want to see you succeed. Advisors make sure you are on the right path to graduate and take care in making sure classes are going well. The architecture of the campus is beautiful with old yet modern designs, all with buildings within close proximity to each other."
Senior,4,"I loved Siena because not only because it was only 30 minutes away from my house, but also because of the community on campus; no matter what major or year you are, everyone is a part of the community and everyone is so friendly. The professors actually care about their students and help them in any way possible to succeed in life."
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled as a Biology major at Siena College and although the work load is tough, all of the professors are there to help. The small class size truly allows for comfortable relationships to form. It is also encouraging to have each of your professors cheering for you to be successful. The environment and curriculum at Siena College challenges each student to do their best and then some, but it is up to the student to take matters into their own hands and use each of the many resources to their advantage."
Sophomore,4,"This college is the definition of community; you'll never have to worry about making friends or needing someone to grab lunch with. Little things like people holding the door for you are second nature, and Siena makes sure to carry on this demeanor through the classrooms and its events."
Junior,4,I liked its small class sizes and it’s location which allows me to commute there. The professors are Always engaging and available. They always have office hours available when I need them. The campus could use some updating in some buildings. This would be my only critique.
Freshman,4,The campus has a very friendly feel. Most people try to create a family like atmosphere. There are many opportunities for students. There are many intramural sports. There are many interesting clubs. The food is the only complaint I have. It could greatly improve.
Sophomore,4,"You'll find the people that you connect with the most which is the best part, but the administration is kind of uptight."
Senior,4,Siena college is a small college which makes it easier to navigate and build a connection with faculty. It is a very small community so the majority of the people know each other on some level.
Sophomore,4,"Everyone says that the first time they set foot on their college campus they automatically knew it was the one.  For me that didn't happen,  Siena College was definitely not my first pic on the list of colleges. Over time  I have come to realize that it is the best decision that I have ever made.  The campus is small and it is easy to get from place to place which is the best for the winter weather because New York gets a lot of snow. Also since the campus is small there are smaller classes, which is the type of learning environment I need in order to be successful academically.  There is so many clubs and activities and because of this I  have meet and become friends with the most awesome people. The faculty really care about you, and go out of there way to make sure you don't fail or get too stressed. There is so many resources available, so if you need anything you are sure to find it.I have grown to love Siena and I'm glad that I decided to attend the school."
Junior,4,I transferred to Siena for the academics. The academics in the School of Science are absolutely remarkable.
Sophomore,4,"Although I just completed my first year, Siena has been an exciting experience overall. For one I love that it is a small based community, a Franciscan community, where everyone gets along and grows on one another. Its size is also beneficial in academics in which allows for one on one time with professors and tutors. Clubs on campus allow for fun and entertainment, and other clubs such as BLSU and LUNA definitely calls for attention of diversity."
Freshman,4,"Siena is a great small school in upstate New York. Being upstate, we get some cold and snow-full winters, and some of the most beautiful spring and falls.  It is a close community of students, small campus with dorms and townhouses. Sports are a big deal, but not in a way that excludes those not athletic. Many students attend sporting events to support there fellow Saints."
Sophomore,4,I love that it is a small school and the class size are small and you can usually always get into a class you want. I wish they offered more classes and had online courses to take as well
Freshman,4,"Siena is a great school that has many opportunities and very interesting clubs as well. Students and staff are very welcoming. My experience has been great and I'm looking forward to the next 3 years.  What I like to see some changes in saga and they should have more variations of food. Also, add new languages, making criminal justice a major and much more but Siena is a great school."
Niche User,4,"Amazing college if you are looking for a family oriented college experience. They are a liberal arts college so it's easy to switch majors. Prepare you very well for the future and has a 90% graduation rate. Everyone is very nice, food is amazing, and Siena is just the perfect college for anyone looking to get very involved in the campus activities."
College Sophomore,4,Siena is a D1 school and although Siena is a small campus the school spirit is still strong. However it may not be as big as other schools with a larger student population and a football team but all the students come out to support Siena at there mens basketball games as that is our biggest sport on campus. Club sports are noticed too we even have an equestrian club! Also its really easy to start a new one if theres a sport we don't have!
College Sophomore,4,"The truly friendly community aspect that Siena has instilled on each one of its students as they first step onto campus can definitely not be comparable and is what makes Siena a must visit school. There is never a moment were you don't feel welcome and encouraged to try new things that Siena has to offer. The courses taken at Siena have challenged me to succeed and expanded my knowledge in all aspects of being a good student not only including the basic information but how to study, public speaking, and how to communicate among my fellow peers and teachers. The class sizes are small and professors hold extensive office hours giving you the appropriate attention needed to succeed in this sort of environment. This and the professors willingness to help when a student asks for it makes goals a lot easier to achieve. Having this close teacher student relationship is definitely a necessity for me and is something that not a lot of schools can offer which made Siena a top choice school for me. Siena has an outstanding study abroad program that will work with you and your major to send you wherever you want to go. On the other hand Siena's dinning system is still in the process of being established with a new supplier and the hours of dinning and food options are subpar which is why I would say my overall experience at Siena so far was great but not quite excellent."
College Sophomore,4,"Its not bad at all. While the campus is dominantly white, everyone finds a way to fit in and no one is unaccepted."
College Sophomore,4,No one really does drugs openly besides drinking and smoking pot. You won't be caught up with anyone with anything worse than that without doing it to yourself.
College Sophomore,4,"Siena has a lot to offer for graduates. I am only an incoming sophomore, so I don't know much about it. I have heard a lot of success stories."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletes are cocky and they get all of the attention from professors. There are not a ton of options for intramurals, but there are some."
Sophomore,2,"I have to assume that no college functions particularly well online, but Siena just has nothing to offer when it comes to online learning.  It has zero social aspect when it comes to taking classes online most of the time, and that includes with the professors too.  I found myself not wanting to get to know my online peers in my in-person classes and not wanting to get to know anybody in my online classes, full stop.  The actual instruction does not end up being engaging online, as it falters to lecture rather than incorporating online activities to engage students.  If you must go to a college during this pandemic (which you probably should not), you will be quite disappointed by the lack of overall engagement this college provides in an online setting."
Sophomore,2,"This school excels in it's presented academics and beyond that, the college falls flat.  There is nothing that this college does to set itself apart from it's kin outside of its academic programs and location.  The people can be very unapproachable and judgemental, essentially the students seem to generally act like they are still in high school.  The food is not good, and not to mention the overemphasis on safety means that students cannot even dine in the dining facilities.  The diversity here is quite poor as well, most of the students and professors are white and you will most likely feel out of place if you are not among the majority.  Dorms are not very good, as the dorms are in a flux of disrepair a lot of the time and it can be difficult to fix issues that may come up, such as bad internet and heating.  As a whole, the college should be attended for its academics only, beyond that the college has a cacophony of issues that hold it back immensely."
Graduate Student,2,"The school tricks you into signing a contract to live on campus all 4 years. A townhouse is over 10,000 per person and there’s 6 people per house. Imagine the apartment you could buy? Then after you toss them your money, they throw all these rules on you. Ex: no music at 1pm on a Saturday, no grilling allowed, no string lights, no solo cups outside. They will also impede and kick everyone out of a house once 1 am roles around on a Saturday even if everyone is 21.... due to that, it forces everyone to go to the bars, even if underage, and drink and drive. Sad this wonderful school came to this."
Freshman,2,"If you are interested in a school with good social life, parties and overall fun, Siena is not right for you. First semester is decent. Townhouses throw parties but unless you are an athlete or a girl your likely not getting in. Second semester is absolutely shot because every sports team is traveling leaving the campus dead on the weekends. Bars are filled to the max with sweaty kids. Academics are the real strong suit of this school but the workload is sometimes extremely difficult to manage. Overall if you want a school with good parties and fun weekends Siena is not right for you."
Sophomore,2,"All of the freshman and sophomore residence halls are incredibly old and run down. Public Universities that cost half as much as Siena have nicer residence halls. The academic buildings are not great either. Siena Hall is not terrible but it is no different then my public high school, Kiernan Hall is old, run-down, and does not have air-conditioning, Roger Bacon is a total dump, Rossetti is the only nice building but it hosts all the social work classes. Siena being such a small and quite frankly ""no-name"" college they struggle to find good professors. My first semester of sophomore year every single one of my professors was a part time adjunct, and only one had a Doctorate, keep in mind I am a double major with marketing and finance. That is simply unheard of at any other school.Overall I would not recommend Siena. The campus is not nice, the buildings are old, the food sucks, academics have nothing to show for. Save your money and go somewhere else."
College Sophomore,2,"First semester is usually ok. But by second semester, public safety raids literally every party, even though there arent many to begin with. You need to know someone who is having a party or know someone that has the connections for a townhouse number. Most parties get raided within 2 hours. Nightlife doesnt start until 1130 or later. All of the bars around here got raided last year so no one underage goes to them anymore. It was fun on thursdays when the bars were open."
College Sophomore,2,the parties are bad. there are hardly any but when there are they get broken up
College Sophomore,2,"The girls are extremely cliquey. The guys are okay, but they also tend to be cliquey. I feel like I am still in high school. Some professors are good and care about their students, but most of them are horrible at teaching and won't even learn your name after a whole semester in a class of 20 students which seems absolutely ridiculous"
College Junior,2,the public safety and health center moderately care. havent heard anything abou tthem being great
College Freshman,2,I go to Siena College and I hate it here. If you don't have a car its hard to get around and if you don't wake up by a certain time on the weekends you can't get food and if you have a night class the dining halls close so you can't get food. The food itself is disgusting and inedible sometimes. the people are weird the classes are boring but i do like the freshman year seminar. The teachers seem to be interested in their students and their success. The gym sucks. The parties suck. The bathrooms are gross. This place is horrible.
College Junior,2,"The faculty is, for the most part, nice and approachable. The school doesn't offer much courses in creative arts, which is where I eventually decided to go into. Plassman and Hennepin aren't too bad, but both buildings definitely had their share of party people, which was something I was not interested in and made my time living there difficult. If you're not a party person, don't sign up for a Hennepin 4-person dorm. So much partying happened in my time in there, and it was an extremely uncomfortable experience. When you're a junior, you have the option of staying in Snyder Hall, which is very nice. All of the dorms in Snyder have a bathroom, and there is a cafeteria in the dorm building. At the moment, the cafeteria closes on Saturday and most of Sunday, so you have to go to other food sources if you don't want to starve. The core curriculum is a pain, though. Not only do you have the general requirements, but there is also something called the ""Francisan Core"". Altogether, all of the requirements get in the way, and it irritates me how much time and money I wasted on them. The college doesn't have the courses that I want to take, so I'm actually planning on transferring to another college that might match more of my interests."
College Junior,2,"The meal plan is not very healthy, it's really hard/expensive to find healthy food on Campus...

The unlimited dining hall is bas, some options make no sense."
College Freshman,2,"Don't ever come her, ever, even if there's a fire."
College Freshman,2,"Luckily, I have never had to go to Health Services since I'm from the area and my doctor is down the road. From what I heard the Health Services Department is a nightmare. I've heard from friends that the people that work there are very rude and that they will demand for you to make an appointment even in near emergency situations. One thing I find disturbing is the fact that they put the Health Services Office in the Townhouse area, which is very far away from where most of the students on campus live. For someone who is sick, that is a very far walk to make."
College Freshman,2,"At Siena the weekends are the same. On Thursday nights, the upperclassmen and underclassmen with fake ID's venture out to Troy and go to Bootleggers. As a local, it makes no sense to me why the make the hike to Troy when great bars in Albany are literally right down the road. I've never been to a bar night at Siena, but from what I heard it is usually a packed s**t show, so if you're into that, Siena may be right for you. For Friday and Saturday's, most of the parties take place up at the townhouses (Upperclassmen Housing). The Townhouses are fit for honestly 10 people max, but somehow every weekend a hundred drunk sweaty kids will fill these godforsaken dorms. That's the other thing, the residents of the houses like to act like their house is exclusive when in reality, 65% of their class live in the townhouses. I've seen booze served at like two parties, so pretty much everyone, including girls, are completely on their own when it comes to alcohol, so don't expect to attend keggers or anything like that."
College Freshman,2,"The Housing process at Siena College is brutal, the lottery system is referred to as ""The Hunger Games"" and it is truly every man for themselves. There are limited housing options for every class, you are either living in a far superior dorm or the one badly in need of renovation. This is inherently unfair given the lottery system. I also find it ridiculous that when you move into a dorm at Siena that you agree to live there for the four years it takes to graduate. The one positive takeaway from Siena's Housing are the social programs put on by Res Life. They go out of their way to make sure there are events on the weekends for students who don't drink to attend."
College Freshman,2,"Apparently, the degree does have some weight but in comparison to a major school I don't feel like I could get a good job with this degree unless I go to graduate school."
College Freshman,2,"Some people like it, I just don't see the upside. It's a mediocre school for students who didn't have the money or grades to go to a better catholic school like Villanova or Boston College."
College Freshman,2,Nobody cares about anything but the basketball team and even so no one cares much about them either. For a D1 school team spirit is weak.
College Freshman,2,"Most buildings are dimly lit, rooms are small, too hot in the winter, way too hot in the summer and the chance of getting the housing you want is low with the lottery system. Students who may have terrible track records still can attain high lottery numbers as well so it's pretty much a crap shoot. Hines would be nice to live in up until the townhouses but it is too far from the other dorms."
College Junior,2,I wanna enjoy my college experience without worrying
College Junior,2,The latest food option closes at around 11.  That is NOT okay for a college!!!!
College Junior,2,public safety is everywhere. especially on the weekends. its hard to have a good time when you're constantly thinking about getting written up.
College Junior,2,theres only one mall. hard for students who love to go shopping
College Freshman,2,The night life sucks- town houses aren't fun unless you know anyone here. Otherwise you're sitting in the dorms drinking- that's it.
College Freshman,2,"Public safety does a great job keeping students safe here on campus- sometimes it's too much. They take their jobs very seriously and you literally can't have fun here because you're always worrying about if public safety is gonna come. Also you can't have a guest unless you sign them in. One time I didn't get to print my boyfriend's overnight pass out before he got here and the public safety officer said that he needed to see some sort of identification and proof he was my guest, and would not let us go until he had it. How was I supposed to prove that if I didn't have the chance to print out the pass yet?"
College Freshman,2,The dorms are okay. They're an okay size but they're old and outdated. The bathrooms are always disgusting especially girls.
College Sophomore,2,"A professor once asked our beliefs on a topic being covered in class. the majority of the class expressed a liberal point of view. When I expressed my more conservative opinion, my ""friends"" completely disagreed. Because of their actions, we are no longer friends. They were not accepting of my beliefs. "
College Sophomore,2,"The students are fairly attractive.  But a lot of the girls (literally) have their noses in the air, and most of the guys might as well have 'douchebag' stamped on their foreheads.  Most of the school is athletic and/or preppy.  They like to get drunk and have random hookups.  People are in relationships, but hookup culture is prominent here."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing about the school seems that unique- it's a small college, and doesn't offer much that other schools don't."
College Sophomore,2,I avoid the dining hall. 
College Freshman,2,"So much alcohol is consumed, despite the no-tolerance policy, as the RAs don't really care. They say at the beginning of the year that if they don't see it, they don't care. Siena's also supposedly tobacco free, but that's definitely not the case."
College Freshman,2,"The only real option for off-campus housing are apartments ~10 minutes down the road, and they have no public transportation options that go to Siena directly."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly fast food, there is a Five Guys which is nice and of course a starbucks but all are about a 20 minute walk (only doable in rare warm weather) other than that you need a car to get to all of them."
College Freshman,2,"No fall, goes straight to winter up here and gets FREEZING!"
College Freshman,2,"Public safety is very strict but only if you get caught by them and its VERY easy to not get caught by them. It's the RAs you need to worry about, they're the ones that catch people and then call public safety if necessary. Even then you just keep the door shut and lower the music when quite hours start, Rule #1 dont step outside a room or house with anything alcoholic."
College Freshman,2,"Typical college dorms, in a bad way. small, old, smelly, dirty and the worst part is theres no amenities in the dorm halls besides laundry. No lounge to go sit in when you want to talk on the phone but your roommates doing homework, no printers or computer labs, no microwaves unless you spend $$$ to rent one though the school. For any of these you need to go out in the cold/rain/snow to another building. There are 2 newer dorm halls that have all these things plus more (New Hall and Padua) but they're junior and senior housing."
College Sophomore,2,"There is some variety of people, although most are rich white people. But, everyone does seem to mingle with people with other backgrounds which is a good thing."
College Senior,2,"There is diversity that exists at Siena with both race, religion, and sexual orientation. It isn't huge, but there are people of different orientations. Most people are white and catholic."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small campus, but there's limited parking.  A lot of times you'll get stuck parking out in Guam if you can't find a space, and the walk is a hassle.  Public safety will ticket you if you park in the wrong spot, too, or if you don't have a permit; However, if you don't have a permit and your car isn't registered, they can't charge you with the ticket."
Niche User,1,Honesty and honor within the athletic program hierarchy is suspect at best and needs a strong look at its policies and practices of same.
Junior,1,"Wish I wasn't forced to go to a local college close to home. Siena is by far the worst decision I have ever made. The campus is ""small"" and the classes claim to be small but expect to have like 25-40 kids in some of the classes. College treats adjunct professors horribly and underpays them. Diversity is 18% on campus so don't come here if you want diversity. The dorms are absolutely horrendous and you can get off-campus apartments that are 10x cheaper. The science courses are not curved like other colleges so half of the classes end up failing. DO NOT come if you are planning on majoring in psych. You'll have a very hard time registering for your classes for the first two years since they don't have many sections open for psych classes you may have to take classes that are irrelevant for two years. Considering the education I am getting, the price is still not worth it. Go to a state university, Siena is not special at all."
Alum,1,"I started my fall semester 16 weeks pregnant. 4 weeks into the semester my pregnancy turned to high risk, due to this I stopped attending school. I had a note from my obgyn explaining this. During my withdrawal interview, the person signed the date at the end of October. I told him I stopped going to school 4 weeks into the semester. He told me the interview was that day so that was my date of withdrawal. If the withdrawal interview person is on vacation when I want to withdrawal, how does that change my withdrawal date? Also, I showed him proof that my pregnancy was high risk & I couldn’t physically go to school everyday, he didn’t care. So, Siena, you really don’t care about your students like you say huh? A student that’s WD from classes for MEDICAL reasons and still hitting her with a $6500 bill? This is ridiculous"
Junior,1,"It's course selection is very limited, professors are old and grouchy, and the advisors are horrible. You get no help from anyone at this school you are basically on your own. 
The social life at the school is non existent. No Greek life and they hardly have any organized activities.  There is no place around to go out.
The athletics are not supported at this school at all. They just discontinued the field hockey program and did the same thing to the football program years ago, shows you what this school thinks of athletics! Discontinued our field hockey program because of budget cuts that needed to be made, meanwhile they are building a new athletic facility, shows you what they think about sports and women's sports especially! IF YOU ARE AN ATHLETE, DO NOT COME HERE!"
Freshman,1,"don’t go to this school if your looking to have fun of any kind at College. Public safety shuts down just about any “good” party there ever is, if anyone is actually having one. I could go on for hours on the other parts of the school like the diarrhea inducing food but I’ll just stop right here"
Freshman,1,"It's full of lies and deceit here. The dorms are a nightmare and a half. People are notoriously known for being transported to the hospital to get their stomach pumped. It happens on min. 3 times per week. Cocaine,pot, you name, it happens here at this school. Academics are subpar. Professors are either terrible or extremely arrogant. The science and math departments are trash. Only business majors or social work majors get a chance at this school.The Bonner Program is a joke here as well. The first question they ask you when you begin your interview is if you apply for financial aid. It's just another way to get kids jobs for work study.The school is filled with cliquey, stuck up individuals, that don't give you the time of day. People get status here by how much you drink and party, not by hard work put into academics and clubs. It's truly pathetic about what is portrayed about this ""catholic school of service""."
Freshman,1,"Going to Siena was the biggest mistake of my life, and its not worth the money. It's incredibly overpriced for the disgusting buildings you'll be living and studying in. If you have any dorm problems, the housing department will make your life miserable. Also,the admissions department will lie to you about EVERYTHING! The food service always serves chicken and baked potatoes, and FYI, you will get diarrhea and food poisoning. The professors are all a bunch of self-absorbed idiots who won't teach you the skills to thrive in the real world. Siena doesn't have a party scene, it really has a drinking scene, and students are frequently transported to the hospital for alcohol poisoning(and this is jokingly referred to by the students as ""Getting Transported""). Don't go to Siena, just don't..."
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Junior,1,we do not have greek life there is no frats or sororities
College Junior,1,"Public Safety will make your life hell, even if you don't drink. This is the one downfall of Siena, they are really hard on students (unless you are an Athlete)."
College Junior,1,"Had the worst possible experiences with Public safety. Even had a buddy get his backpack searched on a Monday morning, he was written up for having a beer can in his backpack from last weekend and charged upwards of $200.00 to take a course.

They are there to break up the fun but they also treat everyone like criminals.

The friendly ones are just that-- friendly. iAt Siena, t's up to the students not to make mistakes."
College Freshman,1,This school honestly just sucks eggs and the only reason I go here is because I have to
College Freshman,1,"I don't even know where to begin in this department, public safety at this school is an absolute joke. All they are concerned about is sniffing out booze and weed and ruining a 19 year old's life. Siena is in the middle of Loudonville, New York. Which is the epitome of white suburbia, yet Siena finds it productive to gate their campus and set up ""safety"" checkpoints on the weekends, when in reality they are trying to find the kids sneaking booze on campus or the kids who god forbid went out and smoked weed. They baby kids here to the extreme and I am quite honestly amazed that graduates transition into adulthood, because you are treated like 16 year olds at boarding school. It's pathetic"
College Freshman,1,Not fantastic neighborhoods and everything too far from campus.
College Freshman,1,Crappy chains and old mom and pops.
College Freshman,1,"Parties are poor, nothing to write home about. Students will make snapchats looked as sick as possible though."
College Junior,1,Lower classman can't party cause of in the presence
College Junior,1,I hate the lottery system. Should be awarded...
College Junior,1,No greek life what so ever :(

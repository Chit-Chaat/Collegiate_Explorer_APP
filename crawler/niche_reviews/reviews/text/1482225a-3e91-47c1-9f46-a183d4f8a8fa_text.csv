Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at Bryn Mawr and I really love it. The campus is beautiful and the students are very friendly. The anthropology department is amazing. Classes are definitely rigorous; don’t expect all A’s.
Junior,5,"Bryn Mawr College is a great school for anyone looking for a high-academic and supportive community. It is a historic all women's college where there are options for dual enrollment with co-ed schools. With small classrooms, it is easy to talk and ask for help from professors with academic/personal issues. As a liberal arts school, we receive a well-rounded education along with being able to focus on our major/minor tracks."
Freshman,5,Amazing Academic Environment. Teachers and students are always available to support. It really helps you transition from High school to college!
Sophomore,5,When I walked onto campus I felt like I was home.  I knew I belonged there.  There is a very strong sense of community and family.  I have support not only to exceed academically but also athletically.
Freshman,5,Bryn Mawr College has a beautiful campus and a wonderful community that is based around learning and student growth.
Junior,5,Bryn Mawr is an incredible institution that gives the best possible opportunities to pursue your dream career.
Freshman,5,Bryn Mawr is an amazing school! The environment and culture is so positive and adamant about change; it makes everyone an even better person by being a part of it all. I have found a real home and family here.
Alum,5,"I read a review saying the people are awkward. ""Awkward"" is a relative term & not really a gauge for quality. The sense of community was strong & welcoming. If you don't participate in the traditions, then you wouldn't see that. If you are not participating in traditions you are not experiencing BMC. I played athletics, 4-year athlete. There was huge community & support in athletics. The facilities are amazing. My professors and classmates were like my family. I found the most sense of community & belonging when I declared, I knew I made the right choice. The campus & dorms are beautiful. No kitchens but you know that before you attend. There’s plenty of things to do if you make an effort to find them. The town of Bryn Mawr is small, SEPTA can take you wherever you want to go. As an alum, I have a support system of alums & resources that I use today. The women I knew have gone on to higher education or have fulfilling careers. BMC was one of the best decisions I ever made."
Freshman,5,"I love the community at Bryn Mawr especially the community that the students have built for each other. Within a couple of days after the dorm assignments came out my roommate and I bonded and we applied to enter a computer science conference / competition together.  My entire class created a group-chat in which we have shared information regarding classes, trips to tour Philadelphia, and how we plan on supporting each other throughout our undergraduate years."
Alum,5,"Bryn Mawr has rigorous academics and a whip smart student body that will challenge you in class discussions, without being actively competitive. The honor code and strong sense of community allow a student to focus on learning everything she can without worrying about who might be getting a higher grade than she is. The alumnae network is amazing."
Freshman,5,"It's very pretty and the atmosphere is super chill. The professors are really understanding for the most part and they all are very knowledgeable in their department. Also the Bi-Co is a pretty neat program at the school. We could also take classes at Swarthmore and UPenn even though that's more uncommon but if you really want to do it you can. The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years. It can get a little boring because it's in a suburb but Philly close enough that you could go into the city every weekend if you wanted to. Would totally recommend!"
Junior,5,"Bryn Mawr is a fantastic school. The academics are top notch, and are a wonderful balance of challenge and personal support. Your professors push you, but make every resource available to help you succeed. The women of the college are inspiring, and it is easy to excel among a cohort of driven, empowered women."
Alum,5,"As an alum of 2004, Bryn Mawr was one of the most formative and special experiences of my life. I am grateful to have gone to Bryn Mawr and in no way would I have been able to achieve or learn in the way I was able to, by not being at an all-women's college.  I majored in areas that very few women across the world have an opportunity to do.  In addition, with great work comes great reward and I was able to easily matriculate into a top Ivy League graduate school immediately upon graduation.  I was stunned because I thought never in my wildest dreams could I achieve that--But all the thanks goes to the incredible teachers, TAs, and professional counselors, that allowed me to succeed.  If you go, you have to be in to win it, and never take this experience for granted!  I am so lucky I counted every day as important during my time there.  It was worth it, for all the hard work and effort. Also, the school traditions are extremely special and incredible--Especially Lantern night!! ;-)"
Senior,5,"BMC is a fantastic, liberal school with inspiring students and professors! The classes are well worth the money and the campus itself makes it all worth it."
Sophomore,5,"It is truly wonderful how much professors at Bryn Mawr care about students' success. The faculty is invested in your future, and you get personalized attention in all your classes. Additionally, research and internship opportunities are abundant, and the close-knit community of students is truly wonderful."
Junior,5,Bryn Mawr has been a place where I have been allowed to be me without being afaird of being judged. I can finally be me.
Sophomore,5,"My time at Bryn Mawr has been a great experience thus far! I've met so many wonderful people from a wide variety of backgrounds, I've had some incredible professors that really care about their students' success, experienced great traditions on campus, and I've had access to so many academic and extracurricular opportunities. I can't wait for the coming years here!"
Alum,5,"I attended undergrad and grad school at Bryn Mawr. I've also taken courses for credit at Lehigh, UPenn, Haverford, LSE, and received another grad degree from Purdue. With that wide perspective of colleges and universities, I am confident when I say that Bryn Mawr academics, professors, and the students are second to none."
Freshman,5,"I like the atmosphere at Bryn Mawr College and its community. All faculty members and students are extremely supportive in providing a safe and welcoming environment. As a freshman, I felt so welcomed by other students and everyone makes sure that you are comfortable and doing well."
Freshman,5,"I came to Bryn Mawr fearful, nervous, and alone. Nothing could have prepared me for the overwhelming kindness and support from my peers. At Bryn Mawr College, the success of few quickly turns into the success of the many. The party scene isn't phenomenal, but everyone finds their people at this school and everyone's emotional well-being is prioritized. We have tons of traditions that help to unify us as a campus and to foster long lasting friendships. We are a very liberal campus, full of boisterous young activists and individuals who genuinely love learning. At Bryn Mawr, everyone is treated with respect and tolerance. Racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, etc. are not tolerated, and hateful individuals quickly realize that this is not the campus for them. We are made of wisdom. We are made of love. We are Bryn Mawr."
College Junior,5,"The professors are great and extremely knowledgeable and influential. The registration process is fairly easy and you can pretty much take whatever class you want. I wish there were more unique study spaces, but that is what Philly is for!"
College Junior,5,"Bryn Mawr is extremely diverse in terms of race and gender, sort of political but not really economically."
College Junior,5,"Bryn Mawr is REALLY well known in higher-level education so even though someone off the street might not have heard of it, when you're looking for a job, that's when Bryn Mawr's name really does come into play. Bryn Mawr has LILAC services in order to help students who are looking for internships or jobs and they're pretty nice too."
College Junior,5,"Public Safety really does care about the safety of the students. The health center is okay, but they are going to go through renovations so it will be better hahaha."
College Junior,5,"The housing options for the dorms are INCREDIBLE! You are basically living in a castle, it can't get any better than that."
College Freshman,5,"I've loved all the classes I've taken here and all the professors I've studied under--they all have an excellent grasp of the material and have always encouraged myself and my fellow students to speak freely and openly on every subject that came up. I've really enjoyed learning here, and I genuinely feel that I've learned a lot."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Rhoads North and I absolutely adore it. My dorm is huge and even though I'm in the basement I still have windows and get a ton of light. QSR is a great space, the laundry room is immaculate, and the community is pretty great. Sometimes things get loud on the weekends, but for the most part, it's pretty quiet around here."
College Freshman,5,"Bryn Mawr is a very unique place, and it's honestly difficult to articulate why. There's just such a great sense of community here and for the most part, everyone is extraordinarily nice and supportive. It's a great environment that promotes learning and emphasizes each of us as individuals, not just numbers, not even just students. It's truly remarkable and I love it."
College Sophomore,5,"This campus is incredibly safe. While crime does happen, the majority of it is someone stealing ice cream from the communal fridge."
College Sophomore,5,"People know Bryn Mawr, and know that Bryn Mawr graduates are great. From Silicon Valley to the White House, it is common to find Bryn Mawr graduates."
College Sophomore,5,"Bryn Mawr has been an incredible experience. My professors have been supportive, my classes have been challenging, and my life has gone in directions I could never have imagined a few years ago."
College Sophomore,5,Our dorms are like palaces! Many have fireplaces and windowseats. It is easy to get a single after your first year.
College Sophomore,5,"From taking ""Sociology of Harry Potter"" in my first semester to a college-sponsored trip to Barcelona to study food and communication, Bryn Mawr has been incredible. Every experience I've had - from courses I took to fulfill requirements to student activities subsidized off-Broadway shows - has impacted me in some way."
College Sophomore,5,The Deans and academic advisers have always been helpful in making sure that we are aware of the opportunities on campus from study abroad to internships etc.
College Sophomore,5,My experience at Bryn Mawr College so far is great! There are multiple levels of members that are a part of the Dorm Leadership Team so someone is always available to help you in your dorm! They can help you from  your social life to your academic life and that is amazing! The professors are very caring and easy to approach and the community itself is very nurturing!
College Junior,5,"The people here are super cool or ingenious or crazy in every possible way. Being small enough that you know most people's faces makes campus social life feel like an endless web. Customs (your hall group with mentors as a first year) and hell families (a tradition like big and littles but better in every way) connect everyone so that you're never too far from a friend. There are some huge parties every year (Radnor Halloween, East v. West) but solid parties can be found in either the Pems, Radnor, Rock, and Batten most weekends. Swat/Haverford/UPenn classes are pretty easy to take, but it just makes you miss the Mawr. New classes are introduced frequently that study interesting topics, like terrorism and counterterrorism, treatment of the sex act in cinema, and the significance of food in East Asian cultures. Classes are typically 20-30 students witch some much smaller. So many a capella groups and theatre projects, our sports teams don't win a lot but they all love each other so much. It's joining a cult, you'll love it."
College Sophomore,5,Campus Safety is involved the perfect amount in student life. They don't care if you smoke or drink as long as you aren't being dangerous about it. They generally care about the well being of the students and do their best to accommodate. I've never seen them write a ticket or citation. The most common offense is smoking in the dorms which is taken pretty seriously because the dorms are flammable.
College Sophomore,5,Professors almost all go by their first names. They are very approachable and are willing to meet with you. A lot of them are looking for undergraduates to help them with research too. Class sizes are almost always smaller than average; they're probably about 10-15 students on average but some of the entry level math and science courses can be as large as 50 students. Professors are all very interested in their course material and encourage students to ask questions and engage in class discussions of the material.
College Freshman,5,"I have loved being able to choose classes that I'm actually interested. All my professors have been incredibly enthusiastic about their topic, and their knowledge of the subject(s) astounds me. The class sizes are excellent for discussions and professors often ask how students learn the best, working to incorporate different learning styles so that students get the best education they can."
College Freshman,5,we're in the middle of nowhere.
College Freshman,5,we. do. not. have. greek. life.
College Freshman,5,i dont really use the gym so bleh.
College Sophomore,5,"I could go on about how much I love Bryn Mawr forever. The faculty are laudible, the academics are challenging and enthralling, and its reputation as well as its connections to Haverford, Swarthmore, and Penn give it the resources of a large school while maintaining its unique character. The community is what drew me here, everyone is so passionate, compassionate, and enthusiastic about being who they are."
College Sophomore,5,"Bryn Mawr is a really special place. You will not find a community like this anywhere else. The traditions, community, and super supportive but challenging academics make it perfect."
College Freshman,5,"Psafe officers are friends. They have brought alcohol to underage parties before. They just make sure everyone is safe, they don't care about drinking or noise or climbing on roofs or anything. Psafe is the best."
College Freshman,5,Dorm are incredible. Beautiful and the dorm life is great. Almost everyone lives in dorms. Rooms are spacious and roommate selection worked out perfectly for me.
College Freshman,5,"Dorms are absolutely superb at Bryn Mawr. Even the smallest dorms are more roomy than average dorms at most colleges. In the average dorm, a student will have a walk-in closet either to themselves, or with a roommate, a fireplace, and a window seat. Heating is excellent, and each dorm is clean and well-kept. All dorms are right on campus except for one. This year, my furthest class has been a five minute walk from my dorm."
Recent Alumnus,5,The English major gave me a lot of flexibility with the areas on literature and writing that I was interested in. I loved taking classes for fun and actually have it count towards my degree. INTENSIVE READING for most 200 level and 300 levels
Recent Alumnus,5,Professors had lots of office hours and were always available through appointment. Collaborators is a good way to describe them. They push you to your limits and help you produce excellent work.
Recent Alumnus,5,It was everything I wanted. I developed academically and personally. I feel like a stronger person and someone who will forever be deeply connect to Bryn Mawr through the alumni network.
Recent Alumnus,5,We don't have greek life and it's the best.
College Freshman,5,"There a lot of work but its manageable, the profs are great"
Recent Alumnus,5,"I can't say enough about my professors. I built great relationships with them throughout all four years. Even though the volume of work was high, it was always worth meeting high demands and producing increasingly good academic work."
College Sophomore,5,"Philly is close, and our campus is beautiful. Really close to other colleges."
College Sophomore,5,There's even laptop lending program for students in need. It's awesome.
College Sophomore,5,Bryn Mawr is probably one of the most diverse college around. International students made up of about 25% of the student population.
College Sophomore,5,We have no Greek Life and we are a perfect community the way we are
College Sophomore,5,It's really safe on campus and even in town. I feel safe even when walking alone on an empty street at night.
College Sophomore,5,"There is a lot of leniency with drugs/alcohol, you won't get in trouble unless you make it very obvious that you are doing something you should not be doing! Campus is very strict on parking, you will get so many parking tickets you will scream if you don't pay attention to where to park. Honor code is held very highly at Bryn Mawr, it may sound crazy, but one day you too will be strict about the honor code!"
College Sophomore,5,"There are a ton of international students in the student body. Each class has at least a third from another country of origin, which is great because it allows everyone else to see a glimpse of another culture from people who really know about that country. It also allows the international students to find similar people and to deal with the shell shock of American culture."
Sophomore,4,I am taking classes online because of covid. I don’t love it but Bryn Mawr tries to be accommodating.
Junior,4,"During the Spring Semester of 2020, we, unfortunately, had to return home and finish our courses online. Bryn Mawr's quick response to the pandemic allowed for students to be able to consider their personal safety first. The support system we were given as students was fantastic, and most professors were able to adjust well to an online format. Going into the Fall Semester of 2020, students are also being given many options of whether to return to classes, to campus, take only online courses, etc."
Freshman,4,"I am a first-year so I don't have a full scope of the school, but I love it so far! Academics are amazing, the campus is beautiful, and the professors are great so far. I wish there was more of a party scene, and the diversity is not as wide as I was expecting but every school has room for improvement."
Alum,4,"Extremely student-oriented- students have a say in almost all major decisions the college makes. A very trusting community, campus is extremely safe. Food is good, but sometimes lacking in options. Student body isn't overly friendly."
Junior,4,"The school is very small but gives me the opportunity to branch out and learn. I have had numerous internships , jobs and a research position. I have created a schedule of classes that fit my wants, needs and interests."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes that Bryn Mawr provides. Students are able to get to know each other within the class setting, as well as the ability for the professor to know each student. Bryn Mawr is an inclusive setting, where our social honor code fosters trust within the community such that creativity and diversity is always welcomed. In the future, I would like to see Bryn Mawr allow more opportunities for students to explore the greater Philadelphia area within the structure of a class, instead of strictly lecture based classes for the entire semester. In addition, Bryn Mawr needs air conditioning in ALL of the dorms! It is brutally hot in the warmer months of the year, especially on the upper floors of the dorms."
Freshman,4,"-A small and beautiful campus with strong academics.
-Plenty of opportunities to explore one’s potential.
-Welcoming and friendly!"
Freshman,4,The diverse community of Bryn Mawr college provides a sense of belongingness and encouragesme to be myself. The Freshman experience was not made easy but it was made interesting:courses like the Thrive program helped me to make friends.
Alum,4,"Professors love what they teach and want to ignite an interest in higher learning in their students. The campus is lovely, with castle-like buildings and gorgeous greenery and hills. The weather can get very cold close to the winter months and gets insanely warm in the summer times. The buildings are not all well-insulated, so I would be careful to bring warm clothing and/or light clothing."
Freshman,4,"Bryn Mawr is a socially awkward place, people are very private and stay in their  cliques most of the time, and their isn't really a sense of community college wide. Because of these qualities, Bryn Mawr campus and classrooms definitely lack a dynamic atmosphere as you would normally encounter in other colleges. 
Academically, Bryn Mawr is rigorous. Though I do suspect that some Bryn Mawr professors water down the courses to make the contents more accessible to students... 
Living at Bryn Mawr is generally comfortable. However, since the structure of the dorm buildings are inflammable, none has kitchen. Also, there are no apartment style dorms. Food is nice, it has a lot of variety and healthy eating options. 
Bryn Mawr is located in a safe neighborhood. SEPTA train can take you to center Philly in 20 minutes. However, Bryn Mawr students do face risks of occasional harassment against social activism."
Junior,4,BMC is a small school that will give you the academic support and attention you need to perform well. It's a school filled with academically driven students which is very motivating.
Freshman,4,"I love the community and the people here, and it’s really easy to schedule an appointment with professors if you need help and their office hours don’t work for you. Academically, some classes are obviously harder than others, but you learn a lot, no matter what."
Freshman,4,"Extremely academics oriented in a good way, with plenty of on campus resources to help you succeed. Does not have too much party life on campus though. Among the top ranked dining services."
Freshman,4,"Bryn Mawr is a wonderful place, I love it here! The community is very diverse, there are so many ways to meet people and we all want to have the best experience we can! The Academics are very engaging and challenging and thats what makes so interesting."
College Student,4,Honestly I could care less about the sports teams but the athletic facilities are fantastic! There's plenty of equipment to use and everything is clean and visually appealing.
College Junior,4,"It's fun to go to parties with your friends, but most parties are with your close friends. Bryn Mawr has a couple of huge parties that happen during the year where a lot of people and schools from the surrounding area come, but other than that it's really who you know to go out and party. It's also pretty cool to have Philly so close so a lot of people go there as well."
College Junior,4,"Very safe, I've never felt in danger. Most parties happen in dorms."
College Junior,4,"The professors are what really make the academics here worth wild. The students are really supportive and non-competitive because of the honor code, which I think is a wonderful aspect when attending an undergraduate institution."
College Junior,4,"People don't necessarily pay attention to sports, but I feel like they are really underrepresented. People should pay attention more to them especially because athletes really do put a lot of effort into their team."
College Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my Bryn Mawr experience and I know that for some people it is not for them, but Bryn Mawr is truly a warm and inviting place for all students. The traditions, the alums, and the professors really do make this place wonderful."
College Freshman,4,"I got sick in the middle of my first semester and the health center was pretty helpful for me. They listened to me, got me the help I needed, and that was that."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many different spots - both varsity and intramural sports. Students are able to take up sports for fun, if they like."
College Sophomore,4,There are a variety of parties by different groups on campus so it is pretty fun.
College Sophomore,4,There is great diversity in sexual orientation and being mindful about the preferred pronouns of everyone on campus. We learn not to assume people's pronouns.
College Sophomore,4,People have a great time with or without drinking.
College Sophomore,4,Everywhere on campus there is always a campus safety number. One of the first thing emphasized to the first years at Bryn Mawr is to have the number of campus safety and to call them for literally anything.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are great, they each hold a symbolic value and facilities usually takes great care of it making sure that is clean and is a comfortable space to be a part of. The dorm I live in (Rock) has a home-like feel and the hallways are close but not too close so there is a social life available and easy to talk to anyone as they are always passing through the halls etc."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at my school always show highlights of an athlete in any of the sports who have shown exemplary skills in anything in particular. The facilities always email us with upcoming events and also provide us with numerous ways we can stay active on campus!
College Junior,4,"You get to know people in your major because there are usually only three or four classes each semester in any field, which creates a great learning environment. Some professors are semi-famous around campus for being really nice, inspiring, cute, or funny. The only bad professors I've met let the class go off topic too much, rather than were boring. Definite feel of a learning community in class, not just a bunch of people taking notes next to each other."
College Junior,4,"The dorms have cultures to them to varying degrees, room draw is stressful, but is intuitive so everyone can choose their roommates, rooms, and neighbors. Brecon is hardcore nerds, bless them. Radnor are intimidatingly cool, they go hard. Merion is like normal Brecon, more idly into pop culture. Denbigh is moderately quiet, lots of athletes. Fun fact, those two are insulated with horse hair and therefore suuuuper flammable. The Pems and Rock are just central living, although Rock is both beautiful and super confusing. Rhoads is beautiful like Hogwarts, overlooking a hill and pond, very quiet. Erdman has a dining hall, looks like the set for post-apocalyptic Hamlet, and is full of chill people. New Dorm is new, also has an (inferior) dining hall."
College Freshman,4,"The profs are excellent, as is the curriculum. Registration can be difficult at times, but becomes easier as you get to know the system. The workload depends on the prof, but is generally manageable."
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is large and helpful though having a ""liberal arts"" degree can be a bit less practical than a school that offers majors that streamline students into the corporate world. A lot of students will pursue graduate school after graduation. the career center is active on campus and tries their best to reach out to students. The school is small though so it doesn't funnel students into jobs that are particularly well known as far as I can tell. The name of the school alone will help with some applications though."
College Sophomore,4,"It's usually pretty easy to get a single starting your sophomore year. All the dorms are less than a ten minute walk from all the academic buildings which is really convenient. The Pems, Radnor, and Rock provide more of a social scene and can be louder on the weekends. Denbigh is where a lot of the athletes live and it is generally clean and quiet. Merion doesn't have the best bathrooms but is quiet and generally has an okay community with some die hard Merions. Haffner is now called New Dorm, and it has super sweet amenities, all singles and air conditioning but is pretty far from the center of campus. Erdman is nice because it's attached to the dining hall but the inside is pretty depressing looking and it's almost always silent. Rhoads is on the perimeter of campus but isn't too bad of a walk from anything, it's generally highly sought after during room draw. Brecon is WAY from the center of campus (relative to the size of campus) but the community is probably the best."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, though the workload can be overwhelming enough to make you forget. The workload is heavy but manageable and the general student body is ambitious and driven. There's definitely a strong concentration on political and social activism and a lot of the school's general atmosphere is fueled by that. Students are intelligent and usually unafraid to inform someone who isn't being politically correct, pushing students to grow past their comfort zones into more aware individuals willing to voice what they believe in."
College Freshman,4,Public safety is very down to earth and accessible. They aren't the cops.
College Freshman,4,Intro classes are generally going to be large and lecture based. It's language and 200 level+ classes where you really get the seminar style classes. Teachers are very supportive and seem to care more about teaching than grading.
College Freshman,4,"A lot of BMC's flaws are actually just things you should expect from a small liberal arts school: limited class selection, fewer major options, seeing the same faces day after day, etc. But those things can also be spun into positives, like more class participation, people who know what they want to do, being surrounded by friends, etc. Bryn Mawr has a heavy emphasis on self care. One of our mottos is ""done is good"" in reference to not stressing too much over assignments, and we rarely discuss grades. Most of the teachers will tell you that teaching is their priority, not grading. Departments outside academics such as health services and academic advising are very helpful, but financial aid/admissions can be a big terse on occasion, so if your tour guide or information session host seems unfriendly, don't let that be your only experience with the faculty. In terms of opportunities, it's very easy to take classes at Haverford. If you got into BMC, you might as well have also gotten into Haverford. They tout Swarthmore as the mythical third member of the trico, but don't be fooled: it's very difficult to get into a class there that isn't Linguistics, since Linguistics is designated as a trico major. It's the same way with UPenn. The transportation to and from Swat is a van with six seats that leaves every half hour or so, so it's a little harder to find a seat than on the bus to Haverford. You generally have to take a train to UPenn as well."
College Freshman,4,"From what I have heard, it is fairly easy for students to find jobs and internships within their majors, which is promising. While students might not find a steady job related to their major right after graduation, they can reach out to the alumni network for help in finding jobs. The career center is very helpful for looking for job and internship opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"I love the fact that for the most part, students are placed in dorms that will fit their personality or lifestyle. As a quiet and less social student, I was put in one of the quieter dorms, which helped immensely with my study habits. However, the res life is very accommodating if there's an emergency or reason you need to switch rooms or even dorms. The hall groups typically are very supportive and custom groups often end up feeling like a family. The housing process is apparently difficult and confusing, but the fact that students have the opportunity to choose their rooms is nice. All the dorms are convenient in terms of getting to classes and the dining halls, which is great."
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love all my professors and nearly all the students make incoming freshman feel welcome and supported, which is different from other experiences I've heard of. The traditions of the school make the students have a closer bond, which is an incredible feeling. All the professors urge students to come to office hours, even if they want to talk about something non-academic. The only reasons I wouldn't choose the school is the price and the distance from home, but through good friends and a great financial aid office, neither of these things are too bad."
College Freshman,4,"It has a small, close-knit community and everyone there is very welcoming and inviting."
College Freshman,4,"Haffner is my favorite, but Erdman is good too. Always something new and good of vegetarians or vegans. Dining halls close too early for my liking, but Uncommon is open for snacks (that cost money) or ordering from Campus Corner (again, money)."
Recent Alumnus,4,Rarely complained about it. Sometimes lacked variety. Special dinners/lunches were a nice highlight and pretty frequent.
Recent Alumnus,4,The Self Government Association does an excellent job at bridging the communication and power between students and administrators. I've noticed that there is no clear way to identify situations where students are held accountable and should be the ones delineating action and when the administration should which cause tension.
Recent Alumnus,4,"girls at bmc are usually hipster chic (urban outfitters, high waisted jeans, etc). Having the tri-co makes it easier to find people if that's what you're interested in. I personally wasn't really concerned."
Recent Alumnus,4,"BMC is on the mainline which is populated by old, rich, white people. Thus, barely any crime. Campus safety is on top of things on campus since it's pretty small."
College Freshman,4,"There is definitely a ""type"" or a few different types of students who really truly love Bryn Mawr. The professors are amazing, classes are really awesome. Definitely not a typical college experience, for some it works for others not so much."
College Freshman,4,They do their best to hear what the students have to say
College Sophomore,4,On campus parties are lively and fun but most girls go to Haverford or Penn to meet guys.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Bryn Mawr is very lucky to have a policy wherein students are comfortable reaching out to campus safety when if a student is in danger. Students have a many opportunities for communicating their concerns to the administration about social events, and the Party Training system means that the administration is able to manage the social atmosphere. 

There is definitely an emphasis on attendance at Bryn Mawr, as many classes are small and discussion based, and students are expected to build a class-to-class rapport with their peers and with their professors. I rarely intentionally missed class while at Bryn Mawr, the exception being my larger lecture-style classes.

The honor system is also a point of pride, as students regularly reinforce it amongst each other. It is a system that benefited us, allowing us to schedule our own exams or take them home, and also encourages a positive academic environment."
College Sophomore,4,Gym facilities are very open to athletes and general population. Amazing building and brand-new facilities. Great classes and options
College Sophomore,4,"Stuck in Brecon freshman year with no idea what I had gotten into. Housing is a bit complicated, but a really valuable system."
College Sophomore,4,The honor code keeps us feeling safe and respected
College Sophomore,4,The buildings sure are mostly pretty old but that what makes living in these dorms so special. It also doesn't mean that the facility is bad. It looks old outside but totally modern inside. Residential life is great with the Honor Code and residential life assistants too.
College Sophomore,4,"The school did a great job processing financial aid. Only thing is that no one likes loan, otherwise I would have rated best!"
College Sophomore,4,I feel very comfortable with the policy and strictness. I really think they are strict on things that are important to the community and lenient on area where students can take care of themselves.
College Sophomore,4,Classes are hard! I am an English major and challenged every day. Workload is A LOT! Don't expect to always finish all of your homework.
College Sophomore,4,"Weed is very noticeable on campus, people will smoke in the dorms. Other than that, you won't hear too much about other drugs unless you are actively looking for it yourself (which if you are, it's mostly pretty easy to find, whatever it is you're looking for). Alcohol is a big thing at Bryn Mawr, especially during Traditions! If you don't drink, IT IS OKAY! We will still love you!"
College Sophomore,4,"The rooms may be a little small when you're an underclassmen, but it gets better! The least strict of housing is Radnor and the most strict is Brecon."
College Sophomore,4,"If you want to be a part of a sport and make it a large part of your life, you can easily do that!"
Freshman,2,"I think that Bryn Mawr College is for a specific type of student- this school is not for everyone. I am white, straight, and come from a conservative background and southern town. People would make AWFUL assumptions about my identity (even though I'm liberal). I became really upset after awhile because students would form cliques based on their status in certain niches. BMC students all try to espouse the same ideology and only care about school and politics. Bryn Mawr also has a huge problem with restrictions on free speech- students may become  hostile if you stray away from the norms of the ""honor code"". I was called a racist, bigot, and classist at some point during my time at Bryn Mawr. It seems like an accepting place; however, students are very intolerant of unpopular/uncommon opinions."
College Student,2,"If you're a caucasian, cisgender, heterosexual female with conservative leaning values you better be ready to either censor all of your opinions or get bullied off of campus. While many people at Bryn Mawr are wonderful there's a significant amount of students who are radically and hatefully liberal. Not only are those students present on campus, but they are allowed to run wild with no resistance from administration. People at this school get offended by the dumbest things and there is a constant competition to see who can be the most victimized. It's stupid and exhausting. Don't be tricked into thinking that this school is accepting because it's not. You're only accepted until you're not like them."
College Sophomore,2,"Generally, students do not concentrate at sports at this school. Though athletes are generally close with their teammates and spend a lot of time and dedication to their sport, the student body as a whole does not participate much. The gym and self care is highly encouraged but being an athlete on a varsity team is more for yourself than any recognition at the school."
College Freshman,2,"Everything looks like Hogwarts, yadda yadda yadda. It's the multiple capacity dorms reviewers seem to be talking about when they say how beautiful and antiquated everything seems. Not that there's a lack of decent single options on campus... except that there is. Keep in mind that only three of the dorms have AC: New Dorm, Enid Cook, and Rhoads. Except they won't turn it on because it's not fair to the other dorms that don't have AC. If you're looking for quality beyond visual aesthetics, this is not the place for you. Walls are thin, sophomore singles are scarce, mice run rampant, temperature control is a nightmare. A lot of the windows don't open all the way, making it impossible to get a breeze in the hot summer months. While individual dorm rooms have their own visual quirks (fire places, etc) the only kinds of dorms you can live in here are the traditional ones with communal bathrooms. No fancy apartments, etc. It's basically a cute, antiquated little cell block."
College Freshman,2,"Very few actual parties at Bryn Mawr. If you want to party, you go to Haverford for the night, which is good, because you don't wake up to puke everywhere. Buses run late enough to bring you to and back from parties."
College Freshman,2,Sports are not that big here.
College Freshman,2,Bryn Mawr barely has a nightlife.
College Sophomore,2,There's not enough night life around. But we study a lot anyway.
College Senior,2,"Bryn Mawr's 'parties' really do consist of just hanging out in the dorm. The school doesn't really emphasize 'partying' as an acceptable destressing activity, so they encourage us to watch screened Disney films in one of the buildings or take us to King of Prussia mall on the weekends. However, this doesn't distress many students because this is what they want to partake in anyhow. Must go off campus to party."
College Senior,2,"The school is in a small residential neighborhood so clubs/bars locally apart from a couple pubs. On campus there are some small parties and 2-3 large parties a year, but it is also pretty easy to go to haverford, swarthmore, and to some extent UPenn for parties by bus (Free: Haverford and Swat) or by train (~$5 to UPenn). It also is about a $5 cab fare to Villanova."
College Sophomore,2,"People Drink More Than Do Drugs – All depends on who you hang out with, just like any other school."
College Freshman,2,"Overlooked and Underfunded – While the athletic facilities have received more money in recent years, they still aren't really what they should be. We don't have our own cross country course or track (indoor or outdoor) and we don't have indoor tennis courts, which hinders those sports. Our fan support is minimal at best, we are a joke in our conference, and even some of the athletes don't take it seriously. We also have very little support or understanding from the administration. As a serious swimmer, this frustrates me, but I see things going in a positive direction."
College Freshman,2,"Barely There – Sometimes there's a hopping party at Bryn Mawr, maybe 3x a year, but it's not that great. Public Safety makes sure the servers don't give anyone more than 4 drinks at the party, and keep the number of people in the building at capacity. It's for our own safety but it's still not fun.
There are some parties at Haverford and Swarthmore that you can go to via the Blue Bus, but they're generally small. Your best bet is to go into the city to find a party at Upenn or another Philly college. That's what most underage students do if they want to leave tri-co, but you have to take the train if you don't have a place to stay over night and the last train is around 2am."
College Senior,2,"Know What You're Getting Into – Most night-time events at Bryn Mawr involve dry parties, movie nights, roller rinks or art parties. The Bryn Mawr Concert Series brings underground groups to campus every few weeks, and those parties are pretty large but are mostly attended by Mawrters. The organization is working to garner outside interest.

I spend Friday and Saturday nights at Haverford with the friends I've made there. Bryn Mawr students who are into hard parties generally head over to Villanova or into Philly.

There are a bunch of dive bars in town that are fun if your expectations are low. If you're into dancing with your girlfriends by the jukebox, or into hosting your own party in the dorm, Bryn Mawr is a fine place for that kind of thing."
Niche User,2,"Probably Wouldn't Come Back – Let's be honest: the social atmosphere is not everyone's cup of tea. Half of the campus struggles with mental health issues. If you are into chicks, you will probably have a rich social life; the opposite is true if you are into guys. But the real deal breaker for me are academics. Everyone feels entitled to As, yet few students actually buckle down and do their work. Instead, they whine whine whine until the professors give in. The professors are awesome though. If you are willing to work, they will make your success a priority!"
College Sophomore,2,"No Community – While the campus is quite beautiful, the suburban location is quite stifling. The proximity/accessibility to Philly and relationships w/ the bi-co/tri-co are completely exaggerated and much harder to pertain then I originally imagined coming into the school. Very easy to get into a rut and just stay in your room, limited interaction with the opposite sex. Students are exclusive and stick to their dorm rooms. Not a very cohesive community, hardly anybody on campus. Very, very boring. Excruciatingly boring. Girls are so feminist it boarders anti-feminism, people are too open and expecting, yet not very accepting. Students are very unattractive, overweight, and completely negligent to their overall appearances. There are a few gems out there, but hard to find. All that said, the academics are great. I absolutely love my teacher and classes. Work is very manageable if you have good study habits."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid department is filled with nice people, but they are a little disorganized. I turned in everything on my online list and a couple of weeks later I received an e-mail saying I still needed things, which was very frustrating as I would have taken care of it when I was dealing with everything else. I received a decent amount of aid, but it was a complete hassle going through the process."
College Junior,2,"I do not own a car to use or park with on campus, but the parking on campus is all right, there seem to be enough spots for students, but they are strict about where students are allowed to park their cars."
Niche User,2,"What Dating Scene? Half of the students don't care about their looks. Why should they, with no dating scene around?"
Freshman,1,Terrible; I wish I could select zero stars. Not accommodating AT ALL. Do not expect the professors or any of the staff to care about you; unless it is convenient for themselves.
Freshman,1,"Wish I could give zero stars. Please do not come here. All of the staff are extremely hostile. They are so set in their own ""perfect"" ways of doing things that they will not consider any outside opinions that differ from their own."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lame.  The town in expensive, it is worth it to just live on campus. You get a better sense of community on campus. "
College Freshman,1,"Sports are not that big of a deal. School and fan spirit only comes from other athletes. It is very rare to see non-athletes at any sporting event. On the bright side, all of the facilities are new and very modern."
College Freshman,1,"Let's be real, Bryn Mawr athletics are TERRIBLE. A good portion of the teams haven't won a conference game in years (or at all). Some have only one 1 or 2 games per season or not at all. I don't even like letting people know my school has varsity sports teams. I have been to a few games and these girls wouldn't even make a JV high school team. I am pretty sure some didn't even play in high school. Please do not waste your time with this school if you are at all interested in sports and have played even a year of varsity in high school, you will be WAY to good for our teams. I know the athletes work hard and practice everyday, but if you aren't good enough/didn't play in high school why do you deserve to represent your college? No one attends games either, but why should we? Save some money Bryn Mawr, get rid of athletics. "
College Freshman,1,"Not. Good. It is actually painful to attend Bryn Mawr sports events, not only are they not well attended but the teams NEVER win. The athletic center however is GORGEOUS."
Niche User,1,"Basically Nonexistent – Bryn Mawr is an upscale residential neighborhood, not a college town. There are a few restaurants within 2 miles of campus for an occasional dinner off campus, but you will want to have most of your meals on campus."
College Senior,1,"Almost Non-Existent – We don't really have a night life. Most girls here go to Haverford and Swarthmore to meet guys and go drinking. We have some parties here, but they are few and far between."
College Junior,1,"We are a Division III school and our sports are horrible. it seems to stem from poor coaching and a disorganized program and student disinterest. Some of the students work hard, but there are also student prone to going to parties before games and they may claim to not drink, but will still stay out very late at night and then are upset when we lose our games."

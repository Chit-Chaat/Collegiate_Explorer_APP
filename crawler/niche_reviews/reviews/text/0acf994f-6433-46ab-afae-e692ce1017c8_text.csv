Niche User,5,Cleveland Institute of Music presents a welcoming environment with incredible faculty and interesting student events. It would be nice for CIM to have an on campus gym.
Junior,5,"The only reason I keep going to CIM is because their donut days are so amazing. I get to talk to the student government association, drink coffee, and eat donuts all on a Monday morning. How much better can this music school get?"
Senior,5,the environment is very supportive. The world class teachers are great. The city is not very safe. The people are very friendly. It is close to the world famous CLeveland orchestra. The school is very beautiful. Students can also take classes at the case western reserve university
College Sophomore,5,"The music world is a small world. There are some Donut Days where alumni come and visit, and the atmosphere is very friendly: we can go up to anyone and strike up a conversation. If you need any help or are looking for more information on jobs, classes, etc, the information is all very accessible."
College Sophomore,5,"I think most of the required courses are all important and very helpful to the students. The professors know what they're teaching, and because the classes aren't big, it is very involved. I love being surrounded by everything music related, yet still get connected to the 'real world' through the gen-ed requirements and classes that we have to take at CWRU"
College Sophomore,5,"It's an amazing experience: being surrounded by other high-achieving musicians, getting very interactive lessons and masterclasses from the world's finest professors. CIM is unique because the school doesn't hire TAs, all lessons are given by the professors themselves. If underclassmen have any questions, the masters/doctor students are very open to help you anytime. From the faculty to the security guards to the students, everyone is warm and inviting. 

The students are all very focused and aspiring. The school doesn't need requirements to attend each others' recitals, because the students are interested and supportive anyway. 

I love the school, and definitely I will consider staying at CIM for my graduate degree as well."
College Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere and environment is so warm and supportive. As a music major and as a student who is seriously thinking about becoming a musician, CIM is a wonderful place to be. Focusing solely on music (with a couple gen ed classes for requirements) is really what I've been looking for. The professors, staff, and peers are always supportive in whatever you do."
College Sophomore,5,"My school has students from all over the world, from Asia to Europe, America, and Africa. Because we have a large variety of ethnic groups, everyone is friendly toward each other and I do not sense much of any discrimination."
College Freshman,5,"With The Cleveland Orchestra giving concerts at Severance Hall within walking distance at the school, plus some restaurants nearby, students always have an option of a fine evening."
College Sophomore,4,"Cleveland is honestly not the safest place on earth. But the community at CIM is all very high-class, well educated, and has good values. If there is any problem, there are people who you could talk to and get help from."
College Sophomore,4,"Lived in the dorm for 2 years, it is pretty nice. Very close to the CIM building, reasonable proximity to other classes as well. It is a very social environment, super easy to make friends. Only about 30% of the students at CIM live in the dorm, everyone else lives off campus, which is also easy to find."
College Sophomore,4,The school enforces very strict rules on the plagiarism. Students immediately fail the course when the school catch them plagiarizing.
College Sophomore,4,"The school provides many shuttles that go to different parts of the campus. Also, later in the night, we can call a ""safe ride"" which drops you off in front of you place. They wait until you go into your place. Everything does not cost anything for students."
College Sophomore,4,"I do not think there is any peer pressure for the drugs. Because not many activities happen around the school, people tend to drink more. Alcohol and drugs are prohibited at the dorm because the first and second year students are under age."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of local restaurants with diverse ethnic food. The price is not too bad, except for a few high end restaurants. However, most of these restaurants are not within the walking distance."
College Sophomore,4,"The newly built Mixon Concert Hall looks beautiful from the outside and has amazing acoustics. The University Circle - combined with Case Western Reserve University campus- offers awesome experiences for the students, such as free admission to the Cleveland Museum of Art (has amazing collections) and Botanical Garden. However, there are not that many places to eat around school and it is a bit dangerous to walk around the school during the night."
College Junior,4,"The process was easy, but the amount was not. It is a very expensive school to attend, and the scholarships/avaiable work study amounts aren't great."
College Junior,4,"There is constant security in the building as well as Cleveland police around frequently. It is, however, a city. Walking in certain areas alone and/or at not is ill-advised, but in the building there are rarely problems."
College Student,4,"I visited the campus, and it was really good. I have a good inmpression so far about this school."
College Student,4,The school is very stable in terms of not doing any bad stuff such as drugs or alcohol.
College Student,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful. It is in the Case Western University circle. It is very calm, safe, and a very stable community. It is an ideal place for college life. The security is also very good in that area."
College Freshman,4,"Mu Phi Epsilon – There is some Greek life at Case Western but only one fraternity at CIM : Mu Phi Epsilon (the professional music fraternity). This fraternity is co-ed and does not have a living requirement. Mu Phi mainly works for community service (members get gigs at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland School of the Arts, and John Hay High School). We also received grant money to give scholarships to high school students that want to pursue a career in music. Mu Phi is also a great way to apply for scholarships for summer programs and festivals. There are about 20 members currently (undergrad and grad)"
College Freshman,4,"The entire building is kept extremely clean. The recital halls (Kulas and Mixon) are absolutely amazing. Especially Mixon (which is new) is beautiful and has fantastic sound. 

The music library is excellent and also includes current music magazines and study areas. The media center (located in the downstairs section of the library) has great facilities and includes two large, ""group"" listening rooms with comfortable seating and great speakers. 

The practice rooms are standard and look sort of like cell blocks. Each one has a piano, bench, stand, and a mirror. However, you can sign out studios if you would rather practice in those (usually available during the evening hours).

Overall - the facilities are kept in top shape."
College Sophomore,4,"Famous for a Reason – The interaction between faculty and students is fantastic because the school is so small. Every student and teacher is phenomenally talented and the environment is fantastic. You have to be an extremely hard worker to come to this school. It's extremely competitive, but not in a cut throat way. Students are very supportive of each other, but also work very hard. Practicing 5 hours a day is  around average."
College Junior,2,"S*** for the price they charge you, I expect much more. Rat infestation, bugs, and did not respond to maintenance issues in timely manner. Dorms were built in the 60s and feels like they haven't been touched since."
College Sophomore,2,"Cleveland has very extreme weather. It is very cold and snows a lot during the winter, and it is very hot and humid during the summer."
College Junior,2,"There is one computer lab. But, as we are a music school, it isn't used often. Which is good, because it is very small. IT is non-existant, though that is a personell issue at the moment. We get a lot of tech support from CWRU, including our wireless, which is spotty in the music school."
College Freshman,2,Cloudy most of the time. Very cold and lots of snow.
Alum,1,"Be prepared for horrible admissions people to work with, the Cleveland Orchestra is the best and only great thing about the city, I was a student there back 10 year ago. I was mugged twice and the university just say ""these things happen"" If you want to go in this most depressing city with highest overcast city in the county, live here...the school is made up of rich privileged kids who isnt great except maybe the top 1%.  Oh and the practice rooms are like prison, it was voted most ugly campus in the USA."

Sophomore,5,LeTourneau University offers quality learning material and helps student find jobs and earn experience during their course of study. It strives to give students the opportunity to reach their max potential.
Sophomore,5,The online program that they use is very efficient and it is easy to stay communicated with professors and students within the same class.
Freshman,5,LeTourneau University is just an awesome place to be. The environment is ideal for studying and it is a very peaceful place. The staff and faculty are very helpful and the professors try very hard to get to know everyone to release tension while studying. The students are very friendly so it is very easy to make friends which makes the school experience superb. My school is not a party school because it is a Christian school but it is still very fun in its own way. There are a lot of games going on all the time and anyone at all can be involved. It used to not be very diverse but its diversity is escalating as time goes by. It is a safe place for not only Americans but for students from all over the world. I absolutely love the fact that my school believes in learning by doing so we are always doing hands-on training which makes learning easy and fun. Another thing I love about LeTourneau is that everyone is recognised as equal no matter what and so everyone is respected and loved.
Graduate Student,5,"The best thing about LeTourneau is the people, faculty and staff. The professors care that each student receive the best possible educational experience. The feedback is valuable, some times hard to hear but fair and meant for student growth and maturity."
Graduate Student,5,"All but one of my classes is online. The professors use live-feed, videos, powerpoint. We have conference calls for groups and project preparation. I feel very well prepared for my future career."
Sophomore,5,"I love my university! Although it is a small campus and a small student body, it makes it very easy to connect with others around you. The programs that we offer are very hands on. As an education major, I was working in schools and with children in my first year. This school is not known for its education program, however, it excels in all of the degrees they offer. Since LeTourneau University is a Christian Campus, you will no find any frat parties. We do have fun events every Friday night that rang from movie nights, to dance, to painting with Bob Ross!"
Sophomore,5,"I like that it is small and that you get to know your professors well. The professors and student life is great and everyone you meet is so nice. Having chapel requirements is not too bad because they offer a lot of different types of credit you can get, which is nice for people with busy schedules. The campus food is not bad, but it would be cool if they added a fast food chain on or near campus. The strict housing rules are kind of a turn off because college is about growing and learning how to become  an adult, and that is hard to do when they do not allow you to live off campus for your first 3/4 years (unless you have an exception). The area of Longview is not bad at all, but the area directly around campus (within a 2-3 mile radius) is not very safe. Overall, it is a great school and if you like a small town and easy going lifestyle, LeTourneau University is the place for you."
Sophomore,5,Just recently transferred here to pursue aviation. I haven’t physically been there but I went to the airport in McKinney and spoke to a aviation instructor there who was very helpful.
Freshman,5,"All of my professors have been kind and understanding. I have enjoyed the experience so much. I’ve made friends with my professors and feel comfortable asking them for help when needed. 
And the campus is extremely beautiful I could walk for hours."
Junior,5,The campus at LeTourneau University is very beautiful and clean. The professors and administrators truly care for the students and want you to succeed in everything you do.
Freshman,5,"LeTourneau's engineering education is very high quality with a variety of hands-on work to prepare you for the work force. If you want to study engineering then this is the place to go. Also, all the professors and students are very friendly and want to get to know you, which creates a great community to be a part of."
Senior,5,This private university gives you the quality of a solid education in a Christian environment. You learn to integrate your faith and education into this life we live in. This is a skill that is worth more than gold!
Sophomore,5,Very friendly environment and one of the nicest campuses in the country. It’s relatively small size makes getting to classes very easy. Professors are easy to get ahold of and always willing to help. The people that go their are the nicest people you’ll ever meet and it is the safest place to be. I’ve never had any problems with students or faculty. The surrounding area is a little underwhelming not much to do very small quiet town. All of the facilities and classrooms are very nice and the entire campus is very clean.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love LeTourneau! It is a great environment and the instructors really do care, not just about our academic success, but also our emotional and spiritual well-being. I love the people here, and it’s just a nice family."
Senior,5,"I have had a great experience studying at LeTourneau University, the staff are very helpful and the academics are great!"
Freshman,5,LeTourneau University has been amazing so far. I have made some really good friends already and I love every second I get to spend with them. My classes are great and the professors I have had have been even better. Being at LeTourneau has been a blessing as the small class sizes mean it is easy to communicate with professors in person and through email. They respond quickly and can answer most of your questions. I would not want to be anywhere else.
Junior,5,LeTourneau University is one of the few remaining universities that upholds Christian values. LeTourneau is a safe and conservative school with incredible professors providing a great education and is well respected in many industries.
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience at this school. The professors are great and the people are amazing. The classes are challenging but still worthwhile.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy everything about LeTourneau University.  The professors are excellent, the classes are interesting, and the students are great.  The cafeteria is excellent too!"
Niche User,5,"I loved Letournal because of its diversity, it reminded me about home and catholic membership. The people are very nice and supportive. They have aviation. They have good foos and teachers that can help you in any way needed"
Senior,5,"I am online student so i don't know much about the campus scene, but i can tell you the professors are awesome and obtaining a degree from LeTourneau University is very much a wise investment"
Junior,5,LeTourneau University offers a biblical approach of study any subject. I love attending and look foward to graduating with knowledge from both God and psychology.
Senior,5,"Excellent online learning, simple to use website and the classes are normally one at a time so you can focus on them."
Sophomore,5,LeTourneau University has taught me the value of hard work and the role that it will have in my life. My teachers are always there for me if I need help and the community is very welcoming.
Junior,5,Super friendly staff and overall wonderful atmosphere. Everyone is extremely helpful and work hard so you can succeed.
Senior,5,"LETU has excellent academics with very experienced and well versed professors. It is a small school with around 1500 students. You are likely to find friends here as it is small but if you are a bit of a social outcast, it might not be the greatest place. It is a Christian College and if you do not fit the mold of the conservative, Christian, and intelligent type, then look elsewhere."
Senior,5,"It’s a wonderful Christian university and you will get a wonderful education. The campus life is great because most of the students really care about deepening their relationship with Christ and they have a lot of fun with other activities too. The teacher education program is great! They will challenge you, but they truly care that you succeed and become the best teacher you can be."
Sophomore,5,"Letourneau University is a great school for students pursing a degree in Education. I am completing the online education program at the moment, and despite any of my struggles, the school continues to work with me. The professors are very helpful and quick to respond, as I am an online student. I have received phone calls and emails from various professors checking to see how I am doing. All in all, the school is very loving and supportive. Not to mention, Christian-based."
Niche User,5,I liked the academics and there job placement rate after graduation for my major. There was not much that I would like to see changed.
Senior,5,LeTourneau University is a Christian based college. They offer on-campus and online classes. It is an excellent college with some wonderful professors. I have had a great experience there!!
Freshman,5,Its a great college with a beautiful campus! the people there are great and the teachers really care about you and want you to succeed.I really like that they include Gods word in their teaching and making it God centered instead of self-centered.
Sophomore,5,"LeTourneau is a smaller university when compared to others. With only around 2,300 students on the main campus, some high schools are bigger. But that is what I like about it. A smaller school where the teachers get to know you and everyone knows everyone. A strong sense of community and friendship is in the atmosphere whenever you are there. Plus the Christian background gives it the reputation and well meaning a sense of security. The teachers and staff are helpful and friendly, and the learning experience is one of the best."
Sophomore,5,"LeTourneau University is a great, little college that challenges you academically and spiritually to be excellent in your chosen field. This institution focuses on creating a robust and useful workforce."
Freshman,5,"The college is great. The professors are so outgoing and understanding and they want to help you do better and be your best. The students are so kind and it's great being able to openly talk about your faith in or outside of the classroom. Not only that but the campus itself is absolutely gorgeous. If you're looking for a beautiful campus with a friendly atmosphere, LeTourneau is the place for you and I promise you won't regret your college choice. I know I don't."
Sophomore,5,LeTourneau University is a fantastic school. It is an academically strenuous environment but all the Professors are willing to work with you in order to ensure that you succeed. The campus has an amazing community which helps when times get tough. It also offers a large variety of classes which spans across many different professional fields.
Freshman,5,I love the vibes around campus. Everyone is so nice around here! The professors truly care about your education.
Freshman,5,"I love LeTourneau University! The small size allows me to be close with my professors. I know the head of the Mechanical Engineering department, and he often invites me and a few other students to visit his house down the street for Korean food, because he knows I love kimbab. I have gotten close with the people in my dorm. LeTourneau has challenged me, but also it has allowed me to be more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever been. I have grown spiritually, personally, professionally, and academically."
Sophomore,5,"An environment that facilitates growth academically and spiritually, and fosters growth in maturity."
Freshman,5,It is a great university. The teachers take interest in you and want to get to know you and help you however possible
Graduate Student,5,"My experience has been a pleasant one from the beginning with speaking with an advisor after my registration, helping me with going over my transcripts to which classes I needed to complete the graduate program. What was most interesting was the spiritual aspect and speaking with Dr. Quiet about why I choose this school.  All the staff since my enrollment has always been available to answer and assist in any questions I had and point out my options.  The professors who I have taken classes with have always responded to my questions in a timely manner as assist as well with any questions or concerns. I have enjoyed by time here, I am looking forward to the time to come."
Freshman,5,"The Staff were very helpful and informative during my application process. My experience at Letourneau University so far has been pleasant. There are many things to do on ground from swimming to just relaxing in their game room. Letourneau University offers on ground, duplex housing to married couples or families. The housing that they offer has allowed my family and I to be a lot less stressful when it comes time for me to go into my classes."
Freshman,5,I love my school! LeTourneau is a school where professors actually care about you learning the material and have a very hands-on teaching method. The first project for engineers is even building a 3D printer! The downer is most of the students are introverts who do not get too involved and the girl to guy ratio is a little weird with the number of guys being greater.
College Sophomore,5,this school has one of the highest rate of students leaving with jobs.
College Sophomore,5,this is a very safe school.
College Sophomore,5,I am a member of the softball team and I love the facilities.
College Sophomore,5,I feel this college is very passionate about the their students while in college and after leaving.
College Junior,5,"you don't really see students use drug and alcohol on campus, many do not partake in such things, though I have heard of a story of a few."
College Junior,5,"The safety and security on campus is really safe, I have not heard of campus crime or any mention of a crime while I attended. It is a safe school with little drug or alcohol use on campus. take it from one that has life in a city and around places in south Florida, many of the people will say that around the campus it is not that safe but it is really not that bad."
College Freshman,5,Job placement is something like 97 percent (I think)
College Junior,5,"LeTourneau University will challenge you in every way--academics, social, and spiritual. If you are not someone up for being pushed to your limit (and sometimes beyond) then this school will be a bad match, but if you want to learn, be pushed, create friends who are deep and really care about you, then this is the place. I almost didn't choose LETU, but going into my third year, I could not be happier with my choice of this school."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The education is great, high job placement."
College Sophomore,5,"The students at LETU work to love and accept one another.  We may not always approve of someone's lifestyle or choices, but we choose to love them any way just as God loves us."
College Sophomore,5,I've not seen too much drug or alcohol issues on or around campus.
College Junior,5,"This stuff doesn't happen at this school! Bars/Clubs around the campus are scary and dangerous because of the campus' location. As far as parties and nightlife I know there are house parties off campus but don't know much more than that. Transportation, you definitely need a car here or a friend with a car because that's basically how you get around anywhere off campus. On campus the buildings are close enough to walk everywhere."
College Junior,5,There are occasional instances where students have partaken in drugs/alcohol but never on campus! That kind of stuff doesn't happen on campus and the campus is relatively clean and safe
College Sophomore,5,"For engineering, at least, students get lots of hands on experience right from the start. As a result, many students have been able to get internships as early as the summer after their first year and recruiters from companies like John Deere, SpaceX and Garmin actively seek to hire LeTourneau grads. I haven't heard much about job/intern prospects for other majors but I did notice at the career fair that the majority of companies were seeking engineers and aviation majors."
College Sophomore,5,Last semester I took a Bible class that covered a lot that I already knew but I always felt like I'd learned something new because my professor gave us lots of tidbits about the historical context or word choices in certain passages that I hadn't heard before. I have also had several other professors who were passionate about their classes and made lectures fun to listen to.
College Sophomore,5,"From the first week at LeTourneau I knew I'd chosen the right school. Yeah, Texas was as hot as ever but my roommate assignment was perfect and I have many good friends both in and out of my dorm. As an engineer, I got to build my own 3D printer the very first semester and I've had several other hands on projects for classes including welding, lathing, lego robotics, 3D modeling, and much more! When classes got tough, professors and friends alike were there to support me and when presentations went well, they celebrated, too. I loved it so much that I stayed three more weeks to do research. LeTourneau also has a group just for kids who've grown up in other cultures and even though it's been a few years since I lived overseas, it was great to meet other students with similar experiences and talk about issues that you don't experience if you've grown up in one culture your whole life. And of course, if you're looking for a place to get involved and serve through leadership, LeTourneau's got plenty of opportunities for you to join others or start something new!"
College Junior,5,I love the school and the overall atmosphere. The students are very friendly and the classes are amazing.
College Junior,5,"The school is very well know for producing quality employees. In my program, 100% of the graduates for this coming May have already accepted their job positions for after they graduate."
Freshman,4,Online school is not bad but it is not as great as compared to on-ground because it lacks the sense of community. But teaching is very effective. One thing I don't like about online school is that I do not get the hands-on experience.
Freshman,4,"Letourneau is a very nice, safe place. However it can hinder peoples ability to become independent or free thinking."
Freshman,4,I am in my first semester of college at LeTourneau. The campus is the perfect size for me since I come from a very small town and school. I am loving it so far.
Senior,4,"I am a Global student, who has been taking classes for the previous two years.  Not all of my courses lined up with my degree audit and that was a huge disappointment.  I enjoyed the Classroom management course to prepare me for a classroom.  However, I got into a classroom and discovered that theory does not always agree with real life experiences."
Junior,4,"I am a working adult trying to finish my education at LeTourneau University. I have actually enjoyed my experience at LeTourneau. When I graduated high school I went to a technical school, so the experience in going to a traditional school was very different. The professors seemed to be more knowledgeable, and better in helping their students understand. When you get to college there is a conception that professors don't care if you get it or don't or if you show up for class, but with LeTourneau it's the complete opposite. The professors and administration staff care about your well being and life their while attending."
Freshman,4,The only problem I have found is that sometimes it feels like there isn't enough communication between the student and the college.
Junior,4,"LeTourneau University is just awesome. If you take your college courses seriously and would like to acquire social and academic skills to shape yourself in to better you, look no further cos it is the place for you."
Niche User,4,"It is a small college. Yet if have very up-to-date technology and facilities. I really enjoyed my visit! The people are really nice and everything is within comfortable walking distance. The available sports and exercise, fields and equipment are quite large in number and varied in type."
Senior,4,"LeTourneau University is a fantastic school! The last four years that I have attended school here have been good!  The community on campus is great, and the school provides a nurturing environment. The smaller class size allows for the students to be able to interact with the professors more. I have enjoyed all the classes that I have taken and learned so much from my time here at this university. The University works on providing exciting events that create community for those on campus. Overall, I would highly recommend LeTourneau University to those looking for a smaller high-quality school!"
Junior,4,LeTourneau University allows you to be pushed academically and spiritually. The class room size is similar to a normal high school class so your teachers will get to know you personally and you won't feel intimidated to ask questions. The campus is small but it is beautiful. The food has both good and bad days but overall it's better than what some other colleges can offer. The Belcher center is the first thing you see when coming to campus and its really nice. It holds chapel 3 times a week.
Sophomore,4,"My really one and only complaint about this school is the rules around housing, both for living on and off campus. To have an on-campus apartment one must be one of several things, the main one being a junior before you can apply to live in one. Even worse is attempt to live off campus, where, among other things, you need to be 22, a criteria that someone who went to college after high school, like I did, won't meet until Senior year. Until the age of 22 or Senior year which ever comes first, you are locked in to paying their housing fees regardless of if an apartment less than 300ft from campus would be several thousand cheaper to live in. Beside that I don't have much to complain about the school, and it's a really good school aside from the housing rules."
Freshman,4,"LeTourneau University has high academic and ethical standards. The professors truly care about their students and will go out of their way to help you do well in class. The campus is very safe, buildings and classrooms are adequate, and the food is okay. LeTourneau is a university focused on producing capable men and women of integrity. It is not a party school, and that is what makes it a great place to call home."
College Sophomore,4,This school has a excellent education program.
College Junior,4,"When attending Letu, it was an amazing experience. The People were friendly, but you must also be able to get out of your shell to talk to others. Many of the professors were interesting, but some of the admin seemed like they did not know what they were doing at times, others do, but it is bearable."
College Freshman,4,So far I have had Lot of fun and learned a lot
College Junior,4,"LETU longview campus is located in a not very great part of town. Rarely does any sort of crime spill over onto campus. So, for being located in a not very nice part of town, the campus is pretty safe. Always better to walk in groups though, especially close to the edges of campus, but that is common sense."
College Junior,4,"Your floor becomes your family at LETU. I live in Davis so for me the whole dorm is family but in most of the other dorms it is more by floor. The people in your dorm can be some of the best friendships you will ever make. After an emergency surgery, my dorm pulled together to help me with everything from moving my bed, to making sure I got food, to walking me places if I didn't feel great. The dorm you live in can really make your experience. I have been lucky to bond closely with one of the other floors (T3). This bonding with other floors can be a really amazing experience especially if you can't actually live on that floor. (T3 is an all guys floor and I'm a girl) Overall, dorm experience is amazing at LETU, but do make sure you get involved in floor activities, it is the best way to bond with everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,"On campus is safe. The area is very rough,"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The dorms are pretty fun here. People are very including. However the rules are very strict. Especially when it comes to guys and girls. The opposite gender can visit only during certain evening hours Thursday-Sunday. Otherwise mixed groups must hang out in public areas of the campus. The rules are usually strictly enforced and a lot of the staff pry more than I feel is necessary. Several of the dorms are new and nice, these would be South, Thomas, Davis (the honor dorm), and Gilbert. Tyler hall is older but in many people's opinions more fun. Penn is also older."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are tough, and the professors drive students hard.  They care enough to help and offer their expertise though."
College Junior,4,"The most segregation that will happen on this campus is for certain religious views, but it is minimal. Gays and other LGBT members keep quiet about their relationship preferences, if they even attend school here??? Other than that there is no racial, economic, political issues."
College Junior,4,I love our professors here! They are always willing to help you as long as you put the work in! Class sizes are excellent too!
College Junior,4,"Some of the best halls to live in are either Gilbert or South Hall. I loved the layout of Gilbert hall and that it is an all girls dorm. However, It would be nicer if the hall was renovated or updated a bit. South also has it's perks. It is nice and usually clean however, the only downside to living there is the walls are super thin and there is no place to study within the dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though the cost is high, it does pay off. I know students are generally offered a job right after graduation and sometimes before."
College Sophomore,4,I like the small class sizes it's a more personal learning style. The professors are helpful and knowledgable.
College Sophomore,4,"Compared to the community outside of campus, I feel rather safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy my dorm room, the only thing is I think the room inspections could be once a month or so."
College Sophomore,4,"On campus, it's great! I have no worries about walking across campus by myself at night. It probably would be good to be cautious though because the neighborhood surrounding campus isn't so safe to walk in alone at night and sometimes gunshots can be heard. That said, it wouldn't be impossible for someone with malicious intents to come on campus harass people and it has happened in the past but it's not talked about a lot and I don't know how long ago that was."
College Sophomore,4,"All three floors of my dorm do a lot together and have a made a world of difference in my experience at LeTourneau. Whether I need a study break or I have free time to kill, there's usually someone around to hang out with. And when I don't know how I'll get everything done, there's always someone to encourage me or help me finish faster."
College Junior,4,"The campus is not on the best side of town, but once you enter the campus, the environment is completely different. There are rarely problems with unwanted visitors on campus."
College Junior,4,The dorms and apartments both are very nice. There is also housing for married couples and families.
College Junior,4,The athletic facilities are very well kept. There are plenty of workout options for all student including different classes.
College Sophomore,4,Most class sizes are reasonable and they are interactive.
College Freshman,4,"The gyms are really nice, and they have scheduled classes too!"
College Senior,4,I feel the safety and health support on campus is strong.
College Senior,4,"While I do not attend any athletic events, I hear that they are top notch and very strong and entertaining."
College Sophomore,4,Studying is the only thing that is happening at all times at the university. The professors care no matter what the time they answer emails
College Sophomore,4,Having graduated from Letourneau most people who leave the school face a high demand from employers simply because they graduated from this university. Going to this school also opens up to internships that later leads to a career
College Sophomore,4,This university has a strong structure as far as community goes. Making friends that share things in common with you
College Freshman,4,"Living in the Honors dorm allows me a great community, devo group, and amenities that aren't not enjoyed by all the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"I can't really complain, other than the fact that our dorms are very old, and there is mold growing everywhere. I think we even have black mold, probably. Not a good thing--at all. Quite frankly, it's disgusting, but the community definitely makes up for what we lack in dorm-quality."
College Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere around here. The students are nice, professors are welcoming, and it is easy to make new friends."
College Senior,4,"I'm an online grad student, so all I hear about athletics is what is published in the newsletter."
College Junior,4,"In general, the school is pretty great. The professors have experience and care about their students, and the class sizes are pretty small. The variety of classes is medium, but that's okay because engineering degrees don't leave much room for electives."
College Junior,4,"The housing is pretty good, but it's expensive. Also, the school likes to keep as many students on campus as possible. The rooms are quite spacious for dorm rooms, and certainly adequate. The furniture is typically in good condition, but if it is not, then it can take forever to get something replaced."
College Junior,4,"If I were to reselect schools, I would still pick the same one. However, it would be a harder and closer choice. The academics are fantastic, the professors really do care about their students, and the Christian environment is great to be around. The trouble is that in this school, students are often treated like high school students instead of adults. Here, college is just another baby step instead of finally walking out of your parents' door and starting your own life."
College Sophomore,4,Greek Life is basically like being part of a club people know you are in it but really do not care that you are in it or not.
College Sophomore,4,I do not attend many sports events so I do not feel like I can give a good review
College Sophomore,4,Love Letourneau there are a lot of great people to fellowship with and I've found my place here and I love it.
College Sophomore,4,There are some great teams on campus and the new field house is really nice. I participate in rugby and we don't use the facilities much. On average the club rugby gets just as large of crowd now as the varsity sports while inter murals are rather late at night so they don't have much of a following.
College Sophomore,4,Letourneau university is great there may be some rough areas but I love it and although there isn't any parties we usually have a great time just having fun going out and having a blast. I play rugby with the team on campus and we are undefeated and I love the amazing trips we have and the crushing victory we secure every game. I also love the materials joining engineering courses and love learning the applications of welding technology to the industry and can't wait to start my internship this summer.
College Sophomore,4,"Longview is a very dangerous area. However, nobody comes to campus. If you stay on campus, you should be safe. Nothing ever happens there. Just be careful when you go into town."
College Sophomore,4,"Courses will typically teach you a lot. However, I have had to teach myself a course several times. The professors are almost always willing to meet with you, help you out, and be there for one-on-one. It will be very difficult to do well in some classes, others are easy A's. Class sizes vary from five people (I was acutally in a class with 5) to 150."
College Sophomore,4,"People know the name LeTourneau. If you apply for engineering jobs after you graduate, you will most likely get one soon. It has a good name. Be willing to work on your resume and interview skills, but you should be fine."
College Freshman,4,"My school is a Christian university that is not just ""Christian"" by name.  It has a beautiful campus and a caring environment.  I like that it is a smaller school. There are a mixture of old and new buildings and ongoing construction projects in many parts of the campus.  The school is academically challenging."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics, especially intramurals, are great for bonding with fellow students and taking a break from studying and getting some exercise. It's also great for having fun, showing school spirit, and getting free t-shirts and other stuff. There are usually different leagues in intramurals based on whether they are more competitive or more for fun. Several clubs meet regularly to practice sports like ultimate frisbee, parkour, volleyball, and rugby."
College Freshman,4,"I got a good grade on my ACT, so the financial aid department immediately offered me the highest academic scholarship they could, and state grants were easy enough to negotiate with a bit of paperwork. To get more financial aid, it is a good idea to talk to an academic advisor, department chair, or financial aid representative and keep up the grades."
College Freshman,4,"Although room and board is quite expensive at Letourneau, it's great to be able to be close to classes and campus activities. Tyler Hall is close to Longview Hall, which is where a lot of the introductory classes are held, but it's farther away from the gym and the cafe (which everyone calls SAGA) and is the only dorm with community showers. South Hall is close to SAGA and the Hive, and houses men and women on separate floors. The Trinities and Quads are a little bit isolated, and the buildings are very old. Gilbert, Thomas, and Davis have very nice furnishings."
College Freshman,4,Students are given a card at the beginning of the year with local discounts. Fairly decent variety but most restaurants are about 10-15 minutes from campus.
College Freshman,4,Most students received scholarships- ACT/SAT scores are very important!
Sophomore,2,"Very discriminatory against differently abled students. Zero support, targeting and harassment allowed by administration. Sickening."
Freshman,2,"I would really only recommend this university to someone who was brought up by strict Christian parents since that’s pretty much how it feels on campus. Eighty percent of the campus is nerds and weirdos, so as one of the athletes you kind of just learn to bond with other athletes. The food is pretty bad I have fifteen meals a week and only use three or four. The university wastes your time by making you go to chapel all year and bogus boring bible classes . Visitation hour are way too strict even though most ppl have girls sleep over anyways. Some halls are horrible compared to others and you pay the same price for the worst ones as the nice ones. Some halls have mold others have dirty community baths. If you’re looking to play athletics here that may be only thing worth coming for."
Sophomore,2,"This University is super strict on their rules and take them too far most times. They also false advertise the help that is provided. The university is constantly having problems with their wifi. Also, there is nothing fun to do on campus or in the small town. What I did like about thisome University was in engineering every year we do some type of project that most schools don't get to do. Freshman engineering students get to build a 3D printer which is pretty cool."
College Junior,2,The Greek life at LETU is practically nonexistent. There are three houses in the space behind the dinning hall where basically no one except Greeks go. They are not like your normal Greeks at other schools as all of these are Christian focused. For the most part there is really no distiction between the non-Greeks and the Greeks on campus. The only people who really care are those who are part of one of the three Greeks.
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no official Greek Life here. There are two wanna-be frats and one wanna-be sorority. However none of these are recognized by nationwide fraternities and sororities. The school doesn't allow the legitimate ones to exist on campus.
College Junior,2,"I was somewhat disappointed in LeTourneau University's Athletic Facilities when I first arrived there. I thought the gym ""workout Rooms"" would be bigger than they actually are. I think it is put together well enough for the athletes here on campus. But combine those people with every other average joe who just wants to go to the gym without seeing a super trim body at every angle; forget it... 

It almost seems as if we are in too close quarters. It would also be nice to have some more useful classes such as yoga or boxing."
College Sophomore,2,I don't know much about the Greek life other than that occasionally they host parties but I haven't gone to any of them.
College Freshman,2,I'm in the smallest dorms. We have the best community but the worst housing. It really is a hit or miss.
College Freshman,2,I think I've been to like one intramural rugby game. Ever.
College Sophomore,2,Our Greek life are called Societies they are very christian based so there are not parties.
College Sophomore,2,"Way overpriced. Good, clean, updated dorms. They are great. But the price is absurd."
College Sophomore,2,"I am the President of the only women's sorority on campus. There are three fraternities. However, we are only allowed to call ourselves societies. The words sorority and fraternity are not allowed. The school tries to be too involved and overbearing about Greek life. In fact, we aren't even allowed to use the work ""Greek."" I am frustrated by the rules and assumptions made about us. However, if you join, you realize that we are a fun group of people just wanting to be a part of a brother or sisterhood. I highly suggest joining Greek life - it's the best decision I've made at LeTourneau."
College Freshman,2,"Letourneau is an academic school, so a lot of people spend time studying instead of going to parties. Sometimes a holiday will lead to some fun contests and entertainment, a floor will host a movie night, a society will have a cookout, or YAC will have events, but generally, if students want fun, they often make it for themselves. Sometimes, students will go out to parties or floors will go to restaurants with the brother/sister floor, but if students are looking for parties, they have most likely come to the wrong place."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a number of issues on campus that administration chooses to ignore. When students complain, they are generally told they are being unChrist-like and should therefore stop complaining and be grateful for what they have. There is very little forgiveness for things the administration views severely (like sex) but much less strictness for issues like longboard theft. The administration has a very narrow view of what a good Christian student should look like and leave little room for other lifestyles (think strict Southern Baptist versus free-thinking nondenominational)."
College Sophomore,2,"As someone with health issues, it's almost impossible it eat well with the available options. The food is often greasy and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Food poisoning is common and it's hard to predict which foods with be the culprit. The soda machines break frequently and the staff can be rude and unfriendly (some are very nice)."
College Sophomore,2,"I am rating this based on what most people would define as ""parties."" LeTourneau is not a party school. If you get caught partying, with alcohol or drugs.... you get kicked out. I would say in my dorm, we have parties, but they are different than most parties. We do board games or video games, just hang out, shower people, drag people across campus and throw them into the pond--stuff like that. We consider it a part even though it isn't that way to most people outside LeTourneau."
College Freshman,2,As an athlete students here don't respect nor understand athletes
College Freshman,2,Visitation hours are very strictly enforced and they're short. Drinking is banned on or off campus and if caught harsh punishment is to be expected.
College Senior,2,The housing is cluttered and smelly.
College Senior,2,The sports here are a joke.
College Senior,2,"The immediate vicinity is a largely low-income area that is not generally safe for students to explore at night.  Other areas of town are nice, but distance is a limiting factor."
College Senior,2,Off-campus dining in the immediate vicinity of campus is limited to a few fast food restaurants.  Students wishing to have a greater variety or more quality options must drive to the north side of town.
College Freshman,2,"There are occasional little parties with cookies and ice cream but rarely do you hear about real parties since alcohol, drugs, dancing, sex and all that stuff can get you kicked out so its normally secretive or nonexistent. If you don't care for all the drama and such its ok though."
College Junior,2,"There isn't much to do off campus.  The biggest attractions would probably be the local theater or mall (to use the term ""mall"" loosely).  Shreveport isn't too far east on the highway, and students sometimes find things to do there or in Dallas (which is a couple hours west).  Most locals in the area don't really know much about the school and they seem to view it almost as a sort of cult."
Recent Alumnus,2,Our athletic teams are average. Not very competitive in basketball. Better at soccer and baseball.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much going on.  I haven't seen any.
College Junior,2,No one is supportive of the athletes. The club rugby team is a hit and intramurals are always hopping.
College Sophomore,2,"When I started school at LeTU, I was quite healthy and weighed a healthy amount. When I left 2.5 years later my health had deteriorated significantly and I had unintentionally lost 20 lbs. I blame the dining hall. 

   Bon Appetit really tries but somehow much of the food is 'off'. The protein selection is pretty bad: the meat is almost entirely, always, either blackened, undercooked, and/or incredibly greasy. There are yogurt and eggs (at breakfast only). Salad is sometimes full of grit. Several times I've seen insects (of the crawling variety) on buffet dishes, serving dishes etc. I've had several friends get food poisoning from the caf, which the school nurse tends to not believe. I came down with intestinal parasites at some point while I was at school--could easily have been the under washed salads. 

   I have seen several friends who were healthy when they went to school develop various health problems while at school. I realize this could be caused by stress…but the dining hall food seems to exacerbate the problem. My (already skinny) roommate lost weight as well…lots of close friends developed stomach issues related to the dining hall food. One friend had to leave campus because he was constantly vomiting or sick…the doctor told him it was the grease in the caf food. 

  The Hive is pretty good. They serve various Mexican-inspired food and it is more reliably tasty than the Corner Cafe. 

My last year I appealed to be removed from the mandatory meal plan. This was a very difficult process that involved multiple doctor's appointments, tests and recommendations. The doc was convinced the food really was making me sick and finally the school let me be off the meal plan. This saved several thousand dollars a year."
College Sophomore,2,"Many people on campus don't have cars. This works pretty well if you pay to at the cafeteria (as students are required to do unless they have a doctor's approval). If you need to get off-campus to get food, though, it gets tougher. Generally you can mooch rides from people with cars (be nice and pay them for gasoline). 

Not a lot of public transit. Heard the buses weren't particularly safe. Amtrak station in town."
College Sophomore,2,"Quite a few international students and missionary kids. Large percentage of homeschoolers. It's an expensive school, so most people are from upper economic classes, but Heritage scholarships mean there are some students who aren't well off financially. 

Religion is pretty homogenous. Most people are quite conservative Christians, but there is a significant population of people who might identify as Christian but don't make it a very important part of their lives. Unfortunately for me, there are very few people who are both dedicated Christians AND 'liberal' on social beliefs. I don't believe I met more than one or two other self-identifying feminists or gay-rights-supporters while I was there. Religious discussions can get pretty heated, though most people are pretty caring and polite. Misogyny tends to be accepted and 'biblically' sanctioned. Rape jokes are common in some groups. Harassment of couples occurs--3 of my closest friends were repeatedly harassed when with their significant others."
College Sophomore,2,"No football team, other teams are okay but not too exciting. Most athletes tend to keep to their own groups, and this is probably exacerbated by non-athlete students negative attitudes towards them, unfortunately. 

Intramurals are pretty big."
College Sophomore,2,"No dancing, drinking, drugs or sex allowed. 

There aren't a lot of parties or other events--YAC plans some fun events though. Almost no private parties or events. Chai parties occur off-campus at the home of a professor (I think) once a month and are fun if you are into drinking wicked-strong chai tea, talking about various intellectual or nerdy topics, and playing cards. More fun than it sounds, actually."
College Sophomore,2,"Panera is the only place I've found that offers food which is healthy AND tasty. Perhaps I am too picky as I came from a town half the size of Longview with more local/artisan/ethnic restaurants than you could shake a fork at. 

Jalepeno Tree offers good Mexican food. But generally not a lot of options and almost nothing within walking distance (not that you'd want to walk off-campus anyway--not safe.)"
College Sophomore,2,"Scholarships are hard to find, and you need to be very persistent with what you want.
There are not a whole lot of them, so you have to know people to know where to apply, when and how.
"
College Sophomore,2,"I'm part of one of the Greek Societies (administration does not allow the name fraternity) and the scene is rather mediocre on the social aspect of it. 
There are no national or panhelllenic societies. There are 3 fraternities: AO, KZX and LAS (for aviation majors only). They all have their houses (owned by the university) on campus, so they abide by the rules of campus (no alcohol allowed, no parties and no dancing). 
Greek life in here is all about the community living and cooperation. Yes, there are some hang outs with alcohol and all that, but not as you would expect of a real fraternity. 
Campus sees the greek life as a bung of preppy kids when there is really not a whole lot of difference other than the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm ok with the Accounting program at the university, but there isn't a broad range of classes to select compared to some bigger universities. 
I would not have selected this university if it wasn't because of the scholarships and proximity to my family (I commute)."
College Sophomore,2,"Gym - nice
Library - bad
Green spaces - pretty, but not breath taking
Student center - horrible, but they are building another 
Campus events - terrible
Traditions - non existent
Student hangouts - good for introverts, but pretty terrible if you're a liberal extrovert"
College Sophomore,2,"Wonderful academics, wonderful professors, but the overall environment is terrible. 
The university is characterized by geeks and many rules from the organization. They believe the world has not changed in the last 50 years, and students live in a Christian bubble. Longview is a terrible town for networking and social life.
There is nothing to do on campus during the weekends or at any moment. The problem is the mentality of the students that attend the university and the administration that acts like a parent to not get their hands dirty. "
College Senior,2,There isn't much to do out of school. Mostly people hang out together on campus. The school is a dry school and you are not supposed to be drinking. Some people go ballroom dancing or do crazy activities like Campus Golf.
College Senior,2,"There are mostly chain restaurants around. But there are a few privately owned locations that will mostly be TexMex, if you are into that."
Senior,1,I'll be graduating soon. You are not allowed to drink EVER on campus or off so the party and social scene is DEAD
Graduate Student,1,"This school is horrible.  I am a grad student here and have had so many issues with this school its not even funny.  I've been lied to, they tried to steal money from me, I have only been attending a year and they have changed the course rotation TWICE of courses, thus causing us to not have the classes we need in a timely manner.  They won't let you register for classes even when you have financial aide, thus causing all the courses to become full.  It's like they WANT you take way longer to get your degree so you can end up spending more money at their school."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life (or the equivalent) has no impact on the school. Due to recent events, they are strictly regulated and monitored by the school."
College Sophomore,1,I do not know of any clubs near campus
College Sophomore,1,I do not know of party's near campus
College Junior,1,"Greek life is very low key at this school. This is largely due to the Christian nature of the school and its rules. Technically, there are societies with their own special housing, but no real fraternities or sororities. For that matter, there are rarely parties at all at this school. The is really no public night life at all."
College Freshman,1,There really is no parties. Campus rules ban all alcohol on or off campus regardless of age.
College Senior,1,The administration is the worst part of this school.
College Senior,1,Awful experience trying to get any aid.
College Senior,1,"Wow, 50 characters. Not enough for how AWFUL it was"
College Senior,1,"If you want to fall asleep to gunshots every night, go to this college."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife on the school. It is completely forbidden, on and outside campus. It does not matter if you are 21 or a faculty. They make you sign a contract of no drinking, no drugs use.
Longview, TX is a very terrible place for nightlife, with no decent night clubs or bars, 
The only ones on town are very, VERY country or very, VERY ethnic. No city environment at all. "
College Sophomore,1,"Athletes are not breath taking, but they're good for a Division III university. However, it is a geek university were school spirit is nonexistent. 
Nobody pays attention to athletics on campus, and it is not a big part of the scene.  "
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible internship opportunities on the private business sector. The curriculum, however, is very comprehensive. It is terrible if you want to just focus on one are of business because every major is the same with distinction of some hours.
The School of Business is not big enough to offer several courses in every area."
College Sophomore,1,"The only transportation that works on campus is the shuttle that takes aviation students from the university to the local airport. Other than that there are no buses from the university that go around town or taxis by the university.
However, is East Texas and there isn't any public transportation, so it is not just the fault of the university.
Conclusion, without a car you're lost."
College Sophomore,1,"People have an awful sense of fashion. Guys dressed ninjas or Links around campus wearing wooden swords and capes.
Girls do not know how to dress. 
The sym is good, but is just used by the athletes or some people. There is no sense of being attractive, and the ratio of 3 guys per 1 girl does not help.
People are stuck up, but not in the way you're thinking. They are close minded resilient to change, but not preppy,
No parties allowed and no dances or formals on campus.
People are introvert except some international students.
However, people are very into video games. Specially into LoL and DOTA."
College Sophomore,1,"Longview, Texas is a terrible town for living 80,000 people with anything to do. 2 movie theaters, 1 mall and some fast food restaurants. 
The closest universities are an hour away on a highway (UT Tyler and ETBU). There isn't at a healthy rivality against them because there is not a rivality at all. Athletics at the university suck and there is not a college spirit. 
No jobs on town other than mom and dad businesses or some minor banks of East Texas.
"
College Junior,1,"LeTourneau does not offer ""nightlife."" There are rarely parties at my college. It is a Christian University with a zero tolerance drinking policy. I have no desire for parties, so I think that this is a good thing."
College Junior,1,"No Dancing, No Drinking, No Partying, No Drugs, No Tobacco Products, No Gambling. You can't Indulge in any of the above even when at home. The university claims that it is a Christian based, but non-denominational, institute of higher learning, but most of it's rules and values are derived from Southern Baptist views."
College Senior,1,"Our Greeks are very stuck-up and not something that's wanted on campus.  They're usually the jerks on campus that nobody wants to be around.  Greek housing includes three houses for guys and as of this year an apartment section for the girl's society.  The girls are not ones that I intend to hang out with.  I don't like to be with stuck-up, preppy, or just plain ridiculous girls.  The guys societies have changed a lot since I've been here; but, it has become just another housing edition, nothing special."

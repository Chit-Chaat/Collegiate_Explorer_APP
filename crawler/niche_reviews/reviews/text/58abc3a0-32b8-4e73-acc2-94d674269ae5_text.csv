Freshman,5,"My online experience was crazy at first because I didn't know how to use some tools for some of my classes and I felt very stressed but the teacher always helped us in anything we were having trouble they were always helping us and asking questions, they also make sure that you understand everything that was being covered in class. right now I feel better about online classes, they are still a bit stressful because we have to be on our computers 24/7 but overall is going great."
Freshman,5,What I like about Pfeiffer is that is a small school and you know everyone. everyone is very friendly and when you need help they are willing to help you with anything you need.
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been amazing. My in-person classes have gone hybrid, but the professors are really good at handling hybrid classes. This is hard to come by in a first-time online setting, but they are doing really well. My online classes give me just enough work to learn something but not so much that I am overwhelmed."
Freshman,5,"Pfeiffer is a great school with great engagement with their students. The failure rate they have is only because of the students who don't care and only go to parties. That is not the school's fault as they try to help them, but the students are uninterested. I go here and if you are engaged, it is an amazing place to be!"
Sophomore,5,All classes have been easy to access all the professors have been helpful. Help is always available when needed. I have had no issues with any of my online classes this far.
Sophomore,5,"All classes were taken online and all the advisors have been great to work with.
Everything is easy yo access and help is always available when needed."
Sophomore,5,"I feel like I have had a great learning experience at Pfeiffer. The teachers want you to succeed, and there are always there for you."
Sophomore,5,"The small school setting is perfect for me! If you want an environment that promotes success and growth, Pfeiffer is for you! I have got so many opportunities that I would not have got from a larger university."
Freshman,5,"I will be a student at Pfeiffer starting this fall but my experience overall has been incredible. From the times that I have visited campus, the staff and faculty are always more than willing to help me. My academic advisor is so kind and eager to help answer any questions I have. It's great to have someone like that to help with the transition into college."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Pfeiffer has been amazing since my freshman year, I'm an uprising junior right now in which I wish to continue studying here because the support system is really good, they have tutors and staff really makes it easier and less stressful when attending here."
Freshman,5,They have a wonderful family environment and have done everything they can to aid me in my early graduation and entrance to college life.
Sophomore,5,Pfeiffer is an amazing university where you create great connections and relationships to better yourself for the future
Freshman,5,"The staff was very welcoming and informative. I enjoyed my tour at the school. It was a great experience for me. I look forward to continuing my education at this college. Also, I look forward to furthering my career in the sport of basketball as well."
Junior,5,Staff is very helpful and makes sure you succeed as much as possible. Smaller class sizes make it easy for teachers and students to connect and ensure there are no questions about the material. The facility could use some updating but the campus is unique in itself and has  a historic feel.
Junior,5,"Pfeiffer University is one of the best Universities on the planet! Great people, great food, great fellowship! Pfeiffer is the place to be. Tight knit community, everybody knows each other and everything looks out for one another! Great athletic department as well and a very nice quiet university. You can definitely focus on your sports and academics here!"
Sophomore,5,"I believe the college of Pfeiffer University is a well persevered school to pursue your education. Pfeiffer has impacted my life for the better. While Pfeiffer is a ""get involved"" campus they offer lots of fun and meaningful events. My favorite event is every month on the second Sunday a group gets together to feed the homeless at the local homeless shelter. If there was one thing I would change about Pfeiffer it would be the weird academic credit hours and how some or most credits do not transfer in or out."
Niche User,5,"I love the enviornment, the teacher/student ratio. I also love the fact the admissions counselor remembered conversing with me. i love the food, and the fact that the students weren't afraid to talk to you. the one thing i would love to see change is the one bathroom that everyone has to share on each floor."
Freshman,5,"The things that I liked about Pfeiffer is that the people are really cool and easy to hang out with. The food is great breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. The social life is  very good."
Freshman,5,"Pfeiffer University is a warm and welcoming place.  The faculty and staff all worked with me.  They were helpful from the beginning with the application process, through admissions, financial aid, and choosing my classes."
Senior,5,"The class ratios are awesome 10-15:1. The professors are great and willing to offer help anyway possible to make sure you are a success. There isn't a big party scene because it is in the country, but it's location is 20 minutes from 2 major cities where you can find everything you need from clothes to clubs. The campus is filled with history and kept up very clean."
Sophomore,5,I like the close knit community and the campus is beautiful. Would like to have recreation closer to campus and better food!
Sophomore,5,Pfeiffer University is an amazing school. Faculty makes their students their number one priority. The small classes help students better understand material and make students feel more at home.
Sophomore,5,"Pfeiffer University is definitely what you make it, but I made it home. Coming from high school I was not sure about that transition, but Pfeiffer showed me that I should not be scared."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Pfeiffer University has been amazing. It's very small, loving, and the people around absolutely nice. Everybody gets to know each other, and its a small environment too keep individuals out of trouble. One change for Pfeiffer University is more comfortable beds."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus and the location of Pfeiffer. The campus is absolutely beautiful and I loved spending time on it.  If there is one thing that I could change it would be that there should be no hall bathrooms, that each room should have its own bathroom."
Alum,5,I went through the adult studies program in order to get my Criminal Justice degree. They accommodated my work schedule as well as my family schedule and helped me make it work to get my degree
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Pfeiffer. Had the opportunity to earn my BS and MBA in a five year program while being very active in the campus community. While there isn't much in the immediate area Charlotte isn't very far, and as a cross country runner I enjoyed how light traffic was in the area."
College Junior,5,The professors give their best effort to ensure students' success.
College Freshman,5,I genually enjoy Pfeiffer University. I love being part of such a great school. The classes are small enough for one on one interactions with the faculty and staff. Pfeiffer is a family. Everyone I meet here is so welcoming and they enjoy education just as well as myself!
College Senior,5,Pfeiffer is one of the best colleges to attend. The people make you feel like you are a part of a family.
College Junior,5,"Our nurse practitioner is very friendly and knowledgeable! She assists you in a prompt manner, remembers your name, face, and what health issue you reported. The counselors at our school are excellent in mentoring and being there when you need them."
College Junior,5,"They enforce all the rules as they should. The campus police are especially good at their jobs. They patrol traffic, attend to issues in the dorms, etc."
College Junior,5,"Individualized help available. Love the small class sizes. Most teachers know my name, goals, and are advocates in my academic success."
College Freshman,5,"Because it is a small school, each student has so many opportunities! Professors will even recommend opportunities for  career placement that students may never expect! AS far as schools go for career placement, I'd say this is one of the best!"
College Freshman,5,Small campus with the village police department right there. I am not saying that it is 100% safe (it is a college campus after all) but it is definitely as safe as possible!
College Sophomore,5,We don't have this issue on campus
College Freshman,5,"The teachers show a genuine care for your academics on a personal, individual level. Small classes allow for much needed teacher- student time."
College Sophomore,5,You have to try hard and study a lot!
College Freshman,5,"Parking is very good here becuase not many students go here. It is such a small campus that you walk every where instead of drive therefore, you don't have to move you car around very much. The cost of parking however is very high for such a small school!"
College Junior,5,There are a ton of malls and parks that people can go to and just hang around.
Freshman,4,My online experience has not been the best but it's not terrible. I'm currently doing good in all of my classes but the communication between students and teachers could be a lot better.
Freshman,4,"So far my experience has been good as a freshman, just wish there was maybe public transportation for those whom dont their car, and cafeteria food is good on some days"
Sophomore,4,"I really love the small class sizes and relationships you have with your professors. Everyone on campus knows each other and there is a great sense of togetherness. However, it is very expensive and the cafeteria food is just about 'average.'"
Sophomore,4,"Pfeiffer is really an awesome school, but the cafe needs work and some professor should be there, but its people like Danielle Donelson, who make the college experience worth while."
Sophomore,4,"Pfeiffer university is a quaint town and every student is treated like family.  The University is very small so that is why it feels like a big family.  Something I would like to see change, is to make the town more college friendly, meaning to add bars to the town or to add more restaurants."
Sophomore,4,"The two years that I went to Pfeiffer was a fun time, a sad time, and a huge learning experience. I got to meet and interact with different people. The staff was great all the way from the CEO to the janitors. They do their best to make you feel at home. If you’re not used to being in the middle of nowhere it’s going to take time to get used to it but it’s not bad. I would suggest having a car if you plan to go here because there are many different places you can go to in Albemarle or Salisbury and Charlotte is only a 45 min drive. What I would change at pfeiffer is the fact that they don’t have a football team that would make pfeiffer almost perfect. What I like most is how everyone comes out to support every sport there. I also like the student to teacher ratio. It helps you get a good connection with the teacher. If you do decide to go to pfeiffer stay safe, pay attention, don’t be a follower, learn when to say no, make good decisions, and stay up on your school work."
Junior,4,I like the campus of the school. People there is pretty nice and there are plenty of resources you can use there.
Graduate Student,4,"New graduate student in the MBA program. Application process, access to Admissions Counselor were very acceptable. Everything was online and my Admissions counselor kept me advised of the process the entire way."
Niche User,4,"Pfeiffer is great if you are wanting a small, close-knit school. The teachers and staff take a genuine interest in their students lives. They work hard to make sure their students are on track. The classes are a nice size, especially for class discussions."
Niche User,4,"From the tours that I have taken, I am very satisfied with Pfeiffer University. The staff and students made me fill at home on every visit."
Junior,4,All of the professors at Pfeiffer are so nice and willing to help in any way. I am really glad I transferred my credits from Central Piedmont Community College to Pfeiffer.
Sophomore,4,"What I love most about Pfeiffer is the close knit community, everyone there is like family. I love the student teacher ratio, if i need any type of help I know my professor will provide as much help as they are able. The diversity is amazing, being friends with people from all over the world is amazing, what better way to get cultured than by your peers. One thing I think I would change is our culture credit system, I understand the University's perspective of them but sixty credits is a lot. You have to factor each individual student and what they do in their personal life that sometimes creates scheduling conflict for students to attend the culture credit opportunities. My overall opinion on Pfeiffer is I love it. I honestly could not see my self anywhere else and I knew this from when I toured Pfeiffer because I looked at my mom and said, I feel like I belong here. Now two years later I am a sophomore and willfully continuing my journey through Pfeiffer."
Sophomore,4,Pfeiffer University is like a family away from home. Teachers help students in every way possible to make sure they have all the needs to be successful. 
Freshman,4,"Pfeiffer University is a student first school, you might think this is an advertisement or reading off a brochure but I can claim I have felt welcome as an out of state resident. As a small campus you can get to class in 5 minutes tops. As an accountant major, I feel confident in all my classes, where the professors really attempt to make a relationship with you so that you can have connections after you graduate try to reach for jobs. I will say that great dorms is something to wish for here, as they seem like they have not had maintenance since the 90's and the food gets plain 2 weeks into the year. Pfeiffer is located in the middle of the woods and in the rural areas of North Carolina, but Charlotte is located about 45 minutes away if you want leisure time. The cops in the Misenheimer area are without a doubt the best as they go the distance to makes sure the students are safe first before taking disciplinary action. "
College Junior,4,Most dorm rooms are spacious.
College Junior,4,The atmosphere at games are amazing!
College Junior,4,"Pfeiffer University has helped me a lot. I am an international student and I can tell how much the staff at Pfeiffer want all of us to feel like we are family. We are only around 800 people on campus and 75% of the students are athletes, which make us feel like we are all on the same focus. Since the school is not really big, it is better to participate in classes and the teachers help us a lot."
College Junior,4,"I have not started classes yet, but we were mandated by my last instructor at my community college to attend this school two times to tour it and speak to instructors and present students. The way in which they interacted together as well as answered any questions regarding finances, scheduling, classes, amount of work, ect. were answered clearly. I really enjoyed both times I visited and knew after the second time that this is where I wanted to attend for my bachelors."
College Freshman,4,There is always something to do no matter what you enjoy doing.
College Freshman,4,The strictness is very prevalent at Pfeiffer University.
College Freshman,4,"The food is great for the price and there is such a multitude of choices, you can always get something new."
College Freshman,4,"The campus life is like a family and there is a wide array of thing to do all the time -there is a great social atmosphere, which is an upside. The only downside may be the price, but if you have time for a loan is it worth both the education and the social aspects."
College Junior,4,"Financial aid counselors are very helpful. If you have a high GPA, there is a greater chance to receive academic scholarships."
College Junior,4,There are very attractive people here. Everybody knows everybody! Most people get along. The majority of students here are athletes.
College Junior,4,The financial aid counselors were very prompt and helpful! They laid all my financial aid information out in front of me in an understandable way.
College Freshman,4,It was a easy process.
College Freshman,4,"The courses and professors at the school are excellent. If you are really looking for a highly interactive , highly involved learning atmosphere, this is the place for you! Class sizes are small so professors can really get to know you, which brings forth all sorts of opportunities for students! The classes are challenging (but manageable)."
College Freshman,4,"Each student has the opportunity to sign up for scholarship day where there is a very wide variety of scholarships awarded. I received a full-tuition scholarship so needless to say I was very pleased with the process, but a lot of my friends received large scholarship amounts as well. As long as you go to the scholarship day I believe you will receive at least some sort of scholarship."
College Freshman,4,"The housing may not be as flashy as some other schools and may not have the same amenities, but it is roomy and comfortable and you will not feel like you are living in a prison while at college. It has a nice comfortable feel to it. And most of the dorms are very similar/the same so everyone is pretty much living in the same conditions (except for the one building of apartments reserved for high gpa sophomores and above)."
College Freshman,4,"Despite its small size and relative isolation from big cities (perhaps this actually helps it!), campus life is really great! There is always a fun activity going on on campus!"
College Senior,4,The people you are friends with at school is definitely what makes it great.  My teammates and friends make anything else that is annoying about the school seem pointless.  I would not go to my school if I did not play a sport. I would try to go to a big state university and try to save some money.
College Senior,4,"Everyone is really accepting, and no one really cares where you are from or what you believe in.  If youre a good person you will get along just fine."
College Sophomore,4,There is always something going on but you have to pay for parking EVERYWHERE
College Freshman,4,"It was a rough winter, but the weather is way better the. What I'm used to so I'll take it."
College Freshman,4,"The small class sizes are great, and you get a lot of individual attention."
College Freshman,4,It's mostly white but there are a few speckles here and there.
College Freshman,4,Do what you're supposed to and no one gets in trouble...
College Junior,4,you have close relationship with professors and students.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty good majors offered! Great teachers!
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office does a great job of getting my financial aid package back to me quickly!
College Sophomore,4,I love going to school in a small community! I also like the size of the school and class size!
College Student,4,most people on campus are athletes so they usually dress in sweats or sports clothes
College Freshman,4,It is always nice and cool outside and hardly ever rains 
College Junior,4,During the summer periods it rained a lot and made it difficult to walk from my classes. The campus is very small so it isn't that bad to walk around but still I don't like getting wet!
College Junior,4,Pfeiffer's population consists of mainly athletes. Sports plays a big role on campus.
College Senior,4,I really appreciate Pfeiffer's continuing education graduate programs that are offered.  I like how you can take classes online and on campus.  The instructors so far are easy to talk to and the campus is clean and professional.
College Junior,4,I enjoy being in my program because this is what I want to do and what I want to work in. I feel like I am relay learning a lot from my professors.  a unique aspect of my program is that it is a joint program with a graduate degree. I  would get my MBA as well along with my bachelor.
College Junior,4,"I am quite happy with my program; I will have both a bachelor degree and a masters in business once i am done with my term at Pfeiffer. If I could do anything again i would take this same program, it saves me time and money."
College Junior,4,"I believe that Pfeiffer although small, is quite diverse. I myself am Hispanic and it was here that I met other Latinos/Hispanics from different countries that I have not met before, such as Columbia Venezuela, Argentina and even Spain. Everyone seems to get along well I do not see tension between any student at any time. Everyone is respectful and mindful."
College Sophomore,4,I received a pretty good academic scholarship considering my grades
College Student,4,"the paperwork can be a hassle but when applying for help anywhere there is going to be paper work. the people that work in the business office are very understanding and helpful, which made the process less chaotic."
College Freshman,4,Our school is very strict on cheating in class and on school work.  If the student is caught cheating then they get an automatic F in the class and have to go to the Honor Board to see if they are kicked out or not.  They are strict about under-age drinking as well.  The police's office is on campus and they go through the dorms to make sure everything is okay and to check on the students.  If the students are drunk the police check their IDs and if they are under age they get a drinking ticket.  If there are parties on campus with underage drinking everyone at the party gets in trouble.
College Freshman,4,We have multiple computer labs on campus.  We have 2 in Jane Freeman which is open 24/7 and we have 2 in the library which has good hours for students to come in and use.  The computers are old but they work well.  The printing is easy the cost is good per semester.
College Freshman,4,As a non-athletic going to a school where 85% of the other students do I was a little worried about having friends or feeling left out. Although in the cafe the teams tend to sit with the teammates this does not stop ANYONE from getting to know them. In fact a lot of my friends are athletes.
College Freshman,4,It is a pretty safe campus. The police keep eveything under control and the RA do a good job keeping residents happy with addressing problems ASAP.
College Junior,4,"Because this is adult studies we seem to be a little more diverse than the average traditional campus I believe. The fact that we all are in ""real world"" situations trying to improve our lives in some way by getting a degree, for many the first time, is our common factor. But we come from all walks of life; different ages, gender, ethnic groups, economic backgrounds but all working toward a common goal."
College Junior,4,There are several fast food resteraunts nearby and a few other small coffee shops. You could walk to any of them if you wanted to.
College Junior,4,"The Adult Campus is pretty diverse. There are men and women of all ethnic groups represented. There does seem to be more women than men all of the classes that I have attended so far, but other than that I think it is pretty well balanced."
College Junior,4,"Dr. Dollar has internship oppourtuniteis where he can bring students to Madagascar with him where he has been studying the Foussa.  His classes are not difficult if you pay attention and engage in discussion.  The program offers many interesting courses and tracks within the major.  I wish we had more to choose from in electives though, such as a geology course."
College Junior,4,Process Is Easy – Most of the time they tell you in detail the items you may need to complete financial aid paperwork.  The people that work in that department are always available to help.
Freshman,2,You will be in debt just your first year alone. It is tuition based college so you will be paying everything. It is a private university in the middle of no where. You have to travel atleast 20-30 minutes for some stores. There are parties every weekend and the parties are not the best and very packed. Professors are really nice. The cafe food sucks. The Starbucks and sandellas is not all the greatest. Not many options on campus for food especially on weekends. The nearest fast food is less than 5 minutes drive and 30 minute walk.
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of options after you step off campus.
College Senior,2,Not very many restaurants to choose from. The ones there are very unhealthy.
College Senior,2,Seems to always be a problem. No one ever answers the phones you can leave messages but they will not return call so normally you have to drive up there to speak with someone.
College Freshman,2,"There is really no Greek Life on campus, but there are a lot of living learning communities"
College Freshman,2,"There really are not many choices to live off of campus, but on the flip side it really brings the school together because pretty much everyone lives on campus!"
College Senior,2,There is pretty much only fast food restaurants by campus which gets old fast and they arent open passed 10pm
College Senior,2,"The dining hall isnt open all day.  You have two hours for each meal and if you can't get there in time due to class or practice they lock the doors.   There is a Sandella's open until 11 most nights, but I don't have the money to spend there."
College Senior,2,"There is not very much to do.  Most of the stores close too early and only fast food restaurants to eat at.  There are activities on campus and some cultural experiences, but outside of school there isnt really anything.  Sports on campus is the main reason people attend and there are not very many locals."
College Freshman,2,"It is an isolated campus, the nearest school is 40 minutes away."
College Freshman,2,"There are drugs everywhere.  From cocaine to weed, it's definitely going on."
College Freshman,2,There's only 1000 kids and they have an entire police department for it.
College Freshman,2,"The athletic director is a terrible guy, and the facilities suck.  If they weren't giving out athletic scholarships I wouldn't have come here."
College Freshman,2,"Mcdonalds and Wendy's haha, gotta go to Charlotte for real food."
College Student,2,not much off campus dining unless you have a car and are willing to drive 30-45 min to either salisbury or albemarle
College Student,2,wireless is often down and when IT fixes the problem its not long before it is bogged down and slow
College Freshman,2,we have our own police station and they are there to help walk you across street at night or from one building to the other
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of people and there are parking places,but here far apart."
College Student,2,"Misenheimer is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, but there is available stores and fast food places right down the road and salibury or albemarle isn't very far away."
College Student,2,the cafe does have its up and downs. Breakfast is delicious although their pancakes do tend to be always hard but on weekends they get out the waffle makers and you can make your own.
Freshman,1,"They do not care for disabled students. All buildings have stairs and only one (The Cafeteria) has an elevator. So If you are in a wheelchair or hurt yourself badly where you can't walk during the semester you're out of luck.  You will not be able to get to your dorm, your classes, or even into the  schools chapel."
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Senior,1,"It's unhealthy, has preservatives, and it's expensive. Not to mention I wanted to look at the food one day to see if I would like to buy a meal plan or buy a meal one day the woman was rude and was not going to let me just walk by to look at the food behind the glass. Usually you can tell a lot by the way the foods being kept and I just wanted to see if the food was stirred or new food fixed when you order it."
College Senior,1,I have not lived on campus. Although I know people who do and I get emails concerning some of the housing problems. I started at Pfeiffer University in 2008. At that time the school had plumbing problems in a few of the dorms on campus. I would get emails that said certain forms did not have water and if you need a shower go to this dorm or shower in the gym. I returned to my community college and came back to Pfeifffer in 2014. I still receive these emails about certain dorms not having any water. The school is also out of date for people with disabilities. Most of the buildings do not have elevators and bathrooms are either up one level or down one level. Even though when you start out there they say they can accomadate people with disabilities.
College Freshman,1,They are all run down and beat up...the entire school is underfunded.
College Freshman,1,Every dorm is old and gross.  They are tiny and badly need renovated.
College Freshman,1,"Athletes have to live on campus, and that's 99% of the school."
College Freshman,1,It doesn't exist to be completely and totally honest
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any places to live of campus.
College Sophomore,1,We have no sources of transportation besides walking to class or driving your own car of campus.
College Freshman,1,almost everyone drinks and only get caught if puking
College Freshman,1,lots of lawn ara and a sand volleyball court but the game room is lacking
College Freshman,1,"not really any buses to take you places, provided transportation to airport for fall break"
College Freshman,1,workload is not too difficult. they have a writing lab to help with papers
College Freshman,1,Good classes. unique general education program. decent variety
College Freshman,1,two clubs and one bar are the only places people usually go and they're all about 40 minutes away at least
College Freshman,1,not much to do if you don't play sports and extremely small like a high school all over again
College Freshman,1,only one set of apartments about a quarter mile away but there are apartment style dorms on campus a lot of people live in
College Freshman,1,Very strict if you get caught drinking and are underage but as long as you're not throwing up or causing a scene you won't get caught
College Freshman,1,not many places to go just the average fast food and hole in the wall restaurants

Sophomore,5,"I love Central Oregon Community College. Located in Bend, Oregon, students are never missing beautiful views, exciting wildlife, and awesome teachers. Teachers are attentive and focused on student success."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at COCC has been amazing. The campus is clean, safe and beautiful. The classes are small so you can really get into your studies and get to know your professors. If you don't know what you want to pursue in your career or life, COCC is a great place to explore your options."
Niche User,5,This is a great college in the lovely area of Central Oregon. Professors are some of the best of the best. Some of Central Oregon Community College Professors have retired from their career and come to Central Oregon to partake in the beautiful scenery and amazing mountain skiing. I highly recommend anyone wanting to appertain their associates or any certificates to apply to Central Oregon Community College.
Freshman,5,"C.O.C.C. is an amazing College to attend!  All of my classes were extremely informative, I was able to see a large amount of diverse ideas and opinions, the campus was always clean and neat, my professors are some of the most helpful people i know, the local area is amazing with great places to eat as well!"
Freshman,5,"The campus is great and I love the area. So far the staff has all been wonderful to work with and are very helpful not matter the need at the time. I am looking forward to getting to know all of the campus better and exploring the city. If you are considering attending, I would highly recommend spending some time on campus, taking a tour, talking with the admissions staff and current or former students."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman starting a new school it can feel overwhelming and nerve-racking, but COCC does everything to make sure you feel comfortable."
Sophomore,5,"I took a four year break from college because I was unable to manage my time properly the first time. At the time, the University I attend was still developing its student success center. COCC has professors who care, and they structure it in a way that taught me the skills that I should have learned the first time."
Freshman,5,Central Oregon Community College is more than what I have expected. It really is a community friendly people and in my opinion has a great Automotive program.
Sophomore,5,"Central Oregon is beautifl, the campus is friendly. The instructors are amazing they make going to school extra fun. They work well with students, and work well with students outside life."
Graduate Student,5,"It great community college, small class sizes. Teachers are very helpful. I enjoy the smaller campuses in Redmond and Madras. Bend campus has lots of stairs!"
Sophomore,5,I love being a student at COCC! Aside from the variety of vocational programs they offer two different AA degrees. The counselors are super knowledgeable and make sure they do everything they can to get you the classes you need for your major and they are there for you on a personal level. Every employee cares about your success in school and it really makes it an easy place to go to every day to learn and progress in life. The administration departments are always helpful and give you access to tons of resources. I would not choose another place to complete my medical assisting certificate. I feel like I have all of the support behind me and I am able get help financially from school and that is amazing because they are helping me live my dream!!!
Senior,5,It's a great college that really pushes you to succeed. They have many different programs and transfer options that can help you become successful in any chosen career.
Alum,5,"It was an excellent decision for me to begin my first two years of college at COCC. It's a small intimate campus with affordable tuition, excellent involvement opportunities, knowledgeable and attentive professors, and fantastic on campus living."
Sophomore,5,I am starting my second year after taking a 5-year leave of absence from COCC and it was been great to be back. I really love the school the teachers are great and the resources they provide for you very nice. So far since being back i have been given a lot of encouragement and support to continue my education and i can honestly say i am excited for my educational career.
Sophomore,5,"It is an amazing community college located in a beautiful city. The academics are amazing and you have an opportunity to transfer directly to Oregon State University Cascades Campus. You can float the river between classes in summer, or hit the slopes in the winter. Plenty of good local coffee shops to study at and the most micro-breweries per capita in America! It is a great affordable alternative to University for your prerequisites. I'm attending their Nursing School and getting my RN. The professors are great, the campus food is pretty solid. The food options include vegan options which are super yummy!"
Junior,5,"The staff and students are very friendly. Each professor that I've had was prompt, organized, and influential. There are many resources for assistance in classes."
Freshman,5,"It's a wonderful school, they are very helpful and make you feel accepted. the education is wonderful and the very informative"
Alum,5,Best place to get your AAOT and they have the best professors that will help you achieve your goals.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school!  The instructors are very willing to help with homework questions when asked and most of them are very quick to replying to email questions.  There are tutors for just about every subject with hours available and all the tutoring is free through tuition.  I have learned so much going here that I am able to retain, not just memorize facts, since they do a lot of hands on learning activities.  I feel I have gotten a wonderful education here and highly recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn.  The campus is nice and has picnic tables in various locations which is nice to have lunch at and get fresh air between classes."
Sophomore,5,The professors are invested in my education. The resources available including tutoring and writing lab are invaluable.
Sophomore,5,"COCC offers great teachers, small class sizes, affordable tuition, scholarships help, and free tutoring for students."
Sophomore,5,"First of all, Bend is a beautiful town with lots of opportunities for recreation. Because Bend is such a great place to live, it attracts a lot of well-qualified individuals. It is these individuals that make COCC such a great place to learn. The professors are all competent, intelligent, kind, friendly, and enthusiastic. Their classes challenged but did not frustrate. They did not hesitate in answering my questions or providing the help I needed. The same goes for the rest of the COCC faculty, such as my academic advisor. This not only makes for a comfortable learning environment, but also an academically sound one. COCC may be a community college, but it has everything a student could need--and because it's a community college, the tuition is far, far less money than anything at a university. In short, my experiences there have been completely positive, and I will always recommend it."
Junior,5,"Central Oregon Community College was an excellent way to get my associates degree quickly, and was affordable for me. I would recommend anyone to start at this Community College because of all the great mentors, and teachers it provided me with."
Sophomore,5,"Central Oregon Community College has great faculty! The campus is very beautiful, and professors make an effort to know your name."
Sophomore,5,I like how the ad visors their really work well with you on getting your degree on time. The classes here are a lot of fun also and very educational all at the same time.
Alum,5,I had a great experience at COCC thanks to some amazing teachers and the fact that it's in the beautiful town of Bend. I still go back and take classes when I can!
Sophomore,5,"Central Oregon Community College has been a pleasure to attend. I love the small classrooms sizes, the one on one teacher time, and the many resources for studying or tutoring. I have made a lot of positive relationships through this school. I have also been able to take a diversified set of classes that have helped learn in ways I never thought I could."
Junior,5,I love how everyone is so welcoming at the campus. The teachers make time for you and help you through things. I would like to see some more programs being offered. 
College Junior,5,"I learned a lot from the professors here, who are educated and passionate about what they do. The workload is doable for any committed student and the facilities are all beautiful."
College Junior,5,"Class times are very flexible; class times range from early in the morning to late in the evening during all terms, including summer."
College Junior,5,"This school has some of the best educators in my opinion; the English teacher I had improved my writing greatly over the course of a year. Similarly, the calculus teacher know exactly what he's doing and how to help the students get to here they need to be."
College Junior,5,"Ridgeview is an engaging and positive environment overall. They take pride in always keeping the school 'classy', meaning we don't stoop to the levels other schools are at when there are sports, competitions, etc."
College Junior,5,There are multiple classes held on different days and different times. It's really nice
College Junior,5,I haven't experienced this very m much yet

College Junior,5,"You cannot beat the location, and if you have the drive to learn more in depth about your program/field then you will love it here and do great."
College Senior,5,They help you learn how to use it.
College Senior,5,Everyone knows what they are doing.
College Senior,5,Everyone seems like they want to be there.
College Senior,5,Going to school to be a pilot. So it is hard work.
College Sophomore,5,COCC has early and late classes so it is easy to go around your personal schedule. The school is always busy with people going to class early or late so the school will never feel dark or abandoned at night.
College Sophomore,5,All off the online classes still feel very connected at COCC because almost all of the online classes have a reflection or blog page where students can talk to each other on the class website. The registration is the same for any class so it makes it very convenient and easy.
College Sophomore,5,All of the professors I have had at COCC are amazing. I have even heard really good things about professors that I haven't had yet. All the professors are so understanding and much more relaxed than other places. They have so many classes available at COCC and they all have only 20 to 25 students per class.
College Senior,5,Great culinary facility and chef instructors.  People care about one another and in the success of all students.
College Sophomore,5,I love the small town feel of my school.
College Junior,5,COCC's staff is fantastic & passionate about teaching you everything you need to know in order to be successful! The campus is beautiful too!
College Sophomore,5,"The psych department is very strong. The professors are incredible, caring, and always happy to work with you. They really know what they're teaching and live the material. The workload can be heavy, but it's always worth it."
College Junior,5,i am in love with it
College Junior,5,they are really fun kids
College Junior,5,The instructors (for everything from Chemistry to Anatomy) were excited tot each and took all the time necessary to help us understand the subjects.
College Junior,5,"Besides having a full load of math every night, my classes were pretty great, schedule wise. All of my teachers were very understand when it came to in-advanced excused absences."
College Junior,5,I love everyone I've met here so far and can't wait to get to know more people for the next few terms.
College Junior,5,I never regret attending COCC. I love it here and everyone is always nice. So glad I decided to finish my first year here!
College Freshman,5,there is a gym to shower at and plenty of computer access scattered around campus
College Junior,5,The class sizes are manageable for effective cross communication between students and teachers. The design of course information is well thought out and creatively accessible to all types of learners. There are tutors for multiple subjects and expansive hours in easy access locations.
Alum,4,"I plan on taking all my classes online so I can also work. However, classes have not started yet to be able to tell you my experience and how well its working for me."
Alum,4,"This is my first time attending this college but they've been so helpful throughout this process of transferring me over. They provide lots of help and resources if needed or preferred. Campus is gorgeous, very green in Oregon."
Niche User,4,My favorite thing about cocc was the teachers every one of them helped me to achieve my goals and if I ever needed help they were there to give the help I need. They wanted me to succeed and did everything the could to help me do so.
Niche User,4,I did not take any online classes but navigating all of there online resources was very easy and applying them to my learning helped me a lot.
Sophomore,4,"Trust me you'll love the dorms and the placement of the campus. While it does look like it in the middle of nowhere and lots of hill, you'll surely get a work out. Very close community and you're treated as a person rather than a number."
Sophomore,4,The courses were well organized and easy to follow. Instructors were available and willing to help with any issues.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy COCC very much the teachers and courses are great and the class sizes are perfect. There are alot of events and clubs aswell.
Sophomore,4,"Central Oregon offered a beautiful campus experience as well as staff that were willing to work with anyone over any issue! With so many classes to choose from, you can get credits for hiking, skiing, rock climbing, and so much more! Both summer and winter could be experience in the outdoors while earning credits from the collage!"
Sophomore,4,Online classes are geared for someone with a busy work schedule. A lot of online classes are easy and the teachers know how to communicate without being face to face all the time which makes it easier on students.
Niche User,4,"Super great community and very welcoming.  My favorite school, great dorms and amazing food service.  Cheap and great education.  Would 10/10 recommend going here.  Super good with any questions you may have."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed COCC. I enjoyed taking classes at the Bend, Redmond and Madras campuses. Everyone I know is nice there. Only compliant is their testing center. I sometimes get a call back and they tell me they have to schedule my test for another day because of sick staff or inexperienced staff."
Niche User,4,"this campus is very diverse and the student body is very open to new comers and inviting.When visiting everyone was very energetic and inviting and happy looking, there was a lot of flyers and clubs i saw. The food was amazing and tasted like restaurant quality."
Sophomore,4,"I like how Central Oregon community college helps people provide access to a bunch of academic resources like computers, rent books, and have one on one support with teachers. What I hope to see changed is the cost of some textbooks and access to renting online ebooks because everything is going digital but still hard to find for good price."
Sophomore,4,"I like the community and how nice everyone is. 
I feel like the teaching is all powerpoint based and I would like more hands on learning."
Freshman,4,Although this college is a community college it is quite large with 5 campuses around central Oregon. They are very helpful when it comes to applying and getting ready for your freshman year. There are many programs to chose from especially in the medical field.
Alum,4,A great way to go through your first two years of school while living in one of the best towns in oregon
Freshman,4,"I am having a great experience at Central Oregon Community College. I am returning to school as an adult rebuilding my life, the instructors really know about the field they are in, and have a passion for teaching. Which makes it less intimidating. They really help you with your career goals, and help you with your plan even starting from scratch. I am more confident in myself then I have ever been thanks to their help, and I've just begun."
Sophomore,4,"I love how every class feels welcoming. Theres not one time that I felt intimidated. The professors are awesome and the other students are too. It has been a great experience to go to COCC. I loved that I didn’t have to travel far, I live super close-by. The campuses are in good condition, they are always clean and tidy. The only thing is that since it’s  in a seldom lonely place of Bend, It can feel weird going at night. Thats the only thing because I once had a class in the evening and It was a bit scary going at night on my own. There aren't that many security around all the time."
Niche User,4,"Academically i am able to choose a variety of concentrations, and it seems like there is a great staff helping you figure out what your future has in store for you. The campus has an option for in student housing, if you decide to stay there. The community has a variety of student activities that can help you with what seems like everything to make your academic journey easy. You are in the area of Bend, which is a beautiful scenic city where you are surrounded by nature everywhere, and if you are in the city you have a wide variety of entertainment, which is what makes the college experience even better."
Sophomore,4,"Despite being a community college, a lot of great opportunities were provided. The professors were willing to make a connection with you and help in any way they could."
Sophomore,4,The area that the college is surrounded by is beautiful! You’ll be sitting in class and deer will come up to the windows. Not only the sensory makes it enjoyable but also the teachers they all do a fantastic job getting you involved in the learning experience!
Sophomore,4,Central Oregon Community College (COCC) is located in beautiful Bend Oregon so that is a huge plus. The campus is beautiful and well cared for. The variety of classes offer is awesome. The library is amazing. COCC also offers free tutoring to students. We just had a brand new science building built and it features study rooms with a view that cannot be beat. I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff and students of COCC. It is a very friendly environment and it is a smaller school so it feels more personal. The only downside is the parking. COCC is on a hill and the parking lots zig zag up the hill and that makes for a long walk and during the winter a very long and slippery walk. We could defiantly do with more parking but they  really have no place to put it.
Freshman,4,"This community college is made up of four campuses in different locations within Central Oregon. The smaller campuses have a less variety of classes and activities than the main campus, which is in Bend. Overall, it is a great college to get your prerequisites out of the way. It offers two different transfer degree programs, but they only apply to certain Oregon four-year universities. My main issue is parking, especially at the bigger campus. I'd recommend carpooling, using public transportation, or arriving early."
Junior,4,Central Oregon Community College is a great option for students who don't have the money for a university but are looking for more of a university feeling. The on campus living really makes it feel more like home. The professors are always open to help and really want you to succeed .
Freshman,4,I liked how much their willing to work with people of all age ranges. Theirs a vast range of people at the college all planning to go into different careers.
Niche User,4,"I have not started college yet, but i have taken classes from there and i really liked how everything was set up and how everyone was so nice and helpful."
Alum,4,"COCC is pretty great! There are some truly amazing teachers, some pretty unique classes, and you can't beat the view of the Cascade Mountain Range. However, the parking situation is not great, and in the winter it gets even worse."
Graduate Student,4,"This college has a lot more time to spend on its students than other Universities, especially the financial aid department. They answer your emails super quick. The biggest problems I've come across are specific instructors."
Sophomore,4,This a great college to figure out what you plan to do and to get all of you undergrad courses completed for less money than a university.
Sophomore,4,"Of course there are many problem professors, but that is easily avoidable. For the most part this is a wonderful campus with many people that care. There are obvious favors of different departments, and departments could stand to communicate when scheduling, but other than that, wonderful."
Freshman,4,"Good school, with good professors and student life. They have many classes and many programs for everyone, they make it very very easy to transfer to other schools. There are many clubs and sports to get involved in as well. The cafeteria food and the housing is okay. I think that theres a lot to do around campus if you like the outdoors and snow."
Freshman,4,I love Central Oregon Community College because the teachers are great and the classmates are down to earth and friendly. I have made a few really good friends because the average age of a student here is above the age of 30. I like this about this college because the classes are geared that way. They are challenging but still have a small college feel. The college also has a lot of school events and activities to peak all interests. There are diversity events such as MLK Day guest speaker a Food and farm fair happening this weekend.
Freshman,4,I have been taking classes at COCC since I was in high school.  I have really enjoyed getting to know some professors.  This community college has a welcoming and helpful staff.  I love that they have free tutoring if you need it.  I can't think of anything I would change.  My experience has been a good one.
Junior,4,"For a community college, COCC is excellent. Most of the professors are amazing and a few terrible ones, as to be expected. Overall, the entire staff is incredibly invested in their students and truly want you to be successful. Beautiful campus, great location, just be prepared for stairs. Parking is said to be awful but i have never had an issue."
Junior,4,Great school with lots of diversity for a community college. Had a great experiences in each class and most instructors care about their students passing their class and tend to push students towards success.
Sophomore,4,"First of, if you don't like stairs don't consider COCC. There is so so many it's ridiculous. However besides the insane amount of distance and stairs, COCC is a great community college. Teachers are willing to go above and beyond to help you and guide you through school."
Alum,4,"COCC was a great college to go to and i enjoyed the classes. The campus wasnt my favorite but I lived off campus so I didnt experience the food, dorms etc."
Niche User,4,Great school and a great location. Staff/instructors are for the most part really helpful and knowledgeable. You can also transfer to OSU Cascades if you want to.
Sophomore,4,"Love that the class sizes are small enough where you can interact with the professors and not have to yell through an auditorium! Most of the professors I've had are very committed to help you learn, that has been one of the best parts about coming back to school after a long break!"
Niche User,4,"Great community college, I had an excellent experience as a part time student. I would greatly recommend the music program."
College Junior,4,"I've spent a lot of time my first term exploring my options and have been pleasantly surprised with the variety of classes I was able to take. I have had a pretty light workload, aside from math classes."
College Junior,4,"Some professors are good and some are not so good, but for the most part its a great school. The school offers lots of resources that can help you if you end up with a not so good professor. The location is wonderful."
College Junior,4,"My favorite thing about this school is that during finals and midterms there is always complementary coffee and food, usually breakfast (fruits, muffins, energy bars, water) to help fuel you and your mind while testing."
College Junior,4,"Online courses, like any, require more self motivation and timeliness The workload appears to be greater because there is no in class time, but adds up to be the same as an actual in class situiation."
College Junior,4,The career center is full of information on different careers and there is always someone there to help you out with job prospects and alumni networking.
College Junior,4,"Class sizes are smaller for the most part, which is great because it allows for more one on one time with a professor if help is ever needed, and gives a sense of belonging because you get to know you other peers (who can also become lifetime friends, or contacts for future opportunity)."
College Junior,4,The degree program at this educational institution is great; there is a wide selection of topics and time slots to fit my schedule to be able to graduate in a timely manner.
College Junior,4,I like how the classes are sized. It's really nice to be in. Smaller classes.
College Junior,4,I love the safe and exciting environment.
College Junior,4,I have loved and learned so much from all of my professors
College Junior,4,"will be very set up for my career after finishing my degree, will have great recommendation letters!"
College Junior,4,I've learned a lot of things that I didn't know before that will help in my career
College Senior,4,"My overall experience is that it's a good school. You can make friends right off the bat and everyone is pretty much friendly. Some classes are fairly easy while others can be a bit difficult but as long as you focus and pay attention, you'll understand the material. Sometimes you may not although that may fall on the teachers for not taking the time to explain a subject but you can always ask and they'll help you as much as they can."
College Junior,4,The online discussions are great and the courses are somewhat comparable to the traditional classes.
College Junior,4,This place is a great starter for careers depending on what field you choose as it is certificates and associate degrees.
College Junior,4,The workload can be heavy at times but with the help of other students and the professors anyone can be successful.
College Sophomore,4,COCC is very community based so people that live in Bend are always centered around the campus because that campus does a lot of events and community work.
College Sophomore,4,COCC has a lot of class options for people so it is very likely for a student to find something they are passionate about and turn that into a career path.
College Sophomore,4,"At COCC, you have the option of being enrolled at the community college your first two years and get the same education as people who are enrolled at OSU Cascades. Students have the ability to stay on the same campus for the full four years because you can be enrolled at OSU Cascades but take classes that only have 20 or 25 students in it. People who are getting there majors have the possibility to get their degree in a community college setting which I think is really important."
College Sophomore,4,"I have taken a full year at COCC and I have had all good professors! Everyone is Bend is so nice and relaxed and makes the college feel more comfortable. The campus is really beautiful, and doesn't feel dated. It is pretty busy for a community college so parking can be hard but there is always a spot open somewhere, it just might not be right by your class. All the professors are super flexible and I have had a great experience so far at COCC."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't dropped by the CAP center for anything other than testing and advising.  They may be helpful, I'm not sure.  Networking is poor and there just aren't enough high level programs for you to really be qualified enough for a great career."
College Freshman,2,The only people here that have talked to me about career opportunities are car salesmen.  Most of the booths that spring up are for political surveys or religious promotion.  This isn't a place you go to make professional contacts.
College Freshman,2,"This is my main issue with COCC.  Professors are all over the place.  Ask around before you sign up for classes.  I have taken a full schedule every term and am almost done with my second year.  My experience here has been frustrating.  The only teachers I've had that seem to teach with a passion are those in the psychology and music departments.  Many of the students seem to be older folks coming back for a second shot at college and a lot of the younger ones seem like this is the only school they could scrounge up the resources/courage to attend.  I've met some nice people but I think that younger students are going to have a really hard time connecting to their peers.  This city has a lot of pot smoking ski bums and is pretty much beer town USA, for what it counts.  It's a beautiful place to live but I'm happy to move on to new things."
College Freshman,2,"I hope all colleges aren't like this.  I started here at age 16 and most of my classmates could be my parents.  The professors are hit or miss.  I've had a couple awesome ones but quite a few more disorganized teachers, some of which have been very close-minded.  If you're going here, it's for affordability and to be in Bend.  Don't expect a first (or even second really) class education.  For me, it's another hoop to jump through to get to the good stuff."
College Junior,2,People here are definitely focused more on their academics as opposed to the social aspect of college.
College Freshman,2,"I was offered very little financial aid so I had to take out unsubsidized student loans.  I have a 3.89 grade point average & feel that to get an education, I should have to go into debt.  I have to work full time to support myself & pay toward my school expenses. My parents are not able to help me as they are struggling themselves. I plan on getting my BA in Economics & possibly a Masters. Any scholarships would greatly appreciated."
College Junior,2,I've never seen any recruitments at my campus.
College Junior,2,"The out of district tuition policy is unfair and penalizes me. I am forced to pay extra, the in district fees are not based on when I moved here but when I enrolled in school. They are making an already expensive education cost too much."
College Senior,2,"I have only been helped well through the CAP center. Nobody else has ever looked at me as more than just a number, not even my required academic adviser."
College Senior,2,"I had 4 online classes. One class I learned things in, but it was because of the subject of the class and the text book I had. The teacher was not involved at all and it was impossible to reach him. The other three classes were either too intricate for an online class without constant communication between student and teacher, or they were too disorganized to make sense to the student. I have learned that online classes at COCC are not a good choice."
College Junior,2,"Most of the time no one seems to care.  Some times I get a human being that likes their job and wants to help, so that is nice."
College Junior,2,The process is long and very frusturating
College Senior,2,"I was not a fan of going to a community college, but money got in the way and now I am stuck going to one. I feel the academic experience at a university is better then one at a community college."
College Junior,2,"Socially there are posters everywhere advertising clubs or groups for aviation, anime, or certain sports. But other than the poster on the wall you never hear or see anything about them, and personally I have never ran across someone in a club or group. It's as if they are nonexistent other that the posters."
College Senior,2,"Since I have no experience working with the Career Services at COCC, I have no personal reflection on the matter of how well it works. I have, however, never heard from post graduates that they found the Career Services helpful at all. They were all on their own when it came to finding work after graduation."
College Senior,2,"If it were not for the writing teacher, it would of been better."
College Junior,2,THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW VERY NICE BUILDINGS AND THERE ARE SOME OLD BUT THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.  THE GROUNDS UP TOP ARE JUST GORGEOUS BUT THE HIKE UP THE STAIRS IS OUT RAGEOUS.  GOOD THING FOR THE SHUTTLE BUT THE TIMES COULD RUN A BIT MORE IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE CLASS START TIMES.  I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS FOR A CLASS THAT STARTED AT 10:15 BUT THE SHUTTLE DIDNT PICK UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS HILL UNTIL 10:05 COULDNT MAKE THERE ON TIME EVER
College Sophomore,2,"I am paying for classes out of pocket. I applied for financial aid and it seemed they always needed one more thing, it was more of a headache then i wanted, so i quit trying to recieve it.The education is well worth the money"
College Sophomore,2,I do not have enough informative to be able to make a determination on this subject
College Sophomore,2,"I personally think this area could be improved with adding additional professors and classes there is definitely and issue with classes being full and I have found that not all courses are offered every term programs that are in very high demand and full each prior term offered.  
I know this is an area the faculty is aware of and actively working diligently as I write this."
Sophomore,1,"If I could give this school a lower rating I would. Disregarding my FAFSA, it took them THREE whole months to reach back to me and tell me that I submitted the wrong paper work (two whole weeks before Fall Term was about to start, even though I submitted the paperwork to them at the end of May). And because I didn't have the correct paperwork, COCC withheld my Oregon Promise which I was already granted from the Oregon Promise Grant itself. Now not only that, they signed me up for a class (that I had already taken and passed with an A) and charged me for it. And then somehow lost the credits from the original class that I passed with an A. This school has been nothing but frustrating, a disappointment and a complete waste of money. I would go to any other school if I could do it all over again."
Freshman,1,COCC has policies that don’t  align with their own core values . They say they want students to reach their full potential yet can’t provide help for them to improve.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The school is all up hill, parking sucks, theres a bunch of old people who think its okay to hit on 18 year olds when they are just minding their business. The school may be called a community collage but there is no community in it at all. Its VERY hard to meet people your age unless you live in the dorms but the dorms are very poor and there are very creepy people that live there. Half the students that go to COCC are your average stoners, the other half just wants it to be over. I dislike it here very much and I'm transferring to a different school."
College Sophomore,1,If you have ever gone to a real college it a billion times better then this one.
College Sophomore,1,"Since my father completely refuses to work with me and give me his tax information, which is the only thing that I need to receive my financial aid money, I can't receive it. I have called the office several times to see if there is a way I can still get my financial aid money without the use of him. I mean I never talk to him or even see him. There must be something they can do."
College Freshman,1,"I don't have any clue to what happens with our ""student body"" on campus as I almost never hear anything involving the student body... let alone activities done by them... I am also disappointed that I pay almost a $100 a year for their student body activities and don't see anything come from it."
College Student,1,The facilitators worked hard to help me over the phone and yet the instructions for the class were erroneous.

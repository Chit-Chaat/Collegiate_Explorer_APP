Sophomore,5,"A good school, with a loving and welcoming environment for Christians of all kinds to learn about and get in touch with Christ as well as receive a quality education. Well trained teachers who know as well as practice what they're talking about. Many hands on opportunities for students to be involved in the school, and beyond the classroom."
Sophomore,5,It is a caring community. Going to Valley Forge is like joining a family. The professors care about your well being and want to get to know you. They put you before your work. Everyone there encourages you to learn and grow. We all grow together.
Freshman,5,The moment I walked on campus I felt at home. They have such a heart of servanthood and I can't wait to attend in the fall of 2020.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere of Valley Forge. I have created life long friendships and relationships there. It has really helped me grow into he person I need to be. The community at Valley Forge has really helped me break out of my shell and be more outgoing!
Freshman,5,"UVF is an amazing university. The professors are not just there to give out information and tests. They want to take their time to become your mentors and help you in every possible way. The food on-campus is probably one of the only complaints I have, but they continue to improve it with each passing semester."
Freshman,5,The professors are all very genuine and strive to help you learn and grow in your academics and in every area of your life. It's a good Christian environment.
Alum,5,"This is a different school than it was just a few years ago. The professors have always been wonderful - they truly care about the students and offer a quality academic experience. The culture and environment, however, have truly transformed in recent years. Jesus is the center here!"
Freshman,5,"Great Christian University. There's plenty of services during the week, as well as worship too. Very friendly, outgoing student environment. Student environment is always ready to smile and greet anyone walking around campus. The Staff/Professors are always available. The Staff/Professors also are absolutely amazing. They are there to help and provide any support and guidance as much as possible. Classes are on the smaller side which makes for great interaction with the Professors. Plus, the tuition costs for a university are absolutely on the cheaper end compared to many others. Overall a great university to grow in your faith while earning your degree."
Junior,5,"The one thing that I love about this school is that everyone here is so accepting of who you are, and they love you for it (it almost feels like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood). This school has some great professor, and an academic program that can't be beat unless you went to an Ivy League school or something, cause they're pretty good too. The food here may not be the best, but is any school going to have great food? I think not. The University of Valley Forge can really changchange your life, just like its has with mine. It doesn't matter was rcolored skin you have or what background you come from, we all people,here to be great and succeed."
Junior,5,"I like that UVF is a small school with big opportunities. The community and atmosphere is perfect, and the professors and staff are all wonderful."
Alum,5,"The University of Valley Forge is a great school. It has a small student body, so it is a good fit for students who like smaller environments. This also leads to a smaller class size, so time with professors is maximized. The students, staff, and faculty are all amazing people and extremely friendly."
Niche User,5,"I loved the sense of community and the pursuit of God. Everyone seemed so much like a family, and I felt very supported. Everyone I met there was so willing to help me find where I was going or answer any questions I had. I also felt very accepted. Like I would fit in if I were to attend."
Freshman,5,The people I have met have been very welcoming and are just wonderful people all together. I can't wait to get to know everyone better as the years go on. I am so excited to meet everyone.
Alum,5,"Loved my experience at UVF. The University is really changing for the better. Better food, better staff, more renovations. It feels like the leadership is listening to the students and making an effort to improve. The Lord is still working in and through this University in a big way!"
Junior,5,"Valley Forge is an excellent place to learn. The atmosphere is very uplifting and the chapels are diverse and interesting, to say the least. Classes are manageable and there are a wide variety of majors, as well as sports to be a part of."
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Valley Forge University! As a young student, I've always longed for a place to learn, grow, and call a home. The University Valley Forge provided that and more!The leadership of the school is amazing because they're willing to work with you no matter the issue. The Professors teach with such FRIE and PASSION that it's unbelievable! Digital Media is a very big at UVF."
Sophomore,5,I really like Valley Forge because it is a small college and Bible based. I really like how you can connect with the students and the professors. You can get to know your professors one-on-one. The staff all care about the students and are always there for the students and willing to help. I love that there is chapel. That's the highlight of my day.
Freshman,5,Didn't start yet but I really like the campus and the atmosphere. I love how small the school is and how everyone knows you. I also love how you have to go to chapel as a requirement. Most schools I looked at didn't require it and I love the idea that you have to go.
Freshman,5,The university of valley forge is a good school I really enjoy just about everything there. I would change anything about the school. What out there makes the school what it is.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Valley Forge is a university with an atmosphere like no other. We are a Christian University and because of that the students here strive to be the best we can be in our relationships with Christ. Christianity is clearly represented in all classes offered here, and they help develop your own worldview. I would not trade my education here for anything! I love being part of a university that helps me grow in my knowledge, but also in my relationship with Christ."
Freshman,5,"I am a second semester freshman, and so far I really like my classes. Most of the professors present very interesting lectures, although some can be hard to focus on at times. Their digital media program is pretty impressive because, although it's a pretty small school, they have some really great quality equipment and the professors are really dedicated to seeing you succeed. You also get the chance to practice some of your skills live during chapel."
College Freshman,5,I love my college and highly recommend it
College Freshman,5,I honestly feel at home here. I've had the best moments of my life while being a part of this college.
College Junior,5,Lots of places to study
College Junior,5,Campus does not tolerate alcohol or drugs
College Junior,5,"I love everyone on campus. Professors care about students and do what they can to help you pass and are there to listen to you. Class sizes are percect, usually 12-20 students. Classes offered are very varied and you can pick from a lot."
College Junior,5,Campus is very safe. We are christian and partying and drugs are not allowed so violence and sexual assaults are basically nonexistent
College Junior,5,The dorms here are clean and we get what we need and have plenty of space
College Junior,5,I love my school! I have grown spiritually and have made tons of life long friends and have learned a lot! I am so grateful im a student here
College Junior,5,They do the greatest job with assisting us with out career goals
College Junior,5,"Love it, would not want to go anywhere else in my home state."
College Junior,5,They do an excellent job of keeping all of us safe and secure..
College Junior,5,I would not want to change anything. I love my housing and my neighbors on my floor.
College Junior,5,"I love my school. There are a lot of fun faces, people and events that always happen."
College Freshman,5,"The Professors are great, I am learning a lot."
College Sophomore,5,Drugs aren't an issue at UVF.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Valley Forge has so much to offer their students spiritually, academically .. don't get discouraged by one or two that threaten to make your experience undesirable. You get out of it what you put into it. I struggled with the amount of theological writing and research I had to do but it made me a better person! I do not like Dr. Dan Mortenson, Jonathon Capeci and a few other administrative persons who have not treated members of the phoenixville community well. They are concerned about money and nothing else! Even if it means robbing good hard-working people of their livelihood. They are wolves in sheep's clothing! Be careful not to expose yourself or personal struggles to those in authority. Speak with a professor or trusted friend or you'll regret it!"
College Freshman,5,We have many options that will make any undergraduate want to attend our school. There are summer courses and internships you can apply for.
College Freshman,5,The campus dining supply's t great course meals. I am highly satisfied with how they manage their food.
College Freshman,5,It is very great in the town my college resides in. We are 25 minutes away from Philadelphia.
College Freshman,5,It is a fun and carefree environment. The faculty are all dedicated to help the students succeed. They are always available when ever a question arises. It is a dedicated college that provides a great christian atmosphere. Every staff and faculty member at the college is approachable to say the least. This college makes you feel at home. The best decision a person can make is applying to such a wonderful college.
College Junior,5,"Not too far from Philly, so those are always options. Downtown Phoenixville, KOP, and Collegeville are full of great places to eat, both chain and small mom and pop joints."
College Junior,5,"We are about 2 hours or less from NYC, DC, Philadelphia, Jersey Shore, and King of Prussia. With this in mind, the availability of activities, cultural events, shopping, sporting events and all things fun are within a short distance away. Downtown Phoenixville is a popular and local hangout for many students in the evenings due to the revitalization of Phoenixville and the influx of great shops/stores there now."
College Junior,5,There is almost zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol on campus. Back in the 90s there was a serious issue with some hard drugs on campus. In the past 20 years they have cleaned up and cracked down on campus. There are different levels of infringement and punishment depending on what was done and in what consistency it is done.
College Junior,5,"As far as diversity, we are quite the melting pot. Being a Christian College associated with the Assemblies of God, we have a large population of missionary kids who have grown up all over the world. On top of this, we are a hop skip and a jump away from Philadelphia, quite a diverse city all on its own. Economically and religiously, we have students that come from all walks and backgrounds of life. We are a more conservative Christian college, so though most students and staff are very open and accepting of everyone, as they come, there are a few that may voice issues with ""unnatural"" sexual orientations."
College Freshman,5,we great our own comptures
College Freshman,5,"The only time school is canceled is when it snows. The school is very concerned about our safety. If they know the weather will be bad, they let us know ahead of time and have us linked to a weather alert system."
College Freshman,5,Everyone commutes to school and there is always parking. School is located in an area convenient for everyone.
College Freshman,5,We hardly get bad weather. It just gets cold in the winter. But I love it here.
College Freshman,5,The professors are great with working with you. They help provide study guides for the exam that will help you learn the material. 
College Freshman,5,The school provides each major with a specific advisor that helps guide the students into the right direction.
College Freshman,5,I love the people and professor of the school. They all work together to better help the students.
College Freshman,5,"I love the attractions, activities, safety, and all that."
College Freshman,5,The school has limits on open dorms. Male and female students are only allowed too go to the opposite sexes dorm if it is open dorm. Any drugs caught will be violation from the student handbook and could potentially get you kicked out of school.
College Freshman,5,The school provides all the technology so that the students have all the access they need to help with their studies.
College Freshman,5,We are a Christian College with Christian views. If we get caught doing those things we will get fined. 
College Freshman,5,They do not hand out fines for parking.
College Freshman,5,I want an internship across the globe doing children's ministry. I am not worried about the pay but I want to reach lost souls.
College Freshman,5,I didn't face any problems or challenges when encountering the admission part. I think it went rather smoothly. 
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe and secure in this school.
Junior,4,Classes pretty simple but very tedious compared to south eastern overall a way better school compared to this school
Sophomore,4,It makes you feel like you are a part of a community and like you are a part of big family. They also have great teachers.
Junior,4,"Great professors! The campus is beautiful and well maintained outside. The dorms can vary in quality, depending on how many people are living there and how new the building is."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Valley Forge. It certainly has its pros and cons, but I wouldn't have traded it for the world. The professors care about each student deeply and the school is engrained in the word of God. However, the whole administrative department left much to be desired. Any questions in regards to financial aid, admissions, etc. was very, very stressful. It was always chaotic and never organized well."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of UVF is very comfortable and homey! The professors are exceptional and they take their time getting to know each of their students. The food is average, but the coffee shop (Jazzman's) on campus is really good!"
Sophomore,4,It is a great university/college to experience God while learning about the field you will be going into.
Graduate Student,4,"Valley forge is a great faith based campus. All the people here are very nice and open. The teachers are always available for help in and out the campus. Even on vacations. Plus they always put god first, and many students will always come to a fellow believer in need."
Niche User,4,I think Valley Forge is a good fit for me. I love the many minsitry options and the people hav ebenn kind
Sophomore,4,Overall my experience is excellent. The only thing I would say is the financial aid office employees need to have a better understanding of their job. They need to have better communication.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are great and really care. Small classrooms  are a plus! I would like to see an upgrade in the dorms and apartments.
Freshman,4,The university of valley forge is a really chill Christian college. It boasts such a welcoming environment and teachers who want to see you succeed. You take from this college as much you put into it. Its just a fun campus with a true mission towards God.
Junior,4,I like the university of valley forge because I love the people there. Everyone is so nice and are willing to help athletes out with their work. I play basketball there and once you're on the team everyone knows who you are. I love my coach and my team. I love the environment.
College Freshman,4,The campus is a healthy and safe place to live on
College Freshman,4,"Though not quite as good-looking as other dorms I've seen, they're pretty great for what they are."
College Freshman,4,"I'm personally not a big sports guy, but the gym is good for working out."
College Junior,4,Staff here are helpful and the student body diverse
College Junior,4,I'm not into sports but volleyball and football seem to be big events at school. The games are fun to watch.
College Sophomore,4,I like the campus housing on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The school is a good fit for me.
College Senior,4,The professor cares for each student. They are available whenever they have their office hours. Classes are moderate they each us about life and spiritual life.
College Senior,4,The university opens student up in a spiritual way and emotional way. The university is not as big as other university so everyone knows everyone. It small yet impactful in spiritual and academic ways.
College Junior,4,Never heard of these. this is new cause almost no one has one of these
College Sophomore,4,The security of UVF is great! They are only a phone call away and will assist students when they are requested.
College Sophomore,4,"I am very confident that I will be able to secure a teaching position upon graduation. I know that in the Phoenixville area and in the Christian community around the country, a degree at UVF is noteworthy. I'm sure that the school will help me right up to graduation day, and long after that!"
College Sophomore,4,I love the faculty and staff at UVF. I love how they are part of student life. I have been to the home of professors for Christmas parties and for extra-curricular activities. They just care! Class sizes are great and the professors care about the subjects they are teaching.
College Sophomore,4,There are several different options for rooms and the number of roommates you want. I think UVF does a great job in meeting the needs and requests of the students to get them in the room that will best suit their wants and needs.
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Valley Forge was the only school I applied to. The very first time I stepped on campus I knew that this was where I was supposed to be. Now that I am completing my Freshman year, I have to say I still feel that way. I am over 300 miles from home, but UVF has become my home away from home. My professors, advisers, student leaders and friends have become part of my extended family and these are the relationships that last a lifetime! What makes UVF unique, in my opinion, is the unity of the student body; sure not everyone gets along all of the time, but we are called to one purpose and to serve the people around us with love and compassion."
College Freshman,4,The professors are generally very good at their jobs.  The majority of them can be sensitive to the individual needs of the students.
College Freshman,4,The cost to attend the University of Valley Forge is on the lower end of the costs of other schools that I looked at.  Some of the dorms could use a little renovation in order to make the campus even more crisp.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, this campus has an enjoyable atmosphere that promotes spiritual growth. The University of Valley Forge is a considerable option on anyone's checklist who is prepared to grow in his or her Christian faith."
College Freshman,4,"The University of Valley Forge, formerly Valley Forge Christian College, is a great environment for making friends and building relationships in Christ, as well as receiving a great education and knowing that you are going to be used in the future to reach more people for the Kingdom of God. Some of my favorite experiences here have to be when I have had the chance to minister to others."
College Freshman,4,"Some class sizes may be too big for the classroom, itself, to handle but it works. The professors work with you and your schedule to make sure you succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"It's good, but again proper time management, otherwise it can all become overwhelming very quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"One thing I must say, this school isn't for everyone, but if it is for you, then this school will help you grow and you will see the importance of community, responsibility, and spiritual growth."
College Sophomore,4,"People come to this school to pursue their passion, and getting internships and jobs after graduation have normally been successful for the graduates."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great school and I truly love the atmosphere, students, and staff/faculty. All I would change is to not make class attendance required and offer better food."
College Sophomore,4,"Depends on what you're here for. If you're here for Digital Media, specifically Video, Audio or Photography, this is really good school for it. Music, and Pastoral ministries are the only other two ares where the school excels in. Other than that, I would advise you to go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,4,I have no bad things to say in regards to this.
College Junior,4,There's very little issue with safety on campus. We have security officers 24/7 but there is rarely need for them. I almost always feel safe.
College Junior,4,Teachers are very knowledgeable about their subjects and really take the time to care about and invest in their students. As we have become a University there have consistently been more classes and majors offered.
College Junior,4,"Valley Forge Christian College (now the University of Valley Forge) is like home to me. I have made friends there that I know I will keep forever. The professors really care about each student and are always available for advice in education and in life. One of my favorite things that we do is each spring, all classes and activities are cancelled for a day and we go out and serve the community. We clean up parks, paint buildings, and do anything that anyone in the community has expressed they would like help with. Overall I have had an amazing experience and am so excited to see what will come in the time I have left."
College Junior,4,The teachers take time to get to know you and invest in your life.
College Senior,4,I have grown as a person and became a much better leader since attending Valley Forge.
College Freshman,4,The athletics are good and they're great to get involved in but there is some unfairness within the different teams.
College Sophomore,4,"In my opinion, the academics and chapel are the best things about this University."
College Junior,4,I have been very happy with my classes. Some classes taught by adjunct professors seem like a waste of time/money. I would like to see more effectiveness in that area.
College Junior,4,I understand why each policy is put into place. I think that they set up positive guidelines for students as Christian leaders in households and communities.
College Freshman,4,The diversity is really nice. The admissions are a little selective on their students but overall we have a evenly distributed community filled with different ethnic backgrounds.
College Freshman,4,We have a nice gym on campus for students to use to prepare and train for the sports they are enrolled in.
College Freshman,4,What makes our school so unique is that we are all a big family. We all can rely on one another.
College Freshman,4,The involvement in our school is fantastic. Everyone is is willing to work with each-other on a personal level.
College Freshman,4,The off-campus selection at my school is really nice.
College Freshman,4,Well it is hard to live on your own. Find a roommate to help lower the cost.
College Freshman,4,It is a great way to get away from home and relax. It is a great place to do homework so that a person is less distracted.
College Junior,4,"There are a large number of restaurants near are school, with many different dining options. The options of these dining places vary from all different price ranges and convinces. The nice thing is that 3 places within walking distance from campus have student discounts, including a pizzeria, and sort of cafe, and a frozen ice place. 

Wawa's, Wendys, McDonalds, and Taco Bell are all within a walking distance. However about 8 miles away from the school is downtown Phoenixville and there are a bunch of nice locally owned restaurants there, most are classier and higher priced however it is a nice environment and great if you want something a little nicer. There are about 5 Apple Bees within 20mins in any direction from the school which is nice. 

Some of the best places to check out are, Bella Nappoli pizzeria, Pettrucis Frozen Ice, Dunkin Donuts, Bobs Haven, The Black Lab Bistro, and Maggionos."
College Freshman,4,The professors are great professors. They really care about ones education. The programs are good and competitive.
College Freshman,4,"There isn't a big security faculty because the school is small. However, it is very well secured. All the doors are locked. There is a security at each main entrance. For a student to go inside, they own a security sensor ID."
College Freshman,4,I want to be a professor in theology. I am not concerned about finding a job. I am confident that I will find one at the right school. I would definitely do it over again.
College Freshman,4,"The school works on a block schedule. This means I have each class once a week, but the class is 3 hours. I love my program. I am focused on Theology. As I strive to graduate with a bachelors in Theology, I am focused mainly in the language side of it with 18 credits in languages. The faculty is very united in their mission. They are not just teaching students how to memorize information, but they are teaching students to learn it and know it. There is always a joyful environment."
College Freshman,4,"As a Christian College, the students don't drink nor consume drugs."
Sophomore,2,It’s more like high school than a university. The school has great marketing and media though! Philly is really fun and not far.
Sophomore,2,The school has a lot of student maturity issues that have resulted in restraining and at times hurtful policies for students seeking a more mature college atmosphere.
College Sophomore,2,I should have gone to Temple.
College Sophomore,2,Needs updates. Don't go here for sports.
College Junior,2,Scholarships are hard to get from the school if you are a non AG member. I think that limited scholarships keep students from attending the school. High GPA should be rewarded more than what it already is.
College Junior,2,Maintenance workers are always in buildings fixing one thing or another. Walls are cracked and paint is chipping in many places. Carpets are very old and stained. The heat is too hot in the winter time where dorm windows have to be opened just to keep airflow. We have insect problems as well. Though rooms are spacious and cozy but the physical appearance is lacking.
College Junior,2,"Our campus lacks a quality athletics facility. It is more of an eye sore to the campus and is a turn away from some students wanting to attend the campus. I think that with better sports facilities students would be more willing to physical activities, and sporting events would be attended much more frequently then they are currently. I also believe it would bring in more students to the campus."
College Junior,2,"Phoenixville has become prime real-estate in the past ten years. Off-Campus housing is basically non-existent, expensive, hard to find, and inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,Not very good food. Makes a lot of people sick
College Junior,2,Aside from athletic teams or music groups not much transportation is provided or is necessary with the small campus 
College Junior,2,Expensive if you don't have a meal plan
College Junior,2,All but one of the housing buildings are renovated hospital buildings. 
College Junior,2,1-2 new buildings. In process of renovating. Was an army hospital 75+ years ago. 
College Junior,2,Slowly getting better but if your not a religious major you will not receive the same kind of respect or recognition that other majors receive. 
College Junior,2,Can only get an off campus apartment if your are over the age of 24. 
College Junior,2,Very Strict on rules and will fine you for every little thing. 
College Junior,2,"It not the greatest. We are that far from a Wawa or K-mart both are about a fifteen minute walk both ways, but most of the students with cars are willing to help out if they can."
College Freshman,2,We occasionally have concerts and such but not very often.
College Senior,2,It Is Pretty Strict – We have a handbook of rules. They do take necessary action.
College Junior,2,"Needs Improvement – Phoenixville is a relatively safe place to be. However, they have had a string of thefts and I feel as though there should be a more visible security presence around campus."
Alum,1,I never had any online classes besides my music class but I just want to say some classes shouldn’t be online
Alum,1,Would not recommend my sons ceiling feel through and the food was absolutely horrible and let’s not for get the building smelled like mold and BO
Junior,1,"I went here for a semester my room was falling apart and bugs everywhere. It seems like a very diverse school but so many clicks. I loved chapel but other than that I would pass! Bad food, bad dorms, and bad service between student and staff! DONT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!"
Niche User,1,"I attended this school for 2years when it was still Valley Forge Christian College. I actually overheard a conversation that they decided to change the name and not include ""Christian"" so that people going into graduate schools or transferring would have an easier time infiltrating the secular world and not be discriminated against. I have a word limit so I'll sum it up. Neurotic behavior and beliefs. Delusional. Homophobia. Speaking in tongues. Fake people. Pious. Pious. Pious."
College Freshman,1,We are a Christian college so there are rarely ever any parties that people go to. The only parties we have are fun birthday parties.
College Sophomore,1,It's pretty disappointing that tuition is very expensive when campus housing is awful. You'd think a Christian college would provide a nice place for students to live on campus but that is not the case. Secular universities provide a better quality of campus housing than this Christian University. It's ashame.
College Junior,1,Don't come to vfcc to party. The closest nightlife worth while is West Chester Univ about 30 min away
College Junior,1,You will always get sick from eating this food. Your system will not like it. 
College Junior,1,Really not a party school. We argue alot on facebook that is quite fun. 
College Junior,1,They very rarely give out money because the school is based on a church. 
College Junior,1,Pretty much everyone on campus us really fake towards a lot of people. 
College Senior,1,"Unless you have a car or friends with a car who are free whenever you need to get to the store or work, you are screwed."
College Sophomore,1,"On rare occasions, at least the school may provide a shuttle bus but not necessarily for the use of the students' general interests of traveling around and it is almost never discussed, so I usually rely on someone else who has a car of their own if I need a ride somewhere as I do not have a car myself."
College Senior,1,"While there is parking for students it's highly limited and the chances of getting a spot near your building are super slim except for Bongiorno Hall which is newly added and in the back of campus by itself as opposed to the other dormitories which are all in the front of campus.
Parking is 50 bucks a semester for a little plastic window cling in your car....ridiculous!!!
Spaces are not academic class reserved everyone parks everywhere. Freshman ARE allowed to have cars on campus."
College Junior,1,"I Go to a Sister Campus – On the campus I go to, there are almost no activities offered. There are definitely very little offered that are actually offered by the school."
College Sophomore,1,"Worst Experience – My freshman year was a nightmare. My aid and cost etc constantly changed through the semester, before and after. No one ever gave me the same number twice, and there was horrendous communication break down between those in the financial department. I was so frustrated by the end of my freshman year I almost transferred. As a commuter it was the absolute worst part about going to school."
College Junior,1,"Greek? It Doesn't Exist. Here, there is no greek life. No sororities or frats. I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing but I think that Greek life has a lot to do with the school's overall happiness as students. With no greek life there is little chance to branch out and meet other people, there is little chance to feel like you belong and there are hardly any events on campus that bring the students together as a whole. I would love to have something similar to the greek life at the Forge, for the sake of relaxing from school work and meeting new people."
College Senior,1,You just better hope that someone has left you a spot in front of your building or you could be parking on the other side of campus from your dorm.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no greek life as it is a way to segregate people and students on campus from each other.  It is something we don't want to do to cause division.

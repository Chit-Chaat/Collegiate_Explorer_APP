Junior,5,"Lord's willing, I will take my classes online. The advisors  is responsive when I have any issues. They have shown their commitment to me when I've had difficulty enrolling."
Junior,5,The staff here is patient. The team is here for each student to help us succeed. I'm very motived to continue on with my career.
Junior,5,Chestnut Hill College is amazing! Their staff was super helpful with the transfer process. They have a beautiful campus and buildings. Everyone there has been super nice and extremely helpful.
Freshman,5,"When I visited chestnut hill college , I didn’t saw beauty scenery . The format of the campus is great . Majority of locations of occupation like residence halls for freshman , dining halls , are beautiful in scenery . Griffey’s den , the dining hall on campus is large and homey . The food is great & I can envision dining  there for a while in between classes . The library and dorms are so homey . After speaking to many students such as the class of 23 , 21 and 22 I know that chestnut hill college counselors and professors care about their students education , how they react to it and if their personal lives are at its best thanks to them . They believe  that if a student is in a great mental state they will excel academically. I cannot wait to attend their admitted students day in April ! I feel at home here . I hope you will fund my experience at my new home"
Junior,5,The program of Organizational Dynamics is perfect for a working parent. The intimacy's of a small college is valuable as there is no feeling of being lost in the numbers.
Sophomore,5,Chestnut Hill College gives me hope to believe that there is another chance for me to succeed in life. Everyone around campus are so friendly and understanding. The staff at Chestnut Hill College are willing to help you with your journey to getting a great education. I love the Academics at Chestnut Hill College and the beautiful scenery around campus.
Niche User,5,"I did a campus tour today. I love the school, the people, and everyone I met today. I actually made a new friend quickly. I'll be looking forward to going in the fall."
Junior,5,"I am in the adult accelerated program so I'm not the average student who gets the full college experience. I can, however, tell you the campus is beautiful, the professors are more than fair, and the staff are there to help to the fullest of their capacity."
Freshman,5,So far it has been a great experience. I am going through the admissions process and it has been a very smooth transition. The staff and the faculty have been nothing sort of amazing. They are very helpful and understanding. I am a nontraditional student with a million questions and they take the time out to help me in whatever way is needed.
Junior,5,"My experience at Chestnut Hill College has been wonderful from the time I have started. The professors are very helpful and caring. They give time to their students. Overall the appearance of the college is wonderful also 
Very neat and clean."
Junior,5,The environment is very tranquil and supportive. Peers are very inclusive with one another and the campus happenings. Staff take pride in Maine sure that each member of the college is comfortable and addressed all concerns.
Senior,5,"Everyone is so nice & welcoming, the campus is beautiful. The professors are extremely helpful. I have been there for 3 years and I have not come across a professor that was not helpful. They offer a lot of scholarships. If I could change anything it would be for the classes to be a little less but like every college I guess u get what you pay for."
Sophomore,5,Very nice professors. I am a commuter that travels two hours to this school which is always nice to be on the campus. Absolutely a great atmosphere to be around. I have met a ton of great people that I am sure will forever be associated into my life throughout my college years and afterwards as well. I have a very hopeful feeling about my career and I am very motivated to carry out my career through their education system. Very proud I had made the decision to attend this college. This experience will be carried on with me throughout my life. I have been able to receive a very fortunate experience for my time being with this school.
Senior,5,Chestnut Hill College is a great small school! You get unique and personalized attention from your professors because student to teacher ratio is 4 to 1 and class sizes are small. The community and student body is very welcoming to all people. Great value for the education you can get here! You can also make great contacts and get connected with great internship opportunities.
Graduate Student,5,"Classes, professors...all excellent.  College has clear mission and stands behind it.  Library cat is awesome!!"
Senior,5,"Chestnut Hill College is a diverse community of instructors and students, Based on the traditions of a catholic institution , The small student class ensure individualized attention. We welcome everyone and the campus is beautiful, convenient to shopping malls and the Center of Philadelphia, Shuttles are provided . We are dear neighbors, The just introduced Cyber security degree is an example of the cutting edge  instruction that gears you towards a career in a up and coming industry."
Junior,5,It has been a good very experienced attending this school. everyone is nice and the teachers are very knowledgeable.
Graduate Student,5,"When it comes to attending Chestnut Hill College I can honestly say it was the best experience I have ever had. I love the mix of tradition and non-traditional students and how we can learn from one another and not feel completely out of place.  I love how personable the staff are and how they  make learning enjoyable. The professors are very supportive and inclusive. The atmosphere is welcoming  and all the staff from the parking lot attendants to constant are absolutely wonderful. There is a supportive family-like system and everyone is willing to step up and help you along the way, either through life or geographically at this school.
When it comes to getting involved they always have things going on such as drama club, crocheting, nights out you name it they have it. I can go on and on but I just want to say that my experience at this college has been one of the most fulfilling, fun and educational pieces in my life and I plan of returning for my Masters."
Senior,5,The professors and advisors take the time to get to know the students and what their needs are.  A very caring and compassionate group can be found here.
Junior,5,Overall Chestnut hill is an excellent school. The teachers are knowledgeable and friendly. They really work hard to give you the education you deserve. The campus is safe and the environment is clean.  It really is a great place
College Sophomore,5,"The courses are very fun. There are some professors that are very popular on campus including Dr. Patrick McCauley and Dr. Karen Wendling. I have throughly enjoyed most of my classes. I decided not to take one of the courses I signed up for and switched it because one of my friends was treated unfairly by the teacher because of her disability and I did not want that to happen to me. Aside from that most professors are very fair. Some can be very irritating, but overall they just want you to succeed. They are very accommodating to your needs. The courses are really fun too. The class sizes are small. The biggest I had was 15 students."
College Sophomore,5,"I basically always feel safe on campus. After being bullied by another student, I brought it to the attention of the administration and I still feel safe. Security is always on the lookout for trouble."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love CHC. I am currently a sophomore who is majoring in psychology and minoring in human services and sociology. I was a commuter for the first year, but am contemplating moving on campus. I am in the interdisciplinary honors program. Most of the teachers are great, but there are some that are a pain in the butt. The psychology major is a really popular one at this school so it is by far the best program offered at the school. All the people at CHC are generally very friendly. If you have a problem, administration is always there to help. The only problem with the school is the racial diversity, but as for other diversity it is great. CHC is a very caring and warm place. I often hangout in campus ministry, even though I am an agnostic. As for being a commuter, it can feel like you are on the outside looking in, if you don't actively attempt to be involved. The best way to be involved is through the clubs. I am in the harry potter alliance and it is so fun and generally entertaining. Anyway CHC is a great school, and I would not choose another school if I wanted to."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are good, curriculum varies, registration was very easy."
College Freshman,5,Have not noticed anyone who was not accepted
College Freshman,5,I am unaware of sexual assaults on campus.
College Freshman,5,I was able to get a single room freshman year.
College Freshman,5,A small school in amazing location.  Close to city and suburbs.  Able to walk to all locations.
College Junior,5,The community you build is the best
College Junior,5,School spirit and Griffin Pride is taken seriously
College Junior,5,I love how much I can connect with professors
College Freshman,5,"There are chances to get internships on campus, they have fairs of jobs and a lot of different events."
College Freshman,5,"I love everything academically, my professor were great and the class sizes are ideal."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is great, everything is close together and in walking distance. I love the social atmosphere, it is what I love about the field."
College Senior,5,My college experience has been amazing. I have met so many new people & expanded my education. It is a totally different environment than high school.
College Sophomore,5,Chestnut Hill was my number one choice from day one of freshman year in high school. I fell in love with it online and now I get to go there as a student. I am more than thrilled.
College Freshman,5,We must follow the rules
College Freshman,5,"We do not have a football team at CHC, but our lacrosse and tennis teams are two of the best teams on campus (in my opinion). It's always great to see our student body come together to celebrate our victories and cheer on our fellow peers."
College Senior,5,Security is alway focus on students and trying to figure out what's best for them.
College Junior,5,"There is no room for drugs, and alcohol..there is so much other stuff to do on campus"
Recent Alumnus,5,"My program is excellent. We are taught by many of the best professors ever. The workload is overwhelming however, that is how we learn."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is very hands on and committed. Unlike, any other school they really want all of their students to succeed so the staff welcomes you to ask questions and come to them for help.  If I had to do it all over again I would."
College Sophomore,5,I find the strictness at my school to be acceptable. Only because it keeps the students focus and they will know the severity of maintaining good grade.
College Student,5,Fiesta has the BEST pizza.
College Sophomore,5,They do not tolerate it.
College Sophomore,5,The college follows great procedures when bad weather occurs.
College Senior,5,"As far as I know there are a wide variety of majors, and I am very happy with my choice (Molecular Biology)"
College Senior,5,"I think the health and safety aspect is excellent, it's a small school where you know almost everybody, and we all watch out for each other. I feel safe walking around alone at night (and I'm a young woman)."
College Freshman,5,Chestnut Hill area is safe and there are tons of little shops.  It just a few minutes outside of Philadelphia and is a great area.  It is a college town so they are very accepting of students.
College Freshman,5,"Chestnut Hill College offers a very large variety of majors and is a great place to go to school.  All classes are small, my largest one is only about 30 students.  The small class sizes means a lot of one on one time with the professors which is especially helpful for understanding material better.  There are plenty of quiet study areas to get away."
College Sophomore,5,"As a criminal justice major, I will like a internship that will expand my mind  about the world of criminal justice. I will like to do some criminal cases going to the jail or following the police officer just to overview what they are doing. I will love a pay internship but if not pay it ok I just want the experience"
College Senior,5,"Chestnut Hill College is all about academics.  This is not a party school and current students know this. If one is interested in parties, drugs, or alcohol, then this school is definitely not the place to attend; however, if one is all about the books, then Chestnut Hill is the place to grow."
College Senior,5,Getting in a particular program is relatively easy.  Many students at CHC just have to take a placement test then go from there.
College Senior,5,I've been at CHC for three years and have never notice any drugs or alcohol on campus. Seriously.
College Sophomore,5,"Just a short train ride away from Center City Philly, CHC is located in the upper west side of Philly in a perfectly quaint, friendly, and safe community."
College Senior,5,I received a good deal of federal student grants but have not received any financial aid from Chestnut Hill despite maintaining a 3.9 GPA.
Recent Alumnus,5,women at my college were very attractive and out going and smart.
College Junior,5,They are very generous with scholarships. Almost everyone gets a scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Chestnut Hill, even though being a Catholic college, really embraces the true practice of being spiritual as opposed to religious. The professors are both members of the clergy and lay people which brings much diversity to education. Every staff member I ever had the pleasure to be taught and mentored by was open with their religion and embraced each and every student with respect no matter what background, religious/ethnic, sexual orientation they were."
College Freshman,5,It doesn't. The campus is very small so when it rains its easy to access other buildings within the college.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy my time at Chestnut Hill College. I am a commuter since I live close by the school. I like my teachers and advisors.
Sophomore,4,I had to take online classes for my spring and summer semester. It is not fun at times but is manageable.
Works Here,4,The campus is located in the Wissahickon Park and besides the Morris Arboretum. A lot of individualized attention.
Senior,4,"They offer Adult Accelerated courses for working adults with daytime work schedules. There are some professors that are excellent at teaching their course and then the rest, not so much."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled at Chestnut hill and like what they have to offer when it comes to athletics, I would like for them to improve their physics department and to have more things around campus for students to enjoy."
Senior,4,"A small school that is looking to expand and continue to be a pivotal education hub in the Philadelphia community. A solid science department and growing communications, technology, and music departments have begun to create a university level of education at a small college. With one of the most scenic campuses in Philadelphia the only thing to make this school better would be more parking and better food services!"
Senior,4,"The financial aid department needs work, that is my only complaint. The student body and academic staff are wonderful and have really made going back to school in my 30s an easy and pleasant transition."
Graduate Student,4,"I've had an excellent experience at Chestnut Hill as a graduate student in the Clinical and Counseling Psychology program. The program has an excellent reputation in the area for turning out graduates who are extremely prepared to immediately begin working in the field. Many of my professors are practicing clinicians, and I find their direct experience to be very helpful in the classroom. I also love that CHC offers so many concentrations within the program- many more than any other graduate program I looked at!"
Sophomore,4,"I loved the size of the classes, you're able to make a connection with the teacher. It is easy to get around the campus and lots of resources to help you."
Junior,4,"I'm a new student at Chestnut Hill College. So far I have had some mixed feelings about the school. While the staff is great and you can tell they are truly invested in student success and the students are personable, it really does make for a good working environments, although is building do seem a bit dated and while I understand maintaining the integrity of the original architecture some updates in the older dorms would be new."
Freshman,4,What I like about chestnut hill college is that the college is small and great for people who want a better experience in classes. All your professors know you by name which is good. What needs to be improved is that they need to install smart boards in the classrooms because using chalkboards and white boards makes me feel like I'm in middle school.
Senior,4,"Chestnut hill is a small college and really gives you that Home-like feeling. You get to know your peers and professors a lot easier gaining a better relationship. The dorms are decent. Since it is small, living in the dorms is super convenient because you can wake up five minutes before class and be fine. The food is not very good and is available at odd times but to make up for it there are many places nearby, a lot that deliver as well. The school provides shuttles into town and to the mall/target. They are very understanding and giving with rides. The professors sometimes are not very good, seeming as if they lack knowledge. But that’s only in some cases as I personally feel I have had some wonderful teachers. Overall it’s a small cozy campus that is very easy to get used to and find your way around. There are many things to do around school and lots of connections for internships and jobs for after college. Chestnut hill does a lot to make up for the things it lacks."
Senior,4,"I am enrolled in the Accelerated Degree program at Chestnut Hill College for adult learners. After doing three years at another university, I was pleasantly surprised at how many of my credits transferred over. The program is excellent as it provides flexibility with it's wide variety of courses offered and different locations. However, it is fast paced; each semester is split into two sessions-running eight weeks at a time. Chestnut Hill college even offers Summer I and Summer II for accelerated students making it even more convenient for working adults who have so many things to juggle to obtain credits.   The staff is very welcoming and helpful and it gives the feel of a close knit family. Although, it is a Catholic institution, it is a very inclusive environment.  I highly recommend this college especially for adults and transfer students."
Senior,4,"I would like to see more on line classes. The professors are great,  and help is available if needed. The campus is. In a positive environment  that will motivate all incoming Freshmans."
Junior,4,I am now attending CHC and I am enjoying myself. But I am also still learning the school & all it has to offer.
Sophomore,4,For people like myself who like small schools chestnut hill is the perfect size. The diversity is huge there's people from all around the world attending. Most of the professors i've had have been quite pleasant and make me look forward to go to class. They have so much for their students anything you need help with they have someone to help you.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Chestnut Hill College and my overall experience so far has been great. I prefer to go to rather small schools because I thrive better in such environments; therefore, the small class sizes at CHC really help me focus on my education and give me the opportunity to engage with the professors when I have questions or concerns. CHC is in a prime location - it's close to local shops and eateries and just a short train ride away from Center City, Philadelphia. The dorms are pretty nice, especially Fitzsimmon's Hall, the newest housing building. The one thing I would like to see change, though, is diversity on campus. It's been an ongoing issue in the school; however, administration is making steps in the right direction. Additionally, it would be nice to see more vegetarian and vegan options in the cafeteria, but overall the food is decent."
Freshman,4,Chestnut Hill College is a small faith based college. My first impression was the staff are so friendly and I love the beautiful campus. The small classes makes the learning experience intimate between the students and the professors. Which to me  makes it easier for students to be more active the their learning experience.
Freshman,4,"Chestnut Hill College makes you feel as if you are home. Compared to other colleges, you are not just a number. The professors want to see their students succeed despite only having them for a semester. They also will help you in your career path by taking your resume and giving it to their colleagues. The campus is beautiful, but it is small compared to other colleges. Even though it is a small college the college community comes together and gives it a huge heart. However, the food could be better. They do give you a variety of choices, but the quality could be improved. The dorm buildings could also be improved. The cable in the dorm building has been out for months and the RAs could do a better job."
College Freshman,4,Have not had any experience with drugs on campus
College Freshman,4,"I am not involved with athletes, however they seem great."
College Student,4,"Living on this campus was my favorite thing a bout school, all of the buildings are great."
College Junior,4,The career center is always on the lookout for jobs
College Junior,4,I have had great and poor professors
College Sophomore,4,I love the courses that are offered it is a very wide variety.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes and the personal help that I receive from my professors
College Sophomore,4,Most of the students are really focused on their education
College Sophomore,4,"I like my school because it is a small setting. Therefore, I do not have a difficult time locating my classes. I also love the professional studies accelerated program it works for me being a full time mom and employee full time."
College Freshman,4,I play softball at Chestnut Hill  College and I noticed all the sports teams tend to hang out with one another and it is a neat experience. The baseball and tennis teams at the school are very good and went to the championships for the league. There is a lot of school spirit at the games.
College Freshman,4,"I love the people at chestnut hill, they make everyone feel welcomed and help everyone. The school's atmosphere is great and I enjoy everything about to community."
College Sophomore,4,"CHC can be very cliquey. Other than that, I really love it."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience was amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the schools inability to stay on top of things. When it came to certain things about classes and tuition there was a complete disconnect and miscommunication between the directors and the students.
College Freshman,4,I got the aid I needed and so far haven't had to take any loans out or cripple myself financially in order to get through school.
College Sophomore,4,Depending on what you want to eat you can stop at a variety of restaurants. There is also GrubHub to place orders and get take out.
College Sophomore,4,Usually parties happen on thursday since most students don't have a friday class. The parties varies as it depends on who you want to hang out with.
College Sophomore,4,With campus housing there are many options to choose from when you are done freshman year. If you have four to six friends that you want to live with then you would go to Fitzsimmons. If you want to live in a single then you would go to Fournier. If you want to live in a double then you have the option of Fournier or Sugarloaf. Fitzsimmons and sugarloaf has an ac/heating unit in the room while in Fournier you only have heating since it is an old building. Fournier you have communal bathrooms while in Fitzsimmons and Sugarloaf you have a private bathroom that you share with your roommates.
College Freshman,4,There's a great variety of food to choose from. They are expensive but they haven't r great food around town
College Freshman,4,I am almost never on campus because I am a commuter but I have a late class that doesn't let out until seven. I feel safe and secure all the time.
College Freshman,4,"It's quiet at CHC, but that is a perk I think. A school great for those devoted to their studies, while looking to have a great college experience."
College Freshman,4,I really like it here.
College Freshman,4,"They offer a lot of athletic scholarships here and the acceptance rate is high, but overall I think CHC is a great college for those who prefer a small community."
College Freshman,4,"I live in a dorm hall that is actually connected to the school itself. This is great for when it's raining, snowing, cold, etc,. Also great if I return to my dorm late at night, it will never be a dark walk back."
College Freshman,4,"I received a $13,500 annually awarded academic scholarship from CHC. Including other grants and loans, only about $6,000 is left for my family to contribute to paying."
College Freshman,4,Not too shabby for college food.
College Freshman,4,"CHC is rather strict, seeing how it is in fact a private Catholic college."
College Freshman,4,"For a small, quiet campus, CHC is full of friendly students and helpful professors and people."
College Senior,4,The school  is perfect in its aesthetics
Recent Alumnus,4,All  the places are very good.
College Junior,4,Everywhere is clean and has hours of operstion . For the most part everything is convientiant except the lunch room hours for those that stay on campus. Although you can go to the another place sometimes you want the lunch room around 830
College Junior,4,the atmosphere is small and friendly and easy to get around campus
College Junior,4,Its a safe and good living enviorment
College Junior,4,transportation is great and it is very easy to get around
College Junior,4,good amount of all mixture
College Junior,4,the facilities are great and I enjoyed a new sport  last semester
College Junior,4,I enjoyed my time on campus
College Freshman,4,campus is in a good location
College Freshman,4,I like the small campus atmosphere
Recent Alumnus,4,"The social atmosphere is great at the school. Because it is such a small community, everyone knows each other and are pretty friendly."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most of the professors are very helpful. The curriculum is like any school. The registration process is pretty quick. Workload can be pretty overwhelming at times but I like it. We are really big on research and presentations. I guess it is good to an extent. We can come out as well-rounded students. Public speaking however, is pretty nerve-recking."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel pretty safe walking around campus.
Sophomore,2,"I enjoyed being around the students and faculty but the school was just way too small for me. The entire school is one large building, not all outside sports get to play games on campus because we do not have enough on campus fields. The food in the cafeteria is very bad besides the salad bar and sometimes when the sandwich line is open. Overall my experience here was not great and I feel as though major advancements need to be made around campus, the residence halls, the food, and the athletics for students to attend and stay for the full four years."
Sophomore,2,"Chestnut Hill College is a waste of money. If you worked hard in high school, please do not waste your hard earned money or time here. There is no diversity whatsoever and there are alot of out of state students. There is also nothing to do unless you have a car. Students don't care about class, so you'll probably sit in silence for the whole duration of your classes. If you live on campus, the RA's will make having fun a living hell. The food is disgusting and complaining to the head of the dining staff at the college wont change anything.  Security does nothing but play on their phones all day and gossip with students. This school has a serious problem with handling rape, assaults, and harassment. I would not reccomend this school to any minority, as the predominantly white population wont include you in their activities. P.s, the party scene is lame, and you have to be an athlete or ""cool"" enough to find out about them."
College Freshman,2,Basketball is D2 but the football team is sprint football. Women's sports do not get as much recognition as men's.
College Freshman,2,"I honestly do not understand how people have given such high ratings for this school. I suppose if you were a commuter, this would be a good school considering the professors are decent. Living on campus is a nightmare. For the first two weeks, the sink in my room would clog and overflow with brown/green sewage that smelled AWFUL. Considering the price of this school, I honestly had much higher standards. I will not be returning Fall 2016."
College Junior,2,I needed help and I mean my parent lost job and all they did was say oh I hope things work out and you can get a loan to pay off your balance. Even asking for assistance and help it was stated no nothing at this time.
College Student,2,Not too many non-white students.
College Student,2,No parties; no guests after 2am... dry.
College Senior,2,"There are little to no internships offered within the sciences on campus, so you will have to find one on your own. While some professors will try and help you, if you don't get one, you can't graduate."
College Freshman,2,Students who are interested in partying always go off campus
College Sophomore,2,"I have work so the dining schedule is not convenient in any matter. If you miss their hours you just pretty much lost a meal you paid for, and no reimbursement at all. There is not meal plan options only one 19 per week for year!!"
College Sophomore,2,"I feel most of guys on campus are sports related, and they seem to narcissi and egotistical. They also flaunt themselves like they own the world, and it is utterly repulsive and irritating."
College Freshman,2,There are areas for off campus housing but it can be extremely difficult to find a place willing to let a student from the college live.  It is usually a hassle and is better just to live on campus.  There is virtually no price difference between the two.
College Freshman,2,"Food is average. I eat off campus a lot which tends to get expensive.  A specific meal plan was assigned to me since I am a freshman, so I will probably look into a different meal plan next year."
College Junior,2,"CHC parking leaves a lot to be desired. If you want a decent spot then you should probably get to campus a half hour before your class. Not only is the parking lot small  but it is also located at the bottom of a hill, which makes it difficult for the days family is supposed to visit, and near a river which occasionally floods."
College Senior,2,"Off-Campus housing can be a little stressful as one looks for housing.  Furthermore, the price is a little expensive. It would be miles better to just live in the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,If it rains a lot or snows a lot school gets canceled since many people live off campus. The parking lot floods when it rains so they have to cancel class since there's no parking.
College Junior,2,"Limited Variety – Not alot of African Americans, which can make dating for people of that ethinicity very limited!!!!"
College Junior,2,In the winter snow and ice can become problematic being that campus is built on a hill. Not good for parking aor walking. Their avearge with cancelling classes.
College Freshman,2,Chestnut Hill is an expensive place to get a house or apartment. A lot of students that live off-campus move 20 minutes away from school to a less expensive area. The house are affordable there but it is a struggle getting to class if you don't have a car.
College Freshman,2,"Food on the Hill – Food at Chestnut Hill is very simple. There are only two places on campus to eat either the caf or the griffins den. After awhile you will get sick of the food, but there are a lot of places to order from off campus. The menus change daily so the variety is ok. There is only one meal plan for students which makes things easy. I would suggest bringing a lot of mircowavable food."
Junior,1,"it’s just an awful school stay away. the food is terrible the school security does not care for the students neither do the teachers the dorms are disgusting. they have no central air in the summer time so it gets ridiculous hot and the heating system barely comes on during the winter time. the rooms have nasty bugs and trash in them. you pay 50K a year and can’t even park on the lot and the dining areas are never open during the breaks or weekends especially knowing that students stay here during those times. this school is old, yes. but they have the money to refurbish it and make changes to meet their tuition cost and the comfortability of their students"
College Student,1,I wish we had this
College Freshman,1,"Chestnut Hill College is like high school, it is very cliquey and there is a lack of diversity among the student population. Many times my account statement was incorrect forcing me to pay an extra $5000 because the finance department forgot to factor in major expenses. Chestnut Hill College looks good on paper until you actually experience the mess that is CHC."
College Sophomore,1,"My best friend, sister, and I all attend Chestnut Hill we have not yet experienced any type of peer pressure involving drugs and or alcohol."
College Student,1,"I'm still going through iussues from Aug.,here in April"
College Sophomore,1,"There is too much importance for the athletes before those who are struggling to succeed. They get access to class selection along with seniors due to ""practice,"" and teachers have to adjust for almost anything at their whim."
College Senior,1,It snows very often here and the campus is hard to access when the weather is bad.
College Freshman,1,CHC is basically A white school with a few minority.
College Freshman,1,Its very boring not much to do but that's not the school fault it the students. so pick friend wisely and you will have a blast
College Junior,1,"Around 11:00 and some of the other busy times of the day, there are not enough parking spots for all the students.  Either you end up circling the parking lot five or ten times waiting for someone to leave, or you have to park on the Sugarloaf campus and catch the shuttle back.  Sometimes when there's a big storm, the parking lot floods and they close the school. Parking permits are only $5.00 though."
College Senior,1,"PARKING IS LOCATED DOWN IN THE VALLEY AS I CALL IT, YOU MUST WALK UP A LONG HILL TO GET TO CLASS FROM WHERE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PARK.  I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS DIFFERENT FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO LIVE ON CAMPUS, BUT FOR US THAT COMMUTE, THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO GO ARROUND.  THE  PRICE TO PARK ON CAMPUS SHOULD ALLOW YOU A CLOSER MORE CONVENIENT PLACE TO PARK.  JUST MY OPINION"
College Senior,1,"Take the Bus! There is only one parking lot available for students and it is at the bottom of the hill. You have to walk very far to get to each class and there are a lot of stairs so wear sneakers. I am a commuter student so I was allowed to park, but I don't even think you are allowed to be blessed with a terrible spot if you are a freshmen. 
Oh, did I mention that they require you to get a parking permit that costs 100 dollars a semester!!!??! I did purchase one for my first semester there but I talked to a few students who said they never had a problem with out one. I would say take the risk of a 30 dollar ticket to waive the 100 dollar  fee every semester. (but don't tell them that)"
College Junior,1,This will be my second time graduating from the school and I have never heard or seen anything pertaining to Greek life!
College Junior,1,"I am an African American female and the school mainly caters to Causcasians, in reference to their social acativities, fraternities and sorrorities etc."
College Junior,1,"Students have to pay and parking spaces for students are VERY LIMITED, they cater more to staff!!!!"
College Freshman,1,"There is very little parking on campus, and as a result, neither freshmen nor sophomores are allowed to have cars on campus. There is a park across campus where students can park, but it fills up very quickly."
College Freshman,1,Needs Improvement – Just hope it doesn't rain because the parking lots actually end up flooding. Even though the school is small parking availability can still be an issue.
College Sophomore,1,there is no greeklife chc does not have frats or sororities
Recent Alumnus,1,they seriously need to fix the parking lot area .. there are so many pot holes!!
College Freshman,1,"There is very little parking, the on campus roads are narrow and hard to negotiate. The parking lot available for students often floods during heavy rainstorms. It is hard to get to places like supermarkets and drugstores without a car.  Public transportation is expensive and not very good."

But, I must say being the first in my family to attend a University to achieve my degree at first was a terrifying, and now I am facing that  the last 2 semesters are not covered by my student loan and it has become very stressful for me in order to complete my dreams.

College Junior,5,"South University Goes Above and Beyond! Although many private colleges recieve poor reviews because of the lack of qualified Professors, I was thoroughly suprised with South University, Tampa.  The school goes above and beyond for preparing you for your degree.  Their teachers and staff are highly qualified and most all Professors have at least their Ph.D.!  The workload for online courses is immense and rigorous.  They have done this to make up for the lack of one on one teaching experience.  It is also an excellent way to ensure that you are more than prepared for your job in the real world!  The school is excellent along with their facilities.  Job opportunities are great because almost all places in Tampa know how well the school prepares their students!"

College Freshman,5,"Most of the classes I need to take are online. The program I am in is new, so therefore there are not enough students to have campus classes yet. But, Given all that, My Director said that If there were only 4 students and we all wanted to take our classes at the school, he would teach them himself! Can't get any better than that!"
College Freshman,5,"South University is one of the friendliest and most helpful collages/universities that I have applied for.

Freshman,4,South university Tampa is a really nice school. The staff is very helpful for the most part and extremely friendly! They offer tutoring and even one on one with certain professors. I like that we go by quarters and that it’s new and refreshing every 11 weeks ! It goes fast and it’s totally worth it ! Lots of programs to choose from and hands in learning ! I would like to change one thing... the snack machines lol they are the worst ! But luckily the art institute is on the other side and they have a student lounge with more food options !
Senior,4,"I have attended South University for three years majoring in psychology.  The school is small, but that is what makes it so nice.  Faculty and staff are always available to students.  An example of how attentive the university is can be found in the following anecdote.   A student was unable to attend graduation ceremonies the previous week.  The staff actually staged a mini commencement just for the student.  That is praiseworthy!"

College Junior,4,It's very user friendly and very organized.
College Junior,4,It was easy transferring credits.

College Junior,4,I like the size of the classes. It's easy for students and professors to interact and for the other students to follow. I would say the quality of courses is similar to other great schools.

College Senior,4,A lot of the students at my college are nice and friendly.
College Senior,4,With the online course you can log in at any time and save money on gas
College Senior,4,"Nursing program requires for all pre-reqs to be done before applying into the nursing program. Once applied, clinicals will begin and workload will double."
College Senior,4,All my professors by far are great! They go through everything step by step and if you have a question or don't understand something they're more than willing to help out.
Recent Alumnus,4,all resources are great they are always readily available to help out whenever needed.
Recent Alumnus,4,I believe that the classes that I will be attending will be great because of the size of each class. normally the more students ina class the more serious they are to learn.

College Senior,4,"Student center and library are great, printing is at no cost which is always a plus."
College Senior,4,"The professors love to teach and want the students to learn, but there is a lot of work and is very time consuming."
College Senior,4,"I am currently only a freshman, however I am doing very well and I a very motivated."
College Senior,4,"The school so far has offered many opportunities to study with my teachers which has been very helpful. The classes that I have taken thus far have been helpful for the process, I currently only a freshman and have a long way to go."

College Senior,4,I have been able to make selections for classes that work well with my work schedule.
Recent Alumnus,4,"For the majority of all my classes was in the evening for the exception of a few, but it was good over all."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Everyone their are very professional, your known by your name. Classes are a perfect size were if your having a hard time understanding a subject or the session being discuss at the moment the professors will elaborate more so you and the class can learn the material. It the quality of knowledge that all these professors have that makes it good to participate in the classes to learn, so when your out in the field your knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,4,Both the online library and on-ground library are resourceful.
College Freshman,4,I have had a really great experience this far and I am very excited to start my classes next month. I love that this school has smaller class sizes and typically when I start my program all of the same students I start with will be going through the whole program together.
College Freshman,4,I believe the value of my education here outways the high tuition costs. It will not be easy for me to pay these high out of pocket fees but I will work hard to get it done because a great education is worth it.
College Freshman,4,They seem to have wonderful opportunities for internships at several different hospitals. They even have internships at a hospital near me in St. Petersburg.
College Freshman,4,"I can only partially answer this question. I have not yet had the opportunity to interact with professors or deal with the workload yet. However, The class registration process was a breeze and my student advisor helped me with a schedule that will work well for me."
College Freshman,4,This is a private school and there is not a lot of athletic centers other than that the campus is great.
College Freshman,4,"I am very new to my school and will begin classes on June 30, 2014. I am very excited to start taking classes. So far the process of applying to the schoool and applying for financial aide has been very easy. The admissions office staff have been very easy to deal with and are extremely helpful."
Alum,2,"Expensive - financial aid office does not accurately inform students of expenses and are selective in who they assist in obtaining financial aid. 
It took more than 2 years to get them to send my diploma.
Changing expectations based on frequent fluctuating leadership and inconsistent standards based on the professors' student preference."
College Junior,2,"Very expensive, however was advised of the cost beforehand."
College Senior,2,"I believe that my tuition is too high, I'm going to school for nursing and will finish with a 50K loan."
College Sophomore,2,"For an eleven week semester, $6500 is a little over the top for 12 credit hours. I paid $5000 per semester to go to a reputable college with traditional semesters for 12 credit hours. Personally, my Financial aid advisor at this institution has been less than helpful."
College Sophomore,2,The only resources available are a limited Tutoring center and a limited library shared with another college. Overall aesthetics are quite boring and dry.
College Junior,2,The financial aid department is not helpful for students having issues getting loans. They do not give help getting grants or scholarship they hand out an outdated packet where half he scholarships are not valid.
College Junior,2,Communication Is Key – Some professors are easy to communicate with while others are more difficult to get ahold of even via email.  That lack of communication with certain professors make some classes more difficult than others to understand what the professor wants from the online syllabus in comparison to traditional classroom professors.
College Junior,2,I can not comment on this manner as of yet due in part that I have not graduated or looked for employment. I happen to work with three alumni at the university which has be great.
College Sophomore,2,"Heavy Workload! I really didn't care for my online course.  The workload was too much.  The teacher would assign the class four assignments for that week, and we had a test every week.  We covered two chapters in one week, so it was very hard to memorize two chapters worth of information in one a week."
Recent Alumnus,2,EDUCATION IS EXPENSIVE – I'M GOING TO HAVE TO APPLY FOR MORE AID EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND IF I DON'T TRY TO GET SOME KIND OF GRANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS THEN I'M GOING TO BE IN HELLA DEBT BEFORE I'M 25
Recent Alumnus,1,"I prefer to be in a class setting, because if you may have questions it will be hard to try to understand it from another student, to me it is not the same. I prefer the professor teaching, this is why they are the professors."
College Senior,1,"I wish I would of gone somewhere else, much much cheaper."
College Senior,1,The online classroom to me is not up to par. It needs a lot of work.
College Senior,1,"Honestly, we do not have half of these things on this list, and we are one of the most expensive schools."
College Senior,1,Absolutely astronomically high costs to go to this school. Everything is an extra cost.
College Sophomore,1,No help with employment prospects. You need hands on experience.
College Sophomore,1,"They are good with explaining and sending documents to sign, but you can't get a stipend but they make sure they get paid."
College Senior,1,"I have had many problems with the Financial Aid department at South.  First, they were not very helpful in the beginning with starting my aid.  Then, I was not told that they were going to charge $900 more for classes that they knew I was taking.  Next, they are not very helpful in finding extra financial assistance since I already have my bachelor's degree and just blew me off.  Last, I was not told that my financial aid did not cover my whole program, which is 5 quarters, but that it was only going to cover 3 quarters and that I needed to figure out how to pay another almost $12,000 by March 2014."
Recent Alumnus,1,NO Help – The financial aid office at this school is terrible their best advice is to put you on a ridiculous payment plan that you can never afford and then call and harass you for the payment instead of sitting down with you and helping find other options. you are on your own here.
Recent Alumnus,1,No Support – On the schools website page they claim that they are for the working person. I am a nursing student and at the end of my quarter I went into labor with my first child no support was offered I was not giving anytime off I had my baby on  Wednesday I was released from the hospital on a Friday and had to be to school Monday for my finals I was placed on probation after that quarter for receiving a C!
Recent Alumnus,1,The financial aide office is not very resourceful South University is a private school and is very expensive. Once they get you in the door they are not very helpful in making sure that you succeed.

Senior,5,My experience at Hiwassee College was awesome from the very first day. Coming from a different state I thought I would be alone and was a little nervous. The Hiwassee family made sure I felt secure and welcomed. Everywhere I turned there was smiling faces and people willing to help all around. The feeling of having someone when moving to a new place made it so much easier. I believe there is nothing Hiwassee College could change because they have an amazing family.
Sophomore,5,"Since enrolling at Hiwassee College, I have come to find that the professors and other faculty members to be very helpful; whether it is with questions with homework assignments or anything going on in your personal life they are willing to offer advice and support for you in every way possible. If you learn better in smaller classroom settings, Hiwassee College is great. I have really enjoyed getting to attend this college and the learning environment is great!"

College Junior,5,The classes are small so you always have time with your professors. The professors are always their to help you in any way they can
College Junior,5,"My major is Physical Therapy so you have to take the core classes first and mostly science classes and they are challenging, which is good because I learn a lot."

College Freshman,5,The class is well taught. The subject is well explained and interesting. The teacher of the class interacts well with the students and makes the class fun and interactive.
College Junior,5,"Being a christian school, the spiritual aspect has helped bring me closer to God."
Sophomore,4,"I love Hiwassee!  It is so small, and the professors really care about their students.  Here I am a person, not a number.  The only drawbacks are the cost of attendance and the buildings are really old and outdated."
Sophomore,4,I love Hiwassee College because it is located in a peaceful place which makes it easy to be focused on campus. I also love the family atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,Hiwassee is a older college with many plans to revise the campus. The small student body makes it feel more like a family. Staff and facility have the opportunity to work one on one with there students.
College Junior,4,I feel like this school works with you. I work a lot so I can definitely schedule my classes around work and my job is really good about scheduling around classes. I have never had a problem with any of these situations
College Junior,4,This school helps you out with pretty much whatever you need. They are willing to talk with you about all your problems and help out as much as they can
College Senior,4,I am in a special program for a job.
College Freshman,4,Smaller classes and air of the classes are shared by the same teachers
College Freshman,4,All the faculty and staff really care about my education and are willing to go out of their way to help students in any way they can
College Freshman,4,"I initially chose this school because I got an offer to play baseball, but the amount of knowledge I have gained living on my own and being away from home is priceless. I have matured and been through situations that are going to help me later in life. A lot of these learning points came outside of that classroom as well. It is amazing how these kind of things work."
College Freshman,4,"I am an athlete here which means during a big chunk of the school year I stay busy with practice and games. During this time frame its hard to be on campus for a lot of classes all the time. Thanks to online classes I don't have to lower my hours or be excused from class, I can enroll online for my hours and complete them at my pace anywhere baseball has me at the time. Very convenient."
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is great here and do a lot for graduates. Also our advisers really work hard in letting us know what our options are for after we graduate. There are a number of on campus career activities that give students multiple opportunities to become successful.
College Freshman,4,"The criminal justice system here is great. My adviser, who is also my professor in some of my classes, really works hard on making the program fit what I want and need. My major is shaped around all the aspect of education I am needing to graduate and become successful in my career field."
College Junior,4,its good but not great!
College Junior,4,An associates degree is perfect to get at Hiwassee
College Junior,4,"i wish we had newer books, and more recent sources"
College Junior,4,For a time our accreditation was bad but students still went and struggled along with the school to bring them back. Because of this teamwork and hard efforts we built a better stronger foundation for our school.
College Junior,4,I have loved going to the financial aid for helpful advice and for a friendly conversations. I believe my education is worth more than any amount of money and the financial aid is there to make sure i am able to have my education
College Freshman,4,The academic experience is straight forward. The professors teach what is needed and explain what you need to always remember.
College Freshman,4,The financial aid moves smoothly and as fast as possible with the help of the student's availability.
College Freshman,4,a lot of the students that attend this school can be a little over dramatic and hard to deal with at times. overall the other students are really nice and can be easy to get along with. it really depends on who you are dealing with.
Niche User,2,"As a parent of a former student we didn’t have a good experience at Hiwassee. I don’t have a problem at all that the dorms are older but the campus and the dorms are falling into a state of disrepair. Communication is horrible even though my student signed the form to let us find out information on any aspect of college information. The price is astronomical and some of the online professors are in California and don’t respond to questions the student may have.  Each of the staff members not only does their job but is also expected to perform at least two other jobs all for the same pya. That is nearly impossible to do that and do any of the jobs well. They also do not offer many choices of majors for students.   A LOT of work on the campus, communication and education needs to take place at Hiwassee."
Sophomore,2,I'd like to see Hiwassee get more involved with its community in order to get more community support for clubs and athletic programs.
College Freshman,2,"I am not a high maintenance person by no means, but my school was established in 1849 and a lot of our campus resources look like they have not been altered since then. I love it here don't get me wrong, but for a private school charging me over twenty thousand dollars tuition I really wish some upgrades would be made."
College Junior,2,"For the type of school, the environment, its not good at all."
College Senior,2,Tuition is slightly expensive for the education and the facilities.
College Senior,2,My college does not have a career center. Alumni works hard to stay in contact with their alums.
College Senior,2,There are not an abundance of classes to take and they are just now offering more online classes and night classes. A frustration I've had was not being able to get in the program that I was accepted into because of scheduling conflict. And a few weeks for graduation I had to take on a class because my advisor was unaware that I needed that course.
College Senior,2,One thing about my school is that the professors care very much about their students. Considering the campus is small  and so is the community it's very easy to get help. The social scene needs a lot of help a long with the campus life. People do not like to participate in campus activities. The facilities need upgrades.
College Junior,2,They do not offer a chemistry major
College Freshman,1,We just recently got a new Financial Aid supervisor and she has succeeded in screwing up most of my financial aid.

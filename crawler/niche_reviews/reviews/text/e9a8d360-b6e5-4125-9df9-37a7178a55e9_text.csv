Junior,5,"There hasn't been one class yet that has failed to instill it's knowledge within me, in one way or another. Even the classes that don't necessarily coincide with my major, Deaf Studies, have been taught in such a way that I can find a link between them. I look forward to furthering my education, though I will be sad to wave goodbye to such a grand institution."
Alum,5,I took almost all my classes online except the few they didn't offer. I loved having the opportunity to do it at my own pace.
Senior,5,Loved this school!! You learn and enhance your skills to better create a professional portfolio for your major.
Senior,5,"Very easy to understand for others, but it depends on the individuals who are able to learn their subjects through online learning."
Sophomore,5,"I began my academic journey at Antelope Valley College (AVC) in Fall 2017. My experiences here has helped me to uncover my passions and interests towards my major: Biological Sciences. I have been involved in several activities and have undertaken various classes that has prepared me not only for the rigor of upper division courses, but also the realities of life itself. 
The honor's program at AVC is an amazing resource that has dramatically changed my life for the better. I have always sought to maximize my learning experience in all fields. As such, I’ve enrolled in a variety of honors courses ever since my first college semester, and have continuously done so for three years. Ranging from art, math, chemistry, physics, and beyond,  the honor's program has not only made me more academically competitive but has also bestowed me with valuable skills, knowledge, and a burning will to learn more."
Junior,5,"Most teachers here at AVC use online resources regularly. As as AVC student you will adapt to this quickly, as moving online because of a situation like this was smooth and would continue to be smooth"
Junior,5,Been a student for almost 3 1/2 years and for the most part I have had a really good experience. Staff tries to help however they can. There are many opportunities available if you just stay focused and seek them out.
Junior,5,"Online experience has been easy to understand. Professors are responsive. Especially now since the curriculum is an online platform for everyone. There has been a lot of changes taking place, but they make it easy to follow. There is support here for the students in every area needed."
Sophomore,5,I took classes online and I would recommend using rate my professor because there are some really good professors but there’s also some that don’t care about their students as much as others
Sophomore,5,This college is pretty good for students wanting to not spend that much money before they transfer to a university! If you do your work and focus on your studies then you should be out in 2 year or maybe 3 depending on your major!
Sophomore,5,"I was a student athlete at Antelope Valley College and I liked the resources that were able to help me succeed as a collegiate athlete. The college understands that students have many things going on in their lives and they provide the students with such great help in the academic area(tutoring, counselors, library, etc...). The coaching staff were phenomenal as well and really care for any needs that you have because they understand the adversities one may face while getting an education."
Sophomore,5,I like Antelope Valley College they are very interested in the students education. Not only that the teachers are very excellent in their teaching skills. Not only that they give students the opportunties to explore how they are as indivduals.
Sophomore,5,"Pretty Good place, teachers are relaxed and very helpful. The campus is on a open area and there is construction going to happen. Only wished they had more food to offer other than the cafeteria and Subway."
Freshman,5,"I had so much fun there. I'm trying to go back to finish my degree. I learned a lot, but used up my financial aide. Now I'm not sure if ill be able to return."
Niche User,5,I have been attending Antelope Valley College for 4 years and High school at the same time. I will be receiving transferable credits so I can attend the university of my choice. Antelope Valley college is a very good university and they offer a lot for it to be a 2 year university. It prepares you for a 4 year and they are very hands on with helping with what you need.
Freshman,5,"Over all it is a very nice college, i have never had a problem and any time I have a question there is always someone there to help you.

Parking price is also excellent and the spots to park too! There is plenty of parking spots for everybody and the also have motor mike parking spots for students or anybody that owns a motor bike."
Alum,5,"Antelope Valley College is a really good junior college to attend.  It is small and really easy to get around.  Classes are all walking distance, and the campus is really nice to walk around!  My experience with the teachers were excellent.  There are a lot of classes, so it is really easy to fit school into your schedule.  Counselors really listen to you and they try to help you out as best as they possible can.  The atmosphere is great, and the food is not bad.  There are a lot of clubs and activities to do around the campus.  It is not too expensive either!  I definitely recommend the school and I'm very glad I attended!"
Freshman,5,"The things that I like of AVC is the diversity in the campus, student life, programs, safety. and campus food."
Sophomore,5,"Antelope Valley College is a great community college if you ask me. They offer a lot of help to their students. They have a lot of benefits as well. I have been going there for three semesters now. The food they have on campus is good as well. They have a Subway on campus, and they also have a cafeteria that serves different kinds of food if you do not like Subway. The campus and the area around the college are safe and have security guards driving and walking around campus."
Freshman,5,"Antelope Valley College is very inexpensive to attend (at around 19k dollars for 2 years), especially with financial aid. AVC professors care greatly about students' success and well-being. Important AVC facilities such as Student Services and the Office of Student Disabilities are in close proximity to each other, which I find good."
Freshman,5,"I like how diverse and accepting the school is. The professors show how much they care each and every day. I feel like my education is really important due to the value that my teachers pass on. I would like to see more involvement, more events and more transfer ready programs."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time here, even with all of its ups and downs. I'd be happy to take more classes in the future."
Freshman,5,My experience at AVC has been nothing but positive. The faculty have helped me through my college journey and I am excited to say that I will soon be graduating and moving forward to my career dream. I will be forever thankful that AVC and my counselor has given me the opportunity to strive for my major and look forward to a bright future.
Alum,5,"Antelope Valley College is FULL of great people and students. Most of the teachers really want you to learn the subject and are more than happy to help you achieve that. Also, they are very nice and aren't mean or condescending (well, MOST of them). I do wish that they'd make a better effort for the Computer Science department, starting by having an actual Computer Science staff member run it as opposed to a Business staff member/"
Junior,5,"AVC is definitely the best option for locals trying to further themselves. There is an expansive amount of academic programs for any major, and numerous connections for people trying to land careers in the medical and STEM fields. Upon that AVC has lively performing arts and music programs, that enjoy hosting live events often. I personally am pleased to be a part of this college with its diverse group of students and faculty. I am excited to further my education in my field and I thank AVC for giving me the education I need to do so."
Junior,5,"Antelope valley has an overall homey feel to the college. i am a part of the athletics program and through the athletics program the coaches and counselors made my transition from hawaii to california a breeze. They helped me find a living space, get settled even went out of their way to deal with many other things for me."
Freshman,5,"Antelope Valley College has a beautiful campus and provide students with every opportunity to succeed. The college has an extremely diverse and friendly environment that can help individuals feel accepted, allowing them to excel in academics to the best of their capabilities. This college has a positive atmosphere which is why I admire it as a prestige college."
Junior,5,"It is a decent school where you are able to get credits to transfer to a university. It is a great opportunity to prepare yourself for the workforce and to create new connections because you do not have to be far from home. You can still not be far from home and still get a good education, at least, that is the case for me."
Graduate Student,5,"AVC provided me an affordable opportunity to begin college. I had many great professors during my time there and made many new friends. As part of the honors program, and being a dedicated student, my education at AVC helped me gain admission to UCLA."
Graduate Student,5,"I just finished my last semester at Antelope valley college. I will be transferring to Cal State University, Bakersfield in the fall. Overall I had a great experience. Teachers  were very involved. They make sure all students have the tools they need in order to pass the classes. The staff there is also helpful. There are a lot of resources students can use. For example there are counselors, Express Counseling, a Transfer center, and a learning center. These resources really made my student life easier."
Niche User,5,"When I first arrived at Antelope Valley College, it was so that I could take my SAT. I arrived and I was led to the front desk. Everyone there was very helpful and kind. I felt like everyone was very friendly and I loved being in a place that felt like a safe environment. I have been at the college three times now and I have enjoyed my stay every time. It is not hard to get around because everything is labeled and there are signs all around. There are also many kind adults that are there to help you get to your destination around campus. Everywhere you go you receive kind smiles and helpful information. I would not change anything about the campus or the people on campus. The school is simply great, and even though I have not attended the school, I would love to."
Junior,5,"It is a great campus, always try to put there students ahead and give them the benefits they have to offer"
Freshman,5,"Overall, Antelope Valley Community College is a great one. Being a freshman entering college is like the first day of school all over again. You get lost right? Wrong. I knew where I was going, due to all the signs and directions, which are great by the way. There are times when I don't know and the faculty are amazing! Student workers as well, which shows more good parts on the faculty too. I would strongly recommend attending."
Senior,5,"My overall experience at Antelope Valley College has been excellent. The classes are good the people are friendly and the campus just looks amazing! One thing I would like to see change though is the size of the Palmdale campus. Having a bigger campus means more class rooms, and more opportunity for a better education!"
Freshman,5,"A great thing about AVC is the community. Everyone is pretty friendly despite classes at 8 am. The campus is big, offers many different courses, and includes a great SOAR program. It even has a cafe with amazing food they make in front of you!"
Junior,5,"I loved this college , they were all always so helpful. Great professors who taught me well. A close and United college."
Senior,5,"I have had a pretty good experience here at AVC. So far all of the teachers i have had have been a pleasure, the were there to help me and the other students when ever they could. If there are any bad teachers, I haven't heard of them."
Freshman,5,"There is always something going on on campus for all different social groups. Academic wise, you will be busy but hey! that's what we're signing up for right?"
Sophomore,5,Antelope Valley College is a great community college to attend. The staff at the school is amazing and extremely helpful. The teachers there want their students to learn and succeed and they offer a ton of resources to help their students thrive. I have learned so much attending AVC. The school has allowed me to grow as a student and adult. One thing I would like to see a change in is hopefully a small food court. I spend so much time on campus and subway is the only source of food that is near all my classes.
Junior,5,"The professors will go above and beyond to help you achieve your degree. The student workers and staff members are extremely helpful in enriching your college life at AVC and provide workshops to all students who are new and are unsure how to set up financial aid, select classes and more! The honor program run by John Vento is amazing, they ensure high education with the best professors and smaller classes to allow more time with struggling students. The honors program is a must to join when going to AVC as graduating with 6 honor classes can increase your chances of getting into universities such as UCLA and other participating schools."
Freshman,5,The staff and students are very courteous and helpful towards everyone. I just wish there were more morning and once a week classes.
Sophomore,5,This is my first year at antelope valley college. I am currently registered in the nursing program and I could not be any happier. The health and science building is so beautiful and state of the art. The staff in the main office are efficient and very nice as well. They answer all my questions and are so willing to help.
Freshman,5,"I am a new and proud student at Antelope Valley College. I just finished my first math class over summer and it was a great experience; the students in my class were kind and my teacher was caring and passionate about helping us. The campus is clean, staff is helpful, and there are a lot of resources offered at the school. I take night classes and I always feel safe walking around campus. I'm really looking forward to spending the next two years receiving an education at Antelope Valley and I'm excited to meet new people, join the honors program, and form new bonds."
Sophomore,5,AVC is a good classic community college experience at a VERY low price! I've learned a lot here and have really loved all my teachers.
Freshman,5,I love the this institution because the have so many resources. I have a learning disability and they have services to help me with that. The job placement center is awesome in helping students find work.
Freshman,5,Antelope Valley College is an amazing college. With an amazing RN program. It has a lot of helpful programs. The campus is great and easy to get around. The academics are amazing lots of majors. Not much of a party scene. Campus food is pretty good. The professors are great they go out of their way to help you out and actually pass their class.
Freshman,5,"I am a current student attending Avc, i am enjoying my overall experience as a student, i am 26 years old but have decided to pursue a career in psychology education, i am fascinated with today's youth and also from personal experiences, i know how vital good positive mentorship is, in especially young adolescents as well as all individuals in society. The professors i have had the pleasure of meeting have all been very pleasant and very informative of there knowledge in the specific field of interests. i am truly enjoying my overall student experience which is even surprising to myself. AVC is a great college , and i am very pleased with my choice to enroll for a chance  to fufill my career dreams  and goals."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student here at my local community college. I am the first in my family to attend colleg. At first I was a bit frightened about college since I had no idea how things worked. Not just that, but I believed it was going to be a challenge for me to get through and actually understand how things worked. I've now been here at AVC for 3 full semesters and I've done both summer and winter courses and the professors I've taken classes with have been great! I also have the best counselor one could ask for, Dietra Jackson. She has been with me from day one. The campus also offers lots of help when one seeks for it. I am a student worker at the Job Placement office, I've been provided financial and academic help by EOPS, and I've also been provided financial help with books up to the point were I don't have to buy them, but borrow them by the BOOKS Help program. AVC has offered me lots of help and the experience I've held here so far couldn't have been any better!"
Niche User,5,"I loved both my professors. They were patient , knowledgeable and patient. What I did like was nothing at all. Had a great learning experience."
Niche User,5,I liked that you can transfer over to another college after four years. I also liked that they have on campus work for those who need a job.I also liked that the classes will help me prepare for what I need in the future
Freshman,5,"Friendly teachers, friendly environment, dedicated and excellent faculty, large amount of resources for students."
College Freshman,5,The relationship wit the teachers and everything in regards of school is the best.
College Freshman,5,The best of the best
College Freshman,5,The Staff is the best
College Freshman,5,"My experience at Antelope Valley College is the best experience, I love the way this college specially the staff helps you to get everything ready for the upcoming semester."
College Freshman,5,I am currently a student at SOAR high school wich is located on the AVC campus but am also a student at AVC  and I can strongly say that I do not feel or am I treated any differently then the other students. The teachers are passionate about what they are teaching and do there best to assure there students understand all that is being teached.
College Junior,5,"Courses are very hard to get into if you do not have a good registration date but once you are in it is a relief. So far, I have had great experiences in all of my courses. All of my professors have been very pleasant and passionate teachers that I have really enjoyed having. The overall class sizes that I have had are a pretty good size and it does not take away from the learning and the questions that are needed to be asked."
College Sophomore,5,"I never had a problem with registration or transferring any sort of credits, its easy to deal with and they'll help out a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"My professors are amazing, I have never had a problem. Class sizes are great, could be larger and the style and way things flow in the class room settings is just perfect."
College Senior,5,"The professors are the best part about this school. I have not had a bad teacher in 2 years at AVC. Of course the student has to put in some effort, but the professors really know their subject and are willing to share their ideas and their knowledge. They also offer office hours wherein which the student can meet them for one-on-one help."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at AVC was good. I liked the professors I had so far. The campus is very well taken care of and clean, I got a chance to meet some good peers to work with."
Junior,4,"Aside from the difficulties brought on by this pandemic, I have typically been very pleased with my classes and the professors who taught them. No more than two of my professors present themselves in less than what I would consider a ""professional veneer,"" though there were several technicalities that did persuade me to come to such a conclusion. All in all, I have been, as well as am currently, joyful my educational journey at this college! Go Marauders!!"
Freshman,4,The online experience is very interesting the diversity of how some professors teach has really opened my eyes. As I am starting the year I've realized that some educators don't even want to bother interacting through zoom or video call.
Freshman,4,"What I liked about AVC is how attentive the staff are. They go out of their way to help and direct any means possible. I love the teachers there although some should have retired a long time ago. Due to quarantine, I haven't really got a feel of the entire campus. Hopefully, for the upcoming year, I experience college to its fullest potential."
Alum,4,There are teacher here who really care about the students and making sure the succeed. Some students can be rude and disrespectful but other than that it is a good school.
Freshman,4,It was a good experience until COVID-19 hit.  I feel like fewer classes have been offered for summer 2020 & fall 2020.
Sophomore,4,"The professors at AVC are all very knowledgeable and creative, which has made this transition into an online learning experience predominantly smooth. We maximized our use of Zoom and Canvas, and brought along several other sites to supplement the professors' lectures. For instance, we were shown videos of laboratory procedures for our organic chemistry class, while for physics, we used simulators to effectively complete our labs as we would have normally done. However, although the lectures were conveyed very conveniently, it was a little difficult to get in touch with the professors if we ever had a question about a topic in class."
Junior,4,"This college will work for you if you work with them. If you are dedicated, driven and hard working you will succeed here. I will say, professors and administrators are not on your case to get your work done but if you reach out and ask for help, they will be more then willing."
Sophomore,4,My time at AVC has been a pretty good one. The teachers are good for the most part and do well to make it easy to get a grasp of  different subjects. The tutoring center is really helpful. Honestly if that wasn't there on campus I wouldn't have passed some of my classes. The only grip I have is with course textbooks and packets and buy backs. Some of them are cheap but a good portion of them cost any where between 100-150 dollars which is  ridiculous. Students shouldn't have to pay these extra high fees for just this one class per semester. My last grip is that after the semester is over and they do buy backs. The amount of money given back is so little that it feels like extortion at times if they change this up and gave more money back say at least 50% instead of 10% I wouldn't have a problem. Despite all that the rest of the school is great and easy for people to transition into.
Freshman,4,"There are some very good professors at this community college who really do want to make a difference in their students lives. The campus is easy to get around and the staff seems friendly enough. For someone who is there to get their degree at a cheaper cost that is close to home, I'd say this is a great option. I think the only improvements I'd like to see is a better system for class registration and more classes to choose from both online and in school because without priority registration it can be hard to get the classes you need to graduate on time."
Freshman,4,"Marine Corps vet here. I love this school, aesthetically the campus is very decent. Many of the professors I've had are extremely knowledgable and hard-working while providing a great education. Didn't expect to enjoy college this much after being out of high school for 4 years. I just wish America's educational system would pay for more of everyone's education at least at the community college level."
Freshman,4,"Antelope Valley College is overall a great college to start out before transferring. It provides students with an insight on the college life before transferring to another 4 year for most students. The counselors are helpful when it comes to discussing academic plans and what classes are needed for you to succeed in your specific major. Professors as well are happy to assist in a time when you need help in the class and are always open to questions. In accordance to academics, there are many activities that are being held on the campus to provide students with an opportunity  to become involved in the school."
Sophomore,4,"The college is pretty good. If you need help there’s so many resources to help you the campus security is super helpful and responsive. Academics is well, great nursing program."
Niche User,4,Antelope Valley College is a good community college. Good way to start off. Improves that could improve the school would be more student/community opportunities. More academics opportunities and a more helpful website/easier to navigate.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed most of the classes that I was enrolled in. Most of the professors are willing to help if you have questions.
Sophomore,4,The thing I like most about this college is how small it is compared to other colleges so it allowed me to get in more participation when it came to any of my college classes. I feel like many of my professors were very committed to making sure that their students understood what they were learning and were easy to talk to. This college also has a lot of online choices for classes which makes it easy for me to help out at home. The only thing I would change about this college is the safety since I am under the age of 18 and a female and there are a lot of men that go to this school who have indicated they want to go on a date even after knowing I am not of age.
Junior,4,I have been going to Antelope Valley College for 4 years now. My experience there has been great. The environment there is very nice. I like how the professors are always willing to help out and answers my questions when I need help. I like how this college is always willing to help their students succeed for their future by giving them the resources they need.
Sophomore,4,ACV is a diverse community college that offers great academics. It has changed my life in so many ways. I grew as a person and learned that education is the key to unlock potential and I thank AVC for wonderful professors that help me achieve what I currently have.
Sophomore,4,"Helpful teachers, great education. I been attending for two years and overall i have had a good expirence."
Sophomore,4,"I've been at antelope valley college since 2017. The things like is the most professors and the staff. Most my professors were nice and helpful as they wanted me to succeed, only a couple of my professors were awful, but I powered and passed. 

The staff is pretty helpful if you plan ahead. In my experience, making a counselor's appointment was quick depending on the day. 

The things I would like to change is the campus food. The food is too expensive and what I mean by that is back during the Spring of 2018, you could get a hot dog, fries and a Brisk for less than $5, now it can cost around $7."
Sophomore,4,Avc college is an amazing community college. The lecturers are committed to helping any willing student to succeed.
Freshman,4,The campus is a little small but it is beautiful. I also like the satellite centers they have because I do live a little far from the college but not from the palmdale center.
Freshman,4,The classes at AVC are usually very calm and easy to understand even Calculus. I have enjoyed my time and some of the classes are easier than the high school classes.  The only thing I would change about it is to give high schoolers more options for classes on their own campus.
Niche User,4,"Antelope Valley College is a somewhat smaller school with a variety of students and teachers. Ranging from young and old to different cultures and races, there is a good mix of students. The campus, although small, does hold some events for different clubs and informational things. If I were to change something, I would change the cafeteria grill. I would change it back to the company that previously ran it as it was cheaper."
Junior,4,"Antelope Valley College is a great place to start your college journey. They offer many programs, classes, and support systems. One thing is I feel like sometimes it is hard to contact the counseling offices, or sometimes that they are not all on the same page on giving information."
Sophomore,4,This school has so much to offer and is currently going through a transformation and bringing in more opportunities for its students. AVC now also offers two campuses the main being in Lancaster and the satellite school in Palmdale. The school has multiple majors available and the staff teaching the classes are phenomenal. The class sizes are small which give students more one-on-one interaction with the teacher. The growth and the development of the student is definitely felt by the staff on campus.
Freshman,4,My overall experience with Antelope Valley College has been very good. The student and professors have all been nice. The first day I struggled to find my way and the professors were kind enough to guide me to my classes. One time I got lost and a kind student went out of his way to help me. I was very thankful for that because I would have been super lost.
Sophomore,4,"Antelope Valley College is a wonderful place to kick-start your academic journey. Being that it is a 2 year institution for most programs, you save a great deal of money while enjoying a more intimate classroom setting. With smaller classes, you tend to learn on a deeper level and have greater access to professors that are more approachable and available than at a 4 year university. There are also many programs and extra curricular activities to get involved in covering a slue of differing interests. This college is going through a renovation to better meet the immediate community."
Sophomore,4,"Antelope Valley College continues to have a bad reputation because it is a community college. However, if the student is devoted to their studies and looks beyond the scope, opportunities knock everyday. The professors want to see the students succeed and some even go out of their way to assist in seeing you prosper. The stigma of not being exposed to a variety of opportunities is false at AVC. If you want internships, transfer advice, or even peer review, AVC provides all of that. From job experiences to rational professors, AVC works with you as long as the student vocalizes and is in search to experience all that is offered."
Sophomore,4,I've has experiences with amazing teachers who want you to succeed and will mentor you as you continue on with your education.
Junior,4,"It's an okay school a good community college but if you wish to pursue an education in something very specific it is hard doing at AVC, but they offer an overall good education."
Sophomore,4,AVC is a fantastic school with so much to offer. The faculty is helpful and the school has so many diverse students enrolled which adds to the quality of education you receive. I have loved my time at AVC and would recommend this school to anyone and everyone.
Freshman,4,What I like about Antelope Valley College is that it is close to home and it's and it's a good option for starting off with college.
Sophomore,4,"Antelope Valley College is underrated. People tend to look down on the institution because of the location or because its location. Although the students tend to be negative, the instructors and resources are very helpful. I feel as though my perspective on the college has definitely become more positive in comparison from when I had first arrived. The instructors may be very inspirational, and the resources available to students make a difference in the academics."
Junior,4,"Overall a very great offer for students in the area. Professors here have always attempted to help my classmates and I in advancing to an even greater future! However, one thing that does bother me is the atmosphere of some of the students being present- they are goofy."
Freshman,4,"My experience has been good so far. When I first enrolled the counselors was so helpful,  and really want to see the students make it. It was the kind of support I needed. My teachers are very cool,  although you have some teachers with very strong accents that make it difficult to understand lectures! I like it. It's very easy to find your classes. The bookstore moves pretty fast,  but that financial aid office is packed the first week if school.  I think that's to be expected.  Better make sure you have your parking pass, because campus security is always driving around I haven't seen anyone get their car towed but better safe than sorry.  Oh yeah parking kind of sucks. It takes forever to get a parking spot people still literally sit In there car for 10 minutes before they pull out to leave.  That can be very frustrating at times.  There are a couple  food places nearby."
Niche User,4,"Its pretty calm and people are friendly, the sheriff is always alert and there's never any problems. I like that it has lots of trees in certain areas and the staff is pretty nice too."
Sophomore,4,The college experience is great. Talk to a counselor before you get started. Very easy to stay on track
Graduate Student,4,Most of my professors were very nice and knew what they were doing. The campus is pretty clean. Some bathrooms need to be remodeled but other than that great campus.
Junior,4,"Antelope Valley College is a great college especially if you don’t have the funds to go straight to university you are saving yourself a lot of money if you transfer from here. Most of the teachers here are awesome and are super helpful, if you begin to get into there side programs like EOPS or other programs to help you are wonderful they help you out by guiding you through the right path of classes you need to take. But if you don’t know about these programs and there one to one counseling and you go to the regular counselors in the main office they don’t help you, they are more lazy for there job and just want to get there job done and get to the next person. And not everyone is like that but you do have to look for the right person to help you and guide you."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at AVC has been good. The small class sizes really helped me to form connections with my classmates and with the professors. I came the AVC to get the feel of college without having to spend a ton of money and to learn college skills without the pressure of having to succeed because of a big price tag. 
Although, I’m not giving AVC 5 stars because when it comes to the councilors, they make you take classes you don’t necessarily need to take. But overall my experience at AVC was exactly what I expected it to be and I got what I needed out of the school."
Graduate Student,4,I've been at Antelope Valley College since Fall 2015. I just finished my last semester before I transfer and it's bittersweet. I met some amazing people I call friends and I will miss them.
Sophomore,4,"Its local, it would be nice they offered housing and fixed up some the buildings a lot of them are really old and out dated"
Sophomore,4,"Since becoming a student at AVC I have been able to overcome certain obstacles and achieve academic success.  In the beginning, I was able to accomplish a lot of positive things that later became beneficial to my current occupation.  Studying in Child Development allowed me to further understand how certain behavioral challenges tend to affect our children and their way of thinking.  Since becoming a Behavioral Therapist I' am able to exude the patience and empathy needed to help our children thrive and express their issues when it comes to behavior.  Going back to college has by far been one of the best decisions that I have made in my life."
Senior,4,The teachers here are amazing. It’s a decent sized campus that’s expanding little by a little. There is a lot of oppurtunuties at the campus.
Sophomore,4,AVC is not a bad place to start after high school. It gives you time to mature mentally and take courses that are usually expensive at universities to a low affordable cost. Help is around every corner in campus when it comes to your studies so do take advantage of that. One thing that I would love AVC to do is probably improve their cafeteria options. The only place that does serve good food is subway but it is so small that it gets cramped and long lines to order. Overall my experience my professors do care about us learning and passing their classes. AVC is a good foundation to start your journey to a higher education.
Sophomore,4,"I have been at Antelope Valley College for coming up on 2 years now, and it’s been a great experience. Aside from the fact that it’s a community college, the students, staff, and on campus organizations create a very close environment."
Freshman,4,"Being there for a semester and a couple weeks into my second semester, the college has been good. I didn't expect anything from a community college, but from what I've seen it's been good. The professors have been good and fellow students were actually wanting to learn unlike my high school years."
Alum,4,Antelope Valley College offers just enough to get the degree that you want. They have a lot of classes to choose from but they do fill up quickly if you don't sign up for them asap. The parking is always a nightmare at the beginning of the semester but usually dies down after the first month or so and there are sheriff's on campus that patrol the campus and parking lot.  Their counseling could use some help. I had to figure out a lot of things out on my own or through counselor's at other colleges. Of course there are some professors who truly are passionate about their jobs and they are the ones who make the pursuit in education worth it.
Sophomore,4,That they always try there best to help you succeed and how caring they are for there students. I absolutely love it but I'm getting close to graduating and need to start planning on transferring to CSU Bakersfield.
Junior,4,I love how much the teachers are willing to work with the students so that they can be successful. Also the students on campus are always extremely helpful and respectful.
Sophomore,4,"This is the only college I have ever attended so I have no comparison, but I have been happy with my time here.  They offer a decent amount of online classes, though I do not suggest those for most people. That would be my main complaint about this school. The online classes are not very interactive, and unless you are able to put in a lot of your own motivated study time, you do not get the full benefit of an in-person class. Plus, without any face-to--face discussion about the subject with teachers and other students you do not retain as much of the knowledge. I do suggest if you can take honors courses, do. They give you much more bang for your buck."
Graduate Student,4,I really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere  and the professors are very helpful and care a lot about students education.
Sophomore,4,"The administration is very persistent with letting the students know what’s going on. The student center is very helpful and is willing to make study sessions based on when an individual student can attend. It’s very student oriented. I would like to have somewhere I can get help with transferring into an engineering program at a CSU. The transfer center is great for getting general admission, but I think it lacks in how to get into specific programs at the campus we aspire to transfer into."
Sophomore,4,"AVC  is a good college, some think because it's a community college that it  can't be as beneficial but hat is wrong. AVC offers different programs to help with textbooks, tutoring center, and professors who really do care."
Sophomore,4,"Before graduating high school and planning to attend AVC I heard many negative remarks regarding staff and getting the classes you need and or want. This is now my second year or third full semester at AVC and I have had a really great experience. I have gotten in every class that I needed and have had some amazing professors. This college is what you make it to be, and if you are a hard worker you will make it a good experience. I had the opportunity to work at the Antelope Valley College bookstore, and the staff is more than happy to assist with your needs. Go with a hard working respectful attitude and you will not be disappointed."
Freshman,4,"It's pretty okay for a community college. Not the cutest campus. Reminds me of a high school, not so much a college. I'd love to see more food franchises on the campus though."
Sophomore,4,"The Antelope Valley College (AVC) is a small community college in Lancaster city that fosters communities of students seeking to develop their academic skills and grow to become successful people.
My general experience at the college has been great.  Though not all or most of the  professors are extremely dedicated and supporting.  Willing to support you and mentor you as well  develop good relationships with their students, many of AVC's will make learning materials easy and enjoyable.  The campus is small but clean and safe, and the  administration works to develop and nurture students through different programs and financial aid opportunities.
AVC  is a great college to start  your education at and develop your critical thinking and skills."
Sophomore,4,It a nice college with some rigorous professors who do care about you and want you to succeed. It has many advantages regardless of what anyone says if you want a cheap college come to AVC.
Alum,4,"I liked the learning center at AVC, and the professors are just as good as those you would get at any 4 year university."
Freshman,2,Converting during Spring 2020 was a mess.  Some teachers were on it and had the lecture contents up and some had a hard time.  Some teachers were better about it than others.
Sophomore,2,Online is okay since we only just start early in the term due to the pandemic. It is okay for theory based classes but hands project classes is really challenging and difficult to do.
Freshman,2,I enjoy the school but doesn't have enough program that will help my major. My counselor was rude. I set up a meeting to help me set up my Ed plan and put kept telling me you could have gone with a express counselor to help you. A express counselor just tells you quick info not set up a class requirement to transfer. She told me I wasn't require to take a math course but I told no it said in assist.com it is minatory. After that she just began being rude and did everything quickly like is had to go. Why offer yourself available if you didn't want to help. Prior to that I schedule a appointment to meet a counselor days ago and they canceled me twice just for the third time to discuss my Ed plan with a rude lady.
Junior,2,"Antelope Valley college isn't terrible but it is incredibly below average. The counseling is not much help especially if you are transferring, they will give you cookie cutter advice and classes. The advice they give you will make you be here for +4 years (not uncommon). If you are transferring follow what the universities you want to go say. The social life is very poor a lot of low life kids who only go to give the illusion to their parents that they are being productive when in truth they are just goofing. The rest of the campus is asocial everyone goes to class and leaves right away which is typical of a CC. The only amenities are the subway, library, and few lounge areas. Not much here. Yet there are a few gems of teachers and students here but there's not enough to offset the rest of the school. The college is really great if you are disadvantaged as there are lots of resources to help. For a typical school experience it's quite dry and bland."
Niche User,2,I don't go to AVC but it's a popular school most high school graduates of the Antelope Valley attend.
Alum,2,"AVC has little to no programs for you to get access, there isn't much involvement,Counseling department administration is not well informed, they happen to be one of the most negatively criticized recourses, they have failed at making their student success a priority. There are less than 3-4 clubs available for you to get involved with. There are very few professors that actively involved in the students academic progress.  Most course syllabus's are not completed during the semester. Parking is not accessible,You are always competing for a spot in a class and the waitlist for the classes is horrendously long. Their website is not fully updated with the current year information. The library is probably one of the best recourses available with efficient and caring staff."
Niche User,2,"Antelope Valley College I believe is for those that need a cheaper route to transfer to other colleges. The only thing that I can say positive about this institution is that it is a college and that you can get a degree. The staff is extremely divided and in-cohesive. Some staff members will give an answer to an question and directly after another would contradict and disrespect the first employee and the answer that was given. They make transferring to other colleges extremely complicated because they want students to graduate there to increase in money. This was told to me from a staff member herself. Applying for classes are always complicated, sometimes even with priority registration. They do not put a lot of effort in the propelling of students but in my opinion the stagnation of them."
College Sophomore,2,The teachers sometimes dont know how to teach you and give you to much homework
College Junior,2,"In my college therebis no help when it comes finding a job in your career path. However, they do help the students find regular jobs, located in the community. They have helped some of the students work as a bank teller,Starbucks employee, and etc. I do wish they helped the students find internships for their career paths. I believe that would be extremely helpful"
College Junior,2,"The tuition is not that bad however the financial aid needs to be increased. Students have to use most of their financial aid of just books, there isn't enough for room and board and other college expences. The financial aid has to be at least a little hire then tuition. So the students does not need to worry about not having enough financial aid to pay for extra expensives."
College Junior,2,They do not have a good post-grad service. Most of the people who graduate have to try and figure out how to start there careers by themselves. The only people who try and help is the teachers. Multiple of my teachers have helped me try and start my career already.
College Sophomore,2,Information from administration is terrible.  Information is something that is just not shared.  The college and the student body could do such a better job of doing an orientation program.
College Senior,2,The financial aide office is chaotic and its hard to get help with the process from there.
College Senior,2,"the school won't distribute financial aid until 2 weeks into the semester because of ""skippers"". and, your award is given out twice: one at the beginning of the semester, and the other half near the middle-end."
College Junior,2,"Many students are not taking their education seriously, and simply mess around in the hangout areas."
College Sophomore,2,I wish the school would give their student WiFi internet access for free but they charge all of us if we want internet I do not think this is fair because if we want internet we have to wait for computers.
College Sophomore,2,"I think the registration fees are outrageous at $46 a unit but that's the state's problem not the school's. Definitely apply for FASFA, the BOG waiver and ANY other financial aid you might qualify for."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This campus is the worst with the computer network. They offer wifi but you must get a contract with AT&T and pay a monthly fee, and even if you did the wireless signal is limited, only some sections of the campus offers it. However they have various places in which you can access a computer to do homework, and print, but since this is a greatly impacted college sometimes it can be a challenge "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Due to the area I live in, where there are tons of people on welfare, receiving financial aid can be extremely difficult. So many of these people enroll in classes just long enough to receive aid, and any other benefits they can, and then after two weeks, they drop."
College Junior,2,"For a few majors, not every major."
College Sophomore,2,Its about average. Racially diverse but not religiously diverse.
College Senior,2,"While there is a  student body, it doesn't really make its presence known all too much."
College Junior,2,"My school is mostly packed with African-Americans who can be obnoxious or rude, but for the most part I don't stay on campus after class. Students in class are respectful."
College Junior,2,"In the school I attend, the student body really is a mix up of a lot of diverse people.  What I have noticed about it though it's a community college, it mainly directed towards young adults that are fresh out of High school."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of useful degree options unless you are taking classes to transfer to a University. The local universities in the area don't have a ton of options either if you are looking for a Bachelors Degree. If you want a career where you can at least hope to be able to pay off your student loans some day, you will probably have to start here and then move to LA for a degree that will actually get you a decent job."
College Senior,2,"While I have only taken one online course at Antelope Valley College, I should first say that my answer does not necessarily speak for all other online courses at my school. However, that does not take away from my terrible experience in an online Biology class. My guess was that it was a hybrid class, basically I got emailed a ton of powerpoints on chapters upon chapters of complex biology. The class would meet only five times during the semester to be tested on whatever it was we were supposed to be studying. I regret taking the class, also as I think back I had no idea the class was an online class when I first registered for it."
College Junior,2,"It is an over crowded campus. There are not enough classes for everyone. Not enough people are motivated. There are alot of people that come up to the school that dont necessarily go here, that just hang out in the quad area. As for me i go here because i do want an education and it is close to home, so less gas being wasted."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't anything unique about it. I feel that its like being in high school all over again.
College Sophomore,2,"So far since I've been attending my college. I haven't been into the career center. But I figured it wouldn't make a difference if I went there or not, because not many people in my area discuss how our college has helped them get a career. As far as alumni network, there is none. never seen or herd any alumni's . Job prospects isn't any better. Where I live there are no jobs and I highly doubt the college is helping any one."
College Senior,2,Students are given financial aid but many just wait for that money and then stop attending class. The school is affordable and helps a large portion of students with fees but those students that are only in it for the money take up class spaces that they will only drop later. It is obvious in lower level classes when a month goes by and half the seats are empty. If you are a student that will put the aid to good use then you should not have too many problems however get to the offices as early as possible because the waiting lines can be atrocious.
College Junior,2,"There is a wide range in academics best suited for those in Science, Math, English etc. The professors are somewhat laid back but are also helpful unless you unfortunately get a poor teacher. Classes are fine, teachers are OK, but class registration is a huge hassle. Registration is like almost ""first come, first serve"" which causes students to flood the system and cause mass confusion and technical difficulties when applying. Otherwise, there is tutorials meant to help you, and study rooms for your group of peers you want to study with."
College Junior,2,"Antelope Valley College is about average when it comes to Academic experience. The Workload is ,at best few, and the instructors are somewhat clueless ,overall, in teaching. It's a hassle to get the right and best teachers but it's worth it. Instructors and other faculty members are somewhat borderline good and bad when it comes to your education level. I suggest you research the teachers for your own benefit."
College Senior,2,My major is nutrition and food but the classes avc suggests for that are useless at four year universities.
College Freshman,2,This school will email you about everything going on with the school but when it comes to Financial aid you may have a little problem with receiving it on time and they don't tell you you have incomplete paper work that needs to be handle. I don't like how they let school students help other student with their financial aid when they are not sure on the process. When that happens and this problem sets your financial aid back to a later date to receive it. They need to give receipts when students bring in forms to complete their financial aid. Without out that they tell you that you need this and that before you can receive your financial aid. So complicated when they continue to blame you for the mishap.
College Sophomore,2,There is always a huge line at financial aid. Sometimes they only have one person working there when there should always be three.
College Junior,2,Transfer Credits Are a Priority. There is not really anything that you can have a substantial major in. Just work towards an AA while doing transfer courses.
College Student,2,"Half and Half – Half of the student body is hard working and career oriented, the other half don't even want to be there and don't care who it affects if they slack off and drop out."
College Student,2,"Facilties Are Okay – The school has very little classes to offer and when they do have the classes needed they are taken by the people that are there just to collect their finacial ad checks. The teachers and student resources are good , its really just the lack of class space and classes avaliable."
College Freshman,2,"Although this school has a decent selection of classes, a somewhat helpful staff, and a few  caring professors I've noticed a lot of flaws in the overall quality of this college. Although they are updating buildings and even building a new nursing building some other parts of campus are just forgotten it seems. When I was in my basic 2D auto cad class there were issues with some of the computers. My professor tried everything he could to get them fixed and eventually the I.T guy came to fix it... 2 months into class and even then didn't fix it! Furthermore some of the professors are completely unhelpful. For example, in my ENGR 115 class a few students didn't understand the idea of auxiliary drawings, they proceeded to ask the professor who then looked up with a grin saying ""I can't spoon feed it to you."" I thought professors were getting paid to teach not to leave students in the dust. However the rest of the class proceeded to teach the few who were confused. Overall however this college is adequate; some of the staff are very helpful (i.e. job placement) while other not so much (registration). I had to spend over 6 hours and 3 different trips to register in my Math 150 course although I had all of the correct qualification. If I could I would gladly have chosen a different college but could not due to the small selection here in Antelope Valley."
College Junior,2,"Computer Labs – the computer labs at AVC, are quite bad. my highschool had better computer labs. i thought that college was suppose to be a step up from highschool but i guess i was wrong. The network is very slow at avc, which is pretty sad considering rhat it is a college. I hope they can fis this problem and soon."
Freshman,1,AVC is a joke. They don’t have enough classes you have wait for a very long time to get into any classes.
College Sophomore,1,It is one of the hardest schools to get the classes you actually need. I depend on crashing classes more than actually registering for them.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid lines are ALWAYS out the door and sometime they even turn down students when they have been waiting in line for 30 plus minutes. Staff is also rude.
College Sophomore,1,"I have never really seen much more alumni. There is a small place on the site, but it is just to donate money."
College Sophomore,1,The Nursing Program at this College has a long waiting period and overall I really dont want to wait to continue my schooling. Overall The college is a great school.
College Senior,1,I can not get any wireless access at Antelope Valley College. For the four years I have been there the computers have failed on me.
College Senior,1,"I didn't do well with the on-line courses.  I do better with the interaction of an actual classroom with teacher, lectures, note taking."
College Junior,1,There is nothing really special about Avc no one really wants to be there are you can tell
College Sophomore,1,Not Many Classes – My school has so many people trying to attend certain classes that if u are not on the priority enrollment list you probably will not get into the classes that you need. this semester I am taking pretty random classes so that nest semester i will be priority.
College Junior,1,The price of the classes and tuition are going up but we are getting money for financial aid. How do they expect for us to go to school is we don't get the right amount funds we need. Many people aren't lucky as other people that they are to pay there expenses because of there parents having money.
College Senior,1,English 101 – teacher was very vague about work. She never gave clear information on what she requires.
College Junior,1,"Some People Need to Learn to Be Nicer – I'm new to this school but I've already had some issues with it. Whenever I'd call or come in and get information on something, nine out of ten times the person was extremely rude and hostile about whatever I needed help with. The school also had me do all of this work to be able to get financial aid eligibility just to find out I wasn't even qualified for financial aid. Their organization is the only thing thatmakes this school bareable so far."
College Junior,1,Class Registration Process – registering for classes are pointless at AVC because the odds of you getting into the classes are very slim
College Junior,1,"Sometimes Progress Is Not Progress – Online classes are ineffectual for teaching purposes, and only offer conveinence and a save on gas. The drawback is there is no face time with the teacher, the classes are larger, and if you don't understand something good luck! There is more homework and if you work full time it is very difficult to keep up."
College Senior,1,"Availability of Courses – The biggest problem with this school is the unavailability of classes,due to budget cuts among man other factors. I've encountered many students who have attended this community college for three to five years because they have been unable to register for a particular class and that is keeping them from transferring. This school needs more classes and it needs to improve its policy on priority registration."
College Junior,1,This year my classes are all over the place! I still need one more class and it's a general ed class but it's the hardest one to get into! I also dont have a car so I have to wait years on campus till my next class
College Junior,1,I havent found anything about my college that would make it stand out.
College Sophomore,1,"Professors Dont Teach Good Enough – i passed CPR and first aid class with a B , but i didn't learn a single thing there. i tried to pay attention but he contradicted himself. we took about two test one that was hands on , and i didn't do good but he passed me with a B and another was written , and it was also a B , i got certified but i am scared to be in a situation where i will need to do CPR because i feel like i know nothing about it."
College Freshman,1,"History Major – The classes they offer get filled so fast, and half of the classes I need get offered every other semester"
College Junior,1,I See Lots of Work Being Done – I see a lot of work being done (construction). But it takes me over 30 minutes to even find a parking place- then the walk from there is crazy...so I haven't seen-nor have I the time to see anything else!

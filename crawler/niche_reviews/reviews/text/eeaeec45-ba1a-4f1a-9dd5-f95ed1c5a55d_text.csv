Senior,5,"Cornish truly is a nurturing environment, this school, based on my experience, is definitely more for individuals who are willing to work really hard, are creative and forward thinking. The faculty is beyond amazing and are successful artists outside of their careers in higher education. Expensive, yes, but like most art schools, you get what you put into this place. I feel transfer student tend to do better because they’re used to the work load. Where as fresh out of high school students seem to struggle more. This place isn’t very diverse so as a person of color this can at times it can be tough. However I can definitely say I do not regret coming here. I’m very happy with my education, school but important what my school stands for and the support you get from the faculty no matter how crazy your creative ideas are."
Freshman,5,"Cornish is the most impactful, selfless, nurturing community I have ever been apart of, as well as the most talented. I have been challenged to expand my boundaries here, and my limits have been stretched like putty. Creating art is the key to living at Cornish College of the Arts, and it's taken incredibly seriously."
Freshman,5,"Cornish College of the Arts isn't like other Arts schools, it allows artists to practice their craft and perfect it with fellow artists. The teachers are artists themselves so they know how to teach students in a way that can help them be successful in whatever they want to do. Not to mention, Cornish is in the heart of Seattle, and its buildings are clean; making its student life quite nice! Choosing Cornish was an easy choice when the school and its people are so accepting and welcome you with open arms."
Niche User,5,Cornish College of the Arts is the best choice for an art school because of the many selection of mediums and choice of education in the art world. From performing arts to arts in general it will pave your path for being experienced artist in whatever your craftsmanship/career will be.
Freshman,5,"Cornish College of the Arts is a fantastic program. If you are a prospective student searching for an individual focused and dedicated curriculum, Cornish is the place. As a musical theater student, I am being challenged positively in all aspects, and am even given the privilege of taking courses outside of my major. Cornish provides a home in which to push the artist, challenging you to see what you can do, and to not take no for an answer. On the side of cons, they are still fleshing out the musical theatre program and adding more dance. To me though, that is not a worry, as most colleges grow over time and change their programs to better suit the needs of their students, which is what Cornish is doing. I highly recommend this innovative and exciting college to any artist looking for a place to start."
Junior,5,Great place to learn from professors who are experts in their field. Small classroom sized helps you connect and learn from your peers and your professors.
Sophomore,5,I love how it is within walking distance of most of the attractions. Its right in the center of downtown seattle.
College Sophomore,5,The housing at Cornish is amazing. It is the nicest housing I have seen compared to the schools nearby.
College Freshman,5,It's very professional and the work load is difficult and heavy. It is very beneficial though and you learn a lot. Extremely good program but only for those serious and hard working.
College Freshman,5,We have a very good security team and protective system. Very good about making you feel safe even for small issues.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, it is everything I want in a school for the career path I have chosen."
College Senior,5,"Seattle has some of the best food in the world, and there's lots of things to choose from. You can usually find some pretty good deals too if you know where to look."
College Senior,5,"Cornish is really close to Capital Hill, which has some of the best nightlife/bar scene in the country."
College Freshman,5,"Haven't spent enough time here to know, but from the looks it seems like a safe campus."
College Freshman,5,Have hard the food is diverse and healthy. That there are lots of vegetarian/ vegan options and that the food is fresh.
College Freshman,5,"Cornish has no sports, but has studios for dance and theatre and they are absolutely excellent!"
College Freshman,5,"Again, not sure yet, but since its an art school I've heard everyone is very accepting of everyone else's views and backgrounds."
College Freshman,5,"Not sure what its like yet because I'll be living there this fall, but I've seen the dorms and it looks like it will be wonderful!"
College Sophomore,5,"I do feel that the training is overall good, I learned things I had not thought about before."
College Sophomore,5,Workload is heavy and so is practice time time management is very important in the fast pace environment.
College Sophomore,5,WiFi is available so are computers
College Freshman,5,"Seattle is full of restaurants, chains and privately owned. A lot of places are organic or vegetarian or vegan. I love going to Pike's Place Market to have a bunch of things from different vendors. And the dorms seem to be located right in the middle of the city so everything is in walking distance."
College Freshman,5,"Because it is an art school, there must be computers for fine art and design students, and there are computers in the library and down on the first floor where many theatre kids hang out."
College Sophomore,5,There are comp's everywhere so labs are in normal.
College Freshman,5,"the safety and security is amazing. they are easily accsessed, always on call and ready to help. they are never to pushy or annoying and even have a night shuttle service if you need a safe ride home from some where. the  best is that they really do keep the campus safe and really do care about our safety."
College Freshman,5,"We began the year with an assembly on diversity.  It was a very inspiring experience for us all, and we all sort of bonded by the end of it.  As Art kids, we're used to being the ""odd ones out"" so there is a really good understanding and acceptance felt all-around throughout our school."
College Junior,5,"there is so much to do, literally every day i walk to the same places but take different streets and see different places. Also there is always music, movies, shows ect. all over the place. so much fun and so social!!!"
College Junior,5,City Living – city living is the best. The atmosphere is extremely creative and motivating. There is always community activities and fun places to see and walk to.
College Junior,5,"Helpful Teachers – The professors are amazing. I have learned a lot from them over the past two years. Not only do they offer guidance for your musical abilities but also great advice on how to build your career. The workload is sometimes rather large but I prefer that over too small. The music office also emails out job opportunities/gigs every week. My only complaint is the facilities. the music building is small with only a handful of practice rooms, so you don't always get space to practice."
College Sophomore,5,"Busses and Shuttle – There are many options around Cornish. The buses run late, there is the trolley to take you around lake union and there are taxi's in case you need to get far. There is also the Cornish shuttle that runs fairly late and takes you from the school up into Capitol Hill."
College Sophomore,5,"The entire structure of the Main Campus building, the Kerry Hall building (music and dance majors), and the 9th ave studios (for theater majors) are all well designed."
College Sophomore,5,"The Very Best! Despite the [wonderful] availability of the Dell desktop computers in not only the Library but the computer lab and writing center, Cornish is the best for having a plethora of the latest Mac OS desktop computers in their studio labs.
The access to printers and scanners is great, too.
A major plus: Since this is a private school, the labs are never full even when a class is in one, so there's always a spot to be found.
All of this available technology makes Cornish very worth the price and experience."
College Junior,5,"OPPORTUNITY GALORE – The standard is extremely high. The degree is a BFA (normally 5 years to obtain) program in a 4 year timeline. The graduate rate is only 50 percent, but those who make it are almost guaranteed a job. Instructors are mostly part-time and full time working in the industry. They have access to an unlimited number of resources and grant you access as well."
College Junior,5,"The only athletics is dancing. Described as the Juilliard of the West Coast, the standard and ability of performers is as good as it gets."
College Junior,5,A lot of choices within walking distance. Happy hours and dancing are available as well as small pubs and larger venues.
College Senior,5,Welcoming and Lively – Seattle is a great town that is bustling with culture all around it. Every area is diverse and different from the next allowing you to get multiple atmospheres within one city.
College Freshman,5,"Diversity at It's Finest! You will never find two people alike in Cornish, and it is something I fell in love with about this school. There are so many different types of people, their interests, and how each person dresses and presents themselves, but it shows their true personality by the way they express how they feel not only through their art, but the way they look. A lot of beautiful people here!"
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone has their own distinct look. Some are very out there with dyed hair and lots of piercings but others are much more tame. Seattle is filled with a lot of hipsters so there's no shortage of them. Cornish is very gay friendly as well! everyone is super friendly, especially for an art school. In my experience most art schools are competitive and cutthroat but everyone supports one another here."
College Freshman,5,"Relax, We All Get It – Cornish is an arts school, so having a group of people yelling and laughing loudly in the cafe is never looked down upon.  You're free to express yourself!  Each teacher has their own policy in their classroom but for the most part they love seeing a person be who they naturally are.  The college does have a student policy and conduct handout, but everything on there is pretty commonsense stuff."
College Freshman,5,"Rainy City – Seattle is a very lively city to attend college in. The arts are widely represented and accessible, with art walks every Thursday, local art gallery's and theaters open almost everyday. Overall I would say that Seattle is a very beautiful city to live in."
Junior,4,Love the faculty & community. Commuting between spilt campuses without school-specific transit is difficult though.
Senior,4,The professors are great and super passionate. The campuses are spread apart so it feels a little unsafe at times but we do get an unlimited bus pass. Food is typically underseasoned and expensive. There are very small class sizes so that's cool.
Freshman,4,"Cornish is a welcoming art school full of musical variation as well as artistic freedom. I admire the constant updates about recitals, and I enjoy the relaxed vibe of the artists here. Art departments range from an oriental drum room to theater and film majors.

I would prefer better chefs in the cafeteria though since the food isn’t anything special. I would also like to see more publicity involving Cornish culture rather than this one isolated block in Seattle Center. It’s as divided as a Chinatown, needs more promo!"
Sophomore,4,"I feel like the school is amazing. The teacher really care about their students and above all have a lot of experience to share with us. One thing I’d give the school crap for is not scheduling events to fit everyone’s schedule. Honestly, any bad ratings are from the salty students who have the whole complain mentality and don’t do anything about it kind of thing."
Sophomore,4,"I have had a marvelous experience with the student body, the faculty and staff, and the overall city experience of Cornish, but the safety procedures around sexual assault are a bit archaic. The school needs an administration reboot to get my vote again."
Niche User,4,"I was only enrolled there for a couple years but I loved the pure love and commitment all the staff had when it came to their subjects and passions. Its definitely a school where you live, breathe and perform your major."
Senior,4,I absolutely love the theater program. The teachers are incredible. It is a very expensive school though.
Junior,4,"Fine Arts department student here. The top three things that I think Cornish has to offer is student personal studio space , a good grounding in modern and contemporary art history, theory, and critique, and a diversity conscious and accepting student body and faculty. The bottom three things that I think keep me from rating Cornish higher are the Administration's inability to communicate effectively, the often dodgy way in which courses can morph from one thing into another, and a couple of instructors who are not good teachers. That being said, the vast majority of instructors are great; knowledgeable, thoughtful, and engaged in what the students are doing. Over arching this is Cornish's ability to offer a range of disciplines rather than just painting + drawing as is the case with various Universities. All in all, I would recommend Cornish and I'm still here, three years later, and planning on graduating next year."
Niche User,4,"Overall I have been very satisfied with Cornish College of the Arts! I am in the Visual Arts program and there is such a diverse range of opportunities to complete assignments in your own respective field. The food is alright, there is always a decent salad bar and fresh pizza. This is NOT a party school, check out UW for that one. Dorms are decently sized for 2 people."
Sophomore,4,"The staff and faculty at Cornish are amazing. They really make it a point to work hands on with each one of their students to make sure they are learning everything they need and more. Also, there are a wide range of opportunities available to all students in every major. The only thing that I would change is the lack of communication. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to be on top of information as a student due to instructors or staff members not getting information out to their students fast enough."
College Sophomore,4,The school wants whats best for their students and want them to feel safe. They do a great job at doing that.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Cornish has been great so far. Classes tend to be small, which I prefer. The professors are wonderful and want the best for you."
College Sophomore,4,Cornish has a good name and reputation in the Seattle area.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at our school are very good, and the facilities are up to par."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at this school has been amazing. The teachers are very interested in you and want the best for you. The school environment is very comfortable and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this school to others!
College Junior,4,"This school is the best for what I want to do, it's tough at times, but I love it."
College Freshman,4,There is a huge variety of courses you can take to better your major. Class sizes are small and intimate and they are very accommodating.
College Freshman,4,A lot of the professors are very good about giving career options and setting you up for success in your field. We often get several performance opportunities and opportunities to be noticed at different performance venues due to the help of the professors.
College Freshman,4,It has been amazing. I've learned more here in a week than I have in my field ever. The work load is huge and extremely difficult but when you manage your time and complete it it has been all worth while. Definitely getting my money's worth.
College Sophomore,4,"its great if you're of age. theres a few clubs around the city that allow 18+, apart from that most concert venues will have a show every weekend"
College Sophomore,4,the food in seattle is wonderful. especially because the campus is directly in the heart of the city you can walk a block in any direction and end up in another part of the world cuisine wise.
College Sophomore,4,the dorms are in the middle of a huge renovation. brand new building directly across from the main campus center. kitchens for every room and the students choice of single to triple bed per room. right now the students are waiting for the finishing touches on their new rooms in the 1980's styled old hotel-turned dorm rooms a few blocks from the campus.
College Student,4,"Campus is near the center of Seattle, so food is always pretty close or you can walk to something good."
College Senior,4,The food was one good thing at Cornish
College Senior,4,"Seattle is awesome, Cornish is NOT"
College Sophomore,4,There are always measures being taken to help safety at the school. The buildings are locked with key cards and emails are always being circulated that tell of any security risks.
College Senior,4,"The issues I have are with academic requirements themselves. The classes and instructors are all great, and I've learned a lot."
College Senior,4,"The dorms suck, but the rest of campus is pretty great. As an arts college, there's a great sense of campus culture, too."
College Senior,4,"I enjoy the faculty, and I have learned a lot from them. I am not happy with the way the theater department is run as a whole, and I have a lot of issues with the curriculum -- specifically the department chair."
College Senior,4,"The most important thing to the officials is that you are a driven, hardworking individual who is passionate about your art. Technique can be taught, heart can't. They want to know you're committed to learning about your art."
College Senior,4,"The workload can sometimes seem like too much, but the teachers are completely understanding. Sometimes I disagree with the way the curriculum is run, but the teachers are open to listening to my concerns, and they help me work through issues that I have with courses."
College Senior,4,The faculty are amazing and fully committed to student growth.
College Senior,4,"Seattle is one of the cleanest, safest cities in the US. And Cornish is right at the heart of downtown."
College Freshman,4,Still have not spent enough time to give an accurate review but during my time in Seattle  I found all the off campus dinning to be very delicious and diverse.
College Sophomore,4,"Just a short walk away is Capitol Hill or Belltown, where there are tons of clubs and bars."
College Sophomore,4,"The thing about off campus housing is that our school is located right smack in the city, so city living is great."
College Sophomore,4,Although all of my cost was not covered it was expected being a private school.
College Sophomore,4,If you come to Cornish you are going to dive deep into your major of choice right away.
College Sophomore,4,I received the financial aid in a timely manner
College Sophomore,4,In a big city with a small town atmosphere
College Junior,4,It is a very safe place. There are some strangers but usually nobody is dangerous.
College Junior,4,It is small private art school. Some advantages for having a small classes
College Junior,4,The facilities are very clean and nice. But it can get very cold.
College Junior,4,They are all very nice. Not much of special study options.
College Junior,4,It is great! There are more than enough nice computers with printers.
College Junior,4,It can be a great place for both Greeks and non-Greeks!
College Sophomore,4,Good food variety of obtions
College Freshman,4,"Coming from an acting major, going to Cornish is providing me with the skills and opportunities to be more than I could have imagined. Cornish finds a way to help each student push themselves into being their very best."
College Freshman,4,They have a very focused and narrowed point of view to get you right to were you need to be.
College Freshman,4,"It's exactly what you are looking for if you want to go into a career that includes any kind of performing or art! They provide you with the way to get the needed skills, as well as connections, to set yourself up for success."
College Junior,4,"Our major teachers are great, they challenge us. The non-major teachers are often forgetful that since we begin our majors on day 1, we are non thinking about our H&S classes compared to how we can make ourselves better with our major."
College Junior,4,The campus security is extremely thorough. It is a fairly small campus so security is easy to keep tight. There are locks on every exterior door that require a key card to open. There are cameras trained on each entrance as well as in common areas more centrally located in the building. At orientation each student is given the campus security phone number in which they can call for emergencies or transportation. On-call transportation are shuttles run by the security department 24 hrs. a day that can take you up to a mile away from the Main Campus Center and Kerry Hall.
College Junior,4,"The school is located in downtown Seattle so access to fun night activities are extremely easy to come by. Several of the upper class men have apartments nearby and host parties that range between 7 to 60 people.  Everyone cares and looks out for each other so everyone is held responsible for their safety and the safety of others.
There are several bars in the area for those who are old enough that caters to a huge variety of people.  There are also underage dance clubs nearby that the underclass men can enjoy."
College Freshman,4,"However heavy the workload may seem, the college imparts a sense of productivity within its students. The professors are helpful and hold regard of the students with high expectations. The professors are very friendly and helpful and hold much interest for the students. They exhibit an appreciation for communication for their students which, in my opinion, separates them from most other schools. While the curriculum requires the credit of general education, these course are designed to meet and hold the interest of the student that is more stimulated by art."
College Freshman,4,"While student discounts on food are hard to come by, the neighborhoods of Seattle combined offer a variety of option for American and ethnic cuisine. For the various food genres (i.e. sushi, Thai, Indian, etc.)numerous locations may be found for an affordable price as well. Many of these location are also provide the benefit of not just dine-in, but also pick-up or delivery for the busy student."
College Freshman,4,"There are buses everywhere, and there are even shuttles that go back and forth between the downtown and Capitol Hill campuses."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are strictly based on what major each student is in. It is less about your standard academic classes such as math and history, and based more on personal academic tools that are needed to become a successful artist in whichever field you are studying. As a music major, my classes include ear training, piano, and music theory."
College Freshman,4,"Compared to other school's facilities, Cornish is extremely unique. We have facilities for all different fine arts majors. There's a piano room for music students, studios for the dancers, more than once concert hall for theater, music and dance performances, and the art department is filled with different areas for film development, costume design, technology for digital art/design and video, and so much more. This school was build to be unique."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is close knit and easily accessible within a few blocks of each other and they have a free shuttle to help out.
College Sophomore,4,There's only one place on campus that you can eat at and it's the cafe but the food is made with locally grown ingredients and they try to be as sustainable as possible. They always have a vegetarian option and usually have a vegan option as well and the food tastes pretty great.
Junior,2,"Great location and sense of community amongst the students. Curriculum for Interior Architecture is very disorganized, with “optional” (aka mandatory) overnight field trips to remote locations that becomes the foundation for all the projects during the semester. Department chair is withdrawn from everything, barely replies to emails and is not as involved in daily activities in the department. It’s a new department so they’re still trying to figure things out. 

The school doesn’t have parking which is a major inconvenience for commuting students."
Alum,2,"I attended here a few years ago for two years in the Performance Production program. The teachers seemed apathetic, more focused on doing their own projects than assisting the students, and the dropout rate was 50% EACH SEMESTER. Of the 60 of us that started in 2010, four graduated, and only one went on to work in the industry. The cirriculum is not at all challenging, and the equipment and methodology is outdated. The program did not at all prepare me for working within the industry."
College Freshman,2,"Foundation year for ADFM is a joke. We are lab rats for the schools new ""ground breaking freshman year"" program, when in all reality nobody has any idea what is going on. If you are a design or film student feel ready to feel out of place for the first semester. The food is absolutely terrible. Quality and freshness is great, but you get the same options every day and dinner you have like 4 options. Don't expect comfort food or junk food. You'll have to like tofu, salmon and lamb to enjoy the entrees. The pizza is great and the salad bar isn't shabby, it just gets old. The location isn't terrible you are close to all your classes and close to westlake. There just isn't a ton to do around here. There is no parking for kids that live in the dorms so be prepared to pay $300 a month for street parking. The dorms are nice and brand new, but there are only 2 elevators for 18 floors of dorms which is actually worse than you'd think."
College Senior,2,Teachers are somewhat rude and not knowledgeable.
College Senior,2,Oh my god. The administration here is insane. They have no control and keep creating new budget restrictions.
College Junior,2,It is not worth of your time. Small things here and there.
College Junior,2,"It was easy to get into the program, but there was not much of challenge after getting into the program."
College Junior,2,There are easy accesses to drugs. A lot of people already have done drugs even before coming to school.
College Sophomore,2,Good labs the soft ware isnt up to date
College Sophomore,2,Expensive to live in down town Seattle
College Junior,2,"I was awarded a decent amount of financial aid but it still only covered about half of the cost of tuition. The people in the office are very little help (don't expect to have a sit down meeting with them - even when you specifically ask for it).  The scholarship booklets in the student affairs office are outdated and if you ask a question you get the shuffle through the different departments. Supposedly the financial aid office has been sending out monthly emails about current scholarships but I have yet to see one even when assured that I have been receiving them.
On the plus side they have very thorough records and send timely emails about bills.  They also have several different payment plans that you can choose between. They readily handout pamphlets and other documents on online resources and have a good amount of knowledge about where you can get student loans with the least amount of hassle."
College Sophomore,2,"You can park at any cornish building parking lot, EXCEPT the ones specifically marked for faculty until a certain time of day. Main lots are the dorms and Kerry Hall. If you miss out on a spot, you have to get lucky and park on the street to pay for parking out-of-pocket."
College Senior,2,"White... but – The vast majority of the school is white. Many people are vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian, and the school cafe caters to those needs. Cornish is a strong supporter of the LGBT community, with a much loved annual drag show. Although there is not a lot of diversity in race, there is much diversity throughout the different departments."
College Sophomore,2,"Always Find Other Aid – I am a transfer student and after my portfolio was seen they said that they would give it the highest review possible. Which meant, based on their scale and info they hand out, that I would be receiving $10,000 in scholarships. When I finally got my financial aid packet I received almost $6000 less that was promised even though my portfolio was highest rated. Now, even with student loans I'm really pinching money together to cover living expenses, due to the fact that I'm not eligible for financial aid with the government."
College Sophomore,2,"A Plethora! Cornish is located between the Belltown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods of Seattle.
There are numerous apartments available to rent, but all of them are moderately to extremely expensive. -And some aren't worth the price.
It is a custom to have at least one or two room mates when finding off-campus housing because of the costs, but a lot of students do it because of the help and resources we receive from Housing and Residence Life."
College Sophomore,2,Not Much Spaces – Not much parking at Main Campus because it's downtown and teachers get all the spots. Great parking at the dorms. Other than that you mostly have to find a pay for a spot on the street which can be hard depending on the time of day. Permits cost about 300 dollars a semester.
Alum,1,"This school ruined my life. Administration is uncaring and unflexable. Classes do nothing to really help you in the industry. You will not learn anything that isn’t major-based and if you decide to transfer, as MANY Cornish students do, your credits will be useless. Dorms are great, but the student life team is very unhelpful and dismissive of any problems. Professors were great and really cared about their students, but the poor administration and the major pathways (what classes each major takes per year) need lots and lots of work. Do not attend this school if you are hesitant, I only wish someone would have told me and saved me $30,000 in useless credits."
College Senior,1,No one knows what this school is outside of seattle
College Senior,1,Student affairs was not helpful
College Junior,1,It is a small art school. There is no school sports. There are clubs but that is about it.
College Senior,1,Even with the parking permit you have to park a ways away. It cost too much for it not to be in front or around the school.
College Senior,1,The housing around Cornish is impossibly expensive.
College Freshman,1,"Many, many students use drugs at this school. It is a place where they are heavily accepted, even among teachers it seems to be okay to reference drugs in conversation and in your work."
College Sophomore,1,"They do not have an actual stage, there is no gym and despite there only being 750 some odd students in attendance the majors are so seperated they rarely meet anyone outside of their major."
College Sophomore,1,"Cornish states that it holds rigor and the other elements of education to high standards.  When attending the school students spend more time idling than being in the classroom.  They are not asked to do any more than elementary school students and although there is a deep passion for art held by those at the school the application of that passion is always chaotic and falls in a category of laziness. They do not recognize their most successful alum due to ""political"" issues.  This was the most upsetting fact to me while at school.  It is overpriced to begin with and if I receive a sub par education the least an institution could do for me as a student is recognize and congratulate me when I tour the world in performances.  It is disappointing to see the cache of wasted potential that the school seems to be oblivious to.  It is all the glitter of modernity without a single percent of substance."
College Senior,1,"Typical Downtown Seattle – The parking is horrible, but it's not far from average parking availability in downtown Seattle. Parking permits are incredibly expensive, and the parking lots are at the college dorms. You still have to walk a ways to get to the main campus, and your car has to compete with the cars of residents living at the dorms."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cornish is located in Seattle, Washington.  For a sunny California resident (like me) the transition was very challenging for me.  However, I would assume Washington residents would rate the weather differently. Everything is relative. 

There is grey clouds most days of the school year. I used to count the number of hours I saw the sun in a week. Mostly, 10 hours a week. 

That said: Summer is Amazing in Seattle.  80 degrees with no humidity and long summer nights make it a great place to be."

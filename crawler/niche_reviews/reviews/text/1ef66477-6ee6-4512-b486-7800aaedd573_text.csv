Niche User,5,"Learning online would definitely get 10/10. The service was not only great, but the classes were entertaining and surprisingly fun compared with face to face classes."
Niche User,5,"Attending College her was sooooo much fun, exiting and amazing. I really dont want anything to change because everything was just perfect for me, the lecturers, environment, facilities, everything."
Alum,5,"Loved my 4 years at BSC! I loved that I was able to take a wide variety of classes.  All of my professors really cared about their students. My classes were challenging,  but the professors were always there if I needed help. I had the opportunity to study abroad, complete an internship in Birmingham, and do research with professors. The only bad thing I could say about BSC is that the food could use some improvement and the dorms need more regular maintenance. Other than that, I highly recommend BSC. It is a place where students will be challenged, but those challenges will push them to meet their full potential."
Freshman,5,"The best choice I have ever made was choosing to go to Birmingham-Southern. The first two months were challenging academically, but socially I was thriving. The social atmosphere is everything that high school was not for me. I am not the type of girl to go out and introduce myself, but the college made sure those of us who are a little more introverted feel included. The professors are very understanding, but will still uphold you to an extraordinary standard. They genuinely care about your learning experience and make themselves extremely accessible to you when you have questions. Overall, I could not be happier with my decision for this school."
Freshman,5,BSC campus is beautiful and feels like home. I love the location near downtown Birmingham with lots to do. The size of the school makes it very easy to fit in and make friends. Academics are challenging and professors are very knowledgable and really get to know their students. I am really glad I chose BSC!
Freshman,5,"It is currently my freshman year. I love it here, the environment, the senary, it's so beautiful. Everyone is so friendly. They provide tutoring FOR FREE !! Which is great !!"
Junior,5,Birmingham-Southern is one of my favorite places on Earth. It has given me more than I could have ever expected and grateful doesn't even begin to cover it. I have met the most supportive of friends and the best of professors. It has the perfect location and the campus cats aren't bad either.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Birmingham-Southern College.  I was there from 2014-18, and during my time I learned so much, made great friends, and got to explore a new city that I grew to love."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE BSC. I live pretty far away from school so when I was searching for schools I was sure to look for one that felt like home. I knew the second that I walked onto BSC's campus that I had chosen correctly. This school is so great because it is so small. I feel like I am always at home when I can walk anywhere and always recognize someone. Class sizes are so small that your professors actually make an effort to get to know you and will help you with any problem you may have (school or non-school related.) I also love that unlike state schools there is not a huge emphasis on greek life; no one is forced into it and it most certainly is not required to have a social life on campus. One thing I would change at school is the caf. The caf does not have the best food but they do the best with what they get. Overall, BSC is a great place to be. Go Panthers!"
Sophomore,5,"This school has taught me a lot about myself in all aspects of life. I learned what I'm best at when it comes to academics and what I'm not so good at(more than in highscool) and the professors were always available to help me with whatever problem I had. Never a problem too big or small for them, and always with a smile on their face too!"
Niche User,5,"When I went to Birmingham Southern Select Southern on March 4-5, I had the most amazing time of my life.  I got to learn what the campus-life was really like and I met the most generous professors, students, and staffs that you could have ever met in your entire life. The president of Birmingham Southern was so sweet and strong-minded which made me want to attend Birmingham Southern because I was really inspired by her."
Junior,5,"This school is amazing. The student body is one big family, and the faculty are top notch. I could not see myself going anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"The campus is gated and very safe. The cafeteria hours could be better. It closes at certain times during the day and closes too early at night. The cafeteria doesn’t open until 11 on weekends, and they frequently run out of food."
Freshman,5,I love BSC and everything about it. This is where I feel at home even though I am 1000 miles away. When I go home I am always ready to get right back.
Niche User,5,"Birmingham-Southern College is a school notorious for its prestige scholars. They offer small class sizes that better enhance your learning experience, education experiences abroad to deepen your knowledge and help you select the perfect career field, and they are also a Christian based school that believe in strong morals."
Niche User,5,"Birmingham-Southern College is a great college. A few of my close friends attend BSC. I love visiting the campus. I attended ""Sample 'Southern"" and had the oppurtunity to sit in on a class and it was very interesting. I also had the oppurtunity to interact with current students and eat lunch at the ""caf."" I plan to attend to BSC next fall."
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful. The whole campus has a security fence around it, so you feel safe the whole time."
Junior,5,"I  always thought that I wanted to go to a big college, but after visiting Birmingham-Southern College I fell in love. The thing I love most is the small class sizes, the individual attention, and the personal relationships with the professors. They truly care about teaching and knowing that we are learning-not just going through the motions to get the grade/diploma. I have grown  personally and academically and I wouldn't change a thing."
Junior,5,"The students and faculty at BSC are so welcoming. My freshman year I was so upset leaving home, and some random stranger came and sat with me while I was freaking out. The students are very nice. And I am looking forward to our brand new food service that is going to expand the vegterain menu on our campus!"
Junior,5,"All of my professors have encouraged thoughtful, challenging discussion and critical thinking---practices I will be thankful for when entering the world beyond the classroom."
Alum,5,"Birmingham-Southern was not only a family and community itself, but the copious opportunities it provided and support I got was the best I've ever received from any place."
Alum,5,"Loves the faculty and Staff; I felt very supported and encouraged to be better. I also loved the community, where I was accepted for who I was and given opportunities for leadership and personal growth."
Alum,5,"BSC was where I made my lifelong friends, made valuable professional connections, and became the person that I want to be for the rest of my life. BSC helped me chart the course towards a bright future. The faculty is outstanding and always available for students, the administration is in touch with the community and its needs, and life on campus is a blast—and it's only getting better. Some of the residence halls are being renovated, and the new food service provider is going to make the cafeteria an even better place for students. I'm so excited to see what the future holds for this incredible institution."
Alum,5,"BSC has shaped me into who I am and I can't imagine my life without my experience there. I hope to see continual growth in diversity, and hope to see more students turn ""right"" off of campus. Although dubbed a ""bad area"", Arkadelphia road isn't all that scary, and students should go serve, get to know, and love the area they are around. I hope that everyone that goes to a 4 yr institution gets what I got out of bsc.  Go panthers and forward ever!"
Sophomore,5,BSC is an amazing institution that really promotes the value of the liberal arts. The campus is one big family and the level of education is superb
Alum,5,"BSC is not just a college, but it is a community. The professors, staff, and students create a welcoming, challenging atmosphere to help you make the most of your college experience. The professors truly care about each individual student and their success. In addition, the school gives students countless service, leadership, and extracurricular experiences to help them to develop interpersonal and professional skills to supplement their education to ultimately help them succeed post graduation."
Sophomore,5,Birmingham-Southern is absolutely a college centered around community. It allows students to excel in the classroom and grow outside of it. There are incredible opportunities to get involved with the school the second you step on campus. The whole staff and student population feel like family in no time.
Junior,5,"Birmingham Southern has been integral in molding me into a future leader and academic. It is so much more than an institution, it is a home. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here and could not have asked for a better undergraduate experience."
Freshman,5,"BSC is a wonderful school! Class size is small, professors are easy to talk to and we have a great Greek life."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is friendly and always helpful
College Junior,5,Professor and class really enhance my education.
College Freshman,5,"We have many advisers in different areas. My pre-health/med adviser is very helpful in that she allows for meetings to explain courses I need to take for my major and plans after college (grad school, med school). I'm given a predicted 4-year plan each time I meet with her and she is very flexible in changing my schedule to fit my needs or answering any questions I may have about my major/classes. The career center is very helpful and many job/internship opportunities are offered, as well as work-study options. The alumni network is strong and many alumni are successful and enjoy having BSC students as interns. Recruitment on campus is amazing--when I was being recruited, I felt like I was really wanted and that BSC already accepted me as a student. I love my school!"
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because of the small class sizes and close relationships with the professors. They really care about your success and are available for help most of the time. I have made many friends in the Honors program as well as in Greek life and on the track team. I have many resources including tutoring, the library, the career center, and the student center to help me on my path to success. I have enjoyed my experience so far and am looking forward to the coming years and what they may bring at Birmingham-Southern College."
College Sophomore,5,Felt at home right away
College Sophomore,5,"Our Greek Life is ranked among the Top 10 in the nation, so take whatever you want from that."
College Freshman,5,"The sense of family and community is overwhelming. Every professor, the staff, and the faculty go above and beyond. I would not trade my college for anything."
College Sophomore,5,Lots of scholarships are given
College Freshman,5,"BSC gives us a lot of freedom, it's good and bad."
College Freshman,5,Birmingham has some really great food anf variety.
College Freshman,5,BSC really supports students financially.
College Sophomore,5,"The Birmingham-Southern student has the great advantage (unlike many schools in the same conference) of being in a city, while maintaining a small town feel on campus. Off campus options are numerous, and have an excellent range of cost and quality. Student discounts are present at a few local restaurants and rumors suggest an expansion of BSC's panther buck system to include a wings restaurant nearby (although it is just a rumor)."
College Sophomore,5,"'It's the best' meaning that if you want a party, you can easily find one on the weekend. However, if that is not your thing or you need to study, you can distance yourself from them if wanted. Parties usually are located on the east side of campus, while academic buildings and dorms are located on the west side of campus. Everyone is friendly on campus, so parties are not usually exclusive (the only exclusive parties are Greek date parties, which an independent can still be invited to)."
College Sophomore,5,"The administration responds well to student interest, and handles any school violation fairly. Campus police does an amazing job of maintaining a safe college atmosphere despite its surroundings. Our current President, General Krulak is a gifted leader who is regionally revered. Krulak is charismatic and selfless, and has helped this school out of an economic struggle. Dean of Students, Ben Newhouse, also does an amazing job at keeping student disputes at a minimum. The result of this well organized administration is a wonderful college atmosphere that me feel at home."
College Sophomore,5,The admissions office as a whole is very efficient and professional. They truly reflect the friendly atmosphere of the school community.
Recent Alumnus,5,Very strong academic program. Rigorous with a heavy workload. Internship and job opportunities are plentiful in the right fields.
Recent Alumnus,5,One of the highlights of my BSC experiences. Greek students are the majority of the student body making the social atmosphere predominately greek. Greek students are mostly viewed positively and both greek and non-greek communities are accepting of each other. Greek housing is very available with each chapter having it's own house/townhome. Most members are required to live the house/townhome at some point during their college carrier.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Given that BSC is located 10min (driving) from downtown and has nothing within walking distance, the on-campus party scene is prominent. A majority of the student body is greek and most parties are hosted by greek organizations. Unlike bigger shcools, greek organizations at BSC are welcoming to non-greek memebers."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors are very engaging and care about the student's education. Professor accessibility is also second-to-none. As for classes, the variety of courses is excellent for a small school. The classes are taught in a unique manner that promotes critical thinking and student engagement. Most classes do not have in excess of 25 students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"On campus crime is fairly minimal. Given the neighborhood the campus is extremely secure with only one way in-or-out that is guarded 24/7/365. Campus police are well trained, extremely visible and extremely helpful."
College Freshman,5,"I am absolutely in love with BSC. I was impressed by what I found researching it on the website. But when I visited, I knew without a doubt that this was where I belong. The atmosphere here is one of acceptance and care. The small class sizes are a huge plus for me and he staff want you to do well. The completely fenced in campus along with the responsive, kind security make me feel safe and secure and the students and staff make me feel like family."
College Freshman,5,BSC has a little bit of everyone and everywhere. The diversity on campus is wide and everyone gets along with everyone. There is a welcoming and accepting tone the minute you enter the campus. All the students and staff welcome anyone and everyone with open arms and it takes no time for you to feel at home.
College Freshman,5,The campus always has security guards on duty 24/7. And they are super helpful and friendly. They'll even help you off campus if you call them. The campus has public phones that students can use to call security whenever they need them. The security officers will bring you back to campus after a night on the town or walk you back to your dorm after a late night study session.
College Sophomore,5,I can't wait to go back!!! I'd choose my school again in a heartbeat it has everything I could possibly ask for and I love every minute of it!!
College Sophomore,5,You follow the rules or your out!
College Sophomore,5,"I would definitely choose BSC again if I had it to do over. The staff and faculty, with the ever present exceptions, treat you like an individual and want to help you to succeed and do your best"
College Sophomore,5,"The business program is great. They provide every opportunity possible to help the students achieve their goals. Since I am looking to start my own business after college, I don't think I should have a problem finding a job within my field"
Recent Alumnus,5,A thriving Greek community that makes up around half of the student body drives the social scene on campus. They are also actively involved in community philanthropic efforts and perform well academically.
College Sophomore,5,"An Education ""Internship"" is really your senior project where you will go out into two different schools for a period of time and teach a lesson here and there in a classroom. It sounds sort of scary but by that time you will have observed in several classrooms and will be experienced."
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe. Campus police are great!
College Freshman,5,"Yes. Right now, I want to be a college history teacher, but I am concerned with paying for grad school in order to become a teacher."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this college is quite good. I am a studio arts major and I really enjoy that department, such as the classes and professors. Additionally, a majority of the staff I have interacted with have been very kind and supportive.
The dorms and campus upkeep could use some improvement. Additionally, the campus is fairly diverse, the campus could do a better job at making students and staff from all races/ethnicities, religions, genders, and sexual orientations feel more accepted and welcome.
Moreover, the campus is small, which I personally like, as this provides a more intimate feeling, especially when you live in campus housing.
Overall, even though that campus could use some improvements, I have enjoyed my time at Birmingham-Southern so far."
Senior,4,The college is gorgeous. The ratio between students to professors is small so there is more one on one time which is very helpful. I personally liked that the college was close to home so I could commute easily.
Niche User,4,"BSC is a great college for everyone to consider. The campus is beautiful and uniquely designed especially being on the top of the hill.  The people and professors are very friendly too. Also, the small class sizes give for a hands-on experience which creates a personal relationship with the professors and your classmates."
Junior,4,"When I was a freshman, I strongly considered transferring because you can easily feel trapped while on campus. Even though you join a billion clubs to get involved, you still feel as if you are missing out on a full college experience. This especially true for minority students on campus who want to strengthen their culture awareness etc. Now, I cannot speak on all minorities, but I can speak on the African-American experience. Growing up, we aspire to get a great degree with an am"
Sophomore,4,"Birmingham Southern has fostered a welcoming and inclusive environment. Despite its smaller size, it still offers a wide variety of opportunities for students to get involved with. Professors get to know their students, encouraging them to engage in one on one interactions. The classes are rather difficult, leading the students to put forth an excellent effort in order to achieve success."
Junior,4,"I love Birmingham Southern College. I chose to go here my junior year of high school, and I would make the same decision over and over again!"
Niche User,4,I love the diversity at Birmingham Souther and I love their teachers and coaching staff. I think Birmingham needs to remodel their school because it is kind of old.
Sophomore,4,"BSC is a life-changing place. You will be pushed academically, supported by all, and taught lessons in and out of the classroom."
Sophomore,4,I loved the family like experience you get at BSC. The faculty and staff are very welcoming and genuinely want you to succeed.
Alum,4,"Birmingham Southern College is a place that is always trying to improve. There is not as much diversity  as I would have hoped for as a student at BSC, but in my four years there  I saw a lot of growth and met a lot of accepting people."
Junior,4,"BSC has a lot to offer students who want to get involved and make the most of their college experience. There are so many opportunities to become a student leader, get involved in the community, and build relationships with professors and the administration. BSC is far from perfect, but it has really been improving in past years (the new food provider is a huge step in the right direction). Like any other school, what you get out of your experience at BSC reflects what you put in, and the students who do put a lot into their BSC experience have great outcomes."
Senior,4,I really enjoy the small community feel at Birmingham-Southern College. The professors and the many academic resources set students up for success. I am excited for the new food service as well as the renovation of freshmen resident halls.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Birmingham-Southern.  The academics were top notch.  The social scene was superb, assuming you're greek.  People were preppy, but not too clique-y.  The campus is beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of resources available, inside and outside."
College Sophomore,4,Bad area but great camp-po; little crime.
College Sophomore,4,Professor's are amazing at BSC. They are willing to help you learn all the material. They commit themselves to their work and their students. Classes are smaller making it a more engaging learning community.
College Sophomore,4,Birmingham-Southern College is listed as one of the safest campuses in the U.S. I feel totally comfortable waling around by myself at night time. Security is top-rated.
College Sophomore,4,Birmingham-Southern College's student's career prospects are high. Students at this school are very determined. The school  offers a lot of job and internship opportunities to its students.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life can be a big part of BSC.
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are small but up to date.
College Freshman,4,It's a really awesome school!
College Freshman,4,They always send out information about places that are hiring students and if you need help they have a student development center.
College Freshman,4,This school has top notch professors. I have had multiple conversations with all of my professors.
College Freshman,4,"Closed campus with police patrolling makes you feel safe, but some of the people on campus at parties can be sketchy."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of school spirit shown at sporting events even though some of the teams aren't the greatest.
College Junior,4,"I don't play myself, but the facilities and quality is second to none in the league"
College Junior,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at BSC. Academics challenge me.
College Freshman,4,Rated one of the safest schools in the south!  Emergency call buttons to call campus police are all around campus.
College Freshman,4,Amazing career services and contacts!
College Freshman,4,The courses and professors are excellent!  Teaching and content is very engaging.
College Freshman,4,"There are parties every weekend at fraternity row, and most parties are open to both Greeks and non-Greeks. Parties are popular and no one cares if you don't/do drink alcohol. However, students do care for each others' well being and will step in if someone needs help most of the time."
College Freshman,4,"The academics are satisfactory and the professors and diverse curriculum enhance the experience. The workload can get tough, but it was still manageable for me while participating in Greek life and athletics. There are special options for individual studies during interim term or studying abroad. The honors program also exposes students to different classes than one's major to engage their learning in different ways. Popular study areas are biology/pre-health, business/accounting, education, law, and urban environmental studies is an option."
College Freshman,4,"There are many diverse options and the courses are beneficial even if they're not part of your major. Professors and courses are challenging and allow you to think/problem-solve in ways that you may not be accustomed to. The class size is small and are often lecture-based, so student participation is great. This allows for close relationships to be formed and involvement is above average (compared to a large state school). Academic advisers are very helpful and really care about how you are doing and what classes you are taking to maximize your experience and success-fullness."
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience in a sorority--it has helped me meet more people and branch out of my comfort zone. I do not feel pressured to look or be a certain way; I am not judged for not going to a lot of parties or being shy. I can be myself, and though there may often be some tension between greek groups, we all know we are family and accept that we have our similarities and differences. Greek life on campus is very involved and sometimes it may be awkward to participate in things when you're not part of Greek life, but most Greeks are very inviting and friendly. I have several friends that are non-Greeks and we get along fine."
College Freshman,4,"BSC is a Division three athletic school, and even though we don't have the best facilities in the country, our spirit and involvement ranks high because of our close-knit community and expectations for success. Many students on campus are involved in either intramural sports or an athletic team--if not, our fitness center (Striplin) is widely used for physical activities. Our Student government and greek life encourages the student body to go out and support our sports teams; our student-athlete relationships are different than they would be if at a larger university."
College Sophomore,4,No cost to go to watch
College Sophomore,4,"Student athletes at BSC strive for greatness. Being a Division III school, athletics are typically not found to be the stronghold, or what gives the university its name. At BSC however, they shine just the same. Athletes are highly respected, but not worshipped, which is a factor I applaud the campus for upholding. This gives a greater sense of a family. Win or lose, we take pride in giving it our all."
College Sophomore,4,"This school has changed my life in ways I never thought possible. From my time here so far, I have relearned how to think, observe, and work inside and outside of class. BSC is a place you never knew you needed, where you find answered you never knew to ask for. It focuses not on teaching what is already known, but preparing a generation to search for the unknown."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall good, some little things"
College Sophomore,4,"Its good at first, but then gets tiring"
College Freshman,4,"Dorm life makes a sense of community, it's great."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing placement is simple. It works through a fair lottery system that is based upon GPA, year, and culture credits (an additional requirement of attending BSC - essentially 24 official presentations must be viewed). Housing quality fair to excellent depending on what you would like to pay. A downside to housing would most likely present itself in the fact that first year students are required to live in dorms in which the quality is completely dependent upon how each student treats it."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is secure, but not restricting. It allows students to have their freedom, while still keeping everyone safe."
College Freshman,4,there is a lot of school spirit. Especially around homecoming. its not unlikely to see students in school gear and sales in the bookstore.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are fairly spacious. it's got decent closet space and the atmosphere is pretty friendly.
Recent Alumnus,4,The education is strong. School's familiarity outside of Alabama is limited. Highly recommended for students interested in the arts or the medical field.
Recent Alumnus,4,Overall the campus is quiet and beautiful. Very much caters to the students' needs.
Recent Alumnus,4,Internship requirement could be better.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I took a job outside of the school's typical career focus, meaning I had to do a lot of the foot work individually. However, the alumni network and career center are very helpful on average."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a small school, the administrators are visible and connected with the student body. The president of the school greatly impacts the experience. The president deeply cares about the students and their academic career. He makes the BSC experience life-changing by himself."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The Business program at BSC is one of a kind. It provides a rare critical thinking approach to the business world that is invaluable in modern business. The curriculum builds a foundation that allows students to excel in any business related career. The program is designed to teach students to learn-to-learn from a business standpoint. That said, the technical skills taught are minimal but students are given the tools needed to learn those skills on the job."
Recent Alumnus,4,Birmingham has a diverse dining scene that provides plenty of options for students.
Recent Alumnus,4,BSC is very generous with financial aid.
College Freshman,4,The college is fairly generous with financial aid. I was given about half of the funds I needed in merit based aid. The remainder was covered by need based aid also from the college and a few manageable loans. The financial planning team at BSC made the whole process very simple and easy. I had my award letter within weeks of submitting my FAFSA.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of variety in the Norton dining hall. They have just about everything you could want to eat including vegetarian dishes. My personal favorite is the make your own Caesar salad bar. And there's plenty of space so finding a seat is no problem.
College Sophomore,4,My program has many different options in my curriculum.
College Sophomore,4,There is a little bit of everyone on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Im apart of a varsity sports team and I have never received so much support from my school!!
College Sophomore,4,My school is very challenging! Everyday you constantly are being challenged inside and outside the classroom.
College Sophomore,4,We have so many options to study whatever and wherever we please!
College Sophomore,2,"Conditions bad, social scene not great."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food will get you by but off-campus food is much preferred. 4 years after leaving, I still avoid Subway."
Recent Alumnus,2,Only a minority of students chose off-campus living. The most viable options for off-campus living are 10-15 min away (or more during high traffic hours). I would recommend staying on-campus all 4 hours.
College Junior,2,Almost every important student organization such as SGA is basically a Greek popularity contest.
College Freshman,2,there are some extremely pretty girls and some terrible looking fat ones and no in-between
College Freshman,2,Nightlife at BSC is more hit or miss but most of the time nothing is there
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I am not much of a party person so I was not crazy about the party scene."
College Freshman,2,The location of campus makes it very difficult to maneuver around town if you don't have a car.
College Freshman,2,"The people in the program are wonderful, but the program lacks opportunities and post-graduate support."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many describe the campus as being very WASP-y, which is not inaccurate. The school has long been working to increase diversity, but it remains an area for growth."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Division III athletics with Division I facilities. There isn't a huge amount of student support at most of the games, which is a bit disappointing. Great programs with great coaches for a school of its size, though."
College Junior,2,Choices limited and often repeated but all things considered they're edible and they have theme days!
College Junior,2,"Birmingham-Southern markets a well-rounded, inclusive Greek environment.  However, that is not always the case.  The social atmosphere is often clouded by assumptions and rumors about different Greek organizations, and there is often hostility and judgement within the sororities.  Having been an active member of a prestigious sorority for 3 years at BSC, I dropped my Junior year and only wish I had done so sooner!  I've been able to get involved with so many other campus groups that really focus on what I am interested in and the service-learning opportunities that I want to be involved with.  Being a Greek member severely limited my time, as well as my self-esteem on more than one occasion.  It's expensive, it gets crazy competitive and often hostile, and you are more than a few letters across your chest."
College Senior,2,"The food is good, but it's overpriced and the cafeteria isn't very clean. There also aren't very many different options; you either eat in the cafeteria or you eat prepackaged junk food."
College Senior,2,"This school assigns ""the green curb"" to teachers. Unfortunately, the faculty takes advantage of student parking spaces, and therefore, much of the green curbs are empty spaces. Fines for a student in a faculty parking spot will result in a 25 dollar penalty. There are too many green curbs than what is needed."
College Junior,2,"Housing is poor at best. Most buildings are old and not up to date at all. The school is trying to clean them up, but there's only so much they can do."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone Seems the Same – There is a lot of diversity at BSC, but there is also a lot of similarities. When you look around the campus, everyone looks the same. Even people of different a ethnicity seem to dress and act the same as those around them. However, it's something that is only superficial."
College Sophomore,2,"""Token"" Isn't Just a South Park Character. The Birmingham-Southern campus is like any other small, over-priced liberal arts school-- predominately middle-class and white. However, there is good news for minority students-- you will be featured on the website! There are organizations for minority students to get involved in, but otherwise there is little notice of racial or class differences among students, regardless of the Southern geographic location of the school. With a campus this small, everyone has to get along."
College Sophomore,1,"-The only 'good' choice on campus is Subway. This becomes quite tiresome and expensive considering that you must pay for a meal plan as well. With the amount of panther bucks you receive, you would only be able to eat at Subway on the weekends without moving to out-of-pocket expenses. 

-The restaurant list provided (excluding Subway) is misleading. To be clear, restaurants such as the Pizza and Pasta restaurant are, in actuality, segments of the cafeteria. They are not independent restaurants. There is a Starbucks coffee machine in the c-store, not a Starbucks coffee shop. 

-Cafeteria meals are usually consumed with great reluctance; do not be fooled by nicer tour day cafeteria meals. While it is not terrible the first year, it gets old quickly after due to a lack of extended variety. I do not suspect this is due to administration or cafeteria employees, rather Aramark (whose contract may or may not end soon). In light of this, improvements have been made in the past year and hopefully will continue on this path. You can get by on these meals, however, it is not an excellent experience. 

-The convenience stores on campus are grossly overpriced. You will pay 50% to 300% more in the name of convenience (as viewed by a student; the reason for this extreme pricing may be due to Aramark's management costs or something entirely different, but the outcome is not changed). Many students are unable to go off campus and purchase supplies due to the nature of the surrounding area (it is often viewed as a bad part of town, however, campus police does a stunning job of keeping everything inside of the campus gate well protected). Whomever profits from these stores must make quite a bit of dough. 

-Despite these things, the quality of education and community far outweighs the quality of food at BSC. Just keep in mind that food expenses per year will be a higher than expected."

College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. There are parking lots designated for certain dorms but the residents don't park there, instead they park in parking lots designated for other students, like behind our sorority houses. The people there have to park so far away just to get a spot. It's awful."
College Sophomore,1,"There are hardly any parking spaces, so when a student parks in the faculty/staff parking space, they get a fine of about $25. So arrive in enough time to find a designated parking spot. If you have guest and they park in the wrong parking spot, they can get fined and it gets billed on your account, so be very careful. The campus police aren't afraid to rack up the tickets."
College Sophomore,1,"Dont Count on It – Pretty much everyone lives on campus, with the exception of a few upperclassman and people who already lived in Birmingham. The campus is in the middle of a neighborhood you would not want to live in, and you're pretty much required to live there until you are 21/ a junior."

Alum,5,"I attended Gannon University from 2011 through 2015 as, Electrical Engineering Major, and here is my take:
-  courses are taught from a very experienced facility. All professor has tons of experience, so they will teach you what you need in the real world instead of wasting your time with useless information.
- Campus is pretty and heart of the Erie area, a lot to do. 
- very diverse, so you will meet fascinating people and grow your network and you as a person"
Freshman,5,"My online learning experience has been very positive, professors are very understanding and do everything they can to make the most out of this time."
Freshman,5,"Gannon University is a very welcoming school. There are many resources for everyone no matter who you may be. This School gives you many opportunities in the health science area as well as in business and engineering. You will never feel alone here, everyone is going through the same thing, especially during this time. They are here to prepare you for your career"
Freshman,5,"Gannon is an amazing school. There is a very huge support system here. There are so many resources to ensure that you succeed in your 4 years at Gannon and for your future here. I especially love the way they are handling school during the pandemic. They made it so that we were able to come back on campus and enjoy an in-person experience. They are strict with masks, maximum capacities, social distancing, and keeping clean. While most colleges have closed down after a week or two of being on campus, Gannon's methods have allowed students to be on campus for over a month."
Freshman,5,My experience at gannon right now is very good. I met some amazing people who are truly my close friends and make me happy. My first class was kinda weird to adjust to but I got over it and made it work even if covid-19 is still going around. Although we are going through a difficult time I managed to meet some really amazing people who really have my back and I'm very happy I will be spending the next 4 years at gannon university.
Freshman,5,The online experience at gannon is really good. It makes me feel I'm still in a real classroom setting. Also my friends are still helping me through my classes after I get off the zoom so I'm very happy I'm in an environment that people are willing to help me if I'm stuck on anything.
Freshman,5,"Gannon University is very involved with each student's life and is willing to do all that it takes to make college a positive experience. The professors are often directly from the field of study and give their life experience to apply it to each student. Being a commuter, Gannon works hard to ensure that we are integrated well into the college atmosphere and are as involved as residents."
Alum,5,Gannon University is a great institution and recent momentum signals that the best years are ahead. The leaders of Gannon seem to be tuned in and focused on success.
Freshman,5,"I love Gannon University because the small school class sizes were great for my academics. The teaching staff offer a lot of support, our standard of learning is excellent, and our success rate is very high. I am a Business Manager in college and is really preparing me for job market."
Freshman,5,"Gannon is such a pretty school. I am a nursing major and the staff is great. They have helped me so much transitioning from high school to college. When I went for orientation everyone on the campus was so welcoming and excited for me and all the other new incoming students to be there. It was super hot out and they still made sure to keep a smile on their faces. I am rooming in North hall and the hall is beautiful. There is a good balance between the boys and the girls which is good. I struggled a little bit with the financial aid process. I called very frequently and each time if no one answered, I left a voicemail and within that day or the following day, my call was returned and my questions were answered. I felt that, that was really nice because I wasn't sure what to do and they were all so helpful. Overall, I haven't had a bad experience at Gannon and I genuinely love the atmosphere as a whole."
Sophomore,5,"Gannon University is a beautiful university. Everyone, including the staff and professors are outgoing. Gannon is a roughly small campus, so there will never be a time where you walk from building to building without seeing someone you know. Gannon gives great leadership opportunities through multiple programs they hold throughout the year. Gannon also provides a great travel program for students to give back, and learn about other cultures and countries they might be interested in. The classroom size is about 20 students, which I enjoy because I am not overwhelmed by 100 people in a classroom. The professors at Gannon are very passionate about what they’re teaching. They also care about every student in their classroom. Gannon offers a beautiful library on campus that people value especially during finals week. Gannon also offers a huge rec center for all students. There is endless amount of equipment, and a huge gym that is also open to students."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed how friendly the faculty was on my first visit.  Brand new dorms were an added bonus.  Gannon has a large variety of majors and programs to choose from.
Niche User,5,Gannon is a fun and unique campus that gives all types of kids a wonderful and enlightening learning experience
Freshman,5,The professors really care about the students and they all make an effort to know your name. They also offer a multitude of great opportunities for study abroad as well as financial support.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Gannon and I am beyond happy I choose to go here. I made the best friends anyone could ask for. If I could change anything it would be the dinning hall hours and maybe become a little more organized with the amazing events they have and that’s it! I can’t wait to continue my journey!
Freshman,5,Gannon University gives a very good background for pharmacy students in their pre-pharmacy program. I do not have anything to change about Gannon University.
Junior,5,I am a current student-athlete at Gannon University and they accomodate so well when it comes to balancing athletics and academics.
Freshman,5,Your second home. People are amazing and there are so many activities all day everyday. Parties are the best
Sophomore,5,"It is amazing can't wait to attend this fall. The atmosphere is wonderful, very supportive,  and adaptive."
Sophomore,5,I loved how Gannon is one big family. Everybody is looking out for your best interest and you know pretty much everybody you see while walking to class.It's a tight knit group of students with a lot of activities and clubs available for students.
Sophomore,5,Gannon will do whatever it takes to make sure that all of its students get the best out of their education. They are focused and committed to what they do.
Niche User,5,"The professors are extremely friendly and very professional. The campus and campus resources (library, gym/rec center/cafes/bookstore) are phenomenal."
Niche User,5,Gannon's students are so welcoming! They made me feel right at home even though I was a dual enrollment student. The professors were more than helpful with getting me adjusted to the college work load. I LOVE GANNON!!!
Graduate Student,5,Gannon University is an excellent university that takes students in and gives them the opportunity to grow as a person. It’s faith based values allow for those to practice their faith as well as be engulfed in their studies and be involved in anything and everything possible.
Alum,5,Gannon was amazing.  They had a 4 year plan not just semester. Financial aid was able to find enough grants for me to only pay for 1 year!!
Freshman,5,I absolutely love everything Gannon has to offer! The downtown atmosphere is fantastic. The teachers are engaging and make it fun to come to class. The students at Gannon clearly love being there.
Sophomore,5,"The professors genuinely care and will do whats in their power to help you succeed, the atmosphere is very welcoming."
Freshman,5,"I love my Knight Family!!  Gannon is a small school in the heart of Erie PA.  Because we are a small school, we form strong bonds with those that we meet.  The activities are well planned, the meals are great, the dorms are clean.  Our RA is absolutely amazing and my first year here has been absolutely amazing!"
Alum,5,"Loved Gannon, close to Erie nightlife, small close-knit school, teachers knew who you were and formed connection with you, excellent school for any medical profession"
Freshman,5,"My initial decision was not to attend Gannon because of the inter-city campus and their Criminal Justice program (while reputable) was not as renowned as that of Mercyhurst.  However, I ended up selecting it after all because of the considerable scholarships they offered me, and on my first day I fell in love with my university.  The classes are interesting, the professors are engaging, the students are friendly, and I feel like I belong.  Gannon has become my home in many ways, and I would not change my choice if I could."
Senior,5,Gannon University has changed my life. I gave me the confidence to become the leader I am today. I wish I could relieve my college experience. Everyone knows everyone on campus and it is a very close family of friends. I wouldn't change my experience for anything. Thank you Gannon.
Freshman,5,Gannon University is a wonderful school in which you feel you are getting a great education for your money.  I have only been here for a couple month but I know I would not want to go to any other school due to the great community atmosphere Gannon University provides along with the great education.
Freshman,5,"The professors , staffs and students are amazingly friendly and supportive. There is always a lot to do at Gannon university, lots of activities and free food. Relative small campus but huge in social lifestyle."
Freshman,5,"Hello guys, my experience at Gannon university is fabulous, in fact the university is one amongst the best in the world.Having access to study in such an educational melieu is the best thing one can ever achieved as preprepation of his future career indeed.

Thank you."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Greek life makes campus livelier in my opinion. The Greeks, APB, SGA and a lot of the clubs are responsible for a majority of the events on campus."
College Freshman,5,We have a brand new athletic center and it has some many opportunities and not just for those who want to exercise but our PT/OT students.
College Freshman,5,"For where our campus is located, I feel we have a very good security system. Campus police are always on patrol during the day and night. The university also has call boxes on campus that a person can use if they see anything suspicious. Another thing that the university has is the Knight Watch. This is a group of students that are assigned different buildings on campus. Their job is to escort students and faculty to other buildings, their car, or wherever they need to go. They radio in every hour, when they leave for an escort, when they arrive at the location, when they're leaving the location, and when they return to their assigned building. This is my job on campus and I love it."
College Freshman,5,"My classes are fun, but challenging. They really make me learn, yet keep me on my toes and make me more independent. The professors are very friendly and helpful as well. Another thing I like is that for each major, the university gives a guide that students are encouraged to follow to get the credits they need for their degree. I really love the class sizes too. That was one of my biggest fears coming to college. I was scared that I would be in a classroom with 300 other kids and just be another test that the professor would have to grade. It's not like that at all though. I think the most I had in a classroom was 35 students, and the least was 10 students. It really allows myself as a student to get to know the professors and for them to know who I am as a person."
College Freshman,5,"Getting an internship is really easy with the help of professors. For my field, the professor in charge of internships is a former FBI agent. He has offered to help me on multiple occasions to get an internship at the FBI office closer to where I live because he worked there at one point in his career. Even though he is in charge of the internships, the other professors in my major help in every way possible to make sure students are getting internships as well."
College Freshman,5,"I couldn't be any happier with where I live on campus. The people there are very kind and accepting of everyone in the dorm. We are our own family on campus and we look out for each other throughout the year. A few of us have even decided to stay another year in our dorm with affinity housing. It's the cheapest out of the freshman options and the oldest building out of them. The only time I don't like where I live is when it's time to do laundry. It's very chaotic and hectic to try and get a free washer or dryer. And a lot of the time, when you're waiting for a dryer, people will take your clothes out of the washer and put them somewhere. Nobody uses the whiteboard that's on the wall to figure out whose clothes are in what machine. I think that would help tremendously. It really doesn't effect me though because I do my laundry at about 1:30 in the morning, but there are off occasions where I have to do it earlier and fight for a machine."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely fell in love with the campus the first day I got here. Everything is right here and if I need to go somewhere off of campus, we can take the bus for free thanks to the university. I've also met so many great people here on campus and made a lot of forever friends. The professors that are involved in my major are phenomenal! A good bit of them are former government agents and have experience in the field. They offer real life accounts of situations they have dealt with in their careers. It really helps me learn and I love it."
College Junior,5,"Newly remodeled apartments, great housing"
College Junior,5,Greek Life is very involved on campus and in community
College Junior,5,It is the best fit for me. The atmosphere is unique
College Senior,5,Health Science Professionals could not pick a better place to go to school
College Senior,5,Gannon was a difficult adjustment but one of the best decisions of my life! I wouldn't change it
College Senior,5,I just finished my term as president of my sorority and it has been one of the greatest experiences I could ever want! It is a great way to get involved and it truly a meaningful experience and brings forth so many opportunites
College Senior,5,I've had an exceptionally excellent experience compared to my friends at other local schools.
College Freshman,5,"It is a great school, they do a lot to include everyone, even the commuters. Proud to be a GU Knight."
College Freshman,5,I love the food around Erie.
College Sophomore,5,I really like on campus food and the options but I wish there were more ways to use your meals and that you could use more than three meal swipes per day.
College Sophomore,5,I love Gannon's housing. It has provided the best living and learning environment for me.
College Freshman,5,Love this School Proffessors so helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Just recently switched from the Physician Assistant program to the nursing program. The Physician Assistant program was great and very interesting, lots of work and time have to be put into it, and needed to apply early to get in. This program wasn't for me, but I am in the nursing program now and I love it. Obviously you're going to have a lot of work to do in this field, but the counselors and teachers are very helpful to get you through it. Especially since the classes are smaller than most colleges, it is easier to get in touch with your teacher. My mother is a physician recruiter for the Cleveland Clinic and doctors/nurses/managers etc look forward to working with students who graduated from Gannon and talk highly of them."
College Sophomore,5,"Gannon's professors are very helpful and respectful to all students. Since the class sizes are small, it is easier for you and your professor to relate and have a better relationship than if there were more students in the class. Registering for classes is fairly easy and can be stressful at times, but you usually the classes you need/want. Many majors especially the health field majors require a good amount of workload, which may take up most of your time at school. Gannon is also well known for their studying abroad programs, which many students take part in."
College Sophomore,5,"Love going to the football games and watching our team play. Not the most popular school for football, but there is enough school spirit to get them going. The recreational center is being rebuilt and redone for the 2014/2015 school year. Excited to see what has come out of all the construction work that has been our view this past year!"
College Sophomore,5,"Gannon is a very secure place and they are sure to enforce rules and regulations among the students. Everywhere you look you can see a GU police driving in the streets no matter what time of the day/night. I personally feel safe during the day, but always make sure I am walking with someone at night. They also have students you can call any time of the night to come and walk you to your dorm no matter where you are."
College Junior,5,The physician assistant program is great! It is unique because you are able to earn a master's degree in 5 years instead of the usual 6. The workload of the program is a lot but it is to be expected with the accelerated nature of the program.
College Sophomore,5,"Class size is small compared to other schools. The teachers know you by name, which is a benefit. There are so many different courses offered, from yoga to human gross anatomy. Class styles vary depending on the professor and type of class taken."
College Sophomore,5,"The alumni network is huge in Erie. Gannon in known for a variety of different academics, so career-finding should not be a big problem."
Alum,4,"I took a few online classes in summer, nothing negative to say, professors were there for me when I needed them"
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience is for the most part good. Gannon has these cameras that are attached to the monitors that track your professor as they move across the front of the room, that way, whatever is being taught on the board can still be seen."
Freshman,4,It is a really fantastic community at Gannon that is dedicated to supporting others. You really do find a sense of community and begin to thrive on the university. Almost all of the facilities are perfect in condition and perform very well for students like me. The only problem is some of the partiers around and it is very difficult to crack down on them. However it is not the universities responsibility to control the students even when they head off campus. They made clear outlines of the punishments for breaking rules centered around partying and COVID and that is the most important factor. Overall the university and the community are one of the best I have ever seen and I am very happy being a student at Gannon University.
Freshman,4,Obviously there comes some problems every once in a while and with everyone converting to online it becomes very difficult to manage all of it so quickly. The online experience is not unbearable at all and we are able to learn and continue classes despite the new norm we have to go through.
Junior,4,"Gannon University strives to make all students feel included, as a commuter, I feared that I would not be able to have a real college experience and that I would struggle with making friends, and connecting to my work, however Gannon has many resources available that are perfect for me such as the commuters lounge to be sure that commuters feeling including with campus lifestyle. As a Nursing major, Gannon curriculum has pushed me a lot to understanding my future role as a Nurse. Overall all the staff are very caring about your future."
Junior,4,"My online experience went well. Especially when the covid-19 scene came up. both the teachers and students where willing to help each other. However, at the end of the day I have always prefered face to face classes."
Junior,4,"My first semester of school I felt very out of place, especially while living on campus. However, during my second semester i was able to make the right friends and go to different school events that changed my overall perspective into something positive. However, tuition at Gannon is a little higher but good scholarships are given out. Gannon is a well diverse group that makes every feel right at home"
Senior,4,Some teachers are more willing to work with you outside of class when you're struggling with assignments or understanding concepts. Others simply refuse to help and expect you to figure it out on your own because you're in college now.
Junior,4,I like that Gannon offers so many different and unique majors. I also love that the class sizes are small so your professors actually get to know you and reach out when they feel you need help. Its a great experience.
Freshman,4,The professors are awesome and are very real with you. Also the food is pretty good as well and most people on campus are very nice.
Senior,4,"Gannon University is aamedium-sized university which is great for students who want a great college experience without a small-town feel of being too overwhelmed. The campus is in Erie, Pa - Erie has great attractions but lacks a safe environment."
Junior,4,I transferred from a state school to Gannon University after my freshman year. The Gannon community is a fun and welcoming group of people. I am a member of the swim team and feel well connected on campus. I am a finance major with a minor in psychology. I feel that the academics are difficult but fair.
Alum,4,Gannon is a small private university that has a lot to offer. It resides in a smaller college town where there is plenty to do. The staff is great and truly cares for the students. You will get a great education while enjoying your time.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Gannon is good. I like that the professor really do care for their students and their success.  They provide services that help their students with their studies and their mental health as well.  The only issue I have is that the campus is not very diverse but they do make you feel welcome.
Sophomore,4,"I love Gannon, I know a lot of the staff and people. I will say it can be welcoming if you put yourself out there."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time here at Gannon. It is definitely a dated campus, could use some updating. the student involvement is fantastic. They are very involved with Greek life, clubs organizations. There is always something going on."
Niche User,4,"I love the area where the school is located. i attend the acrobatics and tumbling camp, the camp was nice we stay the night at the school and practice with the team the girls was nice and very helpful and the coaches was very nice. it felt like home to me for just stay there for 2 days."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere at gannon university! Most professors are amazing and truly care about your experience! Gannon athletics are amazing as well! They give great scholarships and placements are getting better and better every single year!
Sophomore,4,Gannon offers a lot of activites for the students to get involved in. Their indoor facility is extremely nice compared to other division 2 colleges.
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student and study OT.  I feel that this school is an excellent place to go for those who desire to be academically enriched.  However, as an athlete for the school, I don't feel they do enough to accommodate a busy schedule.  It often falls on the individual to compensate (ex: paying 100/month for a sports club) which is very difficult at times although not impossible.   Admissions is not the best either, I found that as a transfer student many details with my application were ignored or overlooked."
Sophomore,4,I love the class sizes at Gannon.  It allows for personal relationships between the professors and the students.  It helps the students do better because the professors care about the success of each student.  The food options available could be improved upon.  There are not many options for students with special dietary needs and restrictions.
Freshman,4,I love how diverse Gannon is. They celebrate other countries events and I truly love that. I would the food choice to have more variety as well as the price could be change a little bit.  It'as a little expensive for the food you get.
Freshman,4,"Gannon is a small, yet very active, campus with a very diverse group of students and staff.  Everyone I have met has been very kind and willing to help in any way possible.  I would highly recommend the Sports & Exercise Science program.  One of the best I've seen in Pennsylvania."
Freshman,4,"Gannon university has been nothing less than a second home for me. I think that there are a lot of people here who are warm and welcoming, but are also eager to learn and create a future for themselves. One thing I would like to see change is how they go about upcoming sophomores housing arrangements and making sure there is enough housing for everyone."
Freshman,4,"I like Gannon because their professors are extremely helpful and respectful. All of the professors here want to help you learn and help you to succeed in life. They provide you with great housing opportunities. All around, Gannon is a wonderful school and I am proud to go here."
Sophomore,4,"This school's PA program is great! Teachers are nice and helpful. They are very good at answering questions. You can tell they are trying to make the school a better place to learn. In addition, they have multiple ways of getting involved. The honors program is also something i recommend to all. I love honors classes as opposed to the typical classroom because honors classes are smaller. The only drawback I can think of is the work-study. They do not offer many options on campus. They tend to higher previous students which means there is no way you can get a job on campus unless a student who works for them graduates."
Alum,4,"Gannon was a great private catholic school. However I do not believe it was worth the money, and there are administrative matters that could be handled better."
Freshman,4,"As an international student, I can say that gannon is a very well diversed university. Also it has so many events going around for people from so many different countries and different cultures. The professor and staffs here are awesome and makes you feel home and are very helpful. The security is so good that i can get a ride home from the college live safe app during night hours which makes it convenient for me to use library facilities even during night. The only thing I would recommend is if the college could upgrade the housing and food."
Sophomore,4,Professors truly care about their students! Classrooms are nice. Things I would change are the on campus apartments and the food.
Freshman,4,This university is different than many in that the campus is not a closed campus. The town and campus intermingle as well as the individuals living there. Some times the people you must contact to ask questions such as administration can be quite rude. This is the only major thing I have noticed.
Niche User,4,"Overall was not terrible, however I had quite a few bad adjuncts and professors. Understanding professors."
Junior,4,"It is a small campus, so you are able to meet people and get to know professors. Granted, it gets cold here, so be prepared for that."
College Junior,4,"The teachers really invest their time in their students and want you succeed, and they provide you with information that is beneficial and not just busy work."
College Junior,4,"Gannon is a smaller school which is why I love it so much. The professors are helpful and create personal relationships with the students that have helped me with my studies, as well as approaching teaches in time of need."
Recent Alumnus,4,Alumni are very involved and willing to help with internships
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus Security vehickes are almost ALWAYS around. The station is located in the middle of campus. The Erie police station is also nearby
Recent Alumnus,4,"Nice dorms. Best ones are North, harbor view, and the apartments though some may put you far from the classes. The campus is beautiful during the spring summer, and is in walking distance to the lake"
Recent Alumnus,4,"We dont have a huge stadium for football, our gym is quite large, and apparently we have a baseball field I have never seen; but school spirit is DEFINITELY there. I love going to football and basketball games."
Recent Alumnus,4,Joining a club/sorority/frat is probably the best decision you could make at this university. Gives you and outlet from just studying and working. Great way to make friends and memories!
College Freshman,4,So far I have found this school to be exactly what I was looking for as a senior in high school. I went to a college prep school and they truly helped shape the environment that I was going to eventually be in and that was very beneficial. By going to a school such as that I can talk to my professors with ease because they are very welcoming and kind.
College Freshman,4,This college truly wants the best for everyone who comes here. There are many opportunities for everyone to get practice for the real world and ways to make some money on the side here.
College Freshman,4,"As a freshmen you can live in one of three buildings. North Hall which is very new and well designed, Wherle hall which is somewhat older and the freshmen only dorm Finnegan. North Hall has many great conveniences with a gym, two floors of laundry, and kitchens on the first and third floor."
College Freshman,4,As a freshmen in my second semester so far I have truly grown up here at college.  My first semester I was timid and stuck to just my books but now i've made lots of friends and I enjoy the community.
College Freshman,4,"I went to one football game. It was rainy, so I guess that had a huge factor on why there weren't many people. Those people that were there though were full of spirit. There was one group completely covered in school colors. Our recreation center is amazing. It's new, so it still has that shine to it. The people that work there are great and very accommodating and helpful. During my first semester, I was at the Rec a lot. My friends and I would play volleyball. The staff would help us set up and on really slow nights, they would take turns playing a round with us. I love going to the Rec whenever I can fit in into my schedule."
College Junior,4,"Internships are available, research is published"
College Junior,4,The class sizes are extremely reasonable
College Junior,4,Our recreation center was just remodeled. Used a lot
College Student,4,The health center is very helpful. they provide basic care and some basic medicine. they are also very supportive of sexual assault victims. The erie are is not the safest but camps generally is.
College Student,4,"I really like my school. I have had a great experience here so far and am sure it will continue over the next few years. I like my classes, professors, classmates and everything else. the only thing I do not like is the freshmen visitation hours and how boys cannot sleep in our rooms as freshmen."
College Student,4,students have an easy time finding jobs after graduation. It is easy to be in touch with internships through advisors and professors.
College Student,4,There are a variety of housing options. Suite style and traditional. The dorms are a good size and one of the buildings has brick walls which provide a nice homey feel. They are kept pretty clean throughout the week. There is a good social aspect to the buildings as well
College Student,4,"Greek life seems pretty active on campus. They are involved in various fundraiser, volunteer opportunities and fun activities. There is no noticeable different treatment between greeks and non greeks"
College Student,4,"The athletic facilities are only a year old so they are up to date and very nice. They are good for athletes and non athletes. There are many different workout machines and weight machines available so there is something for everyone. Club sports are developing here. I am on the club soccer team and it is only their 2nd year but it is fun. I am glad I joined because I got to meet students who shared a passion for soccer. I made some great friends on the team however if you are not on a club sport no one really knows about it. Intramurals are involved in a lot by a variety of students. The varsity sports are well supported by students, faculty, alumni and parents."
College Student,4,I have had a great experience so far at Gannon University. The professors are very nice approachable and helpful. There is always something planned on campus that fits a variety of student interests. I have made great friends because mostly everyone is so nice. The classes are engaging and teach a lot. The class sizes are small which helps create a better learning environment and better relationships with professors. I would choose Gannon again. I am very happy here.
College Senior,4,"Though Gannon was my last-ditch school, I ended up there aftee transferring a few times.  I almost wish I had attended GU initially, however I might not be able to appreciate the school as much without my prior alternative school experiences."
College Senior,4,I love my program and the support within it. The small classroom size is great!
College Senior,4,As first year students we are mandated on education on sexual assult
College Senior,4,Brand new athletic and recreation center!
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are not terribly difficult, and the professors do not try to play games or trick you on tests. Most professors hand out study guides. The workload is very manageable, because most students also play sports or have a job."
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are small with about 20-40 students, which makes it easier to pay attention and learn. The professors really care about what they are teaching and care about if the student is actually learning."
Junior,2,Sexual assault is swept under the rug. Police and Safety responds to emergency calls minutes too late. Professors are set in their ways and do not push success. Advisors are clueless. Food is flavorless. You have to physically be homeless to receive any financial aid. Disappointing experience.
Alum,2,"This college education (as a Biology major) was not worth what I paid for.  The professors in the Biology department were a hit or miss -- don't get me wrong, there are a couple professors I could name off that were fantastic, but I can only count those professors on one hand. Made some of the courses more difficult than classes needed to be. Gannon tries to weed out students late in their secondary education career with the intention to require additional semesters on top of the 4 years required for an undergraduate degree.  A great example of this is only offering certain classes every other semester/year.  I would highly recommend students to look somewhere else, because if I could do it all again, I would be anywhere but Gannon University."
College Senior,2,Not many course options especially major specific. Hard to get into needed classes even as a senior graduating in one semester.
College Sophomore,2,"At Gannon, violating the visitation policy is a bigger deal than being caught with alcohol, drugs or cheating."
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria only serves good food when there are groups on campus.  The best place to eat on campus is the Courtyard Cafe in the lower level of Morosky, which is the health sciences building on 9th street.  There are strange hours at Morosky, but the food is made to order and the pesto mayonnaise is fantastic!  Knights cove closes at 6:30.  The cafeteria closes at 8:00.  Doc's closes a bit later.  There is a ""convenient"" store in the North Hall lobby, but it is closed most of the time.  The meal swipes do not carry over through the weeks, so it is wise to keep track of the number of swipes you use.  The cafeteria is all you can eat, most of which is make-your-own."
College Senior,2,"The apartments that I have lived in are suitable in size for the number of people living in them. However, every little sound can be heard from the street, apartments around yours, and within the apartment. The apartments are also an outrageous price for the size and condition. They are clean, but for the cost to live in them I feel that renovations could be a little bit more extensive than another coat of white paint and discount carpet every few years."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been too one.  People CA And Will Get IN trouble
College Sophomore,2,Pretty much bad downtown.  Boring town.
College Junior,2,There are only four place which students are able to grab a meal on campus. The variety is not there and the quality of the food is poor. Many students find themselves having digestion issues or become sick after eating at some of the service locations. Also the window of which the dinning options are open is very limited and nothing is open past 8pm
College Junior,2,There is not much diversity on the campus. There are a handful of international students but not many.
College Sophomore,2,not the best deal. had to contact a few peopple to geta response and evn then it was very little added. not very effective
College Freshman,2,the school itself gives a lot of money but it is hard to get a loan for that much without a co-signer. I am still not sure if i can continue to attend this school.
College Junior,2,"The weather in Erie is pretty bad. It is sometimes referred to as ""Dreary Erie"". It rains a lot and snows a whole lot. Its always cold. During the summer there are some nice days though."
College Junior,2,Gannon University is a handful of building dropped in the middle of Erie. There is no legit campus. Does not provide a lot of on-campus housing. The only area attraction with in walking distance is a main street full of bars that is useless to half the students.
College Freshman,2,it gets really cold during the winter
College Junior,2,I think the food options are just average. The meal plans they make you get are ridiculous because you have so many meals and if you don;t use them they don't roll over. There are very few places to get food and there is only one place that is open late and it is in a residence hall. The menus for each place are very accessible because they are posted online. Another bad thing is that on the weekends you options are limited. All of the food places don't ope until 11 or 12. I don't know why they assume everyone doesn't get up until late. The food itself isn't that bad though.
College Junior,2,Gannon is right in the middle of one of the worst areas in Erie so automatically that makes you feel a little unsafe but there are always Gannon cops around and Erie PD. They definitely try to keep things safe. There is also an escort system called GUEST so that you don;t have to walk home alone if you feel unsafe. Even with all these precautions though there are times where crimes do happen. Gannon is good about emailing everyone to let them know about these crimes though.
College Junior,2,"Gannon sports are very underrated. The basketball teams, and the soccer teams are great. The football team sucks though. Students don't really go to games unless they are against Merychurst or its a big game for the play offs."
College Senior,2,"The program is in a transition phase due to staff changes and growing class sizes. There is a lot of difficulty with communication and availability of faculty. The program is a great set up for anyone coming in directly out of high school because you are done in 5 years and you have your master's degree then. The classes are very interesting. Classes either seem to have a ton of work, or require little work. There seems to be few classes in the middle of the spectrum. A few professors are still practicing and bring their real-world knowledge to the classroom. There are OT-related extra curricular organizations that give students the opportunity to socialize with other OT students."
College Junior,2,As a commuter I am unaware of how on top of things Gannon security is but within the last couple weeks we had a shooting outside dorms and a break in into a fraternity house.
College Senior,2,Erie. It's really snowy in the winter and windy most of the time. It's beautiful in spring and toward the end of summer. The surrounding neighborhood is not the greatest though. It's an urban area. There is decent nightlife if you are old enough to enjoy that. There are a variety of places to eat. Cultural venues are close by and some offer student discounts.
College Senior,2,"The computer situation is average. It can be difficult to find an open computer hooked up to a printer sometimes, so I recommend having your own computer and printer. Wireless access is usually pretty good, but logging on at the beginning of the school year has been problematic for me all four years!"
College Freshman,2,"Right now it is snowing with a chance of four feet of snow. However, in the summer it is beautiful"
College Junior,2,They're strict about what goes on in on campus buildings but I've never had problems while living in off campus houses.
College Junior,2,The lots are small and not all that convenient. City parking garages and meters are expensive
College Senior,2,"The campus for the most part, really is not diverse. Most of the students are white, and if you are different, you tend to stick with your own kind."
College Senior,2,There is no lots on campus for short term parking for students who are off campus that need to run in and check their mail quickly or something of that nature. The campus police ticket everyone and everything as do Erie police so you get double the fines if you are 2 minutes late. Its very frustrating that I have to park blocks and blocks away to run a quick errond or have a meeting with my advisor for 15 minutes.
College Senior,2,"kinda nasty. many houses are dated and gungy, others arent, but expensive. never lived there, just visited"
College Senior,2,Don't seem like they do anything that fantastic. The frats are nasty.
College Senior,2,"It's Erie – the winters are unpredictable. sometimes it snow a lot sometimes not at all. classes are never cancelled because of the weather, but nothing is too far of walking distance. they do not ice the sidewalks very well, be prepared to fall."
College Junior,2,"Dining Hall Food – The food at the beginning was really good, but the quality of the food after a while diminished. I was unable to tell what type of meats they were serving and the foods were either over-cooked or under-cooked with no taste at all."
College Freshman,2,The food on campus will give you lots of gas and takes some getting used to. The three swipes a day is a pain in the ass. Freshman should definitely get the small meal plan. You will end up with hundreds left over if you don't.
College Sophomore,2,Rain and Snow Aren't Fun – During my Freshman year at Gannon it was very windy all of the time. It snowed a lot which made it hard to get to class and even to get to places that were close to my dorm room. During the rest of the year and even during the winter it rains a lot. The plethora of rain was an occurrence during both of the years that I was at Gannon.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing off campus in downtown Erie is extremely expensive. Gannon does not help students find landlords or give any information on living off campus, nor do they provide any information on what to expect. The price to park off campus is extremely expensive as well, and students are responsible to pay for electricity, laundry, gas, and water."
College Freshman,2,"Greeks Don't Show – As far as I can see, the Greeks don't stand out in my eyes. Gannon has a good mix of community, and everyone collaborates very well together."
College Junior,2,"Lake Erie Lake Effect – Gannon University sits just a few blocks away from Lake Erie. Due to the location of the university, mother nature likes to take its toll on the city. It snows quite often, however classes are rarely cancelled unless our professors have a difficult time commuting. There are a lot of side streets and one-way streets that aren't plowed as much as they should be. Once the weather turns, students like to get outside as much as possible and enjoy the sunshine after a long winter. Spring brings the typical storms and rain. Summer is usually hot and humid, but luckily the lake is very accessible and nearby! Fall weather varies, but is usually pleasant. Erie is typically very windy, which can worsen the impact of snow or rain, making the trek to classes unpleasant."
College Sophomore,2,"Eh Campus Food – The food is average overall. We have a main dining hall, fried food place and a sub spot. I have issues finding appropriate appealing food because I have lactose and gluten intolerances. The thing I dislike most is the inflexibility of the meal plan. You can only get certain things, freshman are required to spend thousands of dollars on a high meal plan no one ever fully uses and meals can't be transferred or used for guests or other friends. I have wasted a lot of money on these meal plans"
College Senior,2,The Campus is mostly white and has many foreign students
College Sophomore,2,"The athletic center is somewhat out-dated with old equiment and building.  I'm not sure of a general student center at Gannon.  There are student centers provided for non-tradional students and commuters, but for the average student living on campus, there are not any places for us to all be in while we wait for the next class to continue other than in the hallways.  The library is definitely old with furniture and decor that look like they are from the 60's or 70's.  The book selection is average for the small amount of students on GU's campus.  The campus as a whole is spread out through city blocks and isn't very seculded at all."
College Sophomore,2,permits are 50 per semester.. spots hard to find during day.. u don't need car until the night or weekend.. so u might as well not buy a permit
College Junior,2,Not Enough – Gannon is expensive anfd there is not enough financial aid around you definately need to get private loans and look elsewhere for scholarships
College Senior,2,"I feel that the security at Gannon University is average.  However, there are too many times that students have been rejected for rides for security based on where they live or that the security staffing is low.  I think if the student is reasonably close to campus, more efforts should be placed to maintain there safety.  Give them the ride.  I feel there are too many incidents right off campus that where Gannon could have made a difference if they gave a simple ride for a student."
College Junior,2,"Gannon is in a nice spot but not in a nice city. The City of Erie is not the safest one around. I've never heard so many sirens at all times of the day anywhere else I've ever been. I've personally had several ""scary"" encounters with local Erieites as well as known many who have."
College Junior,2,Living on campus is a pain. There are too many rules and regulations. I am very upset with the lottery and the office of student living. It is a pain to try housing and I would not wish it upon anyone. I also think that the housing building are old and need updated. I was lucky enough to get into a newer apartment building.
College Senior,2,"Not Very Diverse – The college is mostly caucasian or African-American with a small Indian population and a smattering of other ethnicities.  The ISO tries to sponsor diversity-encouraging events, but they tend not to succeed.  There tends to be a grudge against the Indian students on campus, but they tend to clique up and it's not easy to get to know them."
College Junior,2,"Lots of Under Age Drinking – There is a lot of underager drinking that goes on at my school, buyt I suspect that this is the same anywhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,Gannon needs more computer labs and more printers in the labs present.  They need to make sure that the printer cartridges are always full and paper is always available.  I hate the network because there are always updates we have to do and half the time they never work the first time.  Wireless access is good.
College Sophomore,2,"I did not have my car for my freshman year.  When I wanted to go somewhere off campus, like the mall, I had to take the bus.  This was a big pain because it took so long and I did not feel safe.  Therefore, it would be very nice to have a car.  However, there is very minimal parking on campus, unless you want to pay an outstanding fee to park in the parking garage."
College Senior,2,"Very Strict – Gannon is very strict when it comes to keeping things the way that they would like. They are known for busting many kids with noise violations or for drinking. They also are very strict about male and female visitation. Also, freshmen are not allowed out after 11:30pm for the first 4 weeks of classes. After those four weeks this goes away depending on their grades. However, Gannon seems more interested in busting people on things instead of looking out for people's safety."
College Junior,2,"I believe Gannon is very accepting of diversity. In many aspects Gannon lacks diversity. I believe this is mainly due to the small size of Gannon, cost, and that it is a private religious school. Most students have the same or similar beliefs."
College Junior,2,"The facilities on campus are okay.  They could use major remodeling, especially the library.  The gym is also way too small and over crowded.  There isn't enough equipment and is also outdated."
College Junior,2,Lots of Snow – It's always really cold during the winter either because of the wind or because of the mass amounts of snow.  Makes walking to class annoying when its at its worst.
College Junior,2,"There are average dining options off campus around Gannon University. Although most of the options right around campus and most easily accessible are almost all fast food chains. If you were wanting a more sit down restaurant there are a few right off campus, but more up towards the mall area. The mall is located about 15 minutes up the street, so if you don't own a car you either find someone who does or take the public transportation. And if it's late, neither restaurant nor bus system will be open.  It's just not convenient for college students."
College Senior,2,"Computer Labs – Most computers are ok speed, but some (especially in power room) are painfully slow.  Often tough to determine if a class is going on in the Palumbo computer labs.  Printing is ok, printing PDF slides are not good.  Personal computer would be beneficial."
College Senior,2,"While Gannon does have some well-maintained, updated buildings, there are other buildungs that definitely need a face-lift. Gannon is working on updating and modernizing buildings, but there is still a lot of work to be done. The Morosky Academic Center for Health Sciences is very modern, and the Zurn Science Center has also been recently updated. The Waldron Campus Center also meets all the students needs. The rec center is also great for working out."
College Senior,2,Meal Plans – It is only necessary to have a meal plan your freshman year which is nice
College Senior,2,"The library has all the necessary things a college library needs, it just is in major need of a remodel."
College Senior,2,gannon parking stinks because it is a city area. ive gotten a few tickets since ive been here
College Junior,2,"The city bus is free but scary at night. They offer a bus to go to the mall and grocery store and movie theater, but the times are extremely inconvienent and there is only one that runs. There is a grey hound bus station but it's kind of far away."
College Junior,2,"I don't feel that Gannon offers me anything that another school couldn't offer me. They don't treat their students very well, and I can say that I know for a fact that I am not the only person who feels this way"
Alum,1,"I am screwed with student loans. The financial office was absolutely no help with anything - I was in there a lot and never got answers. Terrible school for a military member. I am in the Air Force reserves and they could not process paperwork properly for me (never got my payment but military records show it was sent so school kept my money).
I have since graduated and went to the office of career development for placement/job search assistance - again no help! The guy told me to look around online (yeah I already do that) and there was no follow up at all !
I am looking for a job on my own but the schools claim to help with placement is a complete lie.
Going to GANNON DID HELP ME IN ANYWAY. I AM STUCK WITH LOANS FROM A SCHOOL THAT ONLY WANTED MY MONEY AND HAS NOT ENHANCED MY CAREER."
College Freshman,1,The freshman visitation policy is awful.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is unnecessarily elitist. They party too much, and they literally pay for their friends."
College Sophomore,1,My program only sits 46 seats. Admissions only picks the cream of the crop from 300+ applicants a year. Volunteering and hospital experience gets a leg up on competition.
College Freshman,1,"rain, snow, and more snow. It has awful winters and springs but beautiful summers."
College Freshman,1,It is gloomy here all the time and unbearable cold
College Junior,1,"Gannon has very strict visitation rules for freshmen. Students of the opposite sex have to sign in and they most be out by a certain time. Freshmen also have ""freshman hours"" for the first four weeks of school where they have to be in their rooms by 11:30.  Many of the academic programs have very strict rules about maintaining a certain GPA. Basically if Gannon has a rule it is very very strictly enforced."
College Junior,1,"The weather in Erie is awful! There is a reason why it is called dreary Erie. The winters are bitter cold and the sidewalks are always cover in slush and ice. When the weather starts to break it can go from being 30 to 70 in 2 hours. It is not uncommon for it to start out sunny in the morning and but afternoon for it to have rained and snowed. The weather is really unpredictable. Also, it is impossible to use an umbrella in Erie because the wind is so bad."
College Sophomore,1,The weather sucks here. It's just too unpredictable. One day it could be cold and snowing and the next day it's hot and sunny. When it's hot it's ridiculously hot and when it's cold it's freezing. So prepare for all kinds of weathers.
College Senior,1,"Never Around – There is one bus, the knight rider, that takes students around campus if you need it -- however, its never there when you need it. It basically just sits outside the health science building for hours doing nothing. As a Gannon Student you can also ride the public city busses for free, so thats nice when you want to catch a movie or go to the mall but don't have a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is either on the street or in a parking garage, and sometimes your not even close to your dorm or your classes."
College Junior,1,"You have to pay either $259 per semester to park in the Erie Parking Authority garage or find another lot with a student discount (still not cheap). You can be entered in to a lottery for roof parking in the Erie Parking Authority garage but it is a gamble, the price is still between $150 & $200 and you have to park on the roof in the snow."
College Junior,1,"Snow Wind and Some Sun – If you don't like snow, Gannon is not for you. Classes have never been cancelled for weather during my time there. Due to the close proximity to Lake Erie, it is often windy outside. The weather can be very nice at times though and stdents take advantage by eating and studying outside."
College Sophomore,1,"The police force is very strict about underage drinking and drug use. They have ever intention of going through the state and getting you very hefty fines! First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing scholarships and getting suspended. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted! Pictures on facebook will also get you in trouble!"
College Sophomore,1,Not much to look at since there really is no campus.  I wish I could tell you its beautiful... but its not.
College Sophomore,1,transportation is limited and stops very early. nothing to do really unless you have a car. only can have fun if you are over 21
College Junior,1,Parking is on of Gannon's biggest down falls.  Finding parking is almost always a challenge and sometimes proves almost impossible.  Space for parking is definitely an issue.
College Senior,1,"There needs to be more variety on campus.  There are only three possible locations to obtain real meals on campus: Doc's, the cafeteria, and Knight's Cove.  And to be honest, they are quite expensive.  To buy a cheeseburger, fries and a bottle of water costs 11 dollars.  That is unnecessary.  Furthermore, they only provide mexican or american foods.  Give us healthier choices!  Mets makes false claims that their food is healthy and it's absurd how obviously false this is."
College Sophomore,1,"Alcohol as Always – As with any school, alcohol is a problem at Gannon.  I see usage especially by sororities and fraternities very frequently, even at events during Greek week.  To my knowledge, no one was ever punished for being trashed at these events, which is ridiculous. As for drugs, I have not seen or been exposed to such; however, that doesn't mean it does not happen on campus."
College Senior,1,"Off Campus – I have never lived off campus. However, it seems that security is less in off campus living and people are prone to incidents such as break ins of their cars and houses."

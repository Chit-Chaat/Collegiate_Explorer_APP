For a relatively low cost you get a great education with professor that are passionate about what they are teaching, and also want to see you succeed. Probably one of my favorite things about Northwest is how supportive everyone is of one another. This stands for not only students and organizations, but also the community. Maryville is super supportive of the college and is always doing things for students.

It shows at sporting events, music events, Greek Life events, and more. Northwest is an amazing place to be!"
Niche User,5,"I think Northwest Missouri State University should have more contact with the incoming freshman students. Such as more phone calls updating them about upcoming things, like housing, instead of just emails. I'm an incoming student so that's why I suggest this. I was confused on how to request my roommate and how to make sure we live together. Otherwise, I'm very excited to go here and I can't wait to become a Bearcat. I really hope that this scholarship can provide me with the additional funds I am looking for."
Freshman,5,"Northwest Missouri state university is a school that is unique. The students are taught unity diversity and equity in order to live harmoniously with another.

We have a very large library where you could read and in the library we have the student success centre,there we have free tutoring,free help with essays. It's a really fun experience. We also have what is called supplemental instruction where an assigned student who has done the course before teaches a class. It's great. Campus is really large.

Sophomore,5,"The environment here is so diverse that you can find individuals with a common interest almost anywhere. The academic programs are cutting edge and highly regarded, like the computer science programs and the education programs. We are one of the few, if not the only, universities with a fully functioning laboratory school. This school is also very affordable for both in-state and out-of-state students, thanks to the Bearcat Advantage scholarship which covers the difference of in-state tuition for out-of-state students. Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing. This small town community provides you with warmth and comfort as everyone is treated like family. If you don't mind being in a relatively small and semi-rural town, I highly recommend Northwest because the environment is simply encouraging. Everyone here wants you to truly do your best."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Northwest Missouri State University. My sister use to attend college here so I know a lot about the campus.

Freshman,5,"Northwest Missouri State University does a fine job at making students feel safe, cared for, and has high quality academics. To start, the police department is very involved with the students. The officers are very friendly and make sure every student knows they have a friend in the police department.  The diversity office on campus does an amazing job at teaching students that diversity is a good thing, and we show that it is a big deal to embrace our diversity throughout campus. Finally, on the subject of academics It is easy to get help through the free tutoring sessions the school offers for most general education courses. Although I have had some professors that I wish would teach some more instead of assigning reading from the textbook, I would say the academics at Northwest are high quality. I take pride in my school, and  constantly recommend Northwest to any friends that are in the school decision making process."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love it here at NW. Being a Bearcat is so amazing. I knew I wanted to come here after seeing the amazing campus and how kind everyone is. Not to mention free textbooks and laptops!! It is in a very small town but you definitely get used to it and will love it here.

Freshman,5,"I love Northwest. The campus is beautiful, our sports teams are great, and the teachers I've had were amazing and helpful. It could use better food and housing though, but some of the dorms are currently planned for renovation. It's one of the cheapest colleges around, but you'd never be able to tell.

Also, when compared to other schools, we rank up with high-end Division I schools in terms of our academic departments and athletics. Our music program is one of the most recognized in Missouri. Our athletics have a rich history of being diverse and successful. Education is easily the biggest department next to agriculture and business. All three of which, are very strong, in addition to music. I love being a Bearcat here. It's a wonderful experience and the perfect college fit."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. Professors are willing to help, it's a small community, many helpful resources to use for any assignments."

Sophomore,4,I love coming to Northwest. The school is small enough to feel homey and to get to know your professors but still big enough to get to know all types of people.
Sophomore,4,I have taken some of my classes online. The fully online classes are great and the professors are super understanding. The half online/half in person classes because of COVID are kind of strange but seem to be working so far.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved just about everything at Northwest. The food is great, with very good professors and housing. One of the only things that I don't particularly enjoy is the lack of diversity among students."
Sophomore,4,"Due to covid-19, I am going to be taking a lot, if not all classes online this semester. The teachers try their very best to keep in contact and are very understanding about the situation at hand. As for classes that are meant to be online, I have not been enrolled into such class so it is difficult for me to have an opinion."
Senior,4,The professors and school made the transition into online learning seem less because of COVID. The school and professors worked with us to make sure we still received the highest possible quality of learning.

The environment in the dorms is also very inclusive, the RAs are wonderful to get to know and it creates a very tight-knit group. Overall, most of the teachers are great, both in personality and teaching. Living in the dorms also grants easy access to all of the buildings overall it's at most a ten-minute walk to get anywhere on campus whether you're walking from Hudson-Perrin to the CIE or the CIE to Colden Hall or Valk."
Freshman,4,I have been here for a semester and I really like the school. The professors are nice and understanding. I love the campus scenery and how it a college with a lot of nature around it.

Freshman,4,NWMSU has staff members who are willing to help you succeed and the atmosphere is conducive to learning.  A wonderful place for learning.
Senior,4,"It's a small town vibe, but for a state school. To get the family feeling on a college campus like this you would usually have to go to a private college. But at Northwest you're bound to see someone you know while walking to class. The professors are great at adapting to your schedule if you can't meet during their office hours."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Northwest and this is my second semester here. While being enrolled as a student at Northwest, I am involved with many intramural leagues through the college. Northwest makes it easy to get involved here on campus as they have so many different groups/clubs for everyone to join, while getting the opportunity to create your own. I really enjoy living in Maryville as the professors, students and faculty members are welcoming and helpful accordingly.

Freshman,4,"Northwest has a family oriented vibe. You immediately feel comfortable and like it is your second home. The school spirit is contagious. Their premed programs are excellent along with the mix of all different people from different areas. They have a great food court that has a mix of all different types of foods and also a food pantry for residents for snacks, cereal etc. Having free laundry and a full kitchen to cook in is also a bonus. Although the dorms are small (pretty normal) they are well equipped. Your books and laptop are included in the tuition cost which definitely helps to save on cost. They have a ride program that will take you to and from places like Walmart, pick you up from a part etc. that helps to keep you safe. There is an abundant amount of activities that are planned for students to participate in if they should wish."

Freshman,4,"Northwest Missouri State University is in a great location and therefore has a wide range of people who attend. When I first started classes I did not know very many people, but I soon was able to expand my acquaintances due to the small class sizes and how the classes are often designed to encourage student participation. The RA assigned to my floor was very good at notifying everyone of events, which also helped expand the group of people I knew."
Freshman,4,"Northwest Missouri State, in my opinion, was the best decision I have made in my Iife! They care about your weII-being and education!"

Faculty greet students by name in the buildings and around campus. Very safe campus with a lot of resources such as safe ride for students who find themselves without a DD. Tons of resources at the library for students who need help with academics. Professors very willing to meet with students during and outside of office hours to help students understand the materials."
Sophomore,4,"I chose to attend NWMSU in order to get a degree in Elementary Education, but have already got a great deal out of my decision. This university offers all types of students to come and get an education & to create amazing connections. I would highly recommend Northwest to anyone, especially someone looking to go into either the education or agriculture field."
Sophomore,4,The campus itself has a very home-y feel to it. All the students and faculty are very genuine and sincere in their actions towards others. All the facilities are very nice as well. Some things that could be better would be to get their financial aid letters sooner and also have a faster response time on emails and phone calls in the summer time.
Senior,4,Northwest is a great school with a diverse student body. The majority of the professors on campus are great and willing to go above and beyond to see students succeed.
Sophomore,4,Northwest has become my home away from home. All of the professors are there to help you succeed. Their education department is amazing!
Sophomore,4,"Northwest Missouri State University is a good school but it has some flaws, the school campus is not diverse but it has not that many activities on campus you should probably go out St. Joe for a lot of things besides groceries as they are close to town about a mile away."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy going to Northwest, professors care about their students and want to help further each student's education. The campus is beautiful with and the environment is welcoming.

There is always opportunities for involvement and the campus strives hard to make sure every student succeeds."

With most class sizes under thirty students it is easy to receive the help necessary to keep grades maintained at a high average. Professors genuinely care about students, and do not want students to fail. Student life on campus is great as well. There are many opportunities for students to get involved, and meet new people. A bonus with joining the bearcat family is books and laptops are included in tuition. Becoming a student at Northwest is one of the best decisions I have ever made."
Niche User,4,"Very welcoming environment. It is very open, but is also very stranded. Not a lot to do besides to stay on campus and find something to do there. Very friendly and helpful workers there. No one seems to be left out."
Sophomore,4,"It is wonderful! The staff truly care about how a student is doing, the class sizes are only about 30 people after gen eds which tend to only have about fifty people. The campus is so pretty and the dorms aren't really bad."
Freshman,4,"I am currently attending Northwest Missouri State University and I enjoy being here. The faculty and staff are all very nice, the professors are helpful and very knowledgeable in their fields, and the students are helpful and fun to be around. The classes are challenging but I enjoy going to them, my animal sciences classes the most. The food could be improved, but it is easy to make smart eating choices while in the cafeteria. I love the library. It is very roomy and has a Starbucks coffee shop in the heart of it which makes everything better! Overall, I do enjoy attending NWMSU and would recommend anyone to come to school here in Maryville."
Senior,4,"There is incredibly too great a focus on athletic achievement and athletic funding on campus. There is a definite neglect and disdain for the arts and the performance venues on campus. However, the professors truly do care about the individual success of the student and genuinely attempt to foster a healthy and safe learning environment."

Freshman,4,"I love the feel of the campus. I don't get very homesick because I feel right at home here. Whether you go to a hypnotist show, a football game, or just go to the cafeteria, everyone is very welcoming and you get a strong connection to the town. The football games are so high energy and definitely worth going to. The campus isn't too big that it's a huge hassle to get from one side of campus to the other. "
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the campus. When I came to campus for the first time I loved it and I knew that was where I was going to go. The only thing I would change is the parking lots and how there is not enough parking for both commuter and resident students.
Junior,4,"I lived on campus my first two years of going to Northwest and the dorms and apartments are all very nice. The classes are super close which is nice since it is usually cold and windy there. Now since they have opened the new campus in Gladstone, I am attending that campus and doing online classes and the professors work really well with my work schedule and make the deadlines reasonable and are always on their emails ready to help. The things I did not like about Maryville was that it was always cold and it is such a small town I got bored. I loved everything about the campus and classes though. "
Sophomore,4,So far my experience here at Northwest has been phenomenal. I have met so many people that I am sure will be lifelong friends. One of my favorite aspects about campus itself is the fact that Northwest is an arboretum. It is beautiful in the fall when the leaves start to change. I honestly don't know that I would like to see a lot of change. The students are great. The faculty members are very personable and easy to talk to. So far my experience as a Bearcat has been the best chapter in my life so far. 
College Student,4,We are one big family that supports one another.

College Freshman,2,There have been many rape incidents within Greek life on campus.  Something needs to be done about it.

College Sophomore,2,You do need to provide your transportation and parking isn't the best.
College Sophomore,2,They offer some good assistance programs but I didn't find out that I didn't qualify til after the first week of class.
College Junior,2,The lots are in odd places and i always have to spend 10 minutes searching for a spot. 
College Freshman,2,"Non-Greeks think that Greeks are pathetic for ""buying"" their friends."
College Freshman,2,"The Northwest Missouri State University campus isn't very diverse, but I think it's because we live in Maryville, MO, which is a smaller, farm town."
College Junior,2,I don't really attend much myself at the school but I read up on what's being hosted and there are various types of events held but different organizations.
College Freshman,2,"It is a nice atmosphere, although there could be a more variety in the late night and breakfast. I really like the second floor eating area much better than the cafeteria. I also really liek the idea of unlimited swipes on your dining plan. Although, I feel there was more encouragement in the cafeteria towards a healthy diet instead of just pamphlets. Overall though, I like the Campus Dining."
College Sophomore,2,Safe ride is only available for off-campus errands
College Sophomore,2,Good mix of cultures but most not accepting of others
College Sophomore,2,There is way too much resident parking and not enough commuter parking.
College Sophomore,2,"To my knowledge, drug safety at Northwest Missouri State is sufficient for campus life.  I am not aware of any drug activity on campus.  I feel safe and secure.  I think drinking is more popular than drugs."
College Sophomore,2,"Northwest MO State is located in Maryville, MO.  The biggest city near Maryville, MO is St. Joseph, MO.  There are no malls in Maryville, so you have to go to St. Joseph to shop.  But there are fun thrift stores and nice restaurants in Maryville. College games are big and usually, there are activities on campus that keep you busy."
College Sophomore,2,I rarely use the transportation option because I walk to my classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,walking t o class in the snow is horrible and it snows a lot
College Sophomore,2,"I don't like the campus dining that much. The menu for lunch and dinner is the same every single day in the food court (which is designed much like a mall food court, with different restaurant areas to buy from). Each place serves the same stuff every day. Occassionally they have some sort of deal thing, but usually that lasts only a week or so. The food is overpriced and not that great. Not bad, but not great. And there's only one food court in the middle of campus, inside the union, and then The Station over by the highrises has a grocery store and coffee shop. So we have small menu variety, bad value, and not a wide range of dining halls. Meal plan is nice - it's a declining balance, meaning you have to budget your money so you don't go over before the semester's over. However, they are changing this for the fall, so I don't know how it'll be then."
College Sophomore,2,The dorm rooms are very small and could use some updating.  As much as I pay I feel they could be a little bit better.
College Freshman,2,"It gets very cold very easily. It snows a lot when the show hits and you better have a heavy coat even for fall, it feels like winter!"
College Junior,2,I think our school could do better because not a lot of people do go to the athletic events.
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is always crazy. There are resident lots, commuter lots, and faculty lots and if you park in the wrong one you'll get at ticket for $35. A lot of the time the resident lots fill up that you have to park in the commuter lot. I think that the need for a car isn't really too high, the city is small so getting around easily by walking could work. I wish there was a car pool system because I would reduce the amount of cars and traffic on campus."
College Senior,2,"Crazy Wheather – Because of it's placement, Maryville has crazy weather. One day, you'll hope it snows, but instead you'll get 30 MPH winds. Be prepared for anything since this city is in the cusp of a crazy amount of weather patterns."
College Senior,2,"The laptops work, but they end up faulting after awhile. Northwest and HP have an agreement and whenever you give them a computer back, you get a new one and the old one goes straight to HP. It can be anything from keys stick to your computer blue screening; it doesn't stay nice for long."
College Senior,2,"North Complex Is Old – Missouri Academy students live in the oldest dorm on campus; from it's asbestos tiles to the yellow walls there is not much good to say about the building. The only good thing about Cooper and Douglas hall is that it's a very open environment [if you ignore the fob doors] and you can talk to anyone at almost any time. It's right in the middle of campus, which makes trans versing campus easy, but it needs a lot of work to make it livable."
College Sophomore,2,"6,000 Students 2,000 Spaces – During the school year it's so hard to find a reasonably close spot. There are so many parking lots close by every place you could need to go, but the spots fill up SO quickly. Sometimes you have to park a 5 minute walk from your dorm. During the summer and holiday weekends however, it's so easy to find a spot."
College Junior,2,We need more options we have approx. 4 polaces to choose from and only 1 is open late.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life can get pretty crazy. I wish that there were more of the divine nine, NPHC organizations on campus. There's one in particular that I would love to join that is currently not on campus. Also, I don't think that it's right that none of the NPHC organizations have charters. I think that would also help with getting more people into their organizations."
College Freshman,2,"Snow and Sun – The spring and summer can be hot as hell. Unbearable sun, constant sunburn if you're out in the weather, etc. And the winters are the frozen pits of Antarctica. Freezing rains, shittons of snow, and the dreaded Maryville Wind, that chills you to the bone. Be prepared to have freezing temperatures one day and then a week of sweltering heat."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of Parties – There is waaayy too much partying. It's a dry campus, but everyone still drinks and parties. There aren't any clubs; there's just bars, and so that doesn't make for much to do for nondrinkers. House parties you usually have to pay to get into, and are just a bunch of drunken idiots anyway."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't very many choices when it comes to certain general education classes, which I really dislike about the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Overall I drove my own car everywhere I went. There is one program called ""Safe Ride"" that would give students transportation, but I never used that because that was considered to be for people who were intoxicated and couldn't drive themselves. If you didn't have a car you would have to live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I understand greek life is created for students to get involved and meet new people, but it has turned into a big party scene and is very expensive. The partying is optional of course, but if anyone wants to be ""included"" they usually feel that they should go. They are cliques and not groups I would really want to be a part of."
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of food places in Maryville but they are all expensive to me because I'm a poor college student!
College Sophomore,2,"Food Options Lacking – I understand that the school is trying to make a profit but some of the options for food are way over priced. While I like the fact that the station is open 24/7, it'd be nice if the food court was open later than 7 Mon-Thurs and was open later than 2 on Fridays. Also, the people working at the food court could really stand to improve upon their cooking techniques. The rice at the Chinese place is always way overcooked and the cheese in my cheese quesadilla is never melted all the way through at the mexican place. It'd also be nice to have a little more variety because it can get pretty repetitive to have the same options for every meal every single day. JW's main problem is they're not always consistent. You can get a meal one day that's great but then the next time you get it, it's horrible. I do like the fact that the station has a pretty large variety of stuff to buy."
College Sophomore,2,"Maryville always seems to get the worst possible winters. The school is good at clearing off the sidewalks so that we have class, but it gets down right cold in Maryville."
Niche User,2,"Northwest has a bit of diversity, but most of the ethnic groups tend to stay in cliques, and there are few activities celebrating diversity."
College Freshman,1,"I am very against the fact that we are forced to live on campus our freshmen year, it is way too expensive."
College Freshman,1,I have applied for endless scholarships and have not received one. Financial aid does not help because my parents make too much. But my parents are not paying my way through college.
College Freshman,1,There is like four total places you can go to get decent food.
College Junior,1,We have a Walmart....we have too many pizza places and chinese/Japanese places. We only have the movies and a bowling place. There is no where to eat in this town except for A and G which is amazing but it gets old after awhile.
College Freshman,1,"Long walks everywhere you go during the frigid winters at nw, and $90 for a parking pass? like $16,000 a year isnt enough"
College Freshman,1,"the cops are flaming assholes, once you get caught doing something wrong they will pull you over every chance they get after that"
College Sophomore,1,Greek life thinks they are legitimately better than non-greeks
College Junior,1,"Parking is awful!!!!!!! There are not enough spots for people, especially with students who live on campus because they take up a lot of the spots. You can buy a parking pass but you will most likely be parking on the street, especially if you are running late."
College Sophomore,1,It's really cold and snowy in the winter.  It makes it somewhat difficult to get around.
College Freshman,1,"You should always leave early for class to find a parking spot. For example, if I have a class at noon then I leave the house thirty minutes early to find a spot. However, a lot of spots are open about ten o'clock after classes start. Also if you want to park anywhere near the food court it's a lot harder try going at odd hours like at two or three instead of noon for lunch."
College Sophomore,1,They are really strict on underage drinking and will hand out MIP like candy
Recent Alumnus,1,"Math Program Is Lacking – The professors are not very helpful or encouraging. Since they are not real educators, but merely doctors in mathematics, they move on quickly and have a hard time explaining math if you don't understand it. Some of the professors are also unprofessional and discuss your grades with other professors and students. I have heard and experienced this department to be one of the worst on campus."
College Senior,1,"The food isn't healthy and whatever is healthy is pretty expensive. You pay a pretty penny to eat on campus, but the food tastes exactly like that from high school. It's very easy to have a bad diet here; I go home and I lose ten pounds just from sitting at home and eating good food. My advice: Go to Hyvee and buy groceries and learn to make your own food. The convenience isn't worth the headache of a bad meal."
College Junior,1,"Terrible Communication – I ran into many bumps with the financial aid office. There were several times where they lost forms I may have filled out and submitted and I had to start the process over, but they never mentioned it to me. If you are missing something in a form you submitted, they don't inform you. They also don't keep you up to date on your FAFSA after you have submitted it. They're also hard to work with. Either you give them your money or they remove you as a student."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't think it is very diverse here. There's definitely not enough programs, scholarships, and mentoring type activities/ programs for minority students. At times, I almost don't feel welcomed because I am a minority student."
College Freshman,1,"There are no buses or many means of transportation, unless you bring your own or have a friend with a car. There's a program they have that they say can take you into town, but it's main purpose is to keep drunk drivers off the streets and give drunks rides home, so it only operates Thursday - Sunday from like 4 to midnight or something."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Provides – The thing that makes the small town of Maryville something huge, is the university. Northwest Missouri State University made the town a family where its members come and root on their Bearcats together."
College Junior,1,The weather in Maryville is the worst I've ever experienced. It has the absolute coldest winters in the region. It will be 60 degrees 20 mi off campus and 40 degrees on campus.. no joke.
College Junior,1,"Nothing to Do – Other than maybe attending the occasional greek party or to St. Joseph on the weekends, the only thing this town has to offer is a really pretty cool movie theater and a bowling alley..."
College Sophomore,1,"Cost, Parking – The cost of living off campus is ridiculous. I pay so much to live in my apartment and it is a piece of crap. So I feel like since this is a college town, there should be some apartments close to campus that are way more affordable for college kids. Also, it is soooo hard to find parking at this school. If you don't have a parking pass you are definately parking at least 2 miles away from campus. And you get parking tickets like crazy here."

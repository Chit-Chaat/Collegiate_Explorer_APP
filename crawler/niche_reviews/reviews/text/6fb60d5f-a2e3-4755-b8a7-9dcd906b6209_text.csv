Freshman,5,"For my fall semester I had all of my classes online. I am a 1st year student and I was on campus for 2 weeks before returning home for online classes. While I was there I enjoyed everything the campus offered, including the housing faculty and the the dining hall."
Freshman,5,"I liked the accessibility to the entire campus, it's not too small but not too large. Faculty is available at all times and the professors are very understanding."
Senior,5,"Polytechnic is my preferred campus because all of the teachers I have had there have been fantastic. The campus is not nearly as big as some of the others, but it is a charming and quiet place to focus on your schoolwork."
Senior,5,"Transitioning to online was difficult for some teachers, but for the most part, my professors engaged well with the students while teaching the coursework. I would recommend online classes."
Sophomore,5,ASU-Poly campus  may be small but everyone is bound to succeed due to individuals being more connected with those in the same major as them !
Freshman,5,"This is a tight knit community that is always willing to help. Professors, advisors and administrators are always willing to help you out when you have questions."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, it's very easy to get where you need to go, and all of the staff and faculty are very friendly. The campus is very clean, and so are the dorms. There are many clubs and extracurricular activities and there is something for everyone. The landscaping and appearance of the campus are very aesthetically pleasing and it's definitely an inviting environment."
Junior,5,"The polytechnic campus is the best campus to study and stay focuses in school. Since the classes are smaller, professors give more attention to students and teach better than professors on other campus where they have big classes."
Freshman,5,"its a very small campus, its a good campus if you just trying to focus on school work and not want to have fun"
Junior,5,"I love ASU Polytechnic campus. It is a smaller campus compared to Tempe, but you can still get that college experience if you choose to. ASU has lots of different clubs and organizations across all four campuses and Poly has a lot to get involved in. There are on-campus jobs that can help you financially. The professional staff are very friendly and help you grow as an adult. The professors at the Polytechnic campus always try to improve and help the students they are teaching. ASU is also very diverse and I love learning about new things!"
Junior,5,"Had the just the degree I was looking for, not many people knew about it, including myself. But all the advisors on campus were extremely helpful and the campus looked amazing!"
Senior,5,The polytechnic campus for ASU is very quiet and very small. I like it because i am able to talk to the professors since they are mainly free during office hours and are very helpful. The Tutoring center is also a good place to go when you need help with homework because the employees are also students that have been in the same course that you are in now or is currently taking the course.
Sophomore,5,So far I've had an amazing experience at ASU. All faculty and staff have been amazing and always attentive. The advisement team has been amazing and always so helpful.
Freshman,5,"I love the Polytechnic campus because at a large university this campus makes you feel much more included and involved in your learning. Class sizes are small, which makes it easier to make friends and join clubs. The dorms are close to classes, the dining hall, student union, and the gym. But you are not limited to only the poly campus; there are free shuttles that can take you to and from other campuses which can make student life more interesting."
Sophomore,5,I think the Polytechnic campus's biggest strength is its size. A lot of people could feel lost when they first arrive at college but here at poly if feels more like a really big high school. When I am commuting to class and walking about campus I see a lot of the same faces and have even had classes overlap with multiple people. Poly really does pride itself as feeling like a community rather than a school
Junior,5,"I am attending this program as a online student.  However, they are very well structured and easy to access for online students.  Professors are very nice so far.  So it has been excellent so far in my opinion."
Freshman,5,"The campus is gorgeous, the teachers are excellent, and there is a great spirit of innovation and learning."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently in my second year at the campus and I intend to finish my bachelor's degree here. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet place to live, but still have access to a large campus."
Graduate Student,5,"Everyone on campus, from teachers to the students in the bookstore are very helpful.  They all want you to succeed and will help anyway they can."
Senior,5,Being at ASU Polytechnic campus has been one of the greatest experiences I have had. I am an engineering major and this campus has given me the ability to truly feel like an engineer. Professors are constantly teaching me more and giving me the tools to become a better engineer. The campus is also decent in size- nor too big or too small. There is a great sense of safety and comfort on the campus and makes college an enjoyable experience!
Niche User,5,What I like about ASU Polytechnic is there campus is really neat even though it isn't big it is really nice and easy to get around. Something else that I like about ASU is that he people that work there are really nice and even though you are not an ASU student they still help you with any questions that you have.
Sophomore,5,I love the classes that I have taken so far and am enjoying the facilities provided for students.  I have honestly found my attendance at ASU to be the best time of my life and being on my way to a successful career feels like the cherry on top.  There are a wide variety of options to pass the time and I find the students and staff I have met on campus to be all around good people.
Sophomore,5,"Great campus for STEM programs, small class sizes and extremely  helpful professors. Lots of housing options on campus but still a small campus."
Sophomore,5,"I really like how there was a wide variety of clubs to join. At my other college there weren’t many at all and coming to ASU allowed me to join one of my favorite clubs Chi Alpha. The one thing I would like to see change is housing, when I got there the house they assigned me had someone living in it already."
Senior,5,"Small classes, every professor is very approachable, all education buildings are Lead certified Silver or better."
Junior,5,"I love that the Polytechnic Campus is smaller in size as compared to the main ASU hub in Tempe. Even though I love the city, I'm used to living in a small town. I received my Associate's degree from the Yavapai College campus of Cottonwood, AZ. This campus is small just like the ASU Polytechnic campus. I like being able to walk around this specific ASU campus without becoming claustrophobic by thousands of other students living their campus lives."
Sophomore,5,"I am 17 years old and currently a sophomore. So far, the Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus has been a positive experience. Most classes haven't been too stressful, and there are plenty of great professors."
Junior,5,The small campus size allows for better relationships with professors and student to help further the foster future careers in their professions. There are a lot of internship opportunities that are easy to apply for as well as easy part-time jobs.
Junior,5,"This campus is absolutely beautiful. Smaller class sizes ensure your professors are involved, and help make learning easier. The community is strong and there is plenty to do around!"
Junior,5,"ASU Poly is great because you get the benefits of a big university and the benefits of a small campus. Everyone knows each other and we have a tight knit community, plus all the resources at the Tempe campus are a shuttle ride away. There is a lot of nature of campus and a lot of labs to get hands on experience. I love the 3D printers and the algae lab."
Freshman,5,"Really nice campus! You get the ASU experience on a much smaller scale, which is really nice. There are lots of resources available to students and instructors really care about seeing us succeed."
Junior,5,"I take this school online, and it has been a breeze so far, the staff is great and I have never had a problem in the process."
Niche User,5,It has a wonderful Biology program and a great group of students supporting each other. There is a pretty big party scene at Arizona State but it's because of the wonderful athletics that ASU supports. Everyone feels at home and a sense of community. This is also a great area to do things and get involved in many activities.
Freshman,5,"Great small campus, teachers there are willing to give you the resources to reach your maximum learning."
Freshman,5,"My experience as a first-generation freshman college student was very welcoming. The Polytechnic campus is so diverse and all the staff, students, professors are so friendly and make you feel at home and comfortable. Also the campus is not as big and hectic as the main campus which is the Tempe campus. The Poly. campus is perfect if you want a quiet and less distracting setting so you can study and focus on you're academics."
Freshman,5,I love the small class sizes and the big high school atmosphere.  I also love the motivation from my peers.
Senior,5,"There's a reason why Arizona State is one of the best colleges out there and this is my opinion on why. The best thing about Arizona State University is all of the amazing opportunities to better yourself not only as a student preparing for the field they want to work in but as a person as well. There are many chances for you to get help with assignments or be the tutor in a field of your expertise, you can join groups of interest, you can be vocal about the things you find passionate and you can receive tips on what you will encounter in the real world of jobs after college. Arizona State helps you prepare and be realistic about your future endeavors after college. And while you go to school, you have everyone's support because Arizona State operates as a family, a tight unit that will be there when you need help, advice or even a laugh. "
College Sophomore,5,Everyone seems to get a long with and respect everyone and Poly has a wide variety of diverse students.
College Sophomore,5,I haven't really heard of anything drug related in a long time at Poly.
College Freshman,5,It's a small campus where you can get to know lots of people and work on hands on experience classes. You can learn a lot from all the project based classes.
Freshman,4,I didn’t take full courses online but my in person courses utilized online learning quite a bit. The homework and textbooks were online and it was useful and efficient.
Freshman,4,I loved the class sizes and the friendliness of the professors. I could tell they were actually concerned about my success.
Junior,4,"I like that the campus is not as crowed and busy like the Tempe main campus, plus it is close by my work.  I would like to see them add more classes there, since I run into the problem of having to go to the main campus for certain classes."
Junior,4,I do take some classes online that dont require much focus like a math class would.  Online classes are good for me to fit into my busy schedule.
Sophomore,4,Being on the Polytechnic campus has been great because of the hands-on courses available. Professors and other faculty have been very helpful with academics.
Junior,4,"The campus itself is in a more remote area; therefore, random strangers off the street can't just walk onto campus. I do wish that parking for students was validated."
Sophomore,4,"Really enjoy this campus. It is normally very quiet except in between classes. Professors are really good and enjoy teaching here. There are a surprising number of clubs considering the campus size which is nice. Overall, would recommend this campus if you're looking for a different college experience."
Junior,4,"Arizona State University's Online course has made it possible for me to obtain my degree as a working professional.  While I enjoy the courses, it can be challenging when professor's don't respond in a timely fashion during the courses."
Junior,4,ASU polytechnic is a very good college campus with a quiet focused atmosphere. The professors and staff are great and are very academic focused. The campus has every service you need and is in a good location. The scenery is nice. Parking and tuition are way to expensive. There is not many options on campus for food so you have to go off campus to find something to eat unlike Tempe or Phoenix.
Junior,4,"It is a smaller campus compared to Tempe, but you can still get that college experience if you choose to. ASU has lots of different clubs and organizations across all four campuses and Poly has a lot to get involved in. There are on-campus jobs that can help you financially. The professional staff are very friendly and help you grow as an adult. The professors at the Polytechnic campus always try to improve and help the students they are teaching. ASU is also very diverse and I love learning about new things!"
Junior,4,Great campus for people who enjoy smaller type of schools with a big school feel. You will soon be familiar with many faces but once in awhile you will see new faces from other campuses
Sophomore,4,It being a super small campus you are able to get to all of your classes on time no problem. Most all the professors are super nice and want to help you succeed in their class. Campus is always super clean and it is a super safe campus.
Sophomore,4,"From my year-long experience with the polytechnic campus, I can say that I enjoyed my time here. I would definitely classify this as a good spot for students who enjoy a quiet campus in the suburban area of a large city. I thought that the academics were good, though I ultimately decided to transfer to seek more academic rigor. I should point out that students without vehicles may have an issue with the area since it would take about 15-20 minutes to walk to the nearest shopping area. I thought the dorms were pretty decent. I had an A/C unit in my room that I could control and a full-kitchen that I shared with a suite mate. The campus is safe and I would take late-night strolls without having to worry. The only thing I had to look out for were a pair of skunks that live on campus."
Freshman,4,"One of the things I love most about ASU's Polytechnic Campus is that it isn't a very big school but it offers students a large variety of things. Every time I called for help on a specific topic, though at times ASU is very busy, I was always greeted and spoke to respectfully by their staff."
Sophomore,4,The Polytechnic Campus is very peaceful and calming. It's quiet and the campus alone is very beautiful. A lot of nature around and open sitting areas. All my classes were near by and my freshman dorms were great. Not to many people know about this campus so not to many interactions but great bondings do form within people quicker.
Alum,4,Great campus. I love how secluded and how much more peaceful this campus is compared to the rest. Fantastic faculties and I enjoy eating lunch at the cafeteria. The only downside to this campus is how far it is from the Tempe campus and especially from Downtown.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman in my second semester of college and my overall experience at the Polytechnic campus has been great so far. They have different clubs, events, and activities almost every week and have different resources available to the students at Polytechnic. I would recommend that they get the more reserved students to join because I am extremely quiet and did not feel that I could talk to anyone during my first semester."
Sophomore,4,"The Polytechnic campus is not crowded compared to Tempe. The gym doesn't get too packed which is nice.  It is a lot safer than Tempe. There teachers here are decent. Although, the economics courses here are not as good as the courses in the Tempe Campus. The Citrus dining hall is a lot better than most dining halls in the Tempe Campus. The is not a large party scene here at the Polytechnic Campus. There have not been nearly as many crimes committed here at this campus compared to the Tempe Campus. The professors are helpful here for the most part."
Freshman,4,I love that the campus is small because this means my classes are small. The people are very nice and century hall (freshmen dorms) are very clean and up to date.
Niche User,4,"I love ASU because of how small the campus is and the amazing professor I have. It's a great campus that has lots of options, and a great fitness facility. As a high school student on campus, my school gets access to the SDFC gym and fields for sports after school. The staff is always friendly and accomodating, and the fields always in prisitine shape. Having access to the ASU facilities has allowed me to grow not just as an athlete, but as a student too. I am taking a college course right now as a senior in high school and my professor is simply incredible. He is accomodating and teaches everything in a way that makes it easier to understand. The campus is very clean and everyone is friendly."
Graduate Student,4,"Education wise, the polytechnic campus was very good; socially not so well creating a unbalanced lifestyle."
Junior,4,"Polytechnic campus is a purely STEM campus unlike the Tempe campus. It boasts great academics, courses, and professors who've had experience in industry. This is great, one thing that isn't so good about campus life is lacking. It isn't a traditional campus style of living and the party life is not what you'd expect, although college is more for the knowledge and experience. It's just a fact those are the only aspects lacking really. The campus itself has a variety of resources for projects such as 3D printers, laser engravers, CNC machines, mechanic shops, and engineering workshops. A great campus to learn engineering but not a great campus for clubs, traditional campus life, and partying. Luckily, Tempe is just a quick shuttle ride away to sate one's appetite for clubs."
Niche User,4,It's nice building and big. It has calmer than another university.  The parking lot is kind of adequate.  It's safe
Junior,4,"The Polytech campus is wonderful. I enjoy seeing wildlife in between classes and it makes me feel like I'm somewhere other than school. The teachers are great, and its actually kinda nice having the same teacher for multiple topics sometimes. I wish I could say nice things about ASU's financial aid, but there's nothing. They are constantly changing how you have to do things and they don't care to help you at all. ""Sorry, that's just how it is""."
Sophomore,4,It is a very calm campus and it is small so you do not feel overwhelmed by a lot of unfamiliar people. There are not very many bikers everyone skateboards or long boards and so there's less chance of getting run over.
Senior,4,What I absolutely enjoy most about poly campus is the class size. I am able to interact with the professors easier than when I was at Tempe campus and the parking is not ridiculously so far .
Freshman,4,"Great small campus, always quiet and peaceful, most of the teachers care for their students, good resources at the students hand."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the Polytechnic Campus, I like the size of the campus, it is small enough that it is easy to get around, and the small class sizes enable you to get to know your teacher and fellow students."
Senior,4,"I am an online student at ASU. I will be graduating this year and the Information Technology program is a well round program for the IT student.  Although on line, most of my professors take the time to help their students if they need help via Skype, Google, or any other video conferencing venue.  I wish I was in the main campus since the Polytechnic is fairly good and it is said that they have outstancding facilities for hands on experience as well as work and study to adquire skills in filed before graduation.  The staff is very helpful, my advisor promptly responds to my emails and calls me if neccesary to discuss an action plan to finish my degree. The only thing about it is tha the tuition I find it way too high for non-residents. Each credit cost 1,599 dollars! Also the local area in Phoenix, is great but crimes committed by alleged drug cartels are always a concern."
Senior,4,"* The campus size is appropriate (not too big or small)
* The class size is about 30 and it seems fitting
* The campus is quiet relative to Tempe known as a party campus
* Plenty of intelligent beings at this campus
* Enjoyable scenery however empty at times"
Junior,4,"This campus is the Engineering Campus for Arizona State University. There are about 4000 students in this campus, which is a lot less than Tempe campus, which is why I kind of like this campus more than Tempe campus. The class size on the campus is also smaller compare to Tempe. This campus is about as big as Tempe in land size, but there are more undeveloped area, and ASU is starting to build more building in this campus. So, I expect it to be larger in the future."
College Sophomore,4,Most professors and classes are great!
College Freshman,4,Overall the campus is very safe. The only problems come from the House of Refuge which is located on the edge of the campus.
College Freshman,4,All of the students try their best to succeed in their degree because they have the ambition to find a job after they graduate. I think ASU does a good job on trying to help students reach this point.
College Freshman,4,The courses could be adapted a little more to meet modern technology but they are great. Most of the professors teach their classes in an excellent way but some have a little trouble connecting with the students. The class sizes are smaller than those at ASU Tempe and I think that makes them a little easier. Overall there's a good variety but some of the class times are poorly scheduled.
College Freshman,4,Football games are the main athletic event on campus but there is not too much on the polytechnic campus since we are a smaller school.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is smaller and easy to naviagte
College Sophomore,4,"There are a few minor thefts in the area, but for the most part, the campus is very secure and I can feel safe walking around at almost all times of the day."
College Sophomore,4,"The space is more than enough for two people and it's so nice to be close to our classes. Walking everywhere is easy. The social atmosphere seems to be lacking, but it is made up for in class when students are more apt to socialize."
College Sophomore,4,"Students get really into the athletics here. If you're not wearing an ASU shirt, you're in the minority. It creates a common purpose for a lot of students who may not know each other to make friends and just have a good time watching the sports."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is small, which means the class sizes are even smaller. It's amazing to be a part of a small community that allows friendships and deep learning."
College Student,4,The spirit is very high for every game and is mentioned in classes
College Junior,4,I don't do drugs so I have limited access to people who do.
College Junior,4,On campus is very diverse. People from all over the world and all over the country.
College Junior,4,I find all my Engineering classes challenging and interesting. I love the program and have been very successful so far.
College Junior,4,I have a full time job at an engineering company and go to school part time. Im fortunate that my company works around my school schedule. I know my company also offer's jobs to graduates from my school and is active in the internship programs.
College Junior,4,I think the place is nice and have had no problems.
College Junior,4,I like ASU a lot. I have a lot of study options and tutors to help with classes.
College Sophomore,4,School is awesome because I keep a positive attitude!
College Sophomore,4,I has a lot of variety and something for everyone.
College Sophomore,4,I had to find off-campus myself.  The school was somewhat helpful.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of students that go to the mill in tempe.
College Sophomore,4,The off-campus dining is pretty unhealthy but its do-able.
College Sophomore,4,The security tries to keep you safe as much as possible.
College Sophomore,4,It has great qualities and it is very clean.  I like it.
College Junior,4,"There are many choices for off campus housing. It can get expensive due to the area, but overall, its the better choice."
College Freshman,4,"Fun, small classes, small campus, slightly pricey."
College Junior,4,"Many fast food and sit down restaurants within a 5 minute drive of campus, as well as markets for actual groceries. Within 10 minutes are two strip malls with excellent restaurants and movie theatres, etc."
College Junior,4,"Housing for sophomores and above is actual suburb housing (what used to be military officer housing) three people to a three bedroom house. Houses are old but spacious and maintenance requests are processed very fast if there are any issues. Social Atmosphere is hit and miss; some houses are near grassy park areas where everyone gets together nights and weekends for barbecues, others are on streets that have almost no activity and are boring. 2-5 minute walk from housing to campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Haven't come across ""Strictness"" per se. Most of the attendance, at least when it comes to tardiness is very liniment."
Freshman,2,"The Polytechnic campus is great for those who want to focus on their studies and not worry about going out or making plans or meeting people.  But to those who wish to have the ""college experience"" and to those who want to make connections or meet people, this is not the place for you.  The lack of events clubs and population make for a boring day with mediocre food and a need to do something. This campus can be compared to a ghost town, with a commute to another campus only being 30 minutes, it seems feasible, but the commute ends up being a hassle with getting together making a plan finding a way back and finding a place to go."
College Junior,2,Its Poly. No need to say anymore. A ride off campus to Tempe is a must.
College Junior,2,"Arizona State Polytechnic Campus, disregarding the fact that it is part of ASU, has no party scene at all. 90% of the campus being Engineers combined with easily patrolled and discovered housing means nothing bigger than 10-15 people happens. Expect to be able to walk the whole campus on a weekend without seeing anyone."
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing going on in campus housing. Its very spread out and the rules are extremely strict.
Freshman,1,Don’t go. People here keep to their own groups. There are still plenty of people who go off campus and to Tempe to party and alcohol in the dorms even though it’s a supposed “dry campus”. There are barely any clubs on this campus. If you want to join one or do anything relatively social then you have to take a 50 minute shuttle ride to Tempe. There’s nowhere to walk to and the nearest small shopping center is 15-20 minutes away by car. Save the money and go somewhere where people aren’t so self centered and there’s actually stuff to do.
College Sophomore,1,All the frats are on tempe. We dont have any interaction with greeks on poly.
College Sophomore,1,We have such amazing facilities and not that many people use them. Its a shame.

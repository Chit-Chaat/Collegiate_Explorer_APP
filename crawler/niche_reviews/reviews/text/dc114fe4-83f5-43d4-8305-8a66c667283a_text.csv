Freshman,5,Since the whole distance learning thing is new to me and alot of my instructors at TMCC I'd say that the experience so far is actually pretty good and overall has impacted my daily  life in a good way.
Freshman,5,"I overall had a pleasant experience. I enrolled right after high school, and the staff were fantastic and willing to help me. I earned a two-year degree and i am planning to return this fall for a 9- month certificate. Nothing needs to change."
Junior,5,What I love about TMCC is that you get to learn and experience the traditional ways of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa teachings.
Freshman,5,The small class sizes are great if you need a little extra help. The faculty is very nice and helpful. It a good environment to be in it makes me happier than i have been in a long time being here.
Freshman,5,I like TMCC because the college offers a lot of programs. They have quite a lot but the only downfall is the money support it has behind it. We have quite a few students but students really don’t know what they are going into most of the time so these programs aren’t filled with a bunch of students. I would like to see that change. Students interacting more with the college.
Freshman,5,"This will be my first year attending, but so far the staff has been helpful in every way possible. They go out of their way to help you with what you need."
Sophomore,5,The stuff here at TMCC is so helpful in each department. The classes are smaller compared to a university so the instructors have a lot of one on one time for the students.
Freshman,5,"Turtle Mountain Community College is a Excellent School, The staff and professors are very professional  and helpful. They help with just about everything. If you do not know something, they will show you everything."
Sophomore,5,It's close to home and really easy classes and you have the choose to go to the campus or do online classes I like the campus.
Freshman,5,the faculty are very in depth with the help and guidance they give they are very accurate in the things they expect of college students i would recommend  this college to any and all college students
College Junior,5,I haven't started yet but I have only heard very outstanding things about the college I am soon to be attending! I'm very excited for this new experience.
College Sophomore,5,Campus is nice and comfortable and I enjoy it here.
College Sophomore,5,I love the turtle mountain community college it is a great school to attend
College Junior,5,"I believe the tuition is well worth the courses I'm taking as well as the options of courses I am able to take. Financial aid services are wonderful at Turtle Mountain. Any time I need assistance, they are willing to go above and beyond to help me find scholarships or assistance to help me achieve my academic goals."
Recent Alumnus,5,I believe TMCC deserves an A+ because the size of the classes are small enough and if you do not understand you are comfortable enough to ask the professor to explain the topic. TMCC is an excellent school choice because the faculty is very friendly and helpful.
College Junior,5,I think they are doing a fine job up here. The work isnt to hard but yet it is very challeging
Recent Alumnus,5,I usually receive a's when I am doing online classes I could receive them going to on campus classes but there is currently road work where i have to drive an extra 20 miles to make it  to class and that gets really expensive when You have no income at all and only relying on your school grants to get you through.
College Junior,5,"Beacause I am a Native American, single mother attending a community college, financial aid is always within arms reach. Tuition is covered, and the money I receive from scholarships and financial aid is used to cover my cost of living, books, and other fees."
Junior,4,"I am a student who has to be in class with the professors, but with this pandemic it was very hard to do my challenging classes online, but I did it and passed all my classes with A's."
Freshman,4,"I recently started going to college here. It's my first year and I can say, I wasn't prepared or knew exactly what I was taking on. I was really nervous, and after being here for a month, I can say my perspective changed. The staff members are really nice, open, and welcoming. The professors also are really good at helping students and answering questions. I can only say one bad thing, and it's the organization. I get that there are a lot of students they have to get information for, so completely understandable. But a bit more options for the students who are going into known careers would be great. Another thing that would be great would be dorms on campus for those who don't have reliable transportation."
Freshman,4,I like that this place is a community college and that it has a student union and the people here make you feel welcome.  Student support services is really great.
College Senior,4,"I found it nice how there are many different times classes can be taken. I perfered to take my courses in the morning, so I was still able to work during the afternoon/evenings. I also liked how they offer many online courses if you are unable to attend the course on campus. I have had great experience with picking my classes."
College Senior,4,I really enjoy all my online classes. I think I am comfortable with online courses because in high school I took four online courses. I like how when you are taking an online course you have the option to pick a time that best suits your schedule to get the course work done. I found it helpful to pick a certain day each week to do the homework. This helps to make sure you get a routine done.
College Senior,4,I am enjoying my time at Turtle Mountain Community College. I have enjoyed many speakers who have took the time to come and share with us students and faculty at the college. I also have enjoyed all my courses I have took throughout high school and college here. I would pick to do my Associates of arts again here if I had to pick.
College Senior,4,"The students are actually very helpful and nice. They help you if you need help. I was lost and i just asked a student to help me and she showed me my classes. there are alot of very smart students, they will succeed in whatever they do."
College Sophomore,4,"The student body at my college is diverse. We have students and instructors at my college that come from many different backgrounds and cultures. They come from many different states even. At first I thought it was really weird that so many people from other places would come to a small community college in a very rural area. Now I think that they, like me, like that the college is smaller and they have more one on one student/teacher interaction. I also get to meet and learn about people from other areas and what their cultures are like. "
College Sophomore,4,I think that the online courses that my college has to offer are great. The instructors are great and easy to get a hold of if you need them. I personally don't like taking online courses because I am more of a hands on learner and like the idea of actually going to sit in a classroom.
College Sophomore,4,"If I could do it all over again, I would choose to go to my college again. The teacher to student ratio is excellent, the tutoring and student services are excellent, and so far it has been a really great experience. I also like that it is a community college and I am so close to home and family, which is great for me and my child."
College Sophomore,4,I love that my school has a lot of classes and a lot to do with the Native American Culture. I like this because I am Native American and in taking some of the Native based classes I am learning a lot that I didn't know about my culture and about myself. I also really like that my college isn't a big university. It is a community college and there are fewer students so there is a lot more one on one student/teacher interaction.
College Sophomore,4,My thoughts is they need to sit down with students to help 
College Sophomore,4,The computers all work good I really have no complaints
College Sophomore,4,There is the learning center that is a really good place to go to get homework done they do whatever they can to help you achieve your goals.
College Sophomore,4,The student body is awesome they do a good job at keeping all the students happy and make sure that all the students participate in everything.
College Sophomore,4,I will go to the career office and see where I can be able to find a job or look in the listing I'm sure I wouldn't have trouble because around our community we need a lot of teachers 
College Junior,4,"I really like online courses. They are a bit intimidating at first because you have to constantly check for new assignments, due dates, and hold a certain responsibility to stay diligent. This only proves that online courses are just as challenging as in class participation. The only difference is that online courses work around your schedule. Working full time and taking online courses is very attainable and that's my favorite part."
College Senior,4,The professors give excellent directions on assignments and are willing to work with you.
College Junior,4,Early Childhood – My school has a great Early childhood program this is better preparing me for my career after graduation.
College Junior,4,"Early Childhood. My school has a great Early Childhood Program that is preparing me for my future career. The help that I need is normally readily available,  but some of my advisors need to be a little better organized and prepared."
College Sophomore,2,I take children's literature online and it is harder than it would be in the classroom. I was nervous about taking it online but I feel more comfortable taking it online than in the classroom. I like though because you always have time to get on the computer and get it done.
College Freshman,2,"Don't Have Many Opitions – I'm a communications major, but here at Turtle Mountain Community College they only give me my Gen-Ed classes, I don't have many options that pertain to my major. So, I'll have to transfer to North Dakota State University to finish my major."
Recent Alumnus,1,They only work with you the minimum amount that is necessary. Don't seem to be too interested in what the student need.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Good – Server often goes down, wireless network keeps timing out, decent speed, IT department is slow to fix any problems with the network."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Try to Avoid – My choice in college was poorly made. Teachers that are hired do not have the appropriate knowledge nor the level of skill required to teach the students. Financial aid is always a hassle, they are never prepared and most students have great difficulty receiving the aid that they need. Knowing what I do now, given the choice to start over, I would have chosen to go elsewhere."

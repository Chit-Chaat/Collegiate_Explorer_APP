Freshman,5,I am so excited to be starting at faith in the fall of 2020. It has been very cool. I will be going there for scholarship weekend in November and I can’t wait one of my best friends goes there and I can’t wait to see her.
Senior,5,"Faith has an incredible atmosphere. The professors and staff truly care about you as a person and will never treat you like a number. The student body is, on the whole, friendly and passionate, and I have made life-long friends during my time there."
Sophomore,5,I love the family atmosphere of the campus. I really like how willing all the staff and faculty are to come alongside the student body not just to help academically but also spiritually. The professors are superb and love seeing their students learn and grow. I can not think of anything that I want to see change. I believe that the school is great the way it is.
Freshman,5,Faith is an excellent school. I have grown immensely here. I have recommended it to my brothers and my cousin.
Junior,5,"Faith Baptist Bible College is a great college, and by far one of the best choices I made! After spending two years there, and planning to finish my bachelor's degree there, I have grown to love this college. My favorite part of this college is the love the professors have for the students. All of my professors cared about my character development. Each one of them made sure to let me know that for any reason I could set up a time to talk with them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the resources and information I received there. As a missionary kid, I wondered how much more I could learn about missions. This college has taught me a lot, not only about mission methodology, but even more importantly about my loving God behind it all. My college experience here was a great experience. Of course it is not a perfect place, only Heaven is perfect. No matter what struggles I had during my college years, I always had someone from the college ready to lovingly help me through."
College Senior,5,"I love Faith. I have grown so much in my love of the Lord and His Word, and I have learned so much about local church ministry and how to effectively serve God in everything I do."
College Senior,5,"Some would say that getting a degree in Biblical Studies is a waste of time and money, but I strongly disagree. For me, as a Christian, I would say it is the most practical degree and the most useful. You learn about how to study the Bible effectively and how to properly interpret it; you grow in knowledge of how the church works and how to be an active member; you meet friends that you will have for the rest of your life. What part of that could possibly be considered a waste of time?"
College Senior,5,"Our nurse is ready to aid any ailing students or faculty/staff. She is also ready and willing to take anybody to the hospital at the drop of a hat.

The campus security vehicle is always en route around campus, and because you basically know or know of everybody, it's easy to spot visitors."
College Senior,5,"I love the dorm style - suites! There are 25 rooms on each floor, 50 rooms total in each dorm, and one men's and one women's dorm on campus. Each room houses two students, and two rooms next to each other share a jack-and-jill style bathroom. It's great to not worry about having to share a community shower with others on your floor, and it's very nice to not have to haul your toiletries back and forth to the bathroom daily! Each room is equipped with two of each of the following: beds, half-sized dressers, desks, and bookcases. Each furniture piece is able to be stacked. The closets are walk-in style, and are decently sized."
College Senior,5,"The coaches are very professional and know what they're doing, yet they are personal and down-to-earth. They care about each of their players and assistant coaches/managers/statisticians. The facilities are the best - we have the biggest gym of the entire NCCAA league, and it is bigger than many NCAA Div. 2 gyms. Gym crew and maintenance work together to keep the facilities clean and fully functional."
College Senior,5,"I love the overall friendliness on campus between students, professors, staff, and visitors. I love that the focus of the college is to prepare and train students for a lifetime of effective ministry and pursuing godliness, regardless of the degree(s) they pursue, the job or career field they enter, and the place in the world in which they live. I love that the professors care about each individual student - in fact, they are given pictures of enrolled students during the summer so they can familiarize themselves with the students' faces and pray for them before they have even met! I love that each and every staff member - bookstore clerks, dining services employees, administration personnel, student life, the dean of students and the dean of women, and even the President himself - is willing and ready to talk to anyone that enters their office; and if they don't have the time, they will try their hardest to make a timely appointment that works for both parties."
College Junior,5,"Our sports teams work hard to build team work, endurance, and excellence throughout each season."
College Junior,5,Faith has been an incredible school. The professors have high standards and they are approachable. The curriculum is challenging and engaging. The students and faculty have a unique bond that make the school feel like home.
College Junior,5,"The dorms are wonderful! So clean and neat. The rooms are spacious, and provide two comfortable beds, dressers, desks, and bookshelves. It is very convenient having a bathroom right by your room and it connects to the next suite, helps to progress your friendships with the connecting suite. The people are friendly and helpful. It is close to all campus buildings and the community. There are many shops, banks, and jobs nearby. It do wish that there was a little more room, or at least an extra room, for storage. Since, I am far from home, I need more things than those close to home who can get items whenever needed."
College Sophomore,5,"Drugs and alcohol are prohibited anywhere on campus at Faith, so I have never even seen anyone partaking or been pressured to do so. If a student were to be caught, they would be immediately dealt with according to the handbook policy."
College Sophomore,5,Living in the dorms at Faith is an amazing experience. I've built some of the best friendships that I've ever had in my life while living in the dorm. It is really easy to request a roommate and even a room for the most part.
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt threatened in any way on campus. Security is always roaming around and willing to help out with anything that is needed.
Recent Alumnus,5,Lots of people from all over the country and the world.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I'm so glad I came to this Bible college and I would do it again. Great academics, social life, culture, and ministry opportunities."

College Sophomore,4,Its an easy program and its a great way to learn techniques for a business or becoming a secretary.
College Sophomore,4,Its easy to apply and not hard to get accepted. The main thing is that your saved and either single or married. If your divorced they won't accept. That's about the only way you won't get accepted.
College Sophomore,4,There are many different scholarships available to new and to returning students as well.
College Sophomore,4,"It is really fun to be a part of athletics at Faith. We are a small enough school that there is a bigger opportunity to play than there would be at a large institution. We have nice facilities, and our coaching staff is absolutely wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere at Faith is very unique in the sense that everyone knows who you are and to some extent a little about what you are planning to do with your life. School spirit is really high, and we love athletics here. We have a relatively small campus, so it is literally impossible to get lost. The faculty and staff are really involved in what's going on around campus and in the lives of the students as well."
College Sophomore,4,Campus has very strict guidelines for our social and academic lives.
College Sophomore,4,"Living in Ankeny and in close proximity to Des Moines, restaurants are easily found, and the variety is huge."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of classes taught by a variety of professors, and this creates a well-rounded education for any students attending the school."

Recent Alumnus,4,Great place to find a spouse...Facebook stats.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been able to qualify for grants or scholarships. I'm still looking for one that will actually help me get through school without the financial burden.
College Sophomore,2,"Winter is rough in Iowa, and it is always really cold and icy during the winter months. Driving conditions are sometimes a little scary if you are not accustomed to driving in snow or on icy roads. Otherwise, spring, fall, and summer weather are awesome!"
College Freshman,2,"Marginally Scary – It's not generally too hard to find a parking spot on campus. Some times it can become difficult, though. Also, I worry about security with the parking. We're ""required"" to have parking permits, but only about half of the students actually do. This doesn't make me feel very safe. Also, one time, I had to borrow a vehicle from my parents while mine was getting fixed. I called security to let them know, and they really didn't seem to care. They didn't ask for the plate nubmer or anything."
Alum,1,"If asked, I prefer not to divulge where I received my degree because it has nearly cost me several jobs by making the interview process more difficult. FBBC has a stigma. 

The academics are not rigorous, students are treated like children, thinking critically for yourself is not encouraged. Rules are overly strict and develop a mindset of legalism. Authority figures are often intimidating. Early marriage is encouraged, but without wise counsel. I very nearly married an emotionally, sexually and spiritually abusive man I attended at this school with. I am thankful to this day that I have a family who loved me enough to risk our relationship by telling me that I was in a dangerous and toxic engagement that was not  healthy. Their risk spared me from a lifetime of pain, but no one I was around daily at FBBC was willing to step in and intervene on my behalf.  Perhaps they did not notice the obvious warning signs because they’re so normal at FBBC;  that is gravely concerning."
Freshman,1,Small classes that are entirely irrelevant to a business student.  Nothing to do on weekends.  Left after the first semester along with about 12 other freshman.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is non-existant at Faith Baptist Bible College.

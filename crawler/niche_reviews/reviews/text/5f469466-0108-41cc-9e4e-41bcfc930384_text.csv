Freshman,5,"I visited the campus earlier this year and It was beautiful and well organized. I saw the cafeteria, the music rooms, the area and it was a really fun experience."
Freshman,5,I have not started classes yet so I could not rate it but I know a friend that goes there that says it is really good.
Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed my studies through Berklee College of Music thus far. All of my professors have been very hands on and quick to answer any questions I've had, whether it be about the work we are doing, or about real life questions."

Freshman,5,I think that their environment is so diverse. I like the fact that all the people attending Berklee are extremely talented.
Niche User,5,Berklee College of Music is a top notch school for music education and all areas of the music industry. The opportunities for growth and connections and networking are brilliant. The administrative aspect and communication need improvement however.

Freshman,5,"Don't know much about it, but if it is anything like the Berklee way, it is fantastic and amazing in every way."
Sophomore,5,"This school is my dream school. Although the virus has hit every college hard, I think my school did the best that they could with handling it. They sent all of us home right after midterms and paid us back half of the semester's dorm cost since we would no longer be in it. They have sent us regular updates which has been really nice. The musical environment at Berklee is crazy... nothing like it. There are TONS of performance opportunities and we have live music every night I our cafeteria. The possibilities and resources are endless. A lot of people complain, but you have to know what you want to get out of the school and figure out how to do that. There's lots of career help, you just have to use it."
Freshman,5,Berklee has some of the top musicians in the world so the environment is challenging but very motivating to reach your highest potential.
Freshman,5,"If you want all around support from your teachers,  Great connections, Endless opportunities, and great long lasting relationships (Personal and business), Definitely apply here! I have loved every second while being here!"
Niche User,5,"I have been accepted to Berklee this year for the class of '24 for Bachelor of Music Performance.
I have not studied there yet but I did do a lot of research on it and I know for certain that is where I really want to go and study for my next 4 years of education.
My Drum Kit teacher is also one of the Alumni's from Berklee and I also do have some friends there who all said that the place is amazing and everything it gives you, educational wise is just incredible.
All the facilities the place holds and the people there can make you become the best at what you want, meaning music.
Overall I really cannot wait to go there this year in Fall.
Thank you very much!

Many thanks,
Raoul Georgescu"
Freshman,5,"I love this school! Every day, we are exposed to so many different types of music and there is no better place to go to school for music because of Berklee's diversity. I like the fact all of our classes are music classes and that there are so many different ensemble options we can play in. Furthermore, our professors are all working in the music industry, so we get the most experience with industry professionals."
Freshman,5,Love Berklee. But it's important to know that this school does not spoon-feed you. You get what you make out of it.  You have to be willing to put yourself out there and study to do well in your classes. It's not easy.
Freshman,5,"I am a second semester student. Berklee is a great school and I love how diverse the music scene is. You are not obligated to only playing your ""principle"" instrument. If you know how to play or do different things, you can. You can do almost anything you want here. The only bad thing here is the no air conditioning in my dorm. I need that. But everything here is great. The teachers, the classes, the environment, the ensembles and the people. Berklee is a great place to be."
Sophomore,5,"Berklee College of Music is told to be the best place to study music. It's unbelievable how true it is! Before coming to Berklee, I was studying at the Academy of Music in Katowice (PL), so I have a comparision. I'm amazed with tremendous amount of knowledge and practise we receive at the college. Also every day brings new opportunities to learn, cooperate, develop and get inspired. Not only as a musician but also as a human being."
Niche User,5,"Great place to meet friends, performers, and gain future opportunities. You will be in a place where you can watch and learn from the best of the best."

Sophomore,5,"I love Berklee. The staff and faculty are all super nice and supportive. If you make an effort, you can easily create a good reputation within the first semester. It's easy to create community because everyone already has a deep shared passion for music."
Freshman,5,"I think it's fair to say that Berklee College of Music lives up to it's reputation. Everyone here is extremely talented and well versed in their principle instrument and are very flexible as far as style, genre, and difficult. The school trains you to be well rounded and thorough from your ear down to technique and even handling business transactions and just how to handle yourself professionally. The school also has state of the art technology and facilities as well as several venues and spaces for students to really get out here and express themselves as they desire whilst providing them with the ability to learn how to book shows themselves. Several world renown artist come on a regular basis to share their expertise and work with students. Even the libraries are full of hundreds and thousands of resources for students to succeed. If you're a musician looking to study music of any sort, this is the place."
Niche User,5,"I did a summer course at the college, the vocal summit. it gave an insight to how the school is and the courses that were offered, as well as the quality of the education. I found the classes I took to be amazing and very insightful, I'm so glad I went to the summer program, hopefully I get accepted here!"
Freshman,5,I have nothing but good things to say about Berklee since I've been attending it. The staff are helpful and always ready and happy to help ASAP. The facilities are top notch. And the environment is accepting of people of all kinds.
Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of amazing musicians, it's just a matter of finding the right crowd. Berklee is extremely diverse, there are students and teachers from all over the world."
Sophomore,5,"I attend Berklee College of Music and I am beyond blessed and grateful to be there. It is really everything I ever imagined college to be like. I am surrounded by thousands of super talented musicians who share very similar passions as I do and music is playing non-stop everywhere you go around campus. 

The professors are great but some could be more invested in their students I would say. In addition, I feel like there should be more practice rooms as there is always a waiting list for students trying to get a room to practice in."
Sophomore,5,"Berklee is the place to be for music education. Not only you will meet teachers who are currently working for big names of the music industrie, you will also be surrounded by the best musicians of this generation, and you will learn alongside them."
Niche User,5,Berklee is a great program for those that really want to get into music. It offers a great range of educational genre and excellent connection abilities.
Freshman,5,"Berklee College of Music is an excellent place for all aspiring musicians to grow and harness their skills and passion and turn it into a career. Their facilities are top of the line, location is amazing and professors all open and helpful. All fellow students are as interested in music as you, creating a community of musicians that you can learn and grow form and collaborate with,"
Freshman,5,"The Boston Conservatory at Berklee is one of the . most inviting and warm colleges you'll experience. the staff are undeniably the most supportive, very helpful with students and understanding of the best worst situations. the community is like no other. from the berklee students and definitely to Boston conservatory crowd. filled with many talented and amazing artist all gather to pursue common and vain Interests which is to perfect out crafts and  flourish into the best and most humble, authentic   and inspiring artist that we can be."
Sophomore,5,I really loved my freshman year! I just wish the leaders would change and make the school more diverse as a whole and make class sizes smaller! I would recommend this school to anyone who is very passionate about music and performing!
Freshman,5,Great and friendly environment. Professors are invested in each student and go in depth to make sure each students completely grasps the curriculum by infusing it in to ways that make what they have learned applicable to  real life.
Senior,5,Berklee is a great place to develop and a Christian and as a musician! The culture is rich with many different styles of music which pushes you to find your inner creativeness.  Would love to see more student input in the college's decisions.
Niche User,5,"Berklee has the most supportive and amazing environment of any university I have visited. It will be my new home in the fall, and I am super excited. Everyone is so kind and motivating. It is truly an inspiring place in an amazing city."
Freshman,5,"I love Berklee so far. It's been such a rewarding experience and I've already gotten so much more opportunity than I could have ever imagined. My biggest problem is the price tag, though."
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed looking at the different rankings and it helped me view an overview of the colleges that I could select.
Alum,5,"Berklee opened my eyes to see the music world differently.  Berklee is very innovative, diverse but also inclusive.  With all the greatest resources I was able to find what I truly want and shaped my future in a very positive way."
Freshman,5,"Berklee will give you exactly as much as you put into it. You will learn self-advocacy, networking skills, confidence, and drive. Oh, and music."
Freshman,5,Love the education. The professors are very knowledgeable with what they teach. I’ve learned a lot more. I’ve been a mucician for 12 years so it’s exciting to learn more and take my music to another level
Freshman,5,Such a great experience . Easy to learn and understand . Friendly faculty and awesome peers. Berklee offers so much. Great school.
Alum,5,"It has a place for everyone, and you can make your own path. They don't give you any classes that you won't need for your career. Also, because it's so big and diverse, you get to meet people you never would otherwise. The different tracks that people come from and go on is astounding, and I would go there again in a heartbeat. Being around such talented musicians is an honor, and even just being in the room with them teaches me so much."
Niche User,5,"Berklee College of Music has the most unique college campus out of all the schools I've toured. It is so immersed within downtown Boston, that one feels that they are truly living in the heart of the city. It's an experience like no other, in such a fantastic location."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Berklee has been amazing! I have been able to learn a lot, grow, and develop my skills to become a better musician!"
Freshman,5,"Performance is my addiction. I always want to play more and more. Especially in jazz style and improvise the new phrases. That is the point of my life, you can improvise totally different lines when you play the same song. That gives you creative skills to become an artist. I’m used to spending long hours on the practice 
Trumpet and performance are the indispensable duos. Performance is the best way to show my character and life. I can catch the audience and take them on a journey. The trumpet is like my heart, my mouth. My heart beats give the rhythm to my music and my mouth is a help to say my feelings. When you are playing your original music, who feel like a newborn baby. Performing at the stage is like a race car, I always realize that because audience listen you very careful and you should not make any mistake. But this is getting me excited to do that. My dreams come true."
Senior,5,"I attend Berklee Online which is a great way to earn your degree while your busy with music related things. A lot of my classmates are on tour, running their own businesses, or managing artists. The ability to work at my own pace allowed me to earn my bachelor's degree in only 2 years. The teachers are also very knowledgeable and most are professionals in the industry. They are a great resource and are always willing to answer questions."
Niche User,5,"I'm a student enrolled into Berklee's online bachelor's degree program and it's been so easy to get through. Comprehensive lessons, live instructor feedback sessions, and a good mix of classes to choose from."
Junior,5,"Berklee Online is one of the most affordable colleges in the nation. For the education you receive, you get more than any other university and are set on the right path to success as a musician."
Junior,5,Incredibly flexible and Unique experiences you would otherwise not recieve like having a teacher who was also Katy Perry's touring manager WHILE they were on tour! And being online you still skype you have in my opinion more contact with your teachers than I ever did in physical college. As well as just crazy cool courses. I am finishing my third quarter and accumulated 30 credits worth! So an entire year and I still have a quarter to go! incredible
Freshman,5,"I love Berklee College of Music. Any entering student will feel and abundance of support, many of the professors want to see you succeed and provide a lot of guidance for all students. It has a very diverse environment with people from all parts of the world. Berklee has countless clubs, organizations and programs available to the students. The food is really good, and they are open to catering to any eating habits. It is one of the best institutions for music in the world, and many students that value their time at the school end up with successful jobs in the music industry. The best part of Berklee is all the networking opportunities available to the students, just for being Berklee students."
Junior,5,"Great for music, not socials. It really depends on what major you are doing. Sometimes you have great teachers. It really depends how lucky you get during your registration period. The facilities and teaching methods are a little old and slow, but once in depth into your major you fly pretty quick."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent opportunities for performing, one-on-one with faculty, great cafeteria. Teachers and directors will help you succeed in music, dance, or theater."
Junior,5,The best music experience you can get worldwide. Every day you have a new experience . The teachers are the best and studios are awesome.
Sophomore,5,"I just completed my first year at Boston Conservatory, and it was what I expected and more. The teachers are deeply invested in their students success and are always there for help and advice. The curriculum is challenging, but it pushes you to grow and explore beyond yourself. The school itself is in the heart of Fenway and provides a lot of activities to do outside of class with friends and families."
Sophomore,5,"What I like the most is the cultural diversity I can find in just a small space. Being able to treat, play and talk with other people with different backgrounds as I is an amazing opportunity I'd never thought I would be able to get someday in my life."
Sophomore,5,"Berklee College Of Music is the best college I have ever attended.  The professors are very educated and helpful, the materials are tough but I have learned so much and the additional support is exceptional also.  I was a transfer student and accepted into their song writing program and throughout my time so far my classes have expanded me into several different directions to enhance my ability for other areas to make money in my field of study.  Being able to attend this school online has also given me the flexibility to work and do my homework around my busy schedule."
Sophomore,5,"The overall experience at Berklee College of Music is very exciting and live. The academic process is engaging and enticing and cannot be matched by any other college of its kind. The professor to student relationship is unique and ideal for a successful experience. One thing I would like to see change in is, the financial  help that returning students receive to continue their studies and doing what they love. Whether it be through a program to aid students, or even a raffle provided by the school, anything they may could do to provide the help that so many students need."
Freshman,5,The professors are (no joke) the best musicians from the world. The faculty very friendly and the competition is exhilarating! The best school to reach new limits in musicality.
Sophomore,5,"I love how diverse Berklee is, and I also like how Berklee is in the heart of the city which gives students an easier way to get involved in the community and into Boston's music scene."
Junior,4,I found that online classes were handle very well and the professors did a good job adjusting. I personally found it very difficult to keep track of assignments and due dates because of the lack of typical routine.
Sophomore,4,Online classes are not meant for a musical institution. It's difficult to really stay motivated when you're not able to receive the experience that you're paying for.
Senior,4,"Berklee has given me much knowledge of the music industry and has given me very practical advice on how to pursue my music career. The education given to me is from really well-experienced professors that had worked in real music industries. Many of the projects and assignments trained me to prepare me to respond to real-life client's demands. One of the biggest negative reviews I would give Berklee is the cost of education and the return on investment. Even with the knowledge provided by Berklee, many outside sources of online music courses that are way cheaper, and with the right people, I can achieve this cheaper and reach to where I want to aspire to be in the music industry. However, I still no doubt think that the only reason that makes Berklee so outstanding is its connection to its community where the community of musicians is outstanding musically and are serious music career makers."
Sophomore,4,"I didn't sign up for Berklee Online, but due to COVID-19, I sort of became a Berklee Online student. Most of my classes were pretty transferrable since I mostly took things like theory and lots of liberal arts courses. It was definitely an adjustment, but my professors were super flexible with me and ready to help me. They were understanding of the stress and extra pressure and defeat that came with all of us having to leave the social part of music school behind. This is super crucial because we couldn't play or practice together for Ear Training or Ensembles or ANY performance based class. We also couldn't do our musical extra curricular which are a HUGE part of the Berklee Experience. My ensemble teachers handled the transition as best as they could and we switched over to recording everything. It sucked because that's not what we signed up for, but they did their best. And that's what really matters."
Freshman,4,Berklee has phenomenal teachers who already are tech savvy and transitioned easily to teaching online.
Junior,4,I am an online student with Berklee College of Music and I really do love it. The only thing that I would change about it would be that I have to take music theory classes even though I am a music business student. I do not think that the business students should have to take theory classes.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are incredible and if you get a good one, which most are, they are highly skilled.  The cost is outrageous and there is very little opportunity for scholarships, unless you are destitute.  Regular working class people don't qualify.  The course load is intense, it's no joke- you study and work harder than you can imagine.  Practice time is intense- 6 hours a day minimum."
Senior,4,"If you're an open minded person who loves music and wants to pursue a life of music, Berklee is definitely for you. Most teachers are amazing, and I believe that Berklee really does try to service the student. You really need to work hard here to get something out of your time at Berklee, but that hard work will pay off!"
Freshman,4,"Berklee is a place where musicians and artists alike dream to go! I'm very excited to enroll & start my first semester there this January. A friend of mine has been there since September and she loves it! She's lucky enough to have amazing roommates, brilliant classes & knowledge expansion galore. I cannot wait to see what I learn and how I grow at Berklee"
Freshman,4,"I love that Berklee has all the programs and classes that I need in order to better understand music and learn more techniques that I can do to make my voice fuller and sound more mature/beautiful. The community nice and everyone is pretty welcoming! But what I think should change is the way their financial aid do things. I did my FASFA in October of 2018 to make sure that I had enough money to ensure my 1st year at the school, but in the start if Summer Berklee's financial aid made me do these tasks that took awhile to do and because of that I lost a lot of money that I could've gotten from Federal Financial Aid. Not just that, but even though they made do all that work they didn't give me any money in my Financial Aid Package."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, a really good school. Like any college, Berklee has its issues as well as its strengths and weaknesses. If berklee is the right school for you, it’s a great place to be but is not so much if you find that this isn’t the right place for you to be."
Junior,4,"I am attending the online program and I would like to see more interaction from the teachers, and maybe one on one sessions with the students at least once per semester."
Sophomore,4,"I love my teachers and I've learned so much but I wish it was so expensive. $1400 per class is a lot and I have to pay out of pocket each semester or obtain another loan to afford it. On a brighter note, I have met several people around the world who share my same goals and interests. Also, I think some of the course are a little redundant and needing a little updating."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed how knowledgeable the professors at Berklee are not only about their specific class topics, but about music and the business of being a professional musician in todays world."
Sophomore,4,"Berklee has been wonderful. The professors for the most part are very knowledgeable about music and theory. My one complaint is a lack of specified focus in the departments, but as a contemporary music curriculum goes, it's stellar."
Sophomore,4,"Berklee is a community of really gifted musicians and a very special place. I have been very challenged to grow here because of the environment of extraordinary talent. On one hand, I feel motivated and have progressed tremendously; on the other hand, I am intimidated by my peers and my inner critic has gotten very loud and I need to learn to cope with this (as does any human). Boston is a cool place to be for music and there are a ton of trips you can go on. It's definitely a good place to be if you want to be in the contemporary music industry and meet a ton of good contacts."
Niche User,4,"So far, I loved the atmosphere. A lot of events that Berklee hosts is student led as well so there is alot of student involvment and real world application after you would have had the theoretical aspect. I also love that there are many well known musicians that come to Berklee to perform so that you have an opportunity to not only see them perform (at a discounted rate of course) but to also meet them and possibly have an opportunity to perform with them."
Alum,4,"Berklee is extremely pricey - but you're paying for the name and the connections. The actual music education can probably be found at most quality music schools, save maybe for the Songwriting department. That's a specific major I don't see elsewhere. The difference here is who's teaching - pretty big industry names. To be totally honest, while I enjoyed my time and made good connections, I can't say I'd recommend it. Enormous student loan debt to go into a field with a highly risky ROI."
Freshman,4,"As a current student at Berklee, I really enjoy the campus, academics, and extreme level of diversity here, in terms of improvement, the food needs improvement, and the elevators in my 15+ floor dorm building would shut down a lot so we had little to no elevator access. Other than that, great school!"
Sophomore,4,"I gave this school 4 stars because although the school does provide many opportunities and has great professors the students are very ""clique-y"". It shows especially in the various showcases I've seen. Many of them have a very similar sound, leaving no room for other performers that bring something different to the table. So, in that aspect, I am disappointed."
Freshman,4,Berklee is a well diverse school. It helps all students with whatever is needed. Shows the way to success in the industry.
Freshman,4,"Love the resources and overall environment. Great place to make connections, but some teachers don't sufficiently teach as well as they should."
Graduate Student,4,"What I love most about this college is the extraordinary opportunity to be completed immersed in the musical environment and surrounded by the most talented and enthusiastic musicians in the world. Every week we have a lot of rehearsals and performances, many concerts and recordings created by the students, outside the lessons and the school activities. I also love the support of the different centers, such as the career center, job opportunities and internships, the large number of master classes with exceptional musicians who come every week to listen to our music and share their stories and advice with us.
What I would change is probably to diminish the separation between the various departments. I would like to have more opportunities to collaborate with the Boston Conservatory at Berklee Dance department, with the recording studios of the Music Production and Engeneering department, or even have the opportunity to participate in the performances of Electronic Music and Design."
Junior,4,Very positive and enthusiastic environment delivered by the faculty a great learning experience to get an education by far!
Sophomore,4,"It's my 3rd semester here at Berklee College of Music and I can say it changed me a lot both as a musician and a person. The diversity at Berklee is something that I'm really proud of, because we all come from different backgrounds, speak different languages, and it's really fascinating how much we are actually connected when we play music together. I would suggest to take ensemble classes every semester because that's where you can learn so much things musically and other life skill things like how to deal with players with different music styles, exchanging ideas, and testing your courage with recital performances once every semester."
Junior,4,"Berklee has so many incredible resources to offer. I love that we are given and informed of so many opportunities, and we're surrounded by so many other talented musicians that continue to inspire. In order to get the most out of Berklee, you have to make it work for you, and take advantage of everything you can. I think that Berklee needs to improve their communication with students on an administrative level. Students should have a say as to where our tuition money is going, or at least be aware of it. Communication between faculty and staff with students is also poor, and some of the teachers couldn't care less about their students, which is fine in a large university, but we are a small tight knit college, and I think teachers should improve."
Sophomore,4,"Overall this is a great school. the main thing you can take away from this place, besides the education, is the connections you will make here. you never know who's going to end up becoming who, so it's important to make as many connections as you can while attending school there."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great, creative environment that aids you to grow and excel in every area in music. I really enjoy the jam sessions, the gigs, and the studio sessions."
Freshman,4,"I have wanted to go to this school since I was 12 years old and when I finally came, it was everything I imagined and more. The professors genuinely care about their students and we'll put in extra work to make sure their students are succeeding. The only thing that hindered my attendance was the cost of the school and how the financial aid department works."
Sophomore,4,"Berklee is an amazing resource for musicians seeking for freedom within the world of contemporary music. The school has put a lot of effort into leaving a wide variety of avenues for students, so they can study anything, and pursue just about any artistic endeavor within the realm of music."
College Student,4,"Berklee, especially being an arts school, is representative of the diverse ways of thinking and the creative process that involves the ceration of each artist's craft. Everyone on Berklee has a rich background, from all over the world, and came together for their love of music, and so all other aspects are appreciated because it is a body that is representative of modern day world."
College Freshman,4,"The most beautiful building you will ever see. Hogwarts-esque.  The dorms are old Brownstone Mansions from the 1890's, and each dorm room is uniquely shaped.  Every dorm has about 28-40 people living in them, and you become very good friends with everyone in your home.  Its almost weird to call it a dorm because it feels so homey.  My only complaint is that there is no Air Conditioning, and we can't bring our own because of the old electrical system in the dorm.  The first four weeks of classes are unbearably hot, but after that everything is amazing!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most of my classes have been great, but there have been a few bad teachers."
Recent Alumnus,4,Berklee does as much as they can to help keep students safe but it is still located in downtown Boston and it is not smart to be out late by yourself.
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of the professors really depends on which professor you get, and a lot of the times students will look to upperclassmen to give them recommendations. The quality of the courses are generally great, with the exception of the liberal arts courses in which I struggled with the quality of the professor and the material that we were going over. The class sizes are great, as even our biggest lectures hold only up to about 60 students in a small hall."
College Student,4,"I feel very safe on campus, and the school makes sure not to let any stranger in the buildings unless they are identified. We have had issues in Boston in Fenway, or in an Uber, but nothing inside our school that I am aware of. Scary things happen every day around everyone, but Berklee makes us feel safe and loved."
College Sophomore,4,"Berklee is full of diversity, kind and talented people. Teachers gave me nothing but all the will to keep on studying hard and never give up. I can feel the good vibes around me, truly because everybody loves this school. Everyone of the classes requires much effort and discipline. Otherwise, you're not good. I've studied in other institutions where I didn't have any pressure at all, that's what I like about Berklee, you have to do your best always. 

I'd choose my school again and again, because it gives me the strongest tools with very professional people, because I feel free to be absolutely myself and I can find people with incredible and the most creative minds with whom we can...raise awareness through music."
College Sophomore,4,i loved how school gave me a lot of works to do but it really helped me out to understand completely about things we learn from class.
College Sophomore,4,I feel like the diversity on campus is really great and i love it so much because I love knowing people from different racial diversity and background and everyone in Berklee seem to be really open minded.
College Sophomore,4,We have public safety people that work for our campus so i think that the personal safety is good in my opinion.
College Sophomore,4,I do not live in the dorm but ive stayed at the dorm with my friends few times and it has a lot of activity going on every week and the social atmosphere is great.
College Junior,4,"I believe finding a job on campus or even near campus isn't the most difficult task. But finding a job that correlates with what you major in is a bit more challenging. I think the admin, and alumni are relatively helpful with the process though."
College Junior,4,"Picking a university suitable for you and your major can be quite a tricky decision. But with the proper help from administration and counselors it can be reassure for students  to find exactly what they need for every situation. I personally like my university and where I study. The main problem for me personally, is affording tuition."
College Junior,4,"Attending university has to be one of the best experiences of my life, getting the chance to meet new people and study precisely what I want to study is absolutely amazing, I am ecstatic to see how the rest of my years go."
College Student,4,"Doesn't need to be a big part of campus life, but it's there and it doesn't hurt anyone. It's mostly for though who need more extreme ways of blowing off some steam during mid-terms."
College Freshman,4,Berklee really is a great place to learn and grow as a musician.
College Freshman,4,Berklee is what you make of it. If you put in the work you will definitely see results.
College Freshman,4,"It is a very expensive investment, but I cannot see myself anywhere else."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel very secure hereht.s tig..security i
Recent Alumnus,4,Alumni network and recruiting on campus is one of best things that Berklee offers
Recent Alumnus,4,very happy here...professors  are always willing to help out
Recent Alumnus,4,i have meet many students from all over the world...
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone is friendly and very supported..one family
College Freshman,4,"Most of my professors are very nice and accommodating to my anxiety and my migraines. Most are experts on the topics they teach which I adore, but I do wish some teachers were more understanding of the fact that we are required to take classes like Arranging 1, and that we do not necessarily need to learn every detail about arranging if we are involved in unrelated majors."
College Freshman,4,"Incredible, specific studying, terribly overpriced"
College Sophomore,4,"Like I said, I still haven't attended the school as a student but based on my visit, it was really great. I just can't give a full and accurate review because I haven't yet had the chance to take full advantage of everything that will be offered to me. Class sizes were great! Largest I attended was maybe 30 people and the smallest was about 8. So nothing like the 200-300 class sizes at many schools. All the staff at the school is extremely helpful in the admissions process and the time between being admitted and attending. They answer all questions clearly and easily transfer you between departments so you can get the best information from the most knowledgable people on the subject."
College Sophomore,4,"Though I don't live on campus, I've stayed on campus for almost a week and it's really great but overpriced. I could find a room to share right near campus and I'd spend less than half what I'd spend living on campus, that's including food and amenities."
College Freshman,4,Berklee's courses are designed to help you develop your musicianship. Every aspect of theory and performance that you learn is all tied together in a very helpful way. Almost none of the classes are frivolous or tedious. The professors are all intelligent musicians who are veterans of the music industry.
College Freshman,4,"Berklee College of Music is unlike any other music school. It is modern and exciting, has up to date technology, and is very open and inclusive. It provides you with the tools to become a great musician, but you have to work for it."
College Sophomore,4,"Some professors seem to not care at all and take their personal stuff out on the curriculum/students, but other than that everything is fine.  I don't really want to stay here longer than I have to but I'm fine being here while I'm here."
Niche User,2,"Going to a college like Berklee is possibly the easiest way to get yourself screwed for life. According to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are roughly 55,000 jobs in the music industry. Considering Berklee's undergraduate size is about 5-6,000, it seems there wouldn't be enough jobs to go around even if Berklee students were the only musicians in the United States. According to NYT, 35% of Berklee's student body comes from families in the top 10% of earners in the United States. On top of that, Berklee graduates have a median income of 27,400 dollars at age 34. The idea that Berklee is a prestigious, competitive school is also a lie. The true acceptance rate is about 55%. During my time at Berklee I encountered some god awful musicians. Surely the income of these students' families have nothing to do with their acceptance, right? On top of that, Berklee's motto is ""to be, rather than to seem."" What a lot of horse shit."
Sophomore,2,This school needs some serious work. The academics are all over the place. The faculty is extremely un organized and will always re direct you.
Alum,2,"It's the Berklee College of Money, over priced and under valued. Has a much better reputation globally than locally. In Boston, people will view you as a sucker for attending because everyone has met the kid drowned in student loan debt that works a mediocre, deadend job waiting to ""make it"". In reality, I know very few people who didn't lose their passion for music after attending. If you are extremely wealthy or on a presidential scholarship, it's a great school to go to and have fun and learn. If you think for one second you will take out loans and make that money back playing music, you're being naive, mislead and taken advantage of."
College Sophomore,2,Berklee seems like they dont have open parties in school.
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is a music school and we dont have any athletic classes, but you can learn about health from classes that is involved with athletics or you could join sports club they have, such as, basketball team, tennis and soccer team.

I didnt get to join any club in my first semester, but  i would love to join Tennis club next semester."
College Freshman,2,Very small. Not clean. Smelly.
College Freshman,2,"For me personally, my on-campus living experience has been sub-par. There is not community in 150 Mass Ave, and while my room is spacious and we have our own bathroom, we also have no natural light which contributes heavily to my seasonal depression and anxiety."
College Freshman,2,My very first night in the dorms there was a mouse in the dorms. There is also lots of construction going on in the main building and the fire alarms go off randomly at night.
College Freshman,2,"It's a music school, sadly there's no athletics program in our school."
College Freshman,2,We don't have sports here at the conservatory.
College Junior,2,I only keep receiving the same job offer which I am not really qualified for.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know about that.
College Freshman,2,It's very expensive or very far from campus. Public transportation required
College Freshman,2,"Berklee kids mainly just hang and listen to music, but that's cool."
College Freshman,2,"The walls are very thin, the bathrooms are dirty"
College Freshman,2,"It has been difficult to receive financial aid from Berklee. It's an expensive institution, and the tuition is quite high, and it is difficult to become eligible for a scholarship. If you just barely fall into the bracket where your family can afford it, you become disqualified. My family can just barely handle it, but some help would be nice. You have to really hustle to find financial aid at Berklee."
College Junior,2,not really an athletic scene.
College Junior,2,"They don't have much financial aid for an international student like me, only scholarships. I got a little bit of scholarship, but it's still not enough, I really struggle to live around here. We pay tuition every semester but continuing students are only allowed to apply for scholarship/ increase their scholarship ONCE per year, and they increase tuition fees every year. It's simply not affordable."
College Junior,2,"The apartments near the school are tiny, prices are too inflated, landlords are rip off."
College Senior,2,"People don't go to Berklee to party.  People go off campus to party.  There's a million other colleges around the area.  Go to BU or Northeastern on the weekends if you feel like partying.  

Berklee has dorms now, but parties get broken up within half an hour of starting."
College Freshman,2,"It's very against anything conservative which I find to be close minded.  It's not healthy for any political group to hate another, even if it is a minority."
College Sophomore,2,The party scene at berklee is bad. There is school party once in a blue moon and some students barely shows.
College Sophomore,2,"From what I know, the Greek life at Berklee is not available. I guess if you want to join the Greek life, you'll just have to go to BU or BC and others."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's downtown boston - of course it's expensive!
College Senior,2,It is way to expensive for what you get. Not worth staying in after your first semester.
College Student,2,It's such a small school and it is private so aid is very difficult. Especially for international students
College Freshman,2,The weather around Boston is really bad. It's mostly cold throughout the year. It seems like it's either cold or less cold around here. It never seems to be warm.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not really sure about the parking spaces because I don't drive to school. However, from what I've heard, it seems like the parking spaces around Berklee are not very convenient and most of them are quarter parking. This causes people a lot of annoyance. I believe that there can be a better way to go about with the parking spaces around Berklee."
College Freshman,2,Tried but way to expensive
College Sophomore,2,Berklee parties are bad and have gotten better only with a small amount being good. Mainly have to go to Northeastern/Boston University/Boston College/etc. to see good parties.
College Junior,2,No one really participates in sports at Berklee
College Freshman,2,"When I auditioned to enter the school, I was told that I would be considered for a scholarship based on how I performed during the audition and subsequent interview. However the only financial aid I was offered was a $1,000 loan from the Federal Government which I would have been required to pay back with interest, even when they saw that I had the adequate amount of money to pay for my first year of Berklee. I am now unable to apply for another scholarship from the college until I attend my third semester which I might not be able to attend due to financial hardship."
College Freshman,2,no parking available to students who live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't too much what to do in free time.
College Junior,2,The atmosphere is really fun... but the Berklee blast is real! You're body literally rejects the Berklee cafeteria food. I lost so much weight cause it would just go right through me.
College Junior,2,"This came as a surprise to me but there are a lot more guys at Berklee than girls and this will be most evident when you're in a classroom of 17 students and only three of them are girls. Though this might seem discouraging, there are plenty of other colleges in Boston with a lot more girls so I definitely suggest branching out and going to non Berklee parties."
College Sophomore,2,I applied for scholarship twice but they never offered me any scholarship.
College Sophomore,2,It is difficult to find parking. Be sure to put enough money in the meter. You will be towed!
College Sophomore,2,People who do drugs then to hang with other people doing the same thing.
College Junior,2,This school is only 30% female. It is kind of a bummer if you were looking into dating during college.
College Junior,2,"There are no real athletics programs at Berklee, but you can partner with neighboring colleges to play on sports teams. They are adding a new building with a gym next semester."
College Junior,2,"Occasionally there are some decent apartment parties near the college, but they can get pretty cramped pretty quick. Try to venture out to other colleges who have more of a party scene.  Transportation in general in Boston is awesome, BUT the T stops working around something like midnight, so you'll have to get a cab if you're gonna stay out late.  The good bars and clubs vary, but there aren't very many for those who are 21+. At least not in the area."
College Junior,2,"Berklee does not offer enough opportunities for scholarships considering how expensive their tuition is and how many students attend the school. They make the guidelines of the scholarships that they offer so hard to meet, that it is only the same select few students who receive the bulk of the money. Financial aid as a whole has been a bit of a headache for me. According to the government, my parents make 'too much money' to receive any financial aid.. but my parents are not the ones paying for my education, I am. And trying to get help for that has been unsuccessful thus far."
College Senior,2,"there are people from all over, but not too many lookers!"
College Sophomore,2,"Since it snows so much here in the winter and the city has found ways to manage it, classes rarely get cancelled due to the weather. Since I live off campus I find it really annoying especially when you'll have a class one day but you can't make it because it's snowing really hard and public transportation is at a stand still. But, other than that the weather in Boston is fairly nice ."
College Junior,2,"There are so many nationalities and social groups at Berklee it is hard to notice a specific emphasis on any particular group. As far as specifically Greek, I haven't seen that many things."
College Junior,2,"Night life is more for Boston society, but not for Berklee student."
College Sophomore,2,Only a Few Spots – There are a few spots by the conservatory but they are usually for teachers. This is okay though because most students live with in walking distance or take the subway. An actual parking lot would be good though.
College Sophomore,2,Not Good Enough – you can not print more than a copy. when I entered they were giving out the old model of the computers that they had for the price of a new version laptop. so I purchased my laptop from out-side.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Good Enough – bad practice rooms, not enough practice rooms, air conditions do not work.  you are not allowed to print more than a copy.  you don't have a student adviser that you can go to anytime you have a question. etc..."
College Freshman,2,Berklee I believe has a hockey team but sports are pretty non-existatnt just like the work out facilities. I guess most musicians aren't interested in hurting their hands in a sport. It'd be nice to have unofficial pickup soccer games or something. I'd like that!
College Freshman,2,"Just Say No! There is a lot of drug activity more so than alcohol.  Peer pressure, not really, just stay true to yourself."
College Freshman,2,"Student Discount – there are some thi restaurant, chinese restaurant, some fast food shop or whatever.. i have never seen any restaurant which discount to student. just in college orientation period, college gave some coupon so we could get free pizza. it was all."
College Sophomore,2,"Distance Vs. Price – Living close to Berklee is very expensive. It's not easy to find a good apartment, either. I looked for over 2 months for a nice place and I finally found it. I'm still paying a lot of money to live close-by and I sacrificed space for cleanliness in order to pay something reasonable. But there's always the option of living further away and paying less. I've heard there are nice apartments in other parts of the city, but having to take the subway to school everyday is a huge hassle.. especially during the winter."
College Freshman,2,Drugs and Drinking – Not as visible on campus but i know people are very in to them. It is an art school and in the middle of the city so many things happen so quickly its hard to catch. But I( choose to focus on school because I have high standards set and I just want to get out of school so I may start my career.
College Senior,2,"Pros and Cons – Cons: Very expensive, stay in the City and do not go southwest - go due east. The T is unsafe at night, break your routine to avoid targeting. Stay in the dorm. You will pay more, but at least you will be safe. Crime rate around Boston is out of control. Don't depend on the law enforcement to keep you safe. Pros: You are near several good restaurants, sporting events and scenery is awesome around Boston. Stay in a group."
College Sophomore,2,"Anyone who has lived in New England will tell you what the weather is like. One minute it will be torrential rain, the next it's bright and sunny. The weather is completely unpredictable. Sometimes it will rain or snow for days on end. Sometimes, the sun will be out for weeks. It gets cold very quickly in Boston, and summertime is delayed as long as possible. I personally have lived in New England for most of my life so I'm completely used to this weather, but for the multitude of foreigners living here, this weather is not the best."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't Expect to Be Helped Too Much. Getting financial aid at Berklee is very tough, and a very uninvolved process for the most part.  There really isn't a lot you can do to help your chances, short of practice your instrument a ton.  The biggest scholarships are either skill- or need-based, so there isn't much you can do in the way of applying for them.  Every so often, the school dishes out some aid to certain students, but there aren't really any patterns."
College Sophomore,2,"Better Bring Your Wallet. The cafeteria at Berklee is very average.  A few decent options, but mostly the same things every day - very similar to a high school cafeteria.  However, the school's location in the heart of Boston makes dining options off-campus very open.  Unfortunately, the price you pay is almost not worth it if you have a meal plan, because you can get more than enough food at the cafeteria without overdrawing your meal plan."
College Freshman,2,"You Better Love It – If you don't love music...I mean really LOVE it...you will hate this school. The ""core"" academics (performance, theory, and composition) are excellent. However, the social scene consists of alcohol and nothing else. I had to join clubs and events at Boston University instead."
Sophomore,1,"What was initially a joke that Berklee's budget is only spent on musical equipment turns out to be not far off. The cafeteria food is not very good, my roommate even got sick once after eating it and this whole diversity and inclusion is stupid. I don't care if the school allows green skinned aliens from Jupiter to attend, what matters is how much you can learn from this place."
Alum,1,"Don´t go to this school, there are better options, please be smart!
research for yourselves you willfind out, this school does more damage than good, stay away!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Berklee College of Music does not have its own independent sports team, unfortunately, and I really struggled with this my Freshman year. Although they offer gym memberships for a discounted price, and we are able to join intramurals that take place at other schools, they are for only a limited variation of sports. The only thing athletic-wise that the school provides is a work out facility that is incredibly small and only in two of the residence halls."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They promised me 100% job placement. I have no job and have applied to well over 100 jobs. They've since added an asterisk with a ""gainful employment disclosure"" statement which says ""This institution is not currently required to calculate a job placement rate for program completers."""
Recent Alumnus,1,"Facilities are poor, classrooms are old, there are rats in the basement."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I would strongly recommend against entering the BoCo program in Music Education. The grade inflation is off the charts (everyone has a near perfect GPA), the quality of education was poor at best and their promises of a job (the only reason I enrolled in the first place) are far from honest. 

I was told the program I enrolled in had 100% job placement. I've applied to well over 100 teaching jobs and have not had a single job offer. The ""Career Support Services"" consider me me fully employed yet all the jobs I currently hold, I was doing prior to entering the conservatory and are not in my field of study. I've been left with thousands in student loans and the only result I've seen is that the program has since placed a gainful employment disclosure statement that reads ""This institution is not currently required to calculate a job placement rate for program completers."""
College Freshman,1,"Although berklee has great music rooms and facilities, there are no sporting facilities which is a bummer for someone who likes basketball. But that's the sacrifice I had to take and it's just a minor flaw."
College Freshman,1,Women who are victims of sexual assault are practically ignored by Berklee. Not a safe space at ALL for women and gender queer people.
College Freshman,1,"Berklee College of Music is, well, a music school. There really isn't much demand or participation in athletics."
College Freshman,1,we don't have greek life here.
College Student,1,There is no Greek life on campus
College Student,1,The school that I will be attending is an all music school so it really doesn't focus on athletic needs.
College Sophomore,1,"My college is music school, so, It's deficient to expose to physical exercise."
College Senior,1,"Berklee is a music college, so there are NO sports teams. Not one."
College Senior,1,We do not have athletics beyond a couple intramural sports.  We used to have a hockey team.  I kinda wish we still did.
Recent Alumnus,1,The closest thing to a frat or sorority? A capella groups.
College Senior,1,We do not have greek life. Everything is city chapters which is great if you know about it. They do a poor job at promoting within other schools such as Berklee.
College Sophomore,1,Berklee is terrible at giving out aid. It's all based on your initial audition.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no sports, not even a gym."
College Junior,1,"I don't drive in Boston but based on stories I've heard from students and faculty, finding parking is a horrendous experience. Berklee is located near downtown Boston, which is a heavily populated area so people are constantly trying to find parking; I feel as though using public transportation trumps driving any day."
College Junior,1,Trying to park in downtown boston is like trying to fit a square peg in round hole. it can't be done.
College Sophomore,1,"All parking is off campus. Very few students have cars, but in the city, you don't need one.  Mass transit is readily available and cheap."
College Freshman,1,There's no sororities or fraternities unless you go through a partner school.
College Freshman,1,"There's nowhere to park, and if there's a spot, it's almost like The Hunger Games - fight to the death."
College Junior,1,"You're on your own--good luck!
WAY too expensive"
College Sophomore,1,Very hard financial help for international student.
College Freshman,1,"There is an Ultimate Frisbee team but if you are looking for a school with outstanding athletics then Berklee is NOT the place for you. Although you can tryout for varsity athletics in schools near by, the coaches will accept students from other schools."
College Junior,1,The weather here is unpredictable as you hear. It can go from 75 and sunny to 40 and raining in a matter of hours.
College Freshman,1,Our school doesn't have it's own Greeks. We have to leave campus to pledge. This is the one thing I don't like about Berklee.
College Freshman,1,"There is no need for cars in the city of Boston. It is pedestrian friendly and has excellent public transportation. If you do have a car, good luck finding parking!"
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus can be a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time. As a freshman, you get the worst parking. there is no parking available, and it gets very expensive."
College Freshman,1,"Student life at Berklee is horrible, no one talks to each other or gets along. no social event, very independent. Very Lonely."
College Freshman,1,"Our school is bad at diversifying the races, genders, and sexual orientation. There is an extreme scarce number of students and staff members of the African American orgin, as well as others."
College Junior,1,"I have really bad experience of housing off-campus. People are selfish, they are trying to steal your money, they're canceling meetings in the last minute, don't answer when they promised, apartments are expensive. Extremely expensive for students. Even college doesn't help you to find a place."
College Junior,1,I feel like it's ALWAYS cold in Boston. Gets really depressing
College Junior,1,one frat and one sorority and they have minimal members.
College Sophomore,1,We have a hockey team but we're all doing music so we really don't see it as vital
College Freshman,1,"Um... What? Berklee does have a few athletic teams. Pretty much, though, they're non-existant. Berklee's focus is on music and not athletic."
College Student,1,Financial Aid should be available for the Summer Session. It is hard to pay tuition out of pocket & not have federal funding or loans to assist.
College Freshman,1,"Berklee is an urban campus. Students who live on-campus cannot bring cars because there is literally nowhere to put them. Most students live off-campus, and if they do have cars, they can park at their apartments."

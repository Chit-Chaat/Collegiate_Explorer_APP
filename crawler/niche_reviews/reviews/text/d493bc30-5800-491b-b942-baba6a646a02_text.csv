Freshman,5,The school is beautiful and up to date on everything. The students are open and caring. The admissions counselors are amazing and super want you to go. Honestly 10/10 recommend going here since it’s just a very family like community. Although the campus is small it’s nice and clean. The dorms are nice and amazing. The school is within walking distance of a few stores and it’s great first time away from home college experience
Sophomore,5,"The college is very good at listening to the students and does it's best to do the best for them.  very good equipment as well as a greta staff, this is a great place to learn everything that you need to in order to get into the industry."
Sophomore,5,It’s a great school. The classes are small which is good because you can get to know the students and the teachers. They have a flexible schedule. The people are nice and let my know about what they offer and what I will me learning
Freshman,5,"If you love filmmaking, TV production, videography, this is the place to be.  The atmosphere, curriculum, teachers, are focused on the making movies."
Recent Alumnus,5,"It was a great experience, on hands participation with in the tour which I like the most.  All teachers and volunteer students gave us presentations that were very clear and broad to better understand what I was getting into..  I also like the fact that school is small which will help much to interact with teachers and other excisting students.  I feel that this is going to be an adventure and  a challenging  experience which will make me more of a strong candidate for future employments with in  the filming/production industry. Adding to this last statement, it is a school that interacts with big filming and production companies, that will also help to set me up for innership purposes and gain experience..  And I would apply again if I had to choose all over again.

Best Regards!

Jennifer Juarez"
College Junior,5,It is better to get a roommate.
College Junior,5,Applying for Financial Aid was a very easy process. The financial aid office made the process very simple and easy. They were very hands on to make sure everyone did everything correctly.
College Junior,5,"You are ten minutes from the beach, an hour from snowy mountains, five hours from Las Vegas, there is DisneyLand, Universal Studios Hollywood, baseball games, basketball games, and hockey games all within a thirty mile radius. The atmosphere here and around the school is great."
College Junior,5,The local weather is sunny all day everyday and doesnt affect the campus unless someone wanted to shoot a rain scene.
College Junior,5,There isn't any Greeks on campus.
College Junior,5,The school has a very diverse background of students from all different areas and walks of life. They have students that are from as far as Bangladesh and Korea and as close as Los Angeles. No one at the school is looked at differently for their beliefs or the way they carry themselves. It is a huge family.
College Senior,5,"Its the old Panavision building, so they had a nice sized parking lot for there employees, when CCH took over the lot, they purchased the lot next door which was a parking lot so students could safely park in the back of the facility.  One of the few smart moves on the schools part. If you stay in the OVERPRICED student housing options, you can easily walk to school or take the shuttle that comes 30-40mins prior to your class period.  

No tickets or fines.  Security guard on duty before and after school hours so no need to worry about the safety of your vehicle.  There are also cameras so your extra ""safe."""
College Senior,5,Students who live in school housing are able to take a shuttle directly from their residence to the school. Public transportation is also available to other students.
College Senior,5,"The application process was very simple. If I remember correctly I needed two refernce letters, and entry essay, a resume, and official transcripts. Obtaining the transcripts from the few schools I have attended was the most difficult and time consuming part. Once all requirements have been met the prospective student interviews with a school counselor and will let them know if they have been accepted or not. Pleae note: this process may have changed since my admission."
College Senior,5,I love the fact that all the computers and software are comprable to the current industry standard
College Senior,5,"With CCH being so close to Ventura Blvd, you're never far from anything you want to eat; whether it is fast food, coffee and pastries or ethnic cuisine."
College Senior,5,Top Quality and they strive for the best or get us the best
College Sophomore,5,"The School is literally right across the street from the Metro, and if you don't have a car to get to school, there is a shuttle that picks up students on a daily schedule."
College Junior,5,"Something for Everyone – There's a variety of dining options within the area. One of my personal favorites includes Panera. Panera is a great, healthy choice for sandwiches, soups, or salads. If you're in a rush before class, Subway, Panda Express, and Coffee Bean are always great choices. Being so close to a hub of spots, you're guaranteed an experience any time you go out."
College Sophomore,5,"Superb Security – Not only do we have 3 wonderfully trained security guards, one of them works for the police department and patrols our campus regularly. Also, the fact that our school is a film school, there are a lot of opportunities for thievery. I have been attending the school for just about a year, and I have not seen or heard of any vandals of any kind."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my professors. I am a freshman at the college and am taking online classes due to the pandemic. It has been a good experience overall. As for changes none.
Freshman,4,I love CCH! I am about to be a Sophmore but have loved my first year. The school is quite small but that is great for making connections and having genuine conversations with staff and professors. If you have an interest in Film I would definitely recommend CCH if you don't mind the small campus!
Junior,4,"If your looking for a good film school, this is it. I have had only good experiences here at my school. the teachers are knowledgable in their field and have no problem in letting you pull out of them all that you can so you can learn more. They have all the equipment you are going to need for each level of production. it truly is a wonderful school.

I think the only thing I would change about it is better communication points between the different fields of study, but other than that it is a great school."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love CCH. The best part about the school is the level of intimacy you feel. Since it's a smaller school, there's more of an opportunity to get to know a lot of people and form bonds with them . There's a strong sense of community that permeates through the halls. Everyone is there to help each other reach their goals and realize other people's vision while fulfilling their own. There's always someone to reach out to for help or guidance no matter what the problem is."
Junior,4,I have found professors in recent years to have improved in helpfulness. The administration staff moves slowly but will help you accomplish what you need done if you've been thorough in what they need from you as well.
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at Columbia College Hollywood has been fantastic, all classes I've taken have been teaching me new things that I can use in a career. The school is very approachable, and since it's so small, the internal community is easy to get into. I do not know yet if my education here will help me get a job in the film industry, but so far, that seems like the logical conclusion to make. The most concerning thing about this school is the massive numbers of negative reviews. So many alumni have posted scathing reviews on Yelp! and other review sites. This makes me very nervous, and I hope that those few reviews are simply the vocal minority. In 2014, Columbia College Hollywood was listed as the #2 Worst School in America, and that is absolutely terrifying. That was four years ago, but it seems like something that I had to find out on my own. My admissions counselor never mentioned it, and that huge oversight seems extremely shady."
Niche User,4,"I was completely sold when I heard about this college. The environment is great, the campus is small and class sizes are small as well. No only that, but here you learn what you want to focus on day one, and not anything you won't need. :)"
College Freshman,4,It is nice to live in an apartment
College Junior,4,People throw a lot of house parties at the dorms and everyone from the school comes by to hang out and party.
College Senior,4,"Teacher's are top notch, the newer instructors aren't always the right fit for that particular class."
College Junior,4,I have not had an internship yet but there is a big department dedicated to helping students find one and there is a bulletin board full of open spots. They are usually credit only but are an invaluable experience.
College Sophomore,4,"Columbia College's facilities are excellent, while there facilities aren't huge, they are constantly expanding and are almost obsessive on keeping up to date and to the industry standard. The goal is to keep the College to Studio Transitional learning curve down and they seem to do a very good job at it."
College Sophomore,4,"Guys and Girls come from all over the U.S and the World, it is a very diverse group of students and every guy and girl has at least one thing in common, so that's a great way to start up a conversation/relationship. Hang around in the lobby all day and you'll run across a wide range of interesting people, and make some unique friends."
College Senior,4,"Several safe and secure apartment complexes are available close to campus, and the school housing office assists (and recommends) comfortable rental units to students. They also have a relationship with apartment rental offices in the area."
College Senior,4,Excellent tips and assistance are available for scholarships and grants. The Financial aid office is always open and available to students.
College Junior,4,"Made for Us – My school provides the perfect atmosphere to make any style of film that we desire. There are sets around every corner, including: living room, pub/restaurant, bathrooms, etc. You name it, we got it. We also have plenty of up to date equipment at our disposal. My school supports us in every way while also teaching us habits we'll need for the real world."
College Junior,4,"Always Something New – Columbia College Hollywood is anything but boring. The quirky style and diversity of looks is not only fun to look at but allows students to film in a variety of locations that wouldn't be available at other colleges. Lined the walls are posters and examples of the alumni's work as a constant reminder that we can succeed too. There's always a film being made, festivals and social gatherings, and a chance to learn and grow in an upbeat, fun environment. This is the perfect place to let your imagination go wild and improve your craft."
College Senior,4,"people literally have traveled from many parts of the world to be at Columbia College Hollywood. not just black and white people from different backgrounds, but hispanic, jewish, etc. not to mention the people from australia, switzerland, nigeria, etc."
College Senior,4,"A REAL Film School – Columbia College Hollywood is a school with the goal of fully training it's students and not just burning up tuition. you never want to miss a day of class because you learn so much and you actually practice what you are taught, not just a school that teaches theory. there is always help for anyone who asks from teachers, staff, and FREE tutors. the school is attentive to students relations and their general needs."
College Junior,4,"Columbia is one of the only school where you can meet a person from every country, every orientation, every creative aspect of film. I enjoy the warm welcome I feel as an African American Native American part Irishmen and alos as a gay man. I don't feel alone an any aspect of life. Even religion and daily interest/hobbies are shared. I'm not the only vegan/vegetarian. With such a small student population Columbia is the place for me. But they do need more vegan options, who puts cheese in salad?"
College Sophomore,2,"Nice Advisers, Despite the Lacking Amount – I received a small amount of money from financial aid. Despite the size of the check, the process was a breeze. My financial aid adviser was helpful and concerned for me. The little amount of money I received created stress and problems throughout the yeat"
College Freshman,2,"They provide a bus from the Ku Edwards campus to Jccc, but that is the only transportation options that they offer."
College Freshman,2,While the off campus housing is extremely nice since it is in such a ritzy part of town it is very expensive. If you are on a budget you have to really look to find hosing that is affordable and remotely close to the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ratio Problems – There are more guys then girls by about 10 to 1.  Which is fine if you are a girl, more to pick from.  But bad for the guys.  Many stoners and partiers go to a our school but they are EXTREMELY intelligent."
Niche User,1,"This is one of the worst schools you could pay to go to. They all about scamming your money. Be careful, they accepted my submission to only grant then after I paid fees the decline it and refused to refund my money. They do it on purpose, they know if they declined it first I wouldn't paid the fees. Be careful students you are better off its so expensive, not worth it."
Alum,1,"As an alumni, I look at my student debt, and what I received in return - Here is what they don't tell you:  When you graduate from film school, expect to ""pay your dues.""  Your going to work for FREE.  CCH is trash RE job placement:  professionals take a narrow view of ""film school grads.""  It worked against me, as they generally scoffed at my supposed ""education.""  Yes.  I learned more on set, then I ever did from CCH.  2.  CCH is only too happy to take your $, and if you're like most people, you go into debt.   The industry respects people THEY KNOW, and abhors newbies - hence ""work for free"".  Worst case, if your terrible, they've lost nothing but time.  Best case they recommend you next time.  Finally you get work because people KNOW YOU.    Finally, they treat their Alum's like trash.  They have your money, now please go.  Thats years ago, and the same people running it, are still there, taking your money, offering nothing in return.  They should be investigated for fraud."
College Senior,1,"Loser central.  I don't think they'd know how to throw a party if a YouTube video hit them in the head and Epic Meal time pop'd out to show them. 

Its a craft school, students that go to CCH usually are busy making films and when they're not, I don't know what they are doing.  
There is NO sense of community at the school, at least for myself. Its saddening."
College Junior,1,"The surrounding area of the college is very nice, but not ""L.A."" Don't expect a big city, you will be very, very dissapointed. Expect suburbs, 7-11s, and asian/mexican food. Expect to travel."
College Freshman,1,People are not very involved with the athletics at this school.

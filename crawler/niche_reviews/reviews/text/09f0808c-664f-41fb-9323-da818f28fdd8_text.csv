Sophomore,5,Ambrose has been so amazing for me; phenomenal professors that truly care and endless amounts of resources.  It is also a very safe campus and there are many off campus options as well.
Sophomore,5,My online experience at St. Ambrose has been great only because I have professors that truly care and want us to succeed!
Freshman,5,I did end up taking some online classes while some are split up depending on days but my online schooling is going fairly well. The professors always try to give you as much information and understand that it can be more stressful.
Freshman,5,St Ambrose University is absolutely everything they say they are. They are a smaller school but they definitely have that big university feel with a family feel to everyone you meet in the classroom. The professors as well as the students are always there to help you no matter what. They listen to you and really help you find solutions.
Sophomore,5,"I am an Education major and St Ambrose had me already observing a classroom by my second semester! The professors are very understanding and try to connect with each student by engaging them differently in each class. With the virus uprising, the education/learning was difficult in the beginning, but the professors were understanding and kept the students up to date about the changes to the syllabus and requirements for the classes. The teachers are/were extremely flexible throughout the year but held the students accountable for their work. Overall, I was held accountable and responsible in earning my grade, but the teachers are understanding and had very useful methods in teaching."
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman at St. Ambrose University in the Fall of 2020.  May experience with SAU has been great! I really enjoyed my in-person campus visit with their baseball coach. After visiting SAU campus with the coach, I knew SAU was the right college for me. SAU has a beautiful campus. Everyone at SAU was so nice and welcoming. Izzy was my admissions rep. and she is so nice and helpful. I feel comfortable asking her or anyone at SAU any question. SAU has been a great positive experience for me."
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been a great experience. During the pandemic, I was introduced to Izzy, a SAU admissions rep. We met through zoom meetings and did I virtual visit. Everything went smooth. You never know about technology but there were no problems during the zoom meetings and virtual visit.  Izzy was very professional and fun to talk to. I like how her and SAU baseball coach would check in with me to see if I have any questions regarding SAU."
Junior,5,"In the second half of the Spring 2020 semester, like most schools, St. Ambrose University converted from face-to-face learning to distance learning. At first, I thought this was going to be an extremely difficult change. However, St. Ambrose University's faculty and staff were prepared to make the most out of the remainder of the semester. My professors strove their hardest to make their students feel comfortable in this new setting. This was mostly noticeable in their precision to create a new schedule for their classes that would work best for their students. For example, my Psychology professor, Dr. Julie Kettmann, created a new week-by-week schedule with weekly WebEx meetings in order to help all her students be able to understand the material that was came from the textbook readings prior to the WebEx meeting. Overall, my professors make it their primary goal to make their students feel secure in the big class transition."
Senior,5,The professors really care about the students and their success. The campus feels safe even at night and the University is in the middle of the city so it's easy to get anywhere you want.
Senior,5,Professors respond to questions quickly and the courses are well planned out and explained at the beginning of the semester.
Sophomore,5,Saint Ambrose is a personable school that entails many opportunities for putting yourself out there and meeting new people. Nearly everyone on campus is welcoming and want you to succeed. Everyone has opportunities to join clubs and activities that suit them. Professors are engaged and truly willing to help beyond normal class hours.

Senior,5,Great teachers and students.  Very friendly.  Top in the area for university sports. Great clubs for students to join.  Life time relationships.
Junior,5,"This school has a very large variety of courses to fit basically every niche and interest. The amount of extra circulars is also fairly impressive. Our LGBT group Prism actually won an award this year in Iowa and that was a huge step for us in our image for being an accepting and diverse campus. The teachers are very inclusive and are set on building beneficial relationships with students to further everyone's education. There is a feeling of ""nobody left behind"" with all of the teachers I have interacted with."
Freshman,5,"When I first stepped on campus I felt like I was at home. The faculty is so welcoming and they make you feel like you are apart of the bee family. Davenport, IA has so much to do in a close vicinity. The walks on campus didn't take over 10 minutes to reach the other side of campus. Walking around on campus feels very safe during the day and at night. St. Ambrose is an extremely friendly environment, from the professors to athletic coaches. My experience at St. Ambrose has been positive and impactful every time I am on campus. I am so glad I chose St. Ambrose to further my career and cannot wait until I begin classes!"
Junior,5,I LOVED my first experience with St. Ambrose. I came in as a new transfer student in the nursing program. The teachers are all very encouraging and I always felt like a part of their family. The program in itself is hard but definitely worth it. Classes are as small as 25 people and can even decrease as time goes on due to students leaving the program. I highly recommend this university for any new nursing students! They really prepare you to be the best nurse.
Junior,5,I love Saint Ambrose because it is a small private school where the professors care about students' success.
Senior,5,"Best 4 years of my life. The parties were lit, the professors were amazing, the dorms are up to date and nice, and the campus is beautiful."
Junior,5,This school is the perfect size for me. It was kind of my saving grace after going to University of Iowa and not enjoying the size or dynamic. This school has been truly wonderful for me.. I am personally not religious and the option to be religious here is very much your own choice and is not pushed upon you in any way.
Niche User,5,"When visiting St. Ambrose, the campus is beautiful. The staff and students were very friendly and were willing to help out and answer questions."
Freshman,5,I love it at St Ambrose! This was actually the first college I visited and as soon as I stepped onto the campus I knew it was the right pick for me. Even though I'm not Catholic I still feel welcomed and all the professors really seem to care about their students. Overall it's a great school in my  book.
Freshman,5,"A warm and welcoming environment where you can easily find new friends and participate in a multitude of activities and athletics.  Housing is modern and spacious with an emphasis on community respect.  Campus is ideal for easy access to classes, food, studying, and wellness.  Located near downtown Davenport, Iowa and the quad cities, provides access to events, dining, and all the necessary amenities.  St. Ambrose does place an emphasis on athletics and athletes make up about 75% of the undergraduate population.  Though being a jesuit affiliated institution, zero participation in the church is welcomed.  Class size is ideal for student / teacher interaction with the vast majority of classes seating around 30 students."
Niche User,5,St. Ambrose is one of the good university. It is diversed and have good faculty members. Level of teaching is good. It is a very good university for Education department.

Sophomore,5,I like the feeling of closeness around campus. I've been here for a little over two weeks and already feel like my professors know me along with my classmates. Everyone is super nice and wanting to help me to succeed in all aspects of my life.
Niche User,5,We just toured the school and it felt very inviting.  THis school has an outstanding reputation.  They have a 5.5 year program for Physical Therapy.
Freshman,5,St. Ambrose is a great college to go to. Full of diversity and with friendly staff I recommend it highly. Unfortunately it is a private school and can be a real strain on one's wallet if your funding for college is low.
Alum,5,The campus and people really made St. Ambrose feel like a second home. The experience I received both in and out of the classroom is priceless.
Niche User,5,I am a full commit incoming freshman for the class of 2022. I have visited St. Ambrose multiple times within just the last couple of weeks and they have been nothing but helpful in my college process. I have even had many student contact me and have been very helpful
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved attending St. Ambrose University.  I started out my undergrad career at a different University in Iowa, but transferred to Ambrose halfway through my freshman year.  The community and student life is laid back, welcoming, and fun.  The professors are all well educated in their fields and are extremely flexible with working with you to succeed.  They also have an excellent career center with tons of area connections and opportunities for the students."
Graduate Student,5,"Going to St. Ambrose changed my life for the better. Going into an atmosphere away from home can be scary, but at St. Ambrose you are home. The campus itself is smaller so you know the majority of the people attending. The class sizes are smaller, which means you have more of a personal relationship with professors. All professors are there to help you succeed, and are willing to help in any way that they can. Everyone at this university wants you to excel, and will put forth the effort to see you do so. If I could change one thing about this school it would be the tuition lock. When I first visited they had told me my tuition would be locked at a certain amount, but as the years went on my tuition kept on rising. Overall this school is perfect in every aspect. If I had to choose again where to attend school I would choose St. Ambrose University."
Junior,5,This university has diversity in many cultures and a wide array of educational opportunities.  It is located in Davenport Iowa which allows many opportunities for entertainment and employment during and after college.
Junior,5,The food better seasoned and more options like hambuger or hotdogs line when you don't like the other food better open hours
Sophomore,5,St. Ambrose is a very beautiful campus with small classes so one is able to fullfill their college degree. The professors are easy to contact with one on one meetings. The campus is open to many career opportunities with many helpful resources. As a Exercise Science major the cadaver lab is one of my favorites. As a student I am exposed to a small class with many different types of anatomy. I also played soccer and made some great memories. St. Ambrose was the right choice for me.
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit St. Ambrose University, I fell in love with the campus. At first I was very hesitant, with it being so close to home. But once I stepped on campus, I had a feeling that, that is where I belonged. Everyone that I meet and talked to were so nice and welcoming."
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the academic opportunities St. Ambrose has to offer in addition to the great housing options. This makes it a great all around environment to spend your college years.
Freshman,5,"I love attending St. Ambrose. The population is just big enough that you see new faces every day but small enough that you see your friends all the time. Same goes for the campus size, it’s a great size! Not too intimidating, easy walk from one end to the other. Great facilities, and the teachers really push you! Very happy with my decision to attend here."
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoyed St. Ambrose. It is a smaller private college and it is a tight knit community. Classes were great here because of the smaller class sizes. It allowed much more individualized learning and the teachers actually knew your name.

The small class sizes, incredible faculty, and endless extracurricular opportunities has molded me into who I am. I am forever thankful for St. Ambrose being a part of my life."
Freshman,5,"I love the close-knit community of St. Ambrose University. I have not met a faculty or staff member that hasn't been of the utmost help or assistance. Everyone here is encouraging of the student's goals and future aspirations. I love the personal connections that I make with other students, professors, and staff. I also love the Catholic, liberal-arts atmosphere."
Junior,5,Saint Ambrose is a small private school that offers good educational opportunities. It has a vast community with many things to do and the professors are very knowledgeable in their field. They are very easy going and helpful. The campus is not to big or small and the people on campus are nice. The area around the school is nice.
Freshman,5,I love St Ambrose!  I have been made to feel welcome all the time and I have met some amazing people. The campus is beautiful and always clean. The professors are caring and approachable. They engage in conversation in and out of the classroom. The dorms are clean.
Junior,5,"I have had a wonderful time here at St. Ambrose University. The professors and staff are all wonderful and I love how the instructors make sure there can have one on one time with the students when they need it.

College Freshman,5,"As a member of the three time national winning dance team, I can say that the athletics are some of the best here at Ambrose."

College Junior,5,People who graduate from Ambrose will always end up with a job right away. The school offers many different internship opportunities and they can be directed to alumni if they need help. No one ever worries about a job when leaving St. Ambrose.
College Junior,5,"My overall experience at my school would be a 10/10. I love everything about my school including the professors, offerings, peers, social life, and so much more. The courses offered is varied and everyone is encouraged to take courses outside of their field and comfort zone. The class sizes are reasonable and perfect because the professor will know you by name not by number."
College Junior,5,The housing on campus is very respected. The dorms are up to date and are very large. The social life within them is very outgoing and everyone is friendly. Rules are set in place and the housing is watched 24/7.
College Junior,5,"Students are very involved when it comes to sports. The sports teams are determined and are good when working together. Students who are not involved in varsity sports always play intramurals. Students on campus like to have fun and you will always see people outside playing volleyball, Frisbee and so much more."
College Junior,5,My experience at the school I attend is out of this world. I am very happy with the choice that I made about attending this school. the professors know you by your first name and when in a classroom everyone is very close. Everyone is always engaged with the topics taught and the professors are understanding when it comes to questions.
College Sophomore,5,The athletic program at my school is a very good one.
College Sophomore,5,The school I chose was because I wanted to play soccer and it had a good physical therapy program. I had a great first year and am excited to go back next year.
College Freshman,5,Just being able to sit down and have amazing conversations with everyone there made me love the school more and excited to start in the fall.
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, I doubt I would have a better experience somewhere else."
Freshman,4,This school is good. The teachers are experts in their fields. You could learn more how to improve for the exam.
Freshman,4,"Blackboard is very easy to use. Just watch some videos on Youtube and mess around, You basically learn the entirety of blackboard."
Freshman,4,"St. Ambrose brings together many different cultures from around the world to accomplish the American Dream and to experience the college life. The small campus is great for walking to class, no matter what hall it is in. The teachers are incredibly talented and clearly show a manner of poise that the experience is obvious. The athletics are great, being in soccer I know this first hand. All in all, it is a great school that is overlooked by many in the college choosing process."
Sophomore,4,"Fine, it was because of corona so it was pretty forced onto us and new for the teachers, wasnt teachers who usually teach online classes."
Junior,4,"St. Ambrose has a great community. It's small campus was like a second home. The campus is cute and very well taken care. Class sizes are perfect between 15-30 people max which allows more one on one help. Professors are experienced and care for their students, excellent resources. The surrounding area is not the most lively but the local businesses offer great partnerships with the school and allow students to get real experiences. Finances are okay."
Sophomore,4,"St. Ambrose overall is a great school. The staff and professors are great and always willing to help out students. Student life is always trying to be inclusive, but sometimes it's not enough. I feel like maybe educating students about diversity can go a long way."
Sophomore,4,"While COVID-19 did ruin the rest of the semester for me, online classes for the spring semester wasn't awful. Teachers were giving out their support and still holding visual office hours which was very useful. It was just the way the explain the work was sometimes confusing."
Sophomore,4,"St Ambrose University is a well wounded school. There are many outlets for getting involved, along with being supported. Although my first year at this college ended early I felt the communication through this pandemic and other situations throughout the year was handled very well for the amount of information that was needed to be sent out. Personally, I am a college athlete and was worried about juggling the grades with the sport, but the swim coach was always ""grades first"". Being my first year on campus I was able to get involved by becoming a part of the Dance Marathon committee. As like other colleges there were a couple of flaws within the year, but it was never directly because of the campus. My difficult times in the year were mainly mental based and was my personal challenges that put a small damper on my visit. Overall, I was planning on visiting home around ten times throughout the school year and I ended up only going about two times. I never wanted to leave campus!"
Junior,4,"One of my favorite aspects about St. Ambrose University is the students, staff, and faculty members. Through the different clubs that I have been a part of, such as the Chapel choir and Bible Study groups, I have been extremely fortunate to witness the unconditional love in my peers through what they say and what they do. These individuals are deeply concerned for all those around them, and are willing to do all they can to make each other feel as if they can call St. Ambrose University their second home. A great example is my Social Work Professor, Dr. Kristi Law. During the semester, she always made it a goal for all of her students to succeed, and she did so by always having availability for her students to come and visit her during her office hours. Even after the class was over and I was accepted into the school of Social Work, she continued to remind me that if I ever needed any assistance, she would always be available to help out."
Junior,4,Taking classes online was actually pretty successful. Our professors made sure they helped us whenever we were struggling in our class and emotionally. I could always depend on them to respond in a timely manner whenever I needed help.
Junior,4,"They are very helpful and make sure that you always have your questions answered as soon as possible. Also, they are very helpful when it comes to your educational needs."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Saint Ambrose was overall pretty good. I like being in smaller classes as you are able to get a lot of help from your professors and be able to be more comfortable with them overall. Also the dorms at Saint Ambrose are very nice and are some of the nicest dorms I have seen at any college campus. Also it is very easy to get to meet new people as it is a relatively small campus and everybody on campus is super nice and helpful. Also the town, Davenport, is a very safe and good town with many things to do such as go to different parks and thee are many different restaurants nearby such as chick fil a and canes and many others. The only thing I think Saint Ambrose needs to improve is the cafeteria food. Some days the food was decent but the majority of the days the food wasn't very good. Most of the time I went out to eat or got stuff from the store because I just couldn't eat the cafeteria food."
Sophomore,4,I like the studentlife and the diverse group of students that you meet. The criminal justice program has a vast amount future opportunities given in that major
Freshman,4,As I hope to be an incoming freshman to St. Ambrose. I thought that the university is nice and I will enjoy it a lot if I am able to attend here.
Junior,4,"St Ambrose offers good academic programs on a beautiful campus. The class sizes are very small, even intro level science classes are around 30-35 students."
Sophomore,4,"I like how the campus is located in a city that has endless options for things to do in your free time, yet it still feels homey and separated from the rest of the city. It's a perfect in between. The lower student population makes the instructor to student ratio closer together and makes it easier to get help from your professors and advisors."
Freshman,4,"Location is really nice. The dorms are nice. I love that they have Forensic Psychology as a major, mostly why I am attending."
Freshman,4,SAU is an amazing place that feels like home.  Have felt welcome from the very first college visit. Can't wait to start my college days as a Bee. My major is Bachelors in Nursing and will also be playing baseball.  The dorms are very big and the professors are very thoughtful and work with students on time management and balancing academics and athletics.
Sophomore,4,Transferring to SAU was probably the best decision I could have made! So many of the people on campus are very friendly and opening! The small campus makes it so much nicer when walking to and from classes and home in the winter time. Go Bees!
Freshman,4,"St. Ambrose University is a great place to receive a higher education. The professors genuinely care about the students success. The small class size allows students and professors to develop a relationship that leads to greater success for the students now and in the future. St. Ambrose stays true to their mission statement through their various topics of study. As a result  of general education requirements, students are able to think critically about more than just their field of study which is just one of many benefits to a liberal arts education. Their constant dedication to their students creates an environment that pushes students to preform to the best of their abilities and beyond."
Graduate Student,4,Taking online courses and it is great! Just like being in the classroom. Definitely worth checking out the campus and courses offered.
Senior,4,"St. Ambrose is a great small school with great options either for online or on campus classes and activities. I would highly recommend this school if it has your program, especially if you want to apply to graduate school in the future."
Niche User,4,I am a football recruit for the class of 2023. I will be attending St. Ambrose next year and I have been on campus twice already. Everything I have seen about St. Ambrose has been amazing.
Freshman,4,"I loved St. Ambrose from the start, taking my first tour of the university I found that it was a close community. Everyone who went there was able to get involved in every way possible, and that felt like a home. Becoming a student at St. Ambrose opened my eyes to all things new, new people from all different backgrounds with all different stories. I find that St. Ambrose has everything a student could need for finding their future and finding who they are as a person. If I was to actually change anything about the university it would be the town, I find that there is some cool parts to the city but there is some flaws, as of safety."
Sophomore,4,"So far I have enjoyed my experience at St. Ambrose. I love the food and the environment it provides for all of its students. The professors really care for how the students progress, and because of its size, it allows them to have one on one time with the students."
Junior,4,"What I have loved most so far during my time at Ambrose has been my academic experience. The professors I have had so far have excellent knowledge in their fields and make their classes engaging while also challenging their students to pursue knowledge in all subjects. In this way the liberal arts education is very well represented at this school. Professors at this school are also more approachable since the majority of classes are no bigger than 25 students. Most of my professors and I are on a first name basis, an aspect of the smaller university education that I have felt has given me greater academic success. If I was going to critique one thing about this school though it would have to the location. While the campus itself is beautiful, the area around it is not in the best shape and there are nearly no places in the immediate area for students to hangout. Because of this, a vehicle or public transportation is almost an essential if you attend this school."
Junior,4,"I like that we can live on campus all years of college. They need to update some dorm hall to what students need and want to see, so more people will want to come here and stay on campus. They need to listen to students needs and wants to see the university. They have jobs for students that have work study or not. Their is a lot of fun events that happen on campus like bingo, concerts,  and halls and floors events in the dorm halls."
Sophomore,4,Saint Ambrose has a rather impressive campus with a new Rec center that really adds value. Dorms are also above average with nice suite rooms.
Junior,4,"I love attending St. Ambrose University! Most of the professors and staff are very helpful. The atmosphere and students are welcoming. Some changes that I would like to see are more guidance when it comes to the resources that the institution offers, as well as clubs that we are able to become involved in."
Senior,4,Overall great school.  Small school environment makes it a more personal experience.  Teachers know you personally and care about you and your achievements.  Gorgeous campus with above average dorms.  Food quality is not that good.  Very friendly environment.
Senior,4,"St. Ambrose is a great university. The location makes it feel like home, but still away at a 4 year school. They offer many resources to assist students in transitioning well into college life without letting them fall."
Senior,4,Great administration and faculty. The student body is nice and there is a wide range of classes and majors. Some of the classrooms are run down and would benefit from renovation.
Sophomore,4,St. Ambrose was one of the best decisions of my life! I love it here and I've made great friends and strides in my education!
Graduate Student,4,Great small school with many opportunities. The small classes allow you to really build a relationship with instructors and advisors. The only bad part is that the area around the campus is unsafe
Freshman,4,"St. Ambrose is a very good school, its a smaller sized school with small class sizes and a smaller campus as well. However there is room for improvement such as better parking. The one thing about St. Ambrose is it is located in a sketchy location but security does do an excellent job with making the campus safe for  students."
Niche User,4,"Visiting St. Ambrose University was really great college experience, the campus looked great when I first arrived there. I met a lot of good people at the school, when I was there I was able to make new friends and enjoy my overnight stay on the campus. The dorm rooms were actually really nice from what I originally thought they would be. I thought it would be really cramped with barely any space to breath but I was immediately proven wrong. I also enjoyed the food a lot there as well, it was a great first college trip experience."
Freshman,4,"I love being at St. Ambrose. I love the small school atmosphere. You really get to know your classmates as well as your professors. Help is easy to receive and everyone wants you to do your best. Also, there are many available on campus jobs as well as scholarship and financial aid opportunities. The university does an excellent job of working with each and every student and making sure they get all the help and money they need. The worked directly with my mom and myself to fit our financial needs when the FAFSA didn't correctly display our actual current financial status. They do a very good job. My only complaint is the food. It's not terrible, but it's not very good and very institutionalized."
Senior,4,"Overall, my time at St. Ambrose has been great.  The athletics are awesome and the residents halls are very nice and clean, which was important to me as I searched for a college.  There are many resources for academic help. My only suggestion would be to improve the quality and organization of the psychology department.  So far I have had 4 psychology professors and I only cared for one of them."
Niche User,4,I am a high senior and attended a fall college visit day.   I previously visited St. Ambrose in the spring and was not impressed.    I gave St. Ambrose another chance and really liked it.   The Physical Therapy facility was very impressive.
College Junior,4,There are so many excellent housing options from dorms to townhouses! There is something for everybody.
College Junior,4,Haven't been here long enough to know much about the athletics here but my boyfriend plays basketball here and he enjoys their program and staff.
College Freshman,4,Alumni take Ambrose very seriously and all that it has to offer.
College Freshman,4,Ambrose is very forthcoming about the dangers of being on campus. They encourage all students to have a healthy and safe experience.
College Freshman,4,Very fun and friendly. There is tons to do! I don't think I will ever be bored.
College Sophomore,4,There are resources that are open to students for just about any problem they could be facing.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not in athletics, but many of my friends are. They all seem to like the programs they are in. As a spectator, our sports teams about very fan supported, have good sportsmanship, and work well as teams."
College Junior,4,There is security in every building 24/7 around the clock. Security is always there if you need help or have questions. Campus crime is usually not an issue. Overall I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I had a great first year in college.  I was involved with sports, worked, joined a few clubs and meet a lot of new friends."
College Sophomore,4,I was hoping to get right into the physical therapy program but did not.  I'm hoping that going to this school will help me when I do apply for graduate school.
College Sophomore,4,The dorm I had freshman year was a decent size room with suite mates to share the bathroom.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus, RA's help to create community and are always there to help. The process of housing is a but confusing however it comes with the territory"
College Freshman,4,"St. Ambrose is a Division II school with over twenty three teams. I love supporting my school by going to as many different sporting events that I can. It is a great way to get involved and meet new people. In addition one of the selling points for me was the school spirit, I love the community and family that is built.

The school is also currently building a brand new state of the art sports facility on campus, a beautiful glass building that will hold new equipment as well as new opportunities. I love that St. Ambrose is always thinking about students and creating many new possibility."
College Freshman,4,Starting school in the fall makes me want to do many things in the fall. Everyone is so helpful and open that my college experience will be a great one.
College Sophomore,4,I have heard that safety and health have been in good standings. I have yet to find out personally.
College Sophomore,4,I am looking forward to spending my next two years and possibly 5 years at St. Ambrose. I have heard a lot of great things. I am excited that it is a small campus and allows students to talk to teachers one on one more often.
College Sophomore,4,"From the couple times that I have been there, dorms and apartments are in good standings are very nice to live in."
College Sophomore,4,"St. Ambrose has a growing varsity program that has a decent local fan support. Athletic facility is in good condition, but a brand new facility will be built in 2017."
College Sophomore,4,"I am looking forward to transfer to St. Ambrose, and I have heard a lot of good things from current students and family."
College Freshman,4,"There are a few crimes on campus a semester, but I think it would be hard to find a campus that doesn't have this."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've heard, these areas are pretty much some of the best you can find anywhere."
College Junior,2,"There were a few incidents that have happened on and off campus, including a shooting at the corner gas station."
College Junior,2,"SUPER STRICT! Parking is outrageous, they love to pass out tickets. Teachers are pretty cool about attendance depending on your major. Security is very strict about parties, you get written up if you get caught. if you're 21 caught in a dorm party, they will ticket you and say you bought the alcohol. The campus is a dry campus, there is suppose to be no drinking or smoking or drug use on campus. If you don't live in the dorms, you have to get someone to let you into dorms. if you bring friends to come visit, you have to request permission and it can get denied."
College Freshman,2,they always screw up my meal plan once a month
College Freshman,2,I do not like many options and other options that look good are very bad for you.
College Junior,2,The school spirit is pretty low and the athletic facilities are not up to par.  The gym and workout area definitely needs work.
College Freshman,2,"The majority of the guys are douches, or man-whores, and the majority of the girls are the same."
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are incredible. Huge with private bathrooms. However, I went an entire semester without meeting more than 5 other guys on my floor. There is no sense of community at all. The RA's do not enforce rules that much and there is usually some sort of damage that we are all paying for."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many places to party unless you can get into the bars. Honestly, it's the only way to meet people. If you don't drink you won't have friends here. Most of the students on campus drink excessively. You would not believe that this is a catholic school by being around on a weekend night."
College Senior,2,The professors do not care about their students and are usually pretty rude but the class sizes are small.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of alcohol use on campus, and those that drink, drink a lot.  It is a major topic with Homecoming and the end of the year ""Last Blast"" celebration.  However, there are also plenty of students that don't drink and there is not a lot of peer pressure for those who don't want to drink."
College Sophomore,2,"There are constant reports of theft and attack, houses around Ambrose are raided by FBI, and security is only really seen when giving parking tickets at 7 in the morning"
College Freshman,2,Not much to do anywhere.
College Freshman,2,Not much to do if you are not 21.
College Freshman,2,This year has been cold and snowy.
College Freshman,2,A lot of people party and drink.
College Freshman,2,Most everyone drinks and parties.
College Freshman,2,There are ultimately not enough spots for everyone on campus. People rarely park in the lot they are supposed to and the university does not do a great job at keeping up with this.
College Sophomore,2,The campus shuttle and city buses that come by school aren't very convenient.
College Junior,2,There is certainly room for improvement. They are walking around sometimes but a lot of times they aren't there when you need them. 
College Sophomore,2,St. Ambrose competes in NAIA for all sports. The gym sucks. 
College Junior,2,don't know much about this
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus is not big enough to require transportation to classes, unless you are at the health and science center; even that, though, is close enough to walk to. There are city buses that stop at our campus, but they do not run late. The city buses are free with our student i.d.s. Other than that, the only transportation is security will drive students to and from our zone 3 parking lot which is about four blocks off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"I did not receive my financial aid package until the day before classes started. Every time I called or went in to ask questions, the people in the financial aid office were not as friendly as I feel they should be. They have blown me off when I have asked for help and I have witnessed them being rude and upsetting other students. Financial aid assistance has been my biggest problem at St. Ambrose."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a relatively small campus that is typically safe. However, a lot of crimes have been committed right outside of campus boundaries recently. We have campus security that we are told walk around at night, but I rarely see them. The only thing I usually see security do is escort students to the parking lot a few blocks away, give out tickets, and break up parties on weekends. There is security in each dorm after eleven at night, but that does not protect us when outside where most of the crimes are committed. We do have a new safety precaution, though; each dorm can only be accessed by scanning a student i.d."
College Sophomore,2,"I am from the Quad Cities, where my University is located, so there is nothing new to me. A lot of people complain about there not being a lot to do around here, though. The best thing there is to say about the Quad Cities is that there are a lot of restaurant choices; other than that, there is not much to do."
College Senior,2,Students will regularly talk about drinking and doing drugs illegally with no fear. They will do it without fear. Plain and simple.
College Senior,2,"Besides some classes, nothing is worth what we have to pay for it. I feel like I'm in debt for the rest of my life for something that wasn't worth the money."
College Senior,2,What scholarships? I got one for academics. That's it. I didn't know of any others that I could apply for because I didn't play sports and I didn't play an instrument or sing.
College Senior,2,"Ethnically, we are hardly diverse because there are not many people culturally different besides the foreign exchange students. This is just a grown-up version of high school because everyone has their own cliques and no one is truly welcoming."
College Junior,2,We have a lot of great sports but the one big problem is that they are bringing a lot of foreigners over and giving them us scholarships and not letting the US students players play
College Freshman,2,"If your a catholic kid from a small town in either Illinois or Iowa, who is massively obsessed with sports, cannot read pass a third grade level or just likes to get drunk at 10:00 Am on a tuesday, then this is the place for you. If your someone like me, whose into music, books, history and nerd stuff, this ain't your bag. If you wanna start a band, not many kids will join you in your quest. If you have a special type of niche interest (I.E. Star Wars, Harry Potter etc.) you find a few people who would think well of you, but the rest just give you strange looks. It's like a lot of these couldn't get used to life outside of high school and decided to carry it over into this place. Unless you like to party or play sports, theres generally not that much to do here. They have a drama department and a jazz band, but not anybody can just join. Granted, there are some cool professors that teach here are pretty cool people and know their field of study. Academic programs here are generally not a problem if your willing to apply yourself, although it seems like most kids don't. Although I have a few friends were we have stuff in common, it's not that many. I tried making friends with some of the international students. Two or Three of them were all right, but the rest of them seem to think of me as a punchline in a joke. Although I've done well academically, socially I feel somewhat isolated from my peers. I tried to give this place a chance and make the best of it, but I just don't know if I can spend 4 years of my life here."
College Freshman,2,"St. Ambrose students can ride the Davenport city busses for free, however, they have limited hours and routes. Students don't need to travel for classes and all necessities are within walking distance, however, a personal vehicle is very beneficial."
College Senior,2,"People at Ambrose are pretty much an extension of high school. With a few exceptions most people are centered on them selves and if they don't have a direct use for you they don't want to be your friend. Girls and guys here will one day wear sweat pants, then dress up, then be wearing ripped jeans. The social life is mainly on drinking and because of the commonalities of drinking and partying relationships don't last long."
College Junior,2,"Campus Safe, Surrounding Neighborhoods Questionable – I have always felt safe when actually on campus. Some of the neighborhoods, especially towards the river can be questionable. During the day most of the city is safe, you just have to make sure that you know what areas are not the safest and avoid going there alone especially at night."
College Junior,2,"Small School With Limited Options – Being a small school, there are not a lot of places on campus to just go and hangout and the places that are available are under used in my opinion. Most people just hangout in their rooms or friends rooms, or they might use the lounges in the dorms. Food options on campus are slim. There is only one cafeteria and the food court in Rogo. There are quite a few clubs and organizations available to join. There is not much support for the sports teams here on campus unless the season is going really good then the fans will watch the games."
College Sophomore,2,"Confusing and Forceful – I think that at SAU it is very common to find students who pick a major and are then jailed into a career path for the next 4 to 6 years. I simply wanted to study biology, but was nudged to choose pre-med, pre-physical therapy, or environmental sciences. Not knowing what I truly wanted, I panicked and switched majors. I changed to psychology and was again pressured into areas that were not of my interest simply because they are popular at SAU. If I could start over, I wouldn't even start at SAU; I would attend a junior college first and explore my interests before being so forcefully committed to a program or path."
College Freshman,2,It can really go either way. It all really depends on how severe the incident is. Also it depends on who your RA is as well. Some RA's are more strict than others. In the end like I said it depends on how serious an incident that determines your punishment.
College Freshman,2,"Labs and Wifi – First off, the WiFi here is not completely terrible but it is boarder line close. The computer labs make up for the slow WiFi, because they never get too crowded throughout the year. Even through finals they aren't that crowed."
College Sophomore,2,There is minimal parking for this growing school. Parking passes are required and tickets often are given on and off campus
College Freshman,2,If you don't have a car on campus and don't have a friend with a car you will be stuck on the bus. It's free with student ID but not that reliable. Long-distance transportation is relied upon public transport ex. Grey Hound and Amtrak. University would benefit from their own transportation.
Sophomore,1,Worst year of my life only went cause my stepmom works there so I got a discount where It was only like 5k a semester for me to go which was the only positive. Now onto the negatives for me personally i had a roommate that was the grossest human being I have ever encountered. He would stare at me constantly until he or I left the dorm even when I was trying to sleep I would notice he would stay up and stare until I went to sleep. So if you do end up going here room with someone you know or you could wind up experiencing what I experienced and I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. I thought the professors were about as good as high school teachers often times felt as if I was teaching myself more than the professors taught me some would just hand me a book and tell me when the next exam was. Crime is everywhere I was only there one year and I think there was like 4 or 5 sexual assaults and about 10 robberies. Now going to a different college feel like I left hell for heaven.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's the unsafest school in the U.S.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are better options at more affordable prices.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's ridden with cockroaches, overpriced, and unsafe in most areas."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In 2016, we added sports team to generate revenues for the school.  We've never had a prior sports team (or band)."
Recent Alumnus,1,I lived on-site and always complained about safety concerns at night.  One of my friends was sexually assaulted on-campus.  The teachers do not care.  http://www.hercampus.com/life/campus-living/sexual-assault-campus-are-colleges-universities-doing-enough
College Freshman,1,"I was sexually assaulted two years ago on campus (in all honestly I was raped by a person I thought was a friend), I am just now able to return. Multiple times a month I get ""incidents of concern"" emails sent to me from St. Ambrose about either sexual assaults or about how someone was touch  inappropriately while walking down the road to class. the emails say Davenport police are investigating however we never get an update email saying it's been resolved or anything. Doesn't do much to put our minds at ease. Something needs to be done."
College Freshman,1,I was a Catholic attending a Catholic University and I can't tell you how many times I was made fun of for going to mass every weekend. SAU really isn't a catholic school at all besides the fact that there is a church on campus.
College Freshman,1,No one goes to sporting events because everything is off campus. No student section. No school spirit at all. I played on the varsity soccer team for my one semester on campus and it is a joke. Coached by a British guy and only the Brits get to play. The coaching staff was extremely biased. I would not recommend playing soccer or any other sport at SAU.
College Sophomore,1,"There is little transportation around campus unless the person's vehicle is in the parking lot a mile away, then security well drive students to there vehicles or pick them up."
College Junior,1,You will more than likely never have a snow day
College Sophomore,1,Thankfully St. Ambrose does not offer Greek life which is one reason I went here.
College Sophomore,1,Parking can be a nightmare. It is expansive and the parking tickets are $40.
College Sophomore,1,It gets dam cold and snows a lot in Davenport Iowa. 
College Sophomore,1,Ambrose students get to use the Davenport bus system for free but that is the only public transportation offered.
College Sophomore,1,"The Food here is absolutely terrible, and everyone hates the food here. "
College Senior,1,I can hardly find food in the caf that I like anymore. Even Rogo is getting bad. I usually eat in the caf once a week and maybe get something from Rogo once a month. I'm pretty much not eating anything now.
College Junior,1,"If you want to get out of college with good grades come here, if you want a solid education that will further you beyond the other competition in life, go elsewhere."
College Junior,1,I have never left the cafe satisfied and have always had digestion troubles after eating there. Their best food is still worse than dirt.
College Junior,1,Parking is terrible. Ambrose sells more parking spaces than they have on campus. More parking is very much needed!!

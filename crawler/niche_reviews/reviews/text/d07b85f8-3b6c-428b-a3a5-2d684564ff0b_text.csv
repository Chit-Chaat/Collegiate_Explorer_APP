Senior,5,"Some professors teach as if they are in front of a class, which truly feels liek I am learning something."
Alum,5,Only took one online class and really enjoyed it. The professor was very knowledgeable and was quick to respond to emails.
Alum,5,I took a sociology course online - professor wasn't affiliated with the university but still a good course.
Freshman,5,"Online is very much go at your own pace, if you are proactive and take care of your work efficiently it will come very easy. I'm a freshman here at UMHB and even the online professors are very quick to help."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor has been great so far. The students and professors are all very well mannered and are always willing to help you with anything. Since it is a smaller University, you get the opportunity to really connect with all of the people around you. You also get to have a great connection with your professors. They will help you out when you need it and will be there for you if you just need someone to talk too."
Sophomore,5,Amazing experience with amazing people ! This college is the best college I’ve ever been to. The people are great
Sophomore,5,Online experience isn’t that well. The professors can do lots more to improve in this area . They are getting better though .
Sophomore,5,"The online learning experience has be did not begin until COVID. They handled it very well and were extremely clear with the guidelines, where things were and the scheduling of submission."
Sophomore,5,"Athough having online classes can be harder, the professors are still there for you and are really available."
Sophomore,5,"This school is amazing. So welcoming and friendly!! Honestly it is my home away from home. Everyone, including faculty and staff, is so loving."
Junior,5,"The University of Mary Hardin-Baylor (UMHB) came into my life before I attended. As a soldier on Fort Hood, I met my wife while she was a Resident Assistant at one of the halls. After work at 5 p.m. I would make the half hour to see her and the students at UMHB that became my friends, leaving well past 1 a.m. to get up at 6 a.m. and do it all again. The atmosphere and the exciting events along with the Christian background of the environment kept me coming back for more. When I finally married my wife, I was forced to take a job overseas in Afghanistan as a contractor. During this time, I thought long about what I wanted to do with my life. With the decision to further my life, I chose the clinical psychology degree program with UMHB and couldn't be happier. The students are friendly and helpful, the teachers give you the attention you deserve at a class rate of 20 students per teacher, and there is always something to do with the local organizations to make it a home away from home"
Junior,5,"This school really cares about their students and is willing to open doors for their futures. UMHB  also takes pride in the spiritual atmosphere of campus, this is a truly Christ centered university."
Sophomore,5,"If you are looking for a small private university, UMHB can fit your needs perfectly. The people on campus and the atmosphere are just different and more special than anywhere else. I am in love with this university and I am blessed to call it home."
Sophomore,5,I am back in school through the MyWAY program and am very excited that this program is flexible enough to afford me the ability to earn my Bachelor's degree while maintaining a full time work schedule as well as balancing home life.
Sophomore,5,"The application process was extremely easy, I took a tour on campus and it was amazing. All the staff at UMHB is very helpful and welcoming . While taking a tour I had many questions about the Education program and they gave me all the details. This will be my second semester at UMHB and I cant wait for this new year of 2020."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love UMHB!!! I love how the campus and student body is big; however, you get that small college feeling within the classes. UMHB has so many student organizations to get involved in and our athletics are some of the best in NCAA Division III. I also love being at a Christian school where I can grow in my faith."
Freshman,5,"The University of Mary Hardin Baylor is a very Christ centered university. If you're looking to grow your relationship with the Lord then I highly suggest applying to UMHB. My junior year I toured the school and as soon as I stepped foot on campus I heard God tell me this was the school He was leading me towards.  I was really nervous about going to college and being away from my parents, but UMHB made my first semester so memorable. The first week before your classes start is called ""welcome week"" and the university puts on a week full of fun interactive activities that keep you engaged and help you adjust leaving everything you know behind. Throughout the year UMHB puts on different organizations to keep you occupied and sociable. I am in love with the school God led me to and can not wait to see what else is in store for my future!"
Freshman,5,"The experience that I got at UMHB was excellent! The school does a great job of creating events so that students can get to know each other. The professors will always allow chances to improve yourself and ask them question in and out of classes. The campus is very beautiful and everything is within a good walking distance for students without bikes, skateboards, or any other means of transportation."
Senior,5,It's an amazing campus and I really like the faculty and professors because they are always willing to help students out academically and financially. Also I was able to get a flexible job on campus and it was incredible. The schedule was flexible and very relaxing environment.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and how the staff and faculty genuinely care. It’s always kept very clean and neat. The food in bawcom could be better.
Freshman,5,"Well as a fellow Christian I have found myself in the hands of a wonderful community found at the University of Mary Hardin Baylor. Believer or not I find most students to be genuinely kind and inclusive. Yes, college life may seem very intimidating but UMHB has such a great and inclusive atmosphere that it makes such a great home. There are so many opportunities of study and getting involved that in all reality it's very hard to not be noticed for who you are.  The professors overall are very nice and range in varying teaching skills and gifts. I find myself walking into every class ready for a new adventure. Though for me academics is not my whole life I also devote my life to Christianity. Here at the University of Mary Hardin Baylor I truly feel such a peace to be who I am and to live my life devotedly to Christ. No matter the circumstance UMHB provides great opportunities to all students."
Freshman,5,I really love the University. I LOVE the at home feeling that i get when i'm here. It's really nice to know that they care!
Niche User,5,"Well I have personally went and got to experience the college, and I go with my sibling to campus because they are a current student. I have went and felt the perfect vibe as if I was right at home. They have my intended major and I plan to attend the university after I graduate from high school."
Sophomore,5,"This is a beautiful school with amazing teachers. Small ratios in the classroom like 20:1 and lots of time for you to meet with teachers during office hours!! Have lots of resources to help you if you need tutoring, counseling, or even some food! Overall amazing school with great people"
Niche User,5,"I'm a christian high school student in my senior year, who is looking for better opportunities to attend college, and what I appreciate is the this college contacted me since junior year, and offered me to apply with a free waive and top application with no essay. Other thing that I also like about this college is that matches with my vision and perpective of the kind of college that I want. A college in which I can keep growing spiritually and emotionally, but also a place in where I can develop in the better conditions my abilities at the time to get a job."
Sophomore,5,"I like the friendly atmosphere the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor had as soon as I stepped on campus. The nursing program is one of the top programs in the state and I am looking forward to being apart of it. The campus is beautiful, the professors are easy to approach, and the football team won the 2018 national championship! It can't get better than that."
Graduate Student,5,"I truly enjoyed my experience at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, and recommend this school to anyone. I had the opportunity of developing myself as an individual through this amazing university. With the aid of the great faculty in the Exercise and Sports Science department, I gained knowledge that will benefit me for life. I have been able to achieve my goals of becoming a physical therapist thanks to this university."
Sophomore,5,"I love UMHB. There is such a big sense of community and everyone is so loving and Christ like. The professors really care about you and want to make your academic experience the best it can be. UMHB is very centered around Christianity, we have chapel once a week as a way to get centered on God amidst the chaos of school. Some of my professors pray at the start of each class, which puts a calming essence over me. UMHB is an outstanding school and I would recommend it to all."
Freshman,5,Great school every one there is so nice. Feels like home. I love the athletic department they make sure I stay in top of everything.
Freshman,5,Mary-Hardin is very on top of and awesome at making students feel at home and that they are important.

Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere and the beauty of the campus! You really feel like you are a more than just a number, and it is nice to know that you have many resources in the palm of your hand!"
Sophomore,5,I love UMHB because it is a small campus and you are able to get the help you need from teachers and the workers there. They also have a mentor program and tutoring program that is run by students who go to that campus and have taken that specific course.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so polite and friendly. It's more like a home and less like a college. They have smaller class rooms, so more professor and student attention. They offer a lot of activities for everyone's needs. Even allowed me as a mother to bring my kid on campus and let him swim. Very comfortable with this new home I have found."
Sophomore,5,"So far its been a pleasurable experience! One thing I would like to see change, is maybe the cost of tuition."
Niche User,5,I love everything about this school. The size is just right for me. The people are nice and the classroom sizes are a good size for a student teacher relationship

Niche User,5,I loved the school and it was a great experience for me to go and look at differ my colleges. If any body is having a hard time picking a college I’d recommend you to pick umbrella and it’s also a great Christian college because you acne connect with other people and tell your testimony.
Niche User,5,My experience with Mary Hardin-Baylor is very limited due to the fact that I've only received emails and an offer to become a freshman at this school.
Freshman,5,"when I went on the tour to visit Mary Hardin Baylor, the campus and the directors that were giving the tour were very welcoming and made the campus feel like home away from home. This made me want to attend Marry Hardin Baylor in the fall semester of 2019."
Sophomore,5,Gorgeous campus! Friendly staff and students! Smaller number of students for a more one-on-one feel. I love my school !
Junior,5,From day 1 I felt very welcomed. The admissions office made sure I was in the right track to apply. Transfer connect was great. I was able to register for my classes and meet the advisors in my department. The professors I’ve had in the fall were amazing. They really want you to succeed not only in their classroom but also in your other classes.
Senior,5,"The atmosphere on campus is so warm and caring. Both faculty and staff invest in the students. There are re so many different ways to get involved on campus,  but still room for incoming students to put their own touch on campus life. I loved being able to grow with this university over four years."
Niche User,5,The campus is extremely beautiful and everything is nice about it. The whole campus has updated technology while also having the smaller campus feel.
Junior,5,"The atmosphere and people at UMHB are really something else. You can feel God at work, and if you aren't a believer, they are still so welcoming and loving. The instruction is phenomenal and the professors are very personable. Allover a great college."
Niche User,5,I have not attend this college yet but I have been accepted. Everyone has been very nice and very helpful every time I have gone to a function there. I can not wait to become a student there.
Sophomore,5,"During my experience with the University of Mary Hardin Baylor, I really enjoyed the atmosphere here and how welcoming the staff is. The professors know their students by name, and are always so helpful and understanding of all students situations which has been so great. There are so many different places for the students to get the help they need, from study centers and tutoring to nurses and counselors. The things I would like to see different would be more availabilities on the weekend, the campus does not have many things for the students during the weekend, so many of the students go back home. So far the three semesters I’ve attended UMHB, I have loved it."
Senior,5,The atmosphere of the campus is very welcoming. The teachers are very prepared and are always available for help.
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere here at UMHB. I love how it is a small community and that you can see the same people every day. I have built friendships since day one here and I absolutely love it.
Niche User,5,There were wonderful people and gave an amazing tour. I walked through the dinning hall and everything was wonderfully clean and neat. The walking distance between class and school isn’t bad and everyone was very polite to me.
Freshman,5,I liked the view of the campus and I loved how the students there were so open-minded and ready to help incoming freshman.
Senior,5,"I love this school. I have made life long friendships and relationships at University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. It is a small school with a great community of students, professors, and staff that make you feel at home."

Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor because everyone is so nice and friendly! UMHB is a small university, but offers many extra-curricular clubs and events to ensure that students are involved. UMHB is a Christian-oriented university that helped me grow spiritually my first year of college The professors are amazing and go above and beyond to help the students excel."
Junior,5,I enjoyed the environment the most. The size is perfect and the campus is beautiful. The staff is all very friendly and the professors are helpful. The immediate area surrounding UMHB (Belton) is a beautiful small town.
Sophomore,5,So many clubs and organizations that cater to any and every desire. The campus is gorgeous and has many facilities open to all students and staff to ensure a pleasurable and memorable experience.
Freshman,5,"When I visited UMHB, they opened their arms to me immediately. Everyone there was so friendly and they took you in as one of their own. UMHB really is the place to go if you want amazing quality."
Freshman,5,"UMHB is an amazing school and everyone here is very caring of each other. The school is located in Belton, Texas and you would think it is in a bad spot but that has never been a problem. Personally I think the dorm rooms could be a little bit bigger but there was not one issue with them. The staff here is so helpful and will help find faith in you."
Senior,4,"If you want a family experience coming into your freshmen year, as well as personal relationships with your professors, then this will be your place to come. I hope in the near future they expand their living facilities and faculty to match the ever growing student population."
Alum,4,Overall enjoyed my 4 years of undergraduate school. The nursing program was great and definitely prepared me for my nursing boards. The students were very welcoming to freshman.
Alum,4,Value gained from attending depends on the program and professors you take.  Most professors are helpful.
Alum,4,"Not a lot of entertainment in Belton. Decent college but very conservative and filled with rich kids. Good equipment and very nice buildings. Strict, ridiculous rules about certain topics."
Sophomore,4,"It is different as your classes are smaller and you miss the face to face.  During COVID, we had to do online study.  It wasn't hard but when you are working with folks who act like family, it made the learning that much more interesting."
Sophomore,4,It is a small college but it the people are like family. If you don't want the influence of big city life than this college is for you.
Sophomore,4,I am still a student at UMHB and so far I am really liking my experience. I chose to attend here because I knew that a smaller campus would allow me to get a better education since classrooms would be significantly smaller than other universities in Texas.
Sophomore,4,I am still a student at UMHB and so far I am really liking my experience. I chose to attend here because I knew that a smaller campus would lessen the amount of people I'd see on a day to day basis and I really like the small town feel of campus.
Sophomore,4,The online classes were very good. All of the professors made sure to give us time to complete the assignments and let us know time in advance when they are supposed to be due. They would always reach out to any of us just to see if we are doing alright with the assignments.
Junior,4,UMHB has a small but beautiful campus. I have always felt safe on-campus and believe that the Police Department takes great care of the students. The campus is always kept clean and there are always friendly people to help you figure out where a building is. I love the faculty and staff at UMHB and think that they really do care about the students attending UMHB. It is expensive but I really think that by the time you graduate you will be ready for your career/adulthood.
Junior,4,It is definitely in its own bubble. If you do not consider yourself cookie-cutter-christian there is definitely a feeling of not always belonging.
Sophomore,4,UMHB is a very supportive and encouraging university. All the faculty on campus want to see you succeed and are willing to help.
Alum,4,Academics are appropriate and prepare students for real world environment. Class sizes are small so there is a lot of individual attention. You never feel like a number there.
Freshman,4,i like that UMHB has a strong emphasis on focusing on the student. i would like to see tuition fall or at least stay at one price for a couple years rather than increasing by semester.
Senior,4,Nice campus with diversity in ethnicity as well as in age group. Very progressive in school technology . Tuition is on the high end .
Niche User,4,"Mary Hardin has a lot of diversity on campus and a lot of great sights to see. It's definitely a place I would like to revisit, and I am even thinking of transferring there after community college."
Senior,4,Offers a Christian based education with lots of fine arts opportunities. Beautiful clean campus with great recreational facilities. Partners with the Yellow Ribbon Program and is Military friendly.
Niche User,4,I like like that it is a christian based school. It has an good atmosphere. The students and teachers are kind. The teacher care about our learning.also like the fact they listen to what the students need.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the campus life and classes, but trying to get scholarships that aren't athletic isn't impossible but isn't easy. I remember trying to get some form of credible aid wasn't easy either, but in the end, 
I got something that helped with expenses."
Niche User,4,"Through my admissions process this university has been both patient and detailed. Originally, I wasn't even sure if I should apply to this school, but one day I received a fee waivered application from them saying they wanted me. They offered priority scholarships to me in result of applying as a early decision student. At first I was hesitant, but after looking at all my options, the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor was a huge deal breaker for me especially because of the offered scholarships I got like the tuition equalization grant, federal pell grant, and other institutional scholarships."
Freshman,4,Mary Hardin Baylor is an amazing school that really tries to help their students get involved and do their best at anything they will do in the future! Will defiantly recommend to anyone who asks!
Sophomore,4,"The only thing I really don’t like about this school is the parking. And it’s very expensive. Besides that, I’ve been here for a year and I’ve enjoyed my experience so far."
Junior,4,I Love the professors in the art program of this school. Really fine program. I have learned many things in my first semester of me going here. It is way better than the previous college I was at before I transferred here.
Freshman,4,UMHB is a great community where you can learn and grow. The small class sizes are very nice as you are able to reach out to classmates and professors easier. It's been a great place to meet lifelong friends!
Niche User,4,"The university of Mary Hardin -Baylorit’s a very good environment ,and everyone is really friendly. The teachers are especially friendly they’re willing to help their students succeed. Being on such a small campus he practically no everybody you just walk down the street and you see somebody already know."
Senior,4,I really love how amazing my professors are and how much they enjoy their job. Most of the staff is friendly and very helpful.
Graduate Student,4,UMHB is a very student centered institution that is focused on retention and success. The faculty is passionate about their content and pass on that passion in their teaching and willingness to assist each student. The institution also provides resources outside of the classroom in student organizations and professional development opportunities such as conference participation and publishing opportunities.
Junior,4,"What I like the most about this university is the friendly atmosphere and how diverse the campus is. The faculty is great, and it is a small campus which makes it easy for you to meet people and make new friends. This is a Christian university which is the main reason why I am attending this school, however Christianity is not forced on students and there is no discrimination against people who are of different religion. The one thing about the campus that I am not a fan of is the lack of activities for students. There are some but not many, and the food is also not the best. These are only small problems though as the rest of this university is amazing."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor so far has been a great one. Although it is a small school, I think that's what makes it so great! You get to meet people very easily and have more one-on-one time with your professors. The professors here want every sinlge one of their studenst to succeed, so never be afraid to ask them for help! There's almost always something going on at the campus such as mission trips, club meetings, and sporting events. The campus itself is beautiful and since it is a small university, it helps with not having to worry about being late to class so much."
Junior,4,"Overall this a great school! The academic programs are wonderful and the teachers want to see  you succeed. There are many ob opportunities available on campus. Since this is a Christian school, most of the events and functions reflect that. The students themselves are not very diverse. The school allows for students to have clubs for the different ethnicities and nationalities on campus. There is no Greek life or big party scene on campus. Most people go home on the weekends or just enjoy trips out of town. I like staying on campus sometimes for the weekends because buildings aren't crowded and everything is really quiet and serene."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and the professors I've had are knowledgable and fair in their grading. Many offer opportunities to get extra credit points if you are struggling with grades and are generally helpful during office hours.
Freshman,4,I like that the faculty puts their students first. What I would like to see change is more assistance financially from the school.
Freshman,4,"I love attending UMHB I come from a small town so the student to faculty ratio is amazing.  The campus is beautiful, there are trees all through campus and the grass is always mowed. If you are looking for a small college with an amazing Nursing program this is it!"
Freshman,4,"At the beginning I was not all that sure of coming to this school because I am not good at socializing with others and coming here would mean that I wouldn't know anyone at all. After being here for one semester I realize I made the right choice, the classes and the professors are really good and they do their best to help you be successful. There is a lot of help offered, including tutors online and in person."
Sophomore,4,"I love that this is a smaller campus, making the commute to every class very short. I've been here for two years now and the professors are very friendly and willing to help students. 
Chapel services could improve significantly regarding the worship team and music. Should have more events on campus during the week to participate in. Cafeteria food is okay, could be much better. The 1945 Grill has excellent food, however, the hours of operation should extend into evening hours."
Freshman,4,"Peers and professors are very friendly, class sizes are small but comfortable, campus resources are pretty accessible and campus activities are enjoyable."
Freshman,4,"This is the school I'll be attending next fall, and so far here are the things that I can see from it."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful! Financial it is difficult to attend without having to pull out a few loans. I enjoy the faculty to student ratio, you can definitely tell that the university is student orientated."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the school. i love the christian environment and and i'm literally so blessed that God brought me  to this school to grow in my faith, get a GREAT education, and play the sport I love, Soccer. The professors are so great, but the only thing I think I would change would be the cafeteria lunch food. Its the same thing every day and it gets old after a while. There's also no glucose free meals available besides salad."
Freshman,4,University of Mary Hardin Baylor is an AMAZING school. I have met my best friends here and I am receiving an excellent education where the professors truly care about you're schooling.
Junior,4,"One thing i enjoy about the university is the student community around the small campus. Individuals from different backgrounds will always come together, whether it be for religion, or other common ground. The university affiliates itself with athletic and academic pride, one being from the football team, and the other form the nursing program. The university, though highly accredited, is still somewhat small and is constantly attempting to grow and branch out. Overall, the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor allows the average college student to feel at home, while providing a memorable college experience."
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my experience at Mary Hardin Baylor and would highly recommend it to others. I have found the classes to be intriguing and the professors to be helpful but also expect the best from the students. The overall learning experience is great! The atmosphere at the school is one of the best, my peers are fun to be around and at the college there's always something to look forward to doing."
Freshman,4,I love the area and the people. They have great sports and activities for students. The class are great. It just the cost if you have a family its hard to go back to school there.
Junior,4,"Mary Hardin-Baylor is a wonderful university. Generally, all of the professors care on a personal level about their students and their success. The campus is absolutely beautiful and it is constantly being updated as needed. It is a safe place, and it is located in a great spot- small town, but shopping is not too far away."
Junior,4,Umhb has a great environment for learning with small class sizes and a Christian environment.  The campus is beautiful and it has many restaurants and areas for student communication.  Umhb also has a great educator preparation program that has been in use since 1911.  
Freshman,4,"I'd have to say my experience will be 10/10. Although I am not in college yet, I assume it will be one of the best moments of my life. "
College Sophomore,4,the school helps you get jobs
College Sophomore,4,the teachers are great at this school
College Sophomore,4,nothing bad has happened on campus because the school does the most it can to make everyone feel safe
College Sophomore,4,its pretty to getting into fraternity because they are clubs and clubs don't turn anyone away
College Sophomore,4,the athletics are great here and they actually make the athletes sit in the front for class
College Sophomore,4,The school has major support for the Athletic Department on campus. The campus is Christian based and a lot of support is given to the players in each sports from the fans all around the area. I have noticed student involvement at the games by painting their faces to dancing at the touchdowns at football games. The Athletic Department is what keeps the school so alive and entertaining.
College Sophomore,4,The University of Mary Hardin-Baylor is amazing!
College Freshman,4,Not to bad. A few things are a little crooked and cramped but for the most part nice.
College Freshman,4,They're great. Very team oriented and involved in the school.
College Junior,4,The UMHB football team always ranks as one of the top D3 teams. There are always large crowds at the basketball and volleyball games as well.
College Senior,4,I feel safe on campus. We have campus police as well as officers from the local police department. I have never had any issues with crime or assault.
College Senior,4,"Honestly, I live off campus, so I am not in tune with the athletic department. I hear great things about the football team and they usually go deep in the playoffs. I may attend 1 or two games per semester with my family and the Crusaders always win. I don't know about the other sports."
College Sophomore,4,Looking forward to intern/job opportunities
College Senior,4,"When first enrolled in the school, i was told i had to live in a dorm before i could live anywhere else. I found this reasoning logical, and sought out my options at the school. However, since the school is primarily female based, there were only 3 options for me to choose: Gettys, McLane, and Beall. I orginally chose Gettys, because it was a very tight knit group that allowed every single host living in the dorm to know each other. But, i was put in Beall because of the lack of rooms available. Beall Hall is very immersed in involving every single person living there in any and all social activities that it hosts. Whether it be bar-b-cue behind the dorm, or a Christmas party with a movie playing on a giant screen, the dorm seeks to give residents a chance to socialize with others in the dorm. McLane is an average dorm, but seems to have more events than the other two male dorms. Overall, the social atmosphere within the college dorm life is centered on helping you find you group of friends. Whether it be one, or 10, you always seem to find a friend within that first year of living in the dorms. The apartment situation gives you the chance to gain a feel of what it would be like to live alone. Unlike the dorms, where you are required to eat at Bawcom, the apartments come with their own kitchen, and come with the option of dining in Bawcom, or choosing your own meal. And though the dorm life may come with a number of social outings, the apartment complexes do their fair share as well. Events such as fall festivities with music and games, to just handing out root beer floats, allows you to become acquainted with those living in your residential building/area. In the end, UMHB gives multiple opportunities to its students to socialize with others who might share the same interests as them."
Junior,2,DO NOT ATTEND HERE IF YOU WANT TO MAJOR IN COMMUNICATIONS. This department has some of the laziest lackadaisical staff and administration. They don't work with you. They don't care about you graduating and they don't care about YOU. They have treated me like dirt for the last 3 semesters and I'm sick of it. The Bursars office is a joke. But the rest of the administration OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DPT. They are good people and honestly care about their students. If I could change my major I would. I'm sickened with the communications dept.
Niche User,2,"The students were kind.  Most professors cared about their students success.  The draw back UMHB is UNNECESSARILY expensive to attend, you are FORCED to go to chapel and if you don't go x amount of times in one semester you DO NOT get to go from freshman to sophomore, or sophomore to junior, or junior to senior, or senior to graduate!!!!!!  They took some of what was already very limited parking availability and built a football stadium on it."
College Sophomore,2,We do not have these programs at my school.
College Junior,2,It is not a diverse campus.
College Freshman,2,It's okay. There is a small amount of housing and the process is very stressful. Most of the apartments are glorified dorm rooms in which you have to share a room with three other people.
Recent Alumnus,2,The housing office sucks and the housing process is a joke.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't choose this school for the simple fact that it is boring. You are very restricted to think or speak how you feel.
College Sophomore,2,The campus is much like a giant high school in how things are handled. The rules are not college equivalent and minor offenses are enforced very heavily.
College Sophomore,2,"With the closure of the SUB and the opening of Bawcom, there is only two food options unless you pay near $1000 for the actual meal plan, which is geared towards freshman living in dorms and not apartments. There is only chic-fil-a and The Grill which only serves hamburgers and chicken."
College Freshman,2,"The amount of documents needed to receive the desired aid is steadily added to all the way up until the deadline. I had to rush to find a printer and a fax machine because I received an e-mail about documents that hadn't been submitted yet two days before the deadline. The e-mail was sent because the document had just been added to my list of needed forms that day, and they had to be printed out and hand-signed. I almost lost a large portion of my financial aid because of that."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much, but most students want to stay on campus in the apartments anyways so you don't hear much about off-campus housing."
College Freshman,2,the fact that we can only have the opposite sex in our rooms one day a week and only for four hours is annoying when you have guy friends that just want to hang out and watch a movie and you cant!!!
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of places aimed at college students. Almost no places are open late at night when many college students would want to go out.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you're a nursing major or a girl (guys get nothing) from a truly baptist background, scholarship opportunities are almost non-existent"
Recent Alumnus,2,We have the few people that actually give into Christian beliefs that are sweet to people no matter what but then you have the stuck up kids that are just rude period.
College Sophomore,2,It is a very strict school.
College Freshman,2,It's do-able but parking spots are horrible to find. The campus police are insane about where you park.
College Freshman,2,I didn't do very well in my classes this semester. The classes were much harder than expected. Sports didn't go well at all for me this year. I think I should've gone to junior college then transferred somewhere else.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, I don't see anything that's truly unique about our school besides a majority of our athletics. Football and basketball and volleyball and women's golf are great teams to represent the school but that's about it."
College Freshman,2,I had no scholarships lined up coming into college so I had to take a huge loan out and I'm worried about taking more huge loans out.
College Freshman,2,dining hall food is okay there is needed improvements.
College Junior,2,"since its a small town, hard to find the restaurants"
College Freshman,2,"There just isn't much variety. We have two sonics, a Whataburger, a Starbucks, and a bunch of Mexican restaurants and steakhouses. If you want anything else, you have to drive to temple, but they mostly have a bunch of chain restaurants."
College Freshman,2,There is just nothing to do in town. Most students drive out of town or find something or some event on campus to do something fun. The locals seem to forget that they have a university in their town and act as though the students don't really exist. It is not a very prosperous community also and there is a lot of unemployment. 
College Senior,2,"Belton is a very small town. There is hardly any ""night life"" and the dorms have a curfew so hardly anything, that isn't school lead such as a bible study, happens at night. I'm not much of a night life person, so this works out fine for me."
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of parking spots for commuters, but limited convient parking for the traditional housing."
College Freshman,2,Not much of a night life. Drinking is not allowed.
College Freshman,2,"Our school is currently working on making sure that we have enough parking for all of our students. It is sometimes very hard to find a parking spot near your dorm or class. However, permit costs are very reasonable, ticketing and fines are not bad at all. You definitely would not need a car on campus. I have made it through my first year without having one."
College Freshman,2,"UMHB is too strict on a lot of the policies. Alcohol and drug use is understandable. However, visitation is just way too serious in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"The night life is pretty boring honestly. Most people go to Killeen, Austin or college station to party. However the house parties near campus have been pretty live!"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't very much diversity at UMHB. There are a few foreign students from Asia but other than that, all the black people are on the football team, and everyone else is white."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is horrible if you are a commuter. It has gotten better but you still have to get here early to get a good parking spot, dont move your car because when you come back you wont find any parking."
Recent Alumnus,2,It seems that the more the years go on by the more difficult the parking becomes. You really have to get there early or tough luck. A good investment would be in a multi-level parking garage so we don't have to park in the residents yard anymore. Especially on the science wing I remember that parking area being the most difficult.
College Junior,2,"There is plenty of parking for people who live off campus. However, there is almost no parking for those that live on campus. This is mainly due to the majority of lots being designated for commuters."
College Junior,2,"Not Enough Housing & Not Enough Cheaper Options – The dorms and apartments vary A LOT. Don't live in Burt Hall if you can avoid it. Small rooms, bunked beds and a shared bathroom with your neighbors is never a fun experience. However, Stribling is great. There are community bathrooms, but there are housekeepers that clean them daily. You have your own private room, which is a major bonus. Gettys is known as the ""Ghetto Dorm"". I will leave you to your own assumptions there. The apartments (especially the newest ones) and really nice but incredibly expensive. The apartments do not include meal plans, unlike the dorms. The cheapest place to live is Huckins Hall, the oldest apartments on campus. It's small and you have a roommate, but there are ways to work around that, especially if your roommate is awesome. Unfortunately, Huckins will be torn down in 2014. In all of the dorms and apartments there are free laundry rooms. For upperclassmen, getting housing is difficult since freshmen are required to live on campus. The school has decided to increase enrollment but not increase housing at the same pace. Bad planning to the extreme."
College Freshman,2,The Town of Belton – Belton is a small town with not much to do. The lake is one of the most popular attractions along with local restaurants that are wonderful to eat at. Everyone is quite friendly in belton and they host a once a month shopping experience downtown with booths and differnt tables set up.
College Sophomore,2,"Avg. Student – the people from my school come fro a lot of small towns, and many are very involved in the church. the school is predominantly white, lot of country folk, are lots of minority males on campus lots of them play different sports, girls are pretty but don't expect anything to exotic maybe a few here and there. lot of people play the guitar and you can find a few smokers that constantly smell like cigarettes."
College Sophomore,2,"Small Town – off campus selection isn't very good, its a small town so there's not to many apt. complexes , alot of old homes that may look good in the inside but the outside isnt to friendly. on campus housing is great theres really no need to live off campus"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking on campus is ok. Campus enrollment has increased and there don't seem to be enough parking spots. If you want one, you have to get there really early."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Food – The food has been improving since there was a new chef, so the quality isn't so much of a problem within the main dining Hall at the moment, however, there are really only two areas on campus to eat at. Sometimes the main dining hall doesn't have much that's good so people go to the sub. It's better, but the food is so greasy. It would be really nice to have other on campus food options that those two, and smoothies whihc hardly qualifies as a meal option."
Senior,1,The University is not worth the cost. The price tag is outrageous and most people who begin here end up tranfering out. I am graduating with maybe 6 people that I began the University with.
Junior,1,"The MyWay Program platform is the most complicated and overall non functioning system. They should be ashamed at how NON user friendly and overall broken the system is. The amount of money you pay and time you invest, they should at least do their part and offer a working system."
College Sophomore,1,The campus does not have Greek life and I wish there was a way someone could bring the idea to the campus.
College Junior,1,UMHB is not a party school. It is hard to find parties and drinking on campus is prohibited.
College Freshman,1,The value of the are fairly motivated. People have their degrees and working towards being more than they are now.
College Freshman,1,"My experience here is not too good. Some of the professors do not know what they are doing, which makes it hard on the students. The courses do have a variety. Now the class style is mainly just note taking which isnt too helpful for those like me who are hands on learners. The class size is small which is a good thing when it comes to getting to know your professor and them being able to actually work with you. But over all it is boring. Everyone is quiet and to themselves, and during the weekend when college students are supposed to be having fun they all go home."
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek Life...
College Freshman,1,We don't really have greek life here.
College Freshman,1,we do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life so it can't get good ratings
College Freshman,1,It's really annoying that we can't have friends that are girls at anytime. Not all of us are perves
College Junior,1,The only parties are thrown by UMHB.
College Sophomore,1,There are basically no parties here. Nightlife is nonexistent and weekends are very boring
College Senior,1,Food is really bad and expensive
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at UMHB.
College Freshman,1,WE DO NOT HAVE FRATS OR SORORITYS :(
Recent Alumnus,1,We only have two options of places to eat on campus. One is a buffet style type and the food isn't that great. And the other we make orders but it is nothing special. For as money as we pay I would think we'd be able to afford more than two cafeterias.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They treat us like if we are still high schoolers. We are not allowed to have candles in our apartments/dorms, they come to check to see if our apartment is clean every other two weeks (is that really necessary?). Even if you are of age we are not allowed to drink at all or have alcoholic beverages in our apartment. The school could also broaden their horizons when it comes to school activities and organizations. I know it is a baptist school, but not EVERYTHING has to be about religion. We also pay a lot of money to attend this school and we are limited to how much stuff we can print...they give us a certain amount to print and anything after that we have to pay...at Texas State University the tuition is cheaper and you can print however many papers you would like for no charge at all."
College Senior,1,"Even though there is a state-of-the-art nursing building, this program is a huge joke. They never follow through on there rules and if you have a problem, they could care less. Thank god for my nurse tech job because I learned more there then that this program. If I would have known how corrupt and shady this program was I would have left immediately. Now its too late to start over."
College Junior,1,really nothing to do. most freshmen and underages vdont have cars so are stuck on campus

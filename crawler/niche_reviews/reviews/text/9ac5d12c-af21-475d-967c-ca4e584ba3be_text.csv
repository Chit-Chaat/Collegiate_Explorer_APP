Graduate Student,5,"The most difficult part about the university is moving between buildings.  The entrances are confusing and not well marked, I have to walk into adjacent buildings to get where I actually need to go."
Sophomore,5,So far the experience has been very new and different but i actually prefer it to classroom learning because it allows me to work full time and get my credits in per semester
Sophomore,5,"Great school, great professors, campuses all over the city with easy metro access. I am happy to be attending a HBCU and can't wait for classes to resume this fall."
Senior,5,"It is a working progress since not all classes are meant to be online. However, the stimulations for laboratory sessions have been great to explore."
Senior,5,"The Professors  provide practical experiences and opportunities. It is great to have professors who are willing to provide theory and practical experiences. They all work to match students with internships, professional development opportunities, jobs and practicuums in the workforce."
Senior,5,"I appreciate the small class sizes which allows for more personalized learning. It is close to a Metro stop, making it convenient to travel to. Extremely diverse school and prides itself on inclusivity."
Sophomore,5,I have been a student at UDC for 2 years now and I can say my experience there have been great. They cater for all students and it is a very diverse school which practice to be inclusive every step of the way.
Freshman,5,"I like the school because it's where family members went to, and now me. Its one of the top most colleges that had students graduate, and the other half that left is now returning to the same program has I am. I can count on it. I am learning how things can work for me, or not for me."
Senior,5,The University of the District of Columbia is small academic four year college. The school spirit is excellent. The classrooms are attentive. And the professors are extraordinary. Students graduate with a stable sense of sense!
Senior,5,My professor taught me textbook knowledge and real world experience to help me future my career. My campus is a safe diverse community moving to better the workforce. The Professor are super helpful and appreciate their students.
Niche User,5,I love how the professors and other employees ho out their way to help a student the best that they can in any way possible. I was scared at first when i began school but as i went on with classes it seem to get better and better. I learned to use my voice if i needed help and everyone's opinion matters and not everyone has the same views.  We all have the ability to teach and help one another.  I look forward to each semester and hopefully i can continue my education further.
Senior,5,"University Of District of Columbia is a great college/University for everyone. I recommend people to go they. They are lots of clubs and activities to join. They are lots of trips for freshmen during each semester. They are lots of learn about the states like New York, Florida. They are also special trips that happens each semester. They go to Ghana and other countries to study for one semester. The yearly cost to attend this college is far less than other colleges out there."
Sophomore,5,"I really like how there are a lot of areas for students to relax and hang out after all of their classes are finished since there are a lot of places around the campus that you can go to, as well as clubs and events that they hold inside of it."
Freshman,5,I have just started at UDC. I am a freshman. My experience at UDC so far has been good. The professors are great. The students how attend are so diverse. It is very convenient for me because I can live off campus since it’s so close to home.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone is friendly and they speak to one another. The staff and students tend to help each other. I feel comfortable and safe there.
Sophomore,5,The University is definitely a school college to visit and attent I would definitely recommend looking into it
Senior,5,What I love about the university of the District of Columbia is the professors and employers there are really nice and accepting
Freshman,5,I would have never thought such a good quality of education was right around the corner from me. The class sizes are not too massive that I feel like I am not getting heard. The teachers give quality information and I feel I am learning so much here. What makes things even better is that it is affordable!
Freshman,5,udc was very helpful. going into the bulding i                                                                                        budc jvcs dvc dcvwdcwb cgwjvvfbff fwefbjdjbefwvef ef edveuvf e fefvj ejf
Niche User,5,i really enjoyed they people there they showed me alot of things they showed me the dorms they food is good they are nice people
Niche User,5,"attending udc is a great oppurtinty and im greatfull to be apart of this company
the staff is very kind and i like how they send emails to make sure you have everything thats needed"
Junior,5,"The University of the District of Columbia has opened up their doors to all that knock. UDC is welcoming and feels like a family away from your family. UDC is always seeking improvement for the individuals, the campus, and the staff."
Senior,5,I love my university due to the diversity. UDC has a large number of international students. the professors are knowledgeable. the student body is wonderful. I enjoying attending the university.
Junior,5,"I like that it is a great community. The people are great, the atmosphere is fair, and the school is fun."
Sophomore,5,Overall the University of the District of Columbia is a great school. It is a diverse school that focuses more on education.
Freshman,5,My experience with Udc is slim because I haven’t been there yet to see what it’s like to be in college.
Freshman,5,So far my experience joining the Firebirds has been the smoothes onboarding experience ive had from any education institution.
Senior,5,I like the university of the district of Columbia because have the tools that need for my education  that want have the great careers and is easy for can go and study full time. I s a amazing university have the programs that need a student.
Graduate Student,5,I love UDC.  Its the greatest experience I have ever had.  Wonderful place and I hope you choose this year.
Sophomore,5,"I am having a very great experience at the University of the District of Columbia, what i will want to see change is a high rate of students graduation every year."
Freshman,5,"6 months ago i moved to America for college. I expected to feel lonely and homesick but University of the district of Colombia took me in their family and made me feel comfortable and at home. The school is amazing, has amazing staff and students and if you fail a class it's not because of any professor, it is because of you because they help you and try their best for everything at get a A or B. The school is very diverse, the campus is small but in a urban area. The campus is very safe , the campus police are very protective but friendly and there are fun activities for everyone"
Senior,5,"I studied at this University and I can tell you my experience; I had great experiences with great professors that taught me great and real things. I see UDC as a great opportunity for getting my education in the United States at low cost and smart way. I met great professors at UDC and I'm glad to belong to this family. Now, what is the negative part? Well, they must improve their administrative management and customer service system, in this part, you must do 90% of follow-up in everything because they will do only 10%. I am sad to say this because I know there are new people trying to change this issue, but in my experience, even the ""Gurus"" were not 100% accurate. However, I believe the University is working hard for fixing their deficiencies and I know they will improve their quality and service for sure. I wish them good luck!"
Sophomore,5,When I started I was intimidated because I am older. The younger students and Professors are very welcoming. And the Professors are very understanding to non traditional students situations outside of school. I would like to see more older people attend or go back to school.
Junior,5,"Proudly of being, part of firebird which actually known as name of the university.
My experience still and always been wonderful, and the university provide such great programs with guaranteed repetition."
Graduate Student,5,"I like the fact that the school is diversity and that they take on the needs of all students. I felt appreciated and I felt like got a fair chance to experience higher education at this land grant university. I appreciate this school, staff, professors and administrative for supporting all students through their college experience. I would want them to have better technology in the classrooms and also financial aid process is slow."
Recent Alumnus,5,"UDC has a unique campus housing situation. Students are afforded the opportunity to live in one the most expensive parts of DC at a reasonable rate. The units are pretty close to the campus. There are underground grocery shopping options, swimming pools, tennis courts, grill areas and much more. The most unfortunate part is that the last year that the university will offer it to students is the 2015-2016 academic year."
College Junior,5,"my professors are so qualified for the courses they teach. They are so passionate about their professions in such a way that it motivates we student and make us to fall in love with out majors. our descriptions very clear, teaching and class style excellent and class size is appropriate."
College Sophomore,5,"on Connecticut avenue where the School is there is whole blocks dedicated to dining, Spanish (South/ Central American), Greek, African (Ethiopian), Italian and chain and franchise food. if that's not good enough the metro is right there and so is the bus."
College Freshman,5,"dining on campus is great, also menus are changed daily to give consumers various options as well as change."
College Freshman,5,"Health and safety of student is important to the school. This also shows in that the school provides school insurance for those without private insurance, which is compulsory when no other form of insurance can be proven by a student and at very low cost."
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process was easy and smooth and any issue had was minimal and there was always someone to help if any does arise.
College Freshman,5,It is really nice to be a civil engineering major. The courses are fun and interesting and if you love constructions and buildings it is the best option. the lecturers also make the course easy as they are always there to help students.
College Junior,5,"The professors are great, the class size is ok. Overall I love my school."
College Junior,5,The party scene at my school is nonexistent that's why its the best because I can focus on my studies and not going out every weekend
College Junior,5,Getting into my major which is finance was no issue at all. I am a transfer student. That process was upsetting and difficult because UDC only accepted 27 credits out of the 30 credits I earned from Penn State
College Freshman,5,DC always has something to do for everybody.
College Freshman,5,We have a lot of police officers on our campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I have never been to a game to see the athletes play but as far as academics, the athletes are very dedicated"
College Sophomore,5,I can always rely on the computers on the campus. Sometimes they shut down the labs to do technical work but I still rate it as an excellent reliable source
College Sophomore,5,Not a lot of people are in the Finance major. I love being a finance major. Every time I mention my major to someone else they always tell me that I am about my business and money.
College Sophomore,5,I have yet to see are witness someone on school grounds doing drugs or drinking alcohol.
College Sophomore,5,I have lived in the District of Columbia all my life. I love the city but I do not plan on living in it once I find my own place.
College Sophomore,5,"The cafe is good, but Potbelly and Chalins are good too!"
College Sophomore,5,"The music program offers excellent courses.    I really enjoy my piano and voice lessons, theory, ear training, choir, etc.    the Professors are first rate!"
College Sophomore,5,I feel quite safe.   There are guards everywhere.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe.
College Sophomore,5,Not sure about internships yet.
College Sophomore,5,I love my program.   The Music Department is excellent!  A lot of people take UDC for granted.   First rate school.
College Sophomore,5,"The school has restricted all drugs from the campus, which is a good thing."
College Sophomore,5,The campus is located in a great spot
Graduate Student,4,"I have not taken online classes, though this past semester was eye opening.  I've taken online classes at another university, but they were designed to be online.  This semester there was no plan for going online, it was difficult but I do not fault the university."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience has been pretty good so far. Most of my professors were able to adjust well to online teaching. Some did virtual lectures that were mandatory and took attendance, some threw lectures out the window, and just posted youtube videos and reading assignments. But all of my professors offered office hours and time to discuss the material one on one, which was super helpful. I could also get tutoring online, so that's good. However, I feel like the quality of my education decreased and I cannot wait to get back into the classroom. It is just not the same."
Sophomore,4,The University of the District of Columbia is an affordable higher institution available to DC residents. What I liked about it most was that the professors were effective and readily available to students.
Freshman,4,My online experience was pretty good. You did not have to worry about getting up early and going to class. Presenting assignments was ways less stressful and scary. The teacher did a great job explaining things as usual.
Freshman,4,I liked how the classes were not too far away from each other. I liked how the advisors would always be there to help you. I liked how there were big gaps between each class so you could catch up on assignments.
Freshman,4,Overall great school. Teachers are very involved and efficient. They want you to really retain your information. Normal class sizes all around. Team spirit
Sophomore,4,The staff are really friendly and supportive.They always make sure you are motivated.The parking is great.The campus is not hard to get around.
Freshman,4,"What I enjoy most at the University of the District of Columbia is that the professors are willing to go out of their way to help the students be successful towards getting their degree. Food is not a problem in DC. It is the perfect place to get lunch before your next class. The school takes security seriously. The University has its own app that lets students know if there is any problem or situation in real time. Security is not a problem at the University of the District of Columbia. The  diversity of the University is poor. Mostly African Americans and some Latino Americans are there. The athletics at the University is not great but it doesn't hurt to see a couple games. The university also has its own free shuttle bus for students to help with transportation around the different campuses and community colleges.  Overall, the University of the District of Columbia is an average school, but it will satisfy the student who wants to focus on their education."
Sophomore,4,I like that it is quiet and in a nice area what I don’t like is how they are so nonchalant and does not care about you signing up for classes and they always have a attitude their no help half the time it’s everything for yourself even if you don’t know what you’re doing
Freshman,4,"UDC is my first college experience and so far I'm enjoying the classes and professors. The only problem I have with UDC is the extreme disorganization and lack of communication. As a first time in college freshman, I feel as though I could be very gullible to whatever I am told but even I am understanding that it's hard to get answers and things done with some of the faculty and staff."
Junior,4,It's affordable and the class size is small. It gives you a better relationship with professors and has open research opportunities  with department faculty.
Freshman,4,"They is one thing i would change about University Of District Of Columbia and it would be the waiting time to get the supplies for certain courses. University Of District Columbia is a great place for everyone to take courses. The campus is great inside and outside. They provide great Academic courses, Excellent Professors and Mentors. Lots of helpful and friendly workers ready to help anytime. That is why it deserves a 4 out of 5."
Junior,4,"I am an international student transferring in this university to finish my Bachelor Degree, and I really like it. The teacher are engaged in their work and helpful to make you success in your field. The university is open to diversity and understand well the challenge to study abroad!"
Freshman,4,I like how everything at the school and the computer is touch screen. The school has some support for students with special needs. I really enjoy the event and  organization. The organization has some good places to meet people at the school.
Junior,4,"I love the convenience of University of District of Columbia. It is in the city and easily accessible. It is also much cheaper than so-called more reputable schools around. I know graduates from other schools that are dealing with the same issues that UDC graduates are faced with. What I would like to change, starts with a more open-mindedness towards all students. I would welcome more support in the areas where support is supposedly available, but practically unfounded. I want to believe that this event is a poorly excused away to force independence – I have no idea. I am getting what I need and getting out of there."
Junior,4,I’m a current student and I have enjoyed the information and professionalism of all my professors.  What I would change is how the school interacts with older students. I think there should be more focus and not just on younger students.
Graduate Student,4,"The University of the District of Columbia has an intimate setting affording students the opportunity to be familiar with their classmates and professors.  It provides quality education at a reasonable cost. The course work and training that I am  receiving at UDC would cost enormous sums at other universities. I like to call it education without sacrificing my financial future. The course work has been very challenging to prepare students for the work place. Our employment center is excellent and supports undergraduates, graduates and alumni.  Our professors and president are relatable and are often seen intermingling with the student body."
Freshman,4,I will be enrolling into UDC as an incoming freshman. Take a journey yourself to see what they have to offer.
Sophomore,4,"Coming from DSU, I really did not know what to expect. My first day stepping into the building, I felt welcomed. The Financial Aid Office was more accessible and easy to deal with. The professors care if the students understand the lessons they teach. I met some good people in the building from peers to admin."
Freshman,4,"UDC is a nice school if you are looking for somewhere to start. It has a general list of majors you can find. When first applying, it was kinda difficult because I didn't do certain things rights, but other then that; it's a good school. I also had a problem getting my loan disturbed, but it was solved in a matter of 2 months."
Freshman,4,"My experience at the university of the District of Columbia is very good the professor are very interactive with that classes, campus life is spot on from communting around the campus as far as going class to class. I feel very safe on campus all the time there hasn’t been a time where I felt uncomfortable while  transitioning to class and to my dorm at any point of the day"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I think the school is great. The professors are very nice and helpful, the classes aren't too big so its easier to connect with the professors. what could improve would be places to eat. there arent many places around the area and i wish meal plans were included in tuition so i dont have to buy lunch everyday."
Graduate Student,4,"It a great school where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their goals, no matter what is your race, religion and social class."
Freshman,4,The university of the District of Columbia is overall and okay school. It has a calm environment. The people at the school are friendly and the teachers are always willing to help you.
Niche User,4,I attended UDC-Community College for one year.  There are many amazing professors who take a keen interest in students.
Graduate Student,4,The University of the District of Columbia is a good school. Academic and social life on campus is great and the professors are excellent doing their best to prepare students  for their chosen careers.
College Junior,4,As far as I know there is a lot of networking at the school.
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed my overall experience at UDC CC.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you focus and commit yourself, you can gain a valuable education."
Recent Alumnus,4,Highly diverse. Many international students.
Recent Alumnus,4,The courses are what you make them. They are not the most difficult but some professors will push you.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you network, you will be in the circles of success. If you just use your degree it may be difficult for you."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was given the opportunity to become a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., Omicron Omicron chapter. Joining has opened many doors for me."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My favorite experience with the institution was the opportunity to live in on campus housing. I worked as a resident advisor, so it was always readily accessible. It is the only public institution in DC, so I graduated with limited debt. I was also given the opportunity to participate in Greek Life."
College Junior,4,"my school is liberal towards ethnic, race, economic background, political belief, religion and sexual orientation of the students"
College Junior,4,"professors are great and qualify for their professions, curriculum is clear and easy to understand, registration process is tedious but advisors are there to help, workload can be overwhelming but helpful to individuals' careers, free tutorials or extra lessons are available on campus for those who are having problems in some courses, library and computer labs are readily available for students"
College Junior,4,my degree or major is very lucrative. getting a job is not difficult after graduation
College Junior,4,my campus is generally safe as to the patrol of campus police and other security officers
College Junior,4,dont really know much about the Greek life
College Junior,4,my school is one of the affordable schools in washington DC area especially for international student. also provision of tuition payment installation made it easy for student paying out of pocket to pay their tuition
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy all of the meal options except for one that are I wouldn't like any way. The price is decent for the level of convenience. of course other school have name brand food options but everything that you would need from chipotle to burger king is in walking distance. The down fall is that no matter what your will be spending your own money because I don't know of their being a meal plan.
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of places to eat near UDC-CC. Starbucks, McDonalds, Au Bon Pain, a pizza restaurant and more."
College Freshman,4,Sporting equipments are up to date. And the university supports athletes by funding and also assist involving students in keeping good grades.
College Freshman,4,"It is really good being in the civil engineering bachelor's program and I do enjoy it. We have opportunities to work on CAD simulation software, robotics project and other unique project. the workload is a little heavy but nothing more than what is expected of an engineering major. finding internships is easy being in the capital of the country were construction is ever on going and the need for civil engineers on high demand, which is why getting a job is also easy."
College Freshman,4,"the local atmosphere of the school is nice as it is located in the center of the city, and also it is very close to the state's zoo. which is a major place of attraction."
College Freshman,4,"Off-campus dining options near my school are great, as they allow different choice of meal, as well as different food  options for different persons; such as food options for vegetarians and low calories option for those on diet."
College Freshman,4,"The fraternities and sororities in my school participate in many community service based events that bring the community together. They also host a lot of forums that help people build their characters, how students can strive academically, and how to deal with anxiety and stress."
College Junior,4,"We have a cafeteria on campus. A local Giant food store. A Starbucks on the corner. A cuisine restaurant, and several other quick eatery places. The campus is also steps away from the Metro station."
College Freshman,4,There are many restaurants within walking distance transportation like metro rail and bus. The life off of campus is pretty nice.
College Freshman,4,I have heard that the medical health center is pretty awesome I have not yet experienced a visit but it seems pretty good.
College Freshman,4,Although I do not live on campus many apartments are nearby am very much in walking distance of transportation and campus.
College Junior,4,There is plenty of places around the campus to get food and the places are in the budget of college students it is great
College Junior,4,I have learned how to network and seek help from others if I am not understanding the lecture or even the professor. The academics offered are pretty good.
College Junior,4,I have no problem with the food that is served on campus its pretty good
College Junior,4,Parking is extremely easy and there is a good amount of it. Cost varies but it is usually decently cheap. They are mostly all within walking distance to campus.
College Freshman,4,A lot of the students at UDC are goal-oriented.
College Freshman,4,There are good resources available for students.
College Freshman,4,"My major, music, isn't hard to get in at all."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people shared the same interests as me.
College Student,4,doesn't affect the experience at all
Freshman,2,Some professors don't show up for class and demand the students to know the material by the next class. The academic portion of the college is weak and basic! The school is very unorganized as far as online learning and the keep of the website for online learning!
Freshman,2,"Very poor administration! The school's administration is very unorganized and vulgar for dealing with the students' needs and concerns. I believe that with the right employee training, the university can establish a better way to treat the students because after all we are the ones paying them via tuition!"
Junior,2,"I took online classes and the work load was larger than that of a regular class, considering the fact that I had to basically teach myself the materials as well."
Sophomore,2,"This school is extremely low quality. I enrolled in order to avoid paying for a dorm since I live about 12 minutes away from campus. The financial aid office constantly messed up students' money and scholarships, including mine. I had several professors that taught poorly and refused to listen to simple criticism. There is a building on campus that does not have heat and keeps all stairwells locked, which is a safety hazard in case of a fire. This school receives PLENTY of money but instead of investing it into maintaining/upgrading student life, it goes into the pockets of the higher up employees. Once I began school here, my health suffered. I got constant migraines and sharp pains from stress. You would be better off not attending college than coming here. Save yourself while you can. The scenery outside the campus is very nice though."
College Freshman,2,I'm not really sure about Greek life at my school
College Freshman,2,"Since the community college is small, there is no much athletics"
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, most of the students who start a the Community College come for the financial aid, verses the promise of a good education to become a positive, contributing member of our society, and a positive mentor for others."
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, security tends to be lenient on areas where they should be far more strict, ( example: loud conversations in quiet areas.) vs. ( you see a student who has shown you their student ID yesterday, but you harass them for not having it today.)"
College Sophomore,2,"I was given the opportunity to receive Financial Aid for a few semesters, but because of one bad grade, I out of four semesters, I lost my approval."
College Sophomore,2,"I must admit that almost everything  in the school has been changing since they have reevaluated the staff. due to the new staff many things have been made available but I have not heard of any scholarships being given I certainly have not received any yet. However, I may not have been made aware of them which says something as well."
College Freshman,2,I think it is bad because we have no Greek life and many students would like the Greek life both male and female.
College Junior,2,"It has been a while since my application has been ""pending"". Not a big fan of my school when it comes to financial aid"
College Sophomore,2,The only jerseys use see on campus are those of the athletes. I'm pretty sure if we won the championship only 25% of the campus would be aware
College Freshman,2,I dont really party so Im not sure
College Junior,2,They need a better system to assist us students.
College Junior,2,It's pretty bad they don't have no Greek scholarships
College Junior,2,I AM ONLY GREEK HERE.  I can't get in Greek club even though I speak Greek better than all in club.  The Tuks girl don't like me.  I don't see no Indians like on TV I thought US have Indians but no only Indians are in IT they always study all the time and help fix my computer.  Sandeep and Rajiv can fix any computer but I can't understand anything they say.
College Junior,2,That is pool is damn cold and I don't see no Greek girls there.  I like to run campus but can't since it snow I lose my flip flops.
College Junior,2,Don't have no car so not a big issue I ride on my bike
College Sophomore,2,food here? you're better off cooking something at home and bringing it here. 
College Junior,2,Once a student has exceeded the prescribed time allotted to receive their degree; they do not qualify for financial aid without filing an appeal.
College Junior,2,It is mostly a commuter school.  There are some campus sponsored activities such as Jazz and comedy night every once in a while.
College Junior,2,The parking cost and the garage is under construction.  It is dark in the garage.  Sometimes the elevators do not work to get you upto class.
College Senior,2,I'm in the Social Work Program at UDC  which is good but there isn't alot of Teacher and the are offered once on semester which mean it takes longer to graduate.
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly blacks and Hispanics, Christians and Muslims. You shouldn't expect to get any sort of discrimination unless you are maybe a devil-worshiper or awkward-looking."
College Sophomore,2,"Most kids have a sub-college attitude. Many are not very polite, avid marijuana users, and single teen mothers. Best to keep to yourself until you find an intelligent worthwhile comrade."
College Senior,2,"UDC ranks zilch in sports, but I transferred from a super-academic school with also no sports, so that doesn't bother me. But they overspent unrealistically on appearance, so at last we have the foundation of a pretty campus to compare with everyone else in Washington.in world actuality, you just might think that fancy building is everything in the seat of world government after all, so when all politics is local after all finally gets its chance, maybe the dust will settle over that controversy. if only we would build a stadium to go with our campus at that. But the serious neglect of cutting-edge-possibility programs and the now therefore ever-so slightly behind-the-curve status of them place our graduates at critical market disadvantage, so such folly is really totally folly.We seem to have less problems with campus expansion than the others and so the future looks bright in any direction. I insist therefore as mentioned, inward. It doesn't seem as fully rounded as when I first started. But the city of Washington is its own world of activities, there is no end of ways to fit in."
College Senior,2,"This campus has two areas designated for computer use if you do not bring your own. I personally think that they should have more because, sometimes their are others waiting. network speed is good as well as the reliability."
College Freshman,2,They need to be upgraded in my opinion the buildings look old
College Junior,2,"very limited, especially for international students."
College Junior,2,"Even though UDC had many computers, majority of them were broken and when you bought your own tablet or laptop the WiFi would go out a lot. It was a hassle during Midterm and Final timea because you had to fight for a computer."
College Freshman,2,A very diverse crowd you will see  dc natives mixed in with international student and a mixture of different races. Many of UDC students look to be in their late 20s early 30s.
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife at UDC is what you make of it. It is not abundant around campus, but DC in general is a ""drinking city"", so if you hop on the train, it is easy to get to bars and clubs."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have only seen marijuana and alcohol use. Neither seem to affect the students during class.
College Junior,2,"I think there could be a more wide variety of class options. Also I have experience more than enough professors that didn't meet my expectations. The registration process is quite convenient, but then there is the problem with availability of books!"
College Junior,2,"UDC just added housing to the campus. To live in DC, you have to keep two jobs and continue to live in dangerous areas that keep us from taking night classes due to the crime level. So we thank the university for hearing our voices to get housing on campus and campus security."
College Junior,2,"The cafeteria is so-so and its very convenient when needing a fast fix for long classes, but there are a lot of fast food chains, dinners and also a grocery store right across the street. So it's much cheaper going to the grocery store than buying food from the school."
College Freshman,2,"The weather changes frequently in D.C. There have been long cold winters with little snow recently, but classes do get cancelled in the event of any type of snow warning."
College Freshman,2,"In regards top ethnicity, UDC is slightly diverse. Although the majority of the students are African-American, there are many other races/ethnicities present on campus. Also, UDC is considered a Commuter School so many students are not coming straight from high school. Many are working adults and have later in life come back to school. I do not think it is too difficult to get accepted, have decent SAT scores and  at least a C average."
College Senior,2,"The majority of students at UDC are returning students and have a different approach on their education versus students just out of high school or transfer students. Therefore there is no strictness I have seen that required necessary reinforcement of rules or regulations as far as students are concerned. The University is undergoing many changes and is going through a transition phase with a new president and many new faculty members. The rules and regulations set forth for the faculty were not being followed and affected the University's reputation and its students significantly.  With new faculty replacing old faculty, the university's policies rules and regulations are beginning to be followed."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid department is an organized in my opinion. One reason is for loss of paperwork or the deadlines can get miscommunicated to the students where sometimes they are not met. Also the division between majors is a little on organize which leads to difficulty with financial aid and if you can afford the classes you want to take .
College Junior,1,cost way to much money to park on the street
College Junior,1,EVEN I AM GREEK THIS WON'T LET ME IN.  It is not right they don't even look Greek.  I am Greek and should get Greek life scholarship.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a joke here, since its not far from the metro and the bus and its 20 dollars a day to park"
College Freshman,1,The guys here are older generally either a transfer or just older. Not alot of cute guys in my opinion but to each is own.
College Junior,1,Very small amount offered and international students are not eligible to apply.
College Senior,1,"In my thoughts, the permit parking of UDC are high. and in some instances, the paid parking is full so the students that pay still have to find parking on the streets. Because CCDC is located in a high traffic area, it Is extremely difficult to find parking. Sometimes you may luck up and catch someone coming out of a space. Even in those cases, their are meters and of course meter readers. I have heard lots of students complaining about receiving thousands of dollars in parking tickets."
College Freshman,1,UDC consists of old outdated buildings and technology. The admissions office and financial aid office is a joke. Use this as a stepping stone I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Students are mainly older and there isn't much school spirit here.
College Freshman,1,The campus is dead most people go to class and then leave. There are no dorms so every one lives off campus and most student are adult in their early 30s with jobs and families.
College Junior,1,"I choose to live off-campus. The housing department was not very helpful in finding alternatives. They have a block of ""apartments"" inside of an apartment complex that they ""rent out"" for students. The cost of housing is also quite expensive for what they are offering. You pay $4200 per semester which includes 3 other roommates (you share a bedroom with another person) and no dining plan. Cleanliness depends on the people you live with. You could be placed with neat freaks or you could be placed with party junkies. You never really know until you get placed. Depending on which campus your classes are located, your commute could be quite costly. For $4200 per semester, you could find a two bedroom apartment (you have your own room and personal space and pick your roommate), pay all utilities, go grocery shopping, do laundry, and have change left over."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus dining at UDC is terrible. There are no healthy options. It is poor quality cafeteria style food. I tried to eat there once, but was put off by the lack of anything resembling fresh food."
College Senior,1,"One main parking lot that is reserved for handicapped parking and faculty. We used to be able to rent/buy spots, but now it's just for handicapped and faculty."
College Junior,1,"Although you are accepted to obatain financial aid,the process is horrific. The financial aid office is a nightmare. They are not organized when it comes to locating confidencial paperwork.It's an inconvienvce to someone who is a full-time mother and employee. I'm always hoping that they will upgrade their current system of properly handling student accounts."
College Freshman,1,TOO DAMN HIGH – WE ALREADY PAYING FOR EVERYTHING ELSE AND WITH THE LACK OF SECURITY PRESENCE THEY SHOULD PAY STUDENTS 2 PARK NEAR THE CAMPUS.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid process is the worst! Please don't send anything buy mail, and if you do make sure you staple all your documents together. The people who are working there have a tendency of getting too caught up that they tend to lose stuff. Although they are nice and show respect, it doesn't help the fact that they will argue you down for stating you never turned in a document. Also, there is no explanation on how about getting these documents. It's a painful process but the job gets done. The best thing to do is turn everything in yourself, and thoroughly check in for your status."
College Student,1,"THE NIGHTLIFE AT UDC IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT, SINCE IT IS A COMMUTER SCHOOL STUDENTS DON'T REALLY SOCIALIZE WITH ONE ANOTHER OUTSIDE OF CLASSES.  BUT SINCE UDC IS SO CLOSE TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY , AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, AND GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY MOST UDC STUDENTS JUST CRASH THEIR EVENTS/PARTIES."
College Student,1,SINCE UDC IS A COMMUTER SCHOOL NOT MANY STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. WALKING AROUND CAMPUS YOU WILL SEE THAT ONE LONELY ZETA OR Q TRYING TO INSPIRE OTHERS TO PLEDGE BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS NO GREEK SCENE ON THIS CAMPUS
College Student,1,they are very slow and not up to date dell computers
College Student,1,Rent is very high. many places to live only if you have the money to pay for it.
College Student,1,"One building is available and it is Off-Campus. availability is on a first come first serve basis. Athletes and ""lucky"" students are usually using that building. Most students live at home or have own home with roommates or alone."

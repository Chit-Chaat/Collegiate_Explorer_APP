Alum,5,MUSC was a great school to attend. They are very invested in your learning and want you to be successful as a student. The learning environment is great and they will teach through different strategies to help engage students more. Professors made learning fun and enjoyable.
Alum,5,"The school is a criminal enterprise.  They give certain students the actual tests for the upcoming exams.  Many of the professors use different grading schemes.  I mentioned this to the school officials that it was not fair.   If you report cheating or unfair treatment, the faculty will give you Fs in all of your subjecting grading classes and have a vote to dismiss you for exhibiting characteristics which seem inappropriate.  They did this to me, but  I still finished the semester with a B average.  They deny students of their constitutional rights of due process of law.  The local judges in South Carolina are corrupt!  The school likes pretty white women and children of doctors, using different grading scheme and allowing them to cheat."
Graduate Student,5,"I'm a long distance student so I really love the professors. The professors are always willing to help, they are easily accessible, and they respond to questions/concerns right away."
College Senior,5,The quality of education is impeccable at MUSC.
College Sophomore,5,"As a student coming from Johns Hopkins, I feel this institution is comparable on several different levels. There are a lot of fellowship opportunities after graduation as well as direct job placement in many, many different fields of healthcare."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are knowledgeable and enthuastic about what they teach, the class sizes are appropriate as are the actual courses needed."
College Sophomore,5,"As a medical university, MUSC has the concern for their students and faculty at the top of their priority list."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not officially began classes yet, but so far I have had excellent interactions with the professors, academic advisers, current students in my program, and everybody in between. I would choose MUSC over again 100 times if I could. I thought the application process was fair beginning with the standard application, to the in person interview and receiving acceptance."
College Sophomore,5,"My institution does not have official sport teams (such as D1, D2 and D3), however there are many sporting events scheduled for students to take part off. We have a state of the art athletic facility as well."
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel as if every class that I have had thus far is preparing me for my future as an Occupational Therapist. I have heard similar testimonies from other programs and colleges. I believe the academics at MUSC to be top notch.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors in the College of Health Professions are excellent. They not only have theoretical knowledge, but also practical knowledge and are very capable of instructing students. Every professor that I have had has had an open door policy when it comes to asking questions or going to their offices and are more than willing to help students. Overall, they create a very supportive environment in which to learn."
Recent Alumnus,5,The College of Health Professions at MUSC is excellent. The faculty truly wants each and every student to succeed and eventually become a health care professional. It is a wonderful environment to learn.
College Senior,5,MUSC has a great total package that includes top-tier level scientific training in a beautiful city.
College Senior,5,The school makes considerable effort and provides services for Health and safety.

College Sophomore,5,I applied and was accepted into the accelerated BSN program.  The process was smooth and fast.  No problems whatsoever.
College Junior,5,Charleston is one of a kind.  Such a unique city with many medical professionals.
College Junior,5,Computer labs are awesome.  Equipped with both MAC and Windows.
Niche User,4,Location is beautiful in downtown Charleston.  Might high crime rate and parking is painful.  Lack of parking and flooding when it rains.
College Senior,4,Safety is fine on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Encouraging and accepting diversity is a major emphasis at MUSC.
College Sophomore,4,"As a major working hospital, MUSC takes security on campus seriously.  Most of law enforcement in SC has ties to MUSC somehow, and so any security threats will be taken seriously and dealt with seriously."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a fairly new student to this school, so there's limits to what I can say definitely.  However, my experience so far has been very positive.  The academics are definitely tough, but I can already see how what they're teaching is preparing me to work as a licensed medical professional in the future."
College Sophomore,4,"here and there, but not everywhere."
College Student,4,"Its a fantastic school, I was offered a personal tour and everyone seemed happy to answer any questions I had"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Past classes have been very successful in securing jobs after graduation, with many of them having job offers even before graduation."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Within the hospital itself there have been cases of petty theft; however, this is rare in classroom buildings. In addition, it is difficult to go anywhere without seeing security as it is not only a university, but also a hospital. I have always felt very safe on campus, even when there after dark. Campus security is ready and willing to walk/drive me to my car if it gets too late."
College Senior,4,MUSC is preparing me well. It will be up to me and a little luck in the next level of my career
College Junior,4,"The campus resides in one on Americas oldest cities. There is a plethora of interesting historical sites throughout the city and visiting the beach is a cheap (very important) source of entertainment. The academics are very technologically advanced; every class features recorded lectures and smart boards, which provided to be a helpful study tool."
College Junior,4,Its a very diverse group of people.
College Junior,4,"Its surrounded by the city and connected to the hospital so of course there are non-students or faculty on campus all the time, but for the most part its very safe. The campus safety is always around"
College Junior,4,It's excellent for gaining experience
College Junior,4,No one really uses drugs that I'm aware of.
College Junior,4,there's always something to do or something going on in charleston.
College Junior,4,So as far as I know the only college at MUSC with fraternities is the Dental School. Their parties are always pretty awesome.
College Junior,4,"It's great to be in downtown Charleston, and I love the experience I'm getting with research. The cost of living here though it quite high."
College Junior,4,It's location. It's right in downtown Charleston  - there's something always going on.
College Junior,4,I live in Mt. Pleasant and am able to utilize transportation to get to lecture. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather does not affect the campus experience very often, but when it does, it is because of a flood.  The worst part about the rain is that we have to take shuttles to the parking lot and wait outside in the rain."
Niche User,1,"When I was a student there, the school allowed some of the students to have the actual test exams without making them available to the class as a whole. Some of the teachers had a funny grading curve. The would take students who made Fs and give them a better grade than mine. When I went to the assistant dean and dean and voiced my concern about what was going on, even having finished the semester with a gpa of a 2.87 I got voted out of school for having characteristics which seem inappropriate, violating my free speech and due process rights. The school informed me this is their protocol.
Hang out with the teacher assistants and you can get the actual text exams. Do not study. Make Fs in all of your major science courses and they will give you great passing grades. Also become good friends with someone whose parents have graduated from the college because there is a chance he knows the system and he will be making Fs."
College Senior,1,"We dont have greek life at my university,"

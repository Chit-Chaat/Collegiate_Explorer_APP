Junior,5,It has been great so far! I have met some great peers and teachers that are very kind and willing to help us along the way!
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes, but Biola switched from Blackboard to Canvas in my junior year. Most professors adapted well."
Junior,5,"I have never attended a school where I have felt more at home than at Biola University. The education is wonderful, the community has become like a family to me, and the Jesus culture is astounding. The professors actually care about your well-being, check up on your real-life situations, and pray for you. The friends I have met here will last a lifetime. Biola has helped me grow to become excited to go to class and see what I can learn for the day. I am a better person because of Biola University."
Sophomore,5,"Biola University is a Christian-based community. If you are Christian, you will definitely enjoy time at Biola. There are many clubs and events that you can attend to make friends. The community in Biola is tight so once you find a group, you will have an amazing time. Food in the cafeteria is average. There are three cafes on campus. There are many restaurants outside of the campus. Professors are supportive and kind. They reach out to us and support us. Classes are small, about 15 students in one class, so it can be better learning environment for many people."
Junior,5,"Biola is a perfect, small University within a small city in Los Angels. Professors and faculty truly care about their students. I feel as if there's such positive atmosphere around campus, you can't help but feel motivated and encouraged by others. The campus is also absolutely beautifu!"
Junior,5,"Biola's online classes are very manageable. They provide videos for online lectures with plenty of flexible time to complete assignments. Professors include video conference calls to engage students, which I felt was great. Online classes run very easy and smooth."
Sophomore,5,"Biola University is my home. Ever since I first set foot on the campus I knew, that it was where I was supposed to be. From the students to the ""staff"", to the buildings, everything screams love. I've never been somewhere that no matter where you go, you can get a hug and a smile from simply asking. Biola is truly the most loving community, and I am honored to be apart of it."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience with Biola has been amazing. At the start of Covid-19 when everything went online, my professors were amazing, and understanding. Every assignment was easy to get to and the lessons were perfectly laid out. My professors never felt out of reach, even if they were. They always made sure their students could reach them if needed."
Senior,5,I like the fact that both secular and biblical viewpoints are discussed in a way that helps students form a more cumulative worldview all for the benefit of those around us and for the glory of God.
Sophomore,5,They made the transition into online learning very easy and helpful due to the Corona Virus making school close early.
Senior,5,Classes online were not hard to navigate through. Many resources were there to help students adjust to online classes and professors and ta's were quick to respond and there to help.
Senior,5,"Professors, students, and staffs are so kind. The professors really care for each and every one of their students. The campus and facilities are clean."
Junior,5,"Biola has changed my life. I transferred from CSUF, and while CSUF is a great university, Biola is something truly special. 
First, the presence of the Holy Spirit is so prominent. As soon as I stepped onto the campus I knew thag is where I was meant to be. 
The colleges are so nice and beautifully made. The professors are kind, genuine, and challenge everyone to pursue the Lord with everything inside of them. They grant grace in times of difficulty, and extend prayers in the hard and not-so-hard times. This university has equipped me for my future passion so well. And it has given me some of the closest friends I could ask for. 
If you’re thinking about going to Biola University, do it. Pray about it, and watch the Lord navigate that journey for you."
Senior,5,"Biola has a warm, welcoming community of students and professors. I've been encouraged to grow so much during my time at Biola–not only in academics, but in character and spiritually as well. High-quality work is expected in classes, but professors are all there for you when you need help and actually care about you personally."
Senior,5,I've taken one online class. It was very organized and well designed. I learned a lot and enjoyed the experience.
Senior,5,"They were quick to keep students updated on changes made due to COVID-19 while keeping the best-interest of the students and their health in mind. Each faculty member was assigned 3 students to check on and pray for in the midst of so many transitions and graduating seniors were celebrated with special boxes to commemorate their time at Biola. In particular, the nursing faculty was dedicated to helping my class graduate while keeping in mind the requirements from the Board of Registered Nurses and the changes made due to COVID-19."
Sophomore,5,Biola is such an amazing school! It is very Christ-centered and the staff strives to love each and everyone of their students.
Senior,5,"I am about to graduate.  So disappointed about the Covid19 cancelling everything. I have made so many great friends here, grown in my faith, served, went on mission trips that were amazing! I am thankful that I only have $15K debt which I should be able to pay back quickly when the state opens up.  I really enjoyed the Torrey Honors program as it helped me read books that shaped Western Civilization.  Recommend Torrey to people who like to read and learn in community.  Praying for Covid19 to end soon! Loved my professors as they cared about me as an individual and shared their personal walk with God as they taught the material."
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my experience with Biola so far, the staff is very friendly and reliable and I look forward to continuing my education with them."
Niche User,5,"I stayed in my cousin's dorm at Biola when I was young and  got my first peek at how loving, affectionate, and accepting Biola's community is. Everyone at Biola is incredibly happy-go-lucky and you can feel their warm charm from miles away. Common misconceptions about Biola are that its people are not social or fun but you will see that both of those misconception COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. Biola is the sweetest community of people I've had the pleasure of being around. :)"
Sophomore,5,"I love Biola. I originally really did not want to come here because it was a small Christian university, but now these are the very reasons I love it here. The Bible classes teach you so much about the Bible and its context. (w/out them I would be very naive on the bigger picture of the Bible). The community is so strong and the students are generally pretty decent people. It is not like high school where students try really hard to dress up to par and look cool as nobody cares and we're pretty kicked back. Students don't judge either. Chapels are actually good for social life (and spiritual life) and the workload is manageable. The faculty and professors are so caring about students and want us to grow closer to God and do well academically. But it's not like you think you're pious just because you go to Biola- you still have independent thought as you need to make your faith your own and obey God because you choose to, independent of the school.  I would definitely recommend Biola."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Biola nearly 30 years ago and have found the the education that I received prepared me exceptionally well for all aspects of both my professional and personal life.  The school blends faith, research, and learning In a well-balanced manner."
Niche User,5,I loved the Christ centered community at this university. All the faculty and students were warm and excited to be there. The cafeteria was clean and had lots of options to choose from. The campus was beautiful and well kept.
Niche User,5,The overall atmosphere of Biola University is welcoming and they are enthusiastic about serving the LORD
Niche User,5,I have taken 2 tours there and have experienced an overnight trip and it was a blast. Everyone was so nice and encouraging. I really am excited to attend there in the future.
Sophomore,5,"Being in the Cinema and Media Arts Program here at Biola, I definitely feel that we are up and coming, One day being up there with USC, Chapman, Loyola.  Millions of dollars of equipment at our fingertips from day one while also growing closer to Christ."
Alum,5,Biola provided a very welcoming and supportive environment in which to get a college education.  All classes are taught in a manner that allows you to integrate faith and learning.  It provides a great foundation for students on which to build their careers.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and the community. Everyone is super friendly and inviting. You are able to be yourself in a judgement free environment. You are able to practice your religion.
Freshman,5,"Biola University has already become a home to me, even after just a few weeks here on campus. The professors and fellow students are all wonderful. The focus on our shared faith in Christ is amazing to experience, and something I can only recommend."
Niche User,5,"My dad was a Biola transfer student for half a year. They have excellent food, excellent professors, is located in a suitable place. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people."
Sophomore,5,Biola is a Christian University that really walks the walk when it comes to true commitment to their values and solid Christian doctrine. I have grown in my faith exponentially since beginning here at Biola and its amazing to see how my life has changed because of this school.  I chose this university over UCLA and Cal Poly Slo and I am incredibly glad I did. There isn't one doubt in my mind that I made the right decision.
Sophomore,5,Biola is an amazing university that provides a unique faith-based college experience. This university provides so many opportunities to its students and does a great job of creating strong community among the students and faculty.
Sophomore,5,"Biola University is a really great private school even though it is pretty expensive. The professors are easy to talk to and there are tons of beautiful study/hangout spots all over campus. The surrounding neighborhood gives a suburban despite being so close to Los Angeles. Additionally, the security makes students feel safe to wander campus any time of day. It is easy for students to get a part-time job on campus, and there are plenty of clubs and activities in which to get involved. Some dorms are better than others but usually it is not difficult to switch. The cafeteria does offer some vegan options but there is not always a lot of variety and these dishes tend to run out fairly quickly if you come to eat during a busy time."
Alum,5,Biola University is a really excellent college. Its academic excellence combined with its Christian focus are all that they say they are. The Torrey Honors Institute is incredible - I couldn't recommend it enough.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are really caring and helpful, they care about their students and how to help them be their best student. The campus is small enough that there is a great community and the dorms also have a great sense of community."
Freshman,5,"The community is like no other, I just finished my first year at Biola University and I can tell you that life will never be the same after being there. I've loved every minute of my attendance and promise that to any newcomer that is considering Biola as a place that they want to further their education. The campus is on the smaller side but that just encourages the intimacy between friendships. The professors are very student oriented, they love what they are doing and are passionate about their students' education. The diversity is impeccable. There are students from so many different countries, there are clubs and events dedicated towards making them feel at home. Biola has an excellent Campus Safety program designed to keep its students safe even while walking around at night. There has not been one moment that I have felt violated or unsafe on this campus. Overall I love this place and wish with every bone in my body that I will be able to return for my second year!"
Junior,5,This is my second trimester as an online student and the encouragement and engagement of the faculty has made this journey easy to manage.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Biola University so far has been just amazing. I would highly recommend this school to anyone. Biola takes academics very seriously and encourages all students to excel in their field of study. In addition, the faculty genuinely care for each student. Whether it is inviting the class to their home to celebrate Easter with their family, or taking time to listen to or pray individually with students, the faculty truly go above and beyond and make the students feel so loved. Everyone is loving and caring and shares the love of Christ with everyone they meet. Attending Biola has impacted my life in ways I could have never imagined."
Sophomore,5,"Biola is excellent!  It's paving the way for Christianity and the spreading of the gospel.  The integrity of the school is found in every aspect from the the teachers, to the students, and to the classes that are offered."
Alum,5,"I attended Biola all four years and loved it! Biola has the friendliest environment and staff. The professors at Biola really care about their students and will make time outside of class to meet with them and help them. The course work is just as hard as any other university, in my opinion. The grading is fair. Biola is a medium sized campus and not over-populated. I was a psychology major and loved their program. It was rigorous but I learned so much and genuinely enjoyed my classes. Most Biola students are Christian and very kind and considerate. Students aren't overly competitive academically and are willing to help each other. The only down side about Biola is that it is very expensive since it's a private university, but I would say that it is worth the money considering the good education, community, and influence you get here."
Freshman,5,"I love the professors and the people on this campus. One thing I would change, would be to add more eateries on campus."
Niche User,5,The community and Christian environment are great! People are very considerate and respectful. The campus is beautiful. Food at Biola is amazing! Had a really fun visit!
Alum,5,"Biola University is a great place to develop oneself professional, academically, and as a Christian. Truly caring professors and intimately sized classes offer an amazing educational experience."
Freshman,5,"So far, I really love Biola. The people are always so kind and the professors truly care about what they teach and how they teach it. It’s really a beautiful environment to be a part of."
Niche User,5,Biola has a beautiful campus and has amazing teachers who truly care about the students. Everyone is so friendly and the church requirements are easily attainable.
Alum,5,"Great university to attend, grew up in the neighborhood and never thought I would attend. After viewing their programs I decided to attend and it was such a formative time there."
Niche User,5,"Biola is such a warm-hearted university. My older sister attends there and every time I visit, the school never ceases to surprise me. The students there are very hospitable and friendly. Instead of feeling intimidated, I felt comfortable because of the school's environment."
Freshman,5,"It's amazing to find a school like this in LA. It's so Christ-Centered and the campus is beautiful. The community is so close and accepting of everything, you never feel out of place when you are walking around here. All the dorms are top quality and the staff is always a pleasure to interact with. Also, it's far enough away from the city to avoid heavy traffic but close enough that a day trip isn't out of the question."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Biola! The business school is top-notch and definitely prepares you for a full-time job. The GenEd classes are high quality, and anyone looking for a Christian education will be impressed by the level of quality in the theology department. The size is just right and the campus is very pretty. The dorms are comfy, and people are very friendly. Overall, a great place!"
Niche User,5,"The tight-knit community is the best part of Biola. Students genuinely care about each other and in many cases, they go out of their way to connect with people and form lasting friendships. The school is pretty small, but that just gives you more opportunities to get to know everyone better. People who don't go to Biola have a lot of respect for it and highly esteem its reputation. On Campus, I spend a lot of time in the dorm lobbies doing homework, cooking, or talking to people. La Mirada is by no means a college town. It is very family oriented because it is next to Disney Land and Knott's Berry Farm. A lot of people like to get season passes to the theme parks and hang out there on the weekends. Personally, I prefer going to the beach and surfing. The school administration is very approachable, easy to contact, and extremely helpful. I have never gotten the run round here. All information is direct and easily available."
Freshman,5,"Biola University provides a high quality liberal arts education that integrates Christian truth into every aspect of life.  Biola has helped me grow academically, spiritually, and relationally in its wonderful community.  The staff and faculty there genuinely care about their students, and the students are very friendly.  There are also many opportunities at Biola for growth and exploration, such as internships, clubs, company visits, on-campus jobs, and so much more."
Niche User,5,"As far as I know, Biola is the best Christian university. The professors and the students makes you feel welcomed and comfortable."
Freshman,5,"Biola university is a place where community flourishes, professors and staff invest in you and you get a good education. People are welcoming and loving. Professors truly want to help you and get to you know you. Biola prioritizes faith and academics making each student well rounded to impact the world for our Lord Jesus Christ"
Junior,5,Biola has helped me grow spiritually and professionally. Professorts genuinly care about your personal and academic life; they want to see you succeed in every area of your life. At Biola I feel loved and motivated to achieve my goals!
Senior,5,"Great community atmosphere. I appreciate that Biola doesn't waver in their foundational beliefs and that the faculty genuinely care for their students, both academically and personally."
Niche User,5,Really great campus with really friendly students and staff. They have a really nice astro-turf soccer field and track to work out on.
Sophomore,5,Biola is an absolutely amazing school. I have loved it so much. I will say that the nursing program has been great so far. The facilities are top of the line and I have not seen one with a better skills lab. The professors genuinely want what is best for you and they are very willing to help you learn. The life on campus is great and there are tons of fun things to get involved in. I have loved Biola thus far. I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who is looking for a school.
Niche User,5,I had a great time visiting. It was a really cool campus. The whole school is focused on community which is really important to me.
Alum,5,Biola has changed my life for the better. I was able to double-major and still graduate within 4 years and Magna Cum Laude. The professors really care about who you are and what you want to do. They will help you in every way possible
Junior,5,This school is amazing! The faculty really cares about you and it feels safe to go to a school where you know you are cared for. Not only that but the amount of freedom you get to praise God with no judgment. You gain knowledge of education in the field you're interested in and are taught about God.
Alum,4,"My professors reached out to me regularly to check in with me. They also made exceptions for the time difference, so I could watch lectures instead of logging in and participating in a class at a specific time."
Alum,4,Biola is a strong Christian university that trains students to think biblically about everything. The professors are great and a lot of the students are too. I really enjoyed a lot of my classes.
Junior,4,"Sometimes confusing, but mostly getting better. Some of the teachers were still not trained enough using the new online platform, but it is understandable. Teachers are still trying hard to solve the problems that we have regarding to online learning."
Alum,4,"At least at the time of my enrollment between 2011-2015, Biola was a predominantly white, conservative school. Its academics are rigorous and its student life is full of events, but administration and students (to a lesser extent) were not prepared for much in the way of ""progressive"" thinking that challenged their evangelical worldviews."
Junior,4,"It has been a little more difficult to find the community that Biola offers by doing school online, however the professors go above and beyond to make sure you feel welcomed and heard. The programs used, Canvas and Zoom, offer a clear way of teaching/learning for both professors and students. It is very easy to navigate though the University's websites and find what you are looking for."
Sophomore,4,Online learning experience with Biola University was pretty good. Professors tried hard to change their teaching styles due to the instant change to the remote class. There was still some disorganization with announcements and tests but the professor worked hard to make sure that there are no problems.
Senior,4,"Although the switch from in-person classes to online learning was a bit abrupt, I would say that our teachers and staff handled the transition very well. Shout out to the administration and everyone who played a role in making the online courses effective."
Sophomore,4,very relaxing and great professors that want to see you succeed. Great resources and easy to understand. Community is also very kind and open.
Junior,4,"Since, covid-19, and all the classes were switched to online, Biola has done an excellent job in ensuring that the students were learning as best as possible. So many teaches were accepting, gracious, and understanding as we made this transition together. They did their best to have discussion group, office hours, and lectures. It wasn’t the worst experience thanks to Biola’s diligence."
Senior,4,"Biola University accommodated to meet the learning needs of it's students. As a nursing major, community clinical activities were changed to do online partnerships with organizations helping to fight COVID-19. The requirements were changed to help make things more manageable for my class and our situations were evaluated on an individual basis."
Alum,4,"Biola University offers incredible academics and a thorough Music Conservatory for their undergraduate degrees. They challenge their students to think Biblically about everything, through the eyes of love and wisdom rather than exclusivity or judgement. Their music program is staffed by industry professionals still practicing their craft, and therefore are able to offer hands-on, real-world experience and thoughtful, relevant discussions on current issues facing the music industry. The professors in all classes, including your Bible and general education courses, genuinely care about their students. The campuses strict no-drinking policy among undergraduates, though highly disputed among the student population, adds a level of focus and safety to the campus that I very much appreciated in my time there. The only downside to the campus is the quality of food, and lack of strong diversity on campus. The food wasn't atrocious, but I often opted for homemade food."
Alum,4,Biola provides a quality education and college experience. The professors are intentional and desire to see students succeed. There is a high value on community and student life which they excel in fostering. The classes were informative and you receive a well rounded liberal arts education.
Sophomore,4,Biola is an incredible university with a community that will help and support students thrive both academically and spiritually.
Freshman,4,Biola is a spiritually rooted Christian college dedicated to its students and their walk with God. The campus is beautiful and the Caf is pretty good. The dorms are nice & the professors are very thoughtful. It is quite expensive unfortunately.
Sophomore,4,I like Biola a lot! I enjoy all my professors and feel known by them. I also think we have a lot of good events and clubs to get involved in. The safety is very very good. I have never felt unsafe walking around campus at night which is such an important aspect of college. I like Biola a lot!
Alum,4,"Biola was the best! Lots of hands on learning with a 14:1 ratio in the classroom. Able to grow alongside each other and really get to know the professors. Working on campus was great too. As an employee and a student, you really felt empowered!"
Senior,4,"Biola has opened many doors for me in terms of networking and relationships with professors that I would have not had at other schools. With their faith based community, I was able to be open and communicate honest ideas pertaining to my field, which allowed my studies to be more in depth."
Freshman,4,"I love Biola! The people are fantastic and the professors are really great. Biola makes it easy for you to get involved and also to be prepared for the work force once you leave. Be warned though, the cafeteria is awful"
Sophomore,4,"I really love the community atmosphere; very lovely campus to study at and the people are generally very nice and easy to get along with. I believe, that like every other campus, there are good and bad things but overall this is a very protected environment and easy to learn at and be myself in."
Freshman,4,It's been pretty good so far. The community is good and the Torrey program is kinda neat I guess. Besides this person named Morgan who seems like a very bad influence.
Senior,4,"What I love about Biola is the integration of faith and learning. You really do get a biblical perspective on everything while still being encouraged to pursue honest conversations. What I would like to see change is for student life to be a lot more inclusive. I think we've made great strides towards that, but more effort from the students who are given power would be all the more helpful."
Freshman,4,it feels so welcoming. There is a friendly environment and it really helps you feel connected to God.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Biola is an amazing University. The community is wonderful and everyone is so kind and welcoming. It does, of course, have some of your common college problems, the food could be better. However, nowhere is perfect! And in my opinion, Biola gets pretty close."
Senior,4,"A wonderful private, Christian school. The faculty is gracious, loving, and facilitates student learning well. The nursing program is longer than most, so apply as soon as possible. It is possible to graduate in 4 years!"
Niche User,4,"A great Christian school locates in LA. A beautiful campus. Faculty, staff, and students are friendly and welcoming. They make you feel welcomed. Academically superb. Professors care about students and their students and how they are doing academically."
Sophomore,4,I’m really happy with my choice of going to Biola! The level of excellence everything is done with still blows me away. And there is really no better place to find community with like-minded peers and faculty that help you grow and push you toward your dreams!
Junior,4,"Biola is a biblically sound university. The campus is great, and the academics are even better. I love going to a school where each professor knows me by name and cares about me"
Senior,4,"Biola is a very friendly school, full of Christian learning and values. I would not recommend coming here unless you are someone who wants to be in a Christian environment i.e. no smoking/drinking/sex, chapels, separate male/female facilities, Bible minor. Biola is a great school, but it does not challenge you in your faith unless you look for it. Talbot, the Theological Department is narrow-minded and does not challenge you. I recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and allowing yourself to take full advantage of the school. Also, the Nursing program here is pretty phenomenal! Beautiful school and kind people."
Junior,4,"Professors here really care about their students. They genuinely want to see students learn and succeed. They are willing to help you outside of just their class as well. For example, my stats teacher said she'd be willing to get coffee with any of us if we wanted to talk, and I was able to go to my theology professor to seek relationship guidance during his office hours. While attending here, my faith has grown so much as I learn more and more about God through classes and chapels. One drawback, however, is that fellow students can be fake oftentimes. There is a sort of delusion that since we're all Christian, we can all be friends, but, for me, I'd rather have fewer but more meaningful relationships."
Niche User,4,"Good University. Everyone on campus is very nice. It is a Godly place that really helps strengthen knowledge about God. Some of the Professors on campus are not the best though, especially in the science department. Since it is such a small school, there are not very many options for different science professors. Definitely check on rate my professor before picking your professors. It really is helpful!"
Junior,4,Biola upholds it’s mission statement and is really striving for racial reconciliation and to share how Christianity and social justice complement and support each other.
Junior,4,The Teachers are very passionate in being able to help the students achieve their higher education while also providing for their students spiritual needs. I would recommend that students spend time with their professors here as they give great insight into many matters of school and life.
Freshman,4,"Throughout the college application season, Biola has been a source of unwavering support and kindness. The admissions office goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and consistently reaches out to you to help make your life easier. From admission to committing, Biola has made me feel at home on campus and within the classes."
Niche User,4,This school is very welcoming to admitted students. They really try to make clear what they offer and what a student can expect when they attend there. The spiritual climate is solid and the dining center is fantastic.
Alum,4,"Friendly people. Good location in Southern California. Great campus life. Strongly religious. No greek life, so social group revolves around dorm life, sports and clubs."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I am certain that I choosing to attend Biola University is one of the best decisions I have made. Not only was I able to find a great sense of community, people whom I can grow in Christ with - something no other Christian campus can do. With Biola being a rather small campus compared to colleges across the nation, it helps you get closer to peers around you."
Senior,4,I have good and poor experiences at Biola. I have had amazing and terrible professors. I have learned a lot in some classes and hardly anything in others. There isn't much uniformity when it comes to academics. But over all I was very in love with my major - fell out of love with Torrey big time. In terms of student life it's fine - I'm just not a very social person so it's hard to gauge this for me.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy how students are able to go to chapel and how we are able to participate in conferences that help us grow in our faith. The food is different than I'm used to, but the food being different gives me the opportunity to try new foods. I also enjoy how the professors and other members of the faculty are Christians."
Junior,4,"I love this college. It is a very academically challenging institution that puts God at the front of it all. As a Christian, this is the type of learning that I aspire to have. One that it geared towards the improvement of the next generations through God’s Word. It also helps with growing my faith immensely. At my previous university before I transferred, I kept my faith very sheltered. I didn't live out my Christianity the way I should because I was scared. Here at Biola, I am surrounded by other believers who are on the same journey as I am, and it is really comforting. Although it is a smaller university, there are still may ways to get involved on campus. I am apart of a few groups on campus and I love the community that comes with it."
Sophomore,4,Biola is an amazing place to study your desired field of work as well as grow a deeper understanding of God.
Junior,4,Biola  University is a small Christian private college and has a great community and campus for people who want to continue learning about God and want to continue to grow in a community with similar beliefs. Biola has done a great job in equipping young Christians to live life with God beyond this Christian campus.
Senior,4,"I have attended Biola for three years now. I am certainly not happy about the price of school but because I'm almost done with my college career, I'm trucking through. I'm graduating early, thankfully.

Academics are decent. Professors really care about what you do and how you do in their classes. They can also get you in contact with anyone and everyone (you just have to know the right people). The location is safe and campus safety does an amazing job of keeping everyone safe. Dorms and housing is good, plenty of room for you and your roommate(s). Meals leave something to be desired of especially after you eat chicken five days in a row. 

Parties are different. While everyone is technically under contract to not do drugs/drink/smoke, residence halls have their bi-semesterly all-halls where you can eat a whole bunch of food, hang out and play games. If you're into something more, there's plenty of parties of-campus to go to. Just have to have the hook-ups."
Junior,4,Biola is a school truly centered around the integration of faith into one's major. The people are truly kind and you can feel the Holy Spirit on campus. There is many communities everywhere one looks and lots to do on and around campus. Biola is definitely the school to attend if you are looking to learn more about God and experience all that SoCal has to offer!
Alum,4,"Biola is a very tight knit community....once you are able to find your niche. People are friendly in general and have the commonality of a shared faith. Professors are really great, knowledgeable, and available to students. some even go out of their way and invite the class to have dinner in their homes. Biola is working on diversity."
Freshman,4,"Biola is a great place to go to school, to learn more about myself and God, and to discovery people similar and different to me."
Niche User,4,"Surrounded by the kindest, most welcoming, and most faithful students, Biola University is the change of atmosphere our world needs. When you walk through the gates of the beautiful grounds of this University in the home of the brightest state, sunny California, you have stepped into a united environment. The people that live and work in this college are people who are both intellectual and extremely talented. Their lives have been prioritized to spreading the love of God and sharing their gifts to those around them. The only flaw visible is that this colleges does not receive the recognition it deserves."
Senior,4,Biola is a great school for those looking to rigorously study the Bible as well as their intended field of study. Be ready to grow in your faith as well as your academics as you are challenged by caring faculty to expand your thinking. Expect chapel and Bible class requirements. People are typically kind however it can take some time to make deeper relationships.
Sophomore,4,"Biola has a great, community of students and faculty who want to glorify God. It does not have a very diverse population, but the effort to change this issue has been evident throughout my time here.  "
Junior,4,"I love the people, dorm life and professors here! So far, I have taken Bible courses such as Theology, New testament and Spiritual Formation, where I've had the unique opportunity to integrate my faith with my academic learning. Also my favorite part of the year is Missions Conference, where thousands of people come to Biola's campus to learn about missions, different cultures and to meet missionaries from every end of the Earth. Biola has provided me with a college experience that has nurtured and cultivated me as a person - something that I value much more than partying every weekend, like other universities promote. "
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed the majority of the professors that I have had. Sure there are some professors that I did not understand or could not really relate to their teaching methods, but for the most part, the professors have proved to be very interested in the students and prove to really care about the students success in their courses."
College Sophomore,4,There are always wonderful opportunities that my campus offers to students for jobs or internships. I always receive emails for events for job fairs on campus.
College Sophomore,4,My campus takes students safety and security very seriously. Campus security is constantly emailing the students when planning certain drill to enhance our safety and they are always around campus keeping the students safe. I am very thankful for the safety that I am given at my university.
College Sophomore,4,"I currently do not live in campus, but I have been inside the dorm rooms and met with the students who live on campus and everyone is always friendly and helpful in the dorm community."
College Sophomore,4,I always enjoy attending sports games and matches to support my school and cheer on my colleagues. The athletes at my school are hard working and driven to do their very best and to always give glory to God in every match or game they play whether they win or lose.
College Sophomore,4,I would choose my school again because it has been a perfect fit for me. Attending my university for the past year has opened my eyes to a whole new perspective on life and has taught me that there is so much more to life than what I was used to. College has been a huge stepping stone towards achieving my goals to attend graduate school and begin my career. I am so thankful for the opportunity to attend a university that encourages me to go above and beyond and to never stop reaching for my goals no matter what life throws my way.
College Sophomore,4,Love my dorm! A bit pricey though
College Sophomore,4,I'm a part of the Women's soccer team and we have the best fans :)
College Sophomore,4,"I love the relationships I  have made at Biola, I have made some of my best of friends here."
College Student,4,Everybody at the school was so friendly and I met my second family at this school
College Freshman,4,I appreciate my Resident Advisors and their efforts to maintain a close-knit community of girls on my floor.
Senior,2,"Overall, I would say that Biola is massively overrated and not at all worth the money spent to go here. While getting a Christian education is important, I don't feel as though my faith has grown but instead have only seen a lot of fake Christians presenting it. Classes are much harder to prove that they are a ""good private Christian school."" Overall community and people you meet are fake making it hard to fit in. At the same time, there were some valuable classes and some very select special people that you meet here. But overall, not at all worth the $120,000 (and growing tuition) that you will end up going in debt for."
Senior,2,"This school is slowing becoming a disaster. For a school that claims to “think biblically about everything”, I would think they would turn to scripture rather than the world. As a white woman, I am constantly told that I have “privilege” because of the color of my skin and that my life has been less hard because of this. I am also told that because I’m a woman, I’m less than a man. This is the agenda this school pushes and pushes and pushes. Think twice before you come here. Reverse racism is vey alive here. This university caters to any student showing the slightest of diversity. If you aren’t diverse in race, you are dismissed and disregarded as hard wrong opinions, etc."
Freshman,2,When it comes to the finacial aid they are very stubborn. I didn't have enough funds to pay and they told me to go to community college and when I have enough I can apply again. The school and staff are very friendly and loving too bad I didn't have enough money. I wasn't going to take out a large loan either.
College Freshman,2,"It is extremely hard to get into the dorm of your choice if you are not already in that dorm. As a female freshman, I found it frustrating and annoying that I had very little options."
College Freshman,2,It's bad because it mainly doesn't exist
College Freshman,2,Parties don't exist as far as I know
College Student,2,There are no real sports teams. There is a small gym and a couple intramural sports. No school spirit.
College Freshman,2,I had no idea we had a greek life
College Junior,2,"There are some tame parties that happen, but for the most part a ""party"" looks like a trip to In-N-Out and some loud music in the courtyard."
College Freshman,2,Biola is not a party school. Plain and simple.....
College Senior,2,"It's bad in a sense that you kind of feel like you're still at your parents house. This can be alright for underaged students, but for students 21 and over it's a bit overkill."
College Senior,2,It's like pulling teeth to get the aid I really need. It's my last semester and I'm trying to graduate and I feel like they could care less. I'm super stressed about it.
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of places to eat around the campus within walking distance. You would need a car to go to a few good restaurants nearby.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms that they show in the tour are the best dorms, the rest are pretty old and run down!"
College Sophomore,2,"The system doesn't accept grades above 4.0 or give more than 1 scholarship.  This makes it pointless for students who work extremely hard to be well-rounded and achieve great grades, since standardized tests hold more sway than their GPA.  This doesn't reward hard work.  The fact that I couldn't receive an academic scholarship and a leadership scholarship from the school, despite my high school leadership commitments, put even more financial stress on my family.  It doesn't make sense to do that because usually the students in leadership are overachievers with high grades.  Both issues just keep the school from giving hardworking students the money they need."
College Freshman,2,"There are no parties at school unless it is a school event where the a group on campus puts it together, fun parties are off campus like house parties or clubs"
College Sophomore,2,No night life. The only things open past 7 are two food shops. Everything else is quiet.
College Freshman,2,Since the school is in LA the housing is expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in Stewart my freshman year and it is perfect for the anti-social recluse.  Being a social butterfly, it was rough because there was absolutely no community unless you were a sophomore or junior or RA. However, it is the most lenient dorm on campus.  Practically everyone had vapes and other ""contract-breaking"" things in their rooms and frequently had the opposite sex in their rooms longer than Open Hours accepted."
College Sophomore,2,"It's bad as in, they are probably more strict than a typical person's parents. Well, my parents at least. Open hours are the worst... The opposite sex cannot be in your room unless its 1-11 on weekends and 6-11 on wednesday and friday.  Also, doors must be kept open and some RA's are even as strict as to both feet have to be touching the floor during their time in your room.  It's rough.  You're also on contract to refrain from sex, drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.  If found that you have done otherwise, you would have to take a class on that specific ""sin"" you committed."
College Freshman,2,"Not a great school for athletics.  Facilities are decent, but not incredible.  Very comparable to my high school.  Interest in athletics was probably higher in high school."
College Freshman,2,They do not focus much on athletics or support for it. They dissolved the cheerleading team as well.
College Freshman,2,The bus system is really confusing and inconvenient. If you don't have a car life is rough.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Because this is a Christian school, there are very strict rules about drinking and drugs. No student may drink alcohol while enrolled in classes, including holidays (Christmas break excluded). There is also no tolerance for drugs or smoking of any sort. The school also has strict rules regarding visitation in dorms. There are open hours three or four times a week, and visitors of the opposite gender may visit the dorm floors at those times only. Any guy found on a girls' floor or girl found on a guys' floor outside of those visiting times will be written up. Regarding academics, the school has the same requirements as other colleges and aren't overly strict. "
College Freshman,2,There are not many taxis or buses around this area. Cars are a must.
College Junior,2,"Overall, the night life, activities, and athletics are bad. Library is great. Student center is great. There are little to non traditions."
College Junior,2,I hate parking at our school. During the school days it is ridiculous trying to find parking.
College Junior,2,"We have a high international population at our school, however it is majority white upper class.."
College Senior,2,"This has been improving over the years, but it is a small campus, so you can walk. Shuttles are available for trips to local malls."
College Junior,2,"Very few of the students actually go to the games, mainly they are roommates or dating one of the people on the team."
College Freshman,2,"You have to have your own computer, there are none to use on campus.  Mine crashed, and it was extremely difficult to function since there are none to use, and many students won't let you use theirs."
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus has become really difficult with all of the construction going on around upper campus. If you live on the Bluff and can't manage to get one of the few spots up there, you end up having to park under the track field or the parking structure. Alpha, Sigma, and Horton have likewise been impacted. Lower campus's parking lot is far too small for the amount of students who live there, and the majority of the parking spots are too small for anything larger than a Civic."
College Sophomore,2,There is very little night life that falls into Biola's code of conduct and risking getting caught isn't worth the parties.
College Sophomore,2,"La Mirada has a few nice spots and places to visit.  It's not exactly a fascinating city, though being in Southern California means there is access to all that is great (or not great) about life in L.A.  Public transportation is terrible and so a car is a must.  There is sometimes too much to do in the wider Los Angeles area."
Recent Alumnus,2,I worked full time and attended school part time.  Most of the opportunities are in the LA/OC region so don't think you're going to be getting great connections at an exotic place.
College Sophomore,2,"Because of the contract Biola students are required to sign, Campus Safety and Residence Staff is very strict about drug use (including alcohol), gambling, and sexual activity. Now if your playing a game with face cards, they'll let it slide as long as there's not any money involved. During open hours, students are supposed to leave there doors open if they have a member of the opposite sex in their room. How this rule is enforced varies. Students are not supposed to sleep in the lobbies, but they often get away with it.

I give Campus Strictness a C even though it would probably receive an F from a frat boy. However, Biola students knowingly sign the behavioral contract, so they know what they're getting themselves into."
College Junior,2,"Biola University has a good campus; however there are many things the school needs to work on. Overall the campus is well maintained, but there is nothing extraordinary about the campus. It is very simple and plain. The athletics are not promoted well and there is very little interaction with campus activities and student hang outs. I believe there is much room for Biola University to improve in this area."
College Freshman,2,"The whether can be very odd except in summer and winter. But throughout the year, there have been odd Weather patterns. One day it will be raining and then out of nowhere, it will be very hot."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Biola is centered around the Christian faith and there are no other religions represented on campus. However, there is vast racial and economic diversity on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Public transportation is almost non-exsistant at Biola University. You have to have your own car our have friends to give you rides to go to places.
College Freshman,2,"Weekends it is kind of dull, lots of people go home but you can always find something fun to do"
College Freshman,2,Biola is strict in its rules but it is for a purpose and it creates the best community ever.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman and sophomore's have guaranteed housing, if you want to live on campus as an upperclassman its harder. Due to the fact that each year that I have been here each freshman class has been bigger than the last so there's always construction, but the dorms like hart and Stewart are nearly 100 years old, where as Horton and hope are the nicest newest dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"If you live on lower campus, aka Stewart, hart or Hope, it can be a nightmare. I've lived on upper-campus, and the bluff (on campus apartments) which is a lot better for parking, since theirs no real crime or partying ticking is campus safteys major job, so fines and tickets can be a problem if you get them cause its a real hassle. You don't really need a car because any of your friends probably have one, but if you want to go out on the weekends when campus is dead it helps a lot."
College Freshman,2,There isnt any parties on campus but if you talk to the right people and are trying to find a party you can get to one off campus. Plus Biola is close to so many other party schools you could just go there.
College Sophomore,2,"I would say that Biola is not a very diverse institution. The majority of the school are devoted Christians. I would say that not too many ethnicity's are represented at Biola, the majority are Caucasians. Many countries are represented though, which I find very interesting! There are many missionary kids that attend Biola University, so many students that appear to be typical American young adults were actually born and raised in different countries and are living in a completely different culture."
College Sophomore,2,"The students look, dress and speak a lot alike, not all of them but the majority do. There are a few who do not care much about the norm and dress as they please but it is the exception."
College Sophomore,2,"There are few non-white students at BIOLA and because of this those of us who are not white feel excluded in a sense at the school. Respect is often given but being invited to sit, eat, talk or hang out with people outside ones race is rare."
College Sophomore,2,"Transportation is available to certain places locally on the weekends through the shuttle service, but it is slow and irregular. There is a bus stop right off campus but it takes hours to get anywhere using it. There isn't any hint of long-distance transportation"
College Senior,2,It can be a complicated process at time but I know they try to put effort into fixing the system.
College Junior,2,"Parking can be really bad sometimes. Even if you have a permit, it won't guarantee you a spot. You have to get on campus at least 30 minutes before your class to find a spot and get to class on time. Permit costs are not as bad as other schools. Sometimes when there are events going on at school, you have to arrive even earlier to grab a spot. Also, every year they make less and less parking spaces for students as it goes to the staff and faculty. You really have to make best of your time with parking."
College Sophomore,2,"Biola is primarily caucasion, and being that it is a Christian school, most all students share similar beliefs and philosophies. However, many minority groups have voices that allow for knowledge about other cultures, and missions work helps us to be aware of other ethnic and religious groups."
College Freshman,2,"Ridiculous During School Hours – The permit cost is not expensive compared to other schools for example Cal State University Fullerton. Theirs is around $300 or so a semester and Biola's is, I believe $125. It is so  difficult trying to find parking it once took my friend almost an hour to find a spot."
College Freshman,2,Its Expensive and Needs Work. Its way too expensive. I would love to see them lower the enrollment and make the cost of school cheaper but what you going to do.
College Sophomore,2,"Walking Works – other than the we cars, which are kind of pricey, walking is pretty much the best option if you don't have a car"
College Sophomore,2,"Biola has a beautiful campus, there is construction going on which will make it more astonishing. There aren't that many big classrooms but that isn't needed because there aren't that many students. There are only two good dorms that everyone wants to live in, the others are old. The school is also admitting more students which is crowding the dorms since freshmen have to live on campus unless they commute. The gymasium is a good size and the soccer field is nice but plain. The cafeteria is nice but it can get very crowded at times."
College Freshman,2,We Need Help – There is not much parking. You get lucky if you find a sport quickly. Luckily a new parking structure is being made right now!
College Sophomore,2,"Haha, this question is a joke right? This is Biola, we have tons of fun don't get me wrong, but definitely not in the nightclub/ partying kind of way."
College Freshman,2,"This Is Not an Athletic School – If you do sports for fun, but really care about your education then Biola's great. But sporting events are not commonly attended and there is no football team. Don't come for sports."
College Freshman,2,"Disappointed With Official Student Groups and Opportunities – Seeks to cultivate diversity but the expensiveness of the tuition and lodging seem a barrier towards opening it up to more diversity in terms of people from other socioeconomic backgrounds and race. I wish there were more people from other countries as well as representing the minority groups as that brings a lot more life, interest, and balance to a place. Also, official student leadership positions are very polarized. You have to be a certain personality and hang out with a certain people to be able to join, have the chance, or be welcomed. My first semester, I wanted to know how to join/get involved the Student Missionary Union only to be looked at by the student receptionist like I'm crazy. You have to fit the mold and be friends with some people ego to join. Needs an overhaul of the system to prevent monopolization by certain students to just include their friends. Also, some professors treat people from minority groups considerably different than they would others."
Freshman,1,I found that it was very hard to make friends. Most of the students there live within a two hour radius of the campus and majority would go home every weekend. There was nothing to do on campus. There were sports games but the games were never advertised and the university is not spirited at all. It's a very academic school instead of allowing opportunities for student life. There were a couple of those opportunities but not many. The professors were very personable and nice and the dorms are average.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek Life!
College Junior,1,"We are adults and we should not have to be babysat whether or not a person of the opposite sex is in a room at a certain time. Group projects, friends, movie nights, are all harmless things. And it's expensive."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have one.
College Freshman,1,"There is a very small party scene at Biola, but that is a large reason a lot of people go to Biola in the first place. It is known for not being party school."
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties. Period.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,My overall experience was a bust.  It took a lot of will power to return in the Spring because it was too much.  The professors are nice however it did not outweigh how I felt about how I felt I was treated as a child here.
College Freshman,1,"As part of the contract drugs and alcohol are not permitted on campus, and students truly follow this."
College Freshman,1,We do not have any Greek like at Biola University.
College Junior,1,We have no greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life on campus that i know of. Biola's dorms are better than greek life.
College Freshman,1,They don't offer much financial aid at all
College Sophomore,1,Biola does not have any Greek life on it's campus.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,Parties are non existent on campus or off. Students sign contracts saying they wont party or drink while enrolled so that greatly reduces the party scene.
College Senior,1,There is no greek life available at Biola.
College Freshman,1,"I rated this the worst, because we do not have ""Greek Life"" at Biola."
College Sophomore,1,NO. JUST DON'T EAT HERE. Save yourselves.
College Junior,1,"Big prep school. For the most part everyone comes from money and the school is in Southern California. Biola University is the typical stereotype for Southern California. Blonde, skinny, wealthy white girls and boys. "
College Junior,1,"The campus is VERY strict. Fines are constantly being handed out and each fine is a minimum of 50 dollars, but is usually around 100 dollars each. "
College Junior,1,"Biola University is a Christian school and all students sign a contract that they will not use alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or engage in sexual behavior even is you are of age. "
College Junior,1,Biola University does not give two s***s about its students. Financial aid is a miracle if received.
College Junior,1,We do not have any night life. There is no such thing as a Biola event. Dancing is banned..
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek life..We do not have any time of frats our sorority life. 
College Junior,1,"Our atmosphere sucks to put it bluntly. There is no college ""feel"". There is nothing to do on campus or off campus. If you want to go out everything is at least a minimum of one hour away. "
College Freshman,1,"The school has been very good to deal with concerning their financial aid. However, it is extremely hard to get scholarships even though I really need them (if not impossible) because I am white, both parents work, and both parents are married and alive."
College Junior,1,"Biola has a contract on which the students are not allowed to consume alcohol, or else risk expulsion. As such, there is not really a ""party scene"" and for those that do continue to party, the parties are very hard to find; they are off-campus, small, and exclusive."
College Senior,1,There are hardly any students of color on on campus!!
College Student,1,Drinking is strict at my school you automatically get sent to the dean and get a review. It is really serious. So parties are very limited at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"With Biola being very specific about their religious stance and what is acceptable behavior for students, there isn't diversity in religion or sexual orientation. They have many discussions throughout the year that provide explanations for what the school believes and Bible classes help with that also. 
Biola is working on trying to create more racial diversity because as of now, a large majority of the student body are white."
College Freshman,1,"I have had a terrible time with Biola and it's financial aid. Every time I received a scholarships they would take it back days before school started. I had to drop out of school for a semester because of this problem. Don't believe you will get every scholarship that is offered to you because they will drop your scholarships if they see that you have ""to much."" For a school that costs $35k THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"We are not allowed to drink, smoke, or do any kind of drug. While this is appealing to parents, it does more damage by hiding and punishing what's going on beneath the surface. There are a smattering of people who abuse it secretly. I had a room mate who dealt ecstasy and another friend who was date raped under the influence. Just be careful who you associate with if you decide to partake. 

Personally, I think the idea of a contract where we are not allowed to do these things is stupid."
Recent Alumnus,1,No transportation. I brought my car. Best decision I ever made.
College Freshman,1,"Money.... That's the Hardest Part. This school is VERY expensive. I believe the experience is worth it in the long run, but getting through it is a long haul. The financial aid department is somewhat helpful. I would strongly encourage a ton of prayer and thought when thinking about attending this school"
College Sophomore,1,Biola University does not give out very much financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"Sports Don't Matter – At Biola University, sports are not a big deal. Especially Women's sports but that's everywhere. There is no football team. No one supports track, swim, cross country, tennis or sofball. Men's basketball has the most student involvement, next comes Men's soccer."
College Senior,1,I don't even think there is this at all on Biola's campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Have Your Own Car or Friends With Cars – Not too much public transportation. The school own a few cars people can rent out, but other than that you just ask friends."

Alum,5,I took several online courses during winter and summer break and I never once had an issue contacting the instructor. I felt that I received the same responsiveness as I would during an in-person lecture. There were never technological difficulties experienced.
Alum,5,The faculty and staff at Bridgewater State are very supportive and will go the extra mile to see their students succeed. The small classroom sizes allows you to develop meaningful relationships with your professors yielding lifelong networks and connections.
Senior,5,The professors have been very accommodating and understanding with the current state we are all going through
Alum,5,"I took predominantly science courses. The material, the courses, the equipment, the professors... absolutely brilliant. All of my professors went above and beyond to make sure I (we) knew the material, they were approachable, and humble. The facility and equipment was brand new and state of the art; academic research was an unforgettable experience. I would recommend this university, especially for individuals interested in science, 10 times out of 10!"
Alum,5,I loved the exercise science program however the professors who have tenure need to either retire or allow someone new to come in and move the program forward instead of staying stuck in the 80's. The beautiful thing about exercise science is the fact it is always changing and theres always something new to learn. Not here. The professors teach from the same exact slides and handouts they were teaching from in the 80's!!!!
Alum,5,"I was a commuter at BSU doing a mixture of online, campus, and hybrid courses. Even though I definitely didn’t feel like I was a part of the campus life there, I definitely felt like my time there was well spent. Most professors were very engaging."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love BSU. I've only been here three semesters and I never want to leave. I'm learning a lot in my classes, I'm making life-long friends, I found my boyfriend here, and I love my classes."
Freshman,5,it is a beautiful campus with excellent teachers and great classrooms. a lot of programs to offer. there are many on campus activites to take part in. so many clubs to join.
Junior,5,Bridgewater State University has allowed me to stay in school and stay close to home. The school has an incredibly clean campus and the professors and amazing!
Freshman,5,"Bridgewater State University is an amazing school, the campus is beautiful and the professors are incredibly knowledgeable. The school offers a diverse campus and you learn from all walks of life."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here at Bridgewater State University. I really enjoy the involvement here on campus. I am apart of the Best Buddies program and I have made friends and get to hang out with my paired buddy. This club is very beneficial to me because it gives me confidence living here on campus. The courses here are very well laid out and I have spent most of my time living here on campus studying, taking notes, and doing homework to help benefit myself for the future. I really enjoy the fact we have a bus system. It makes going across campus so much easier for me, especially in the cold weather we were having. The professors are always available if you need them prior to or after class to help with any concerns. I recommend going to as many classes as possible since you are paying for them. The only thing I would change about this campus is the opportunity to live by yourself on campus, especially if you are as serious about your studies as I am."
Graduate Student,5,"Some downsides about BSU are that the parking is absolutely horrible, and the food isn't great. However, the facilities at BSU are overall pretty nice, the professors and classes are good, and it's an extremely affordable school."
Junior,5,"Overall an excellent school. As a transfer from a community college, BSU made the transfer process smooth and easy. BSU is very good about communication and I was never left wondering what I am doing or what should be next. The campus is very big, and BSU provides shuttles services throughout the campus and neighboring cities for its students. The professors here are very knowledgeable, and faculty is very helpful, approachable and friendly. My main reason for picking this university was for its location and tuition. Even though it's the most affordable than other school options throughout Massachusetts, the quality of education and student experience is just as good."
Sophomore,5,"Bridgewater State University is a great school. I love how here at BSU, there are many activities, clubs, sports (intramural and non-intramural), and club sports that students could become involved in. It's an amazingly diverse school; you see many students of different ethnicities, religions, cultures, disabilities (whether can be seen with the eye or not). It offers multiple different majors (and minors) that could be chosen from."
Junior,5,"Good school that is affordable, local, and provides lots of opportunities for students. I transferred here in the spring of my freshman year previously from Virginia Tech and genuinely am having a much better time with academics, adjusting, and so on. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved and professors actually care about your performance in class. They want to see you succeed and most are willing to help you if you ask for it."
Sophomore,5,"Very nice campus, professors are quite alright, many tools for struggling students. The dorms could be nicer, programs are very good. College is pretty cheap too if you are from the state."
Freshman,5,How spread out and gorgeous the campus is! It’s so pretty and peaceful and like it’s own little community within a community.
Alum,5,Professors are very helpful and teach not only what is in the book but also how it relates to the real world.
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved Bridgewater State University. The professors were super helpful, the students are friendly and the athletics were very involved. I would highly recommend."
Freshman,5,"I loved the overall experience. The people are very nice, i’d just wish the freshman dorms were a little move updated."
Sophomore,5,"Very friendly college, staff is incredibly helpful and despite the fact the school was previously known as a teaching school, the professors in other subjects are extremely well versed."
Senior,5,Positive experience if you put the work in!  Great professors in every department. Many opportunities to be a scholar that other schools may not provide.
Sophomore,5,"Bridgewater really a great school and my first year of college I really like it. In the beginning, I was scared, sad because I was leaving my home and family but then I for use to Bridgewater campus"
Sophomore,5,In all college is a wonderful experience but for some reason Bridgewater state gives me the all around love I was looking for. Im a business major so I love to network and there is always someone to talk to who can introduce you into someone who can get you to the place you want to be. The classes are very interactive and interesting (depending on the class). The people are welcoming and make you feel safe.
Freshman,5,"My first semester of college was great. I commute, so I didn't really get to know anybody. It was my own choice not to get involved because I worked almost everyday after classes. The school offers many different clubs and sports to join, and many things on campus to get involved in."
Sophomore,5,"I've found such an amazing community here at Bridgewater. Coming as a transfer student, it has been the best experience to find faculty and staff that are willing to go the extra mile and make sure your needs are met. I have found so many incredible opportunities on campus including departmental honors, Greek Life, and the opportunity to be a Teacher's Assistant. It's also a great campus and really affordable as a commuter student!"
Senior,5,I love this school and its environment. It is a very hands-on school with teachers who are passionate about their job and ensuring students learn and enjoy their experience here. Everyone has a place here!
Freshman,5,Didn’t really like as a resident there but commuter life is great. I haven’t really gotten involved in student life but plan to junior year. I feel like they have a really good psychology program though.
Freshman,5,"I love Bridgewater State, great campus, amazing professors, fabulous dorms, and so many ways to get involved."
Freshman,5,"I am only a second semester freshman at Bridgewater State but I enjoy it so far. I don't have anything negative to say about the school, the professors have been great and so have the classes. The environment is safe and the people are welcoming."
Senior,5,"Bridgewater State has given me many different opportunities to connect with other students on campus. It has given me the opportunity to continue dancing and finding myself. it has given me life long friendships. It is a safe and welcoming environment, where everyone says hi to others.  The staff and faculity are always willing to help you."
Senior,5,I enjoy the awareness of the need for diversity on campus. I also enjoy that the general faculty seems to understand that it is important to go a step further and be inclusive of varying identities rather than just representative.
Junior,5,"This school is perfect. It is small so it is easy to get to know where all the buildings are and also the classrooms are just the right size; meaning we get to interact more with the professor and they get to know us more, since the class capacity it is roughly about 30 students. I think it is just right."
Alum,5,I loved going to BSU! I was able to complete my Bachelor's in Psychology while working full time because of their flexible class hours and online availability.
Junior,5,"Bridgewater State has really made it such a peaceful and cute place to be. I love it and the energy it brings me, I have work there through the week! I love taking pictures of cool things around the school and the architecture and the nature surrounding it!"
Junior,5,"I am extremely proud to call myself a student of Bridgewater State University.  I major in Physics, which is a difficult major but my professors are like my family. We have a small major, so everyone is special and taken care of in every way possible. My college is great and I couldn't imagine it any other way."
Freshman,5,"Well, i am just an incoming freshman and i can tell you that they are great with informations and making you aware of the next steps for college.  For example orientation and other stuff."
Niche User,5,"Such a great school, I always feel safe on campus, I have made so many new friends and everyone is so kind in the community"
Senior,5,"Bridgewater University is a great local school. All the teachers are very much involved and almost all the criminal justice teachers have been in the field so they really know what they're talking about and you learn a lot. Food here is great especially compared to other colleges I've visited. Dorms are decent, we have great parties. Only bad thing about the school is parking. I hate it, if you decided to live on campus no need for a car seriously or be ready for tickets!!"
Sophomore,5,I just transferred to BSU and I absolutely love it. It is definitely a growing school in all aspects including academic and social.
Freshman,5,I haven't attended this school yet but I love the environment and the community that surrounds the campus! Such a helpful staff and extremely professional school!
Alum,5,"This school may not be the typical disgusting party weekend school some look for, but its the perfect balance of everything. There are a million ways to get involved and feel included on campus, housing and food is decent, nightlife is there if you seek it, the campus is wicked safe, and HOLY MOLY do the staff members at BSU care. The support and care I received from all of the staff and faculty at BSU was unreal. I'm a few years out from undergrad and I still have staff checking in on me to see how my successful life is going. They care. Bridgewater isn't some school you go to for four years and never go back to, this is a school you'll want to go to homecoming for. Sure it doesn't have the glitz and glamour with millions of dollars from alum and parents, but so what? If you want to have the perfect college experience, you have to make it that way. I am so incredibly thankful for my time at BSU, and honestly recommend it as often as I can."
Senior,5,"Bridgewater State is an excellent university. There are many dedicated students, professors, and staff. Many opportunities can be found on campus whether it be sports, organizations, student government, and/or internships. Very friendly student life. Nice Campus. Strives to bring diversity, success to its students, and build an ongoing community."
Senior,5,"I transferred to BSU after completing the Mass Transfer Program at Massasoit Community College. BSU is a great campus with sources everywhere if help is needed for anything! Professors are great and the location is great because it is super close to home! Overall, BSU is a great college and very convenient!"
Freshman,5,"My experience at Bridgewater State has been in tremendous! The professors are respectful and the academics are pleasant. The food is debatable at times, but other than that the campus is extremely diverse and has a beautiful scenery."
Freshman,5,"Love the people and amount of things to do on campus. Sometimes communication with administrative offices is a little lacking, but if you go in or call they are friendly and happy to help. On the website some things are hard to find."
Freshman,5,Teachers are involved and caring. Lots of resources to help with classes. Lots of clubs to be involved with. Big campus to get to know a lot of people. Pretty diverse school. There is always something to do on campus.
Niche User,5,Staff and Teachers are so kind. Always makes sure that you understand and are on task with everything.
Senior,5,"Bridgewater State University is such a great school for education majors. The program which teaches students how to be great teachers is vigorous and demanding, but it trains students very well."
Freshman,5,I have had many different experiences in bridgewater but i do wish that the school was more diverse and the party scene was more lively.
Niche User,5,"My sister attends Bridgewater and it is a beautiful, old campus that always seems to be full of life and diversity. The professors at the university are so hands on and really take time to further every students education. Bridgewater State University is on the top of my list to apply to."
Freshman,5,I am a freshmen and I absolutely love the campus. I am currently a resident and couldn't ask for a better turn out. I enjoy the scenery and the campus life! The professors are excellent and do all they can to help you to the best of their ability.
Junior,5,"I love everything about BSU. There are endless opportunities for us students to become involved in the school and our community. All of the professors want the very best for their students and expect us to strive for greatness. There is such sense of community at BSU and there is always a smiling face everywhere you turn. The academics are amazing, the buildings and technology are state of the art, and there are so many clubs and organizations. There truly is something for everybody at this school."
Freshman,5,"So many fun opportunities here! Great student life, great staff, really good food and safety. The dorms are pretty good and the campus is really clean!"
Freshman,5,"Great school overall. Diverse student body with clubs and organizations that will make sure everybody has a group of people they feel comfortable with. Academic standards above average with various classes that fit everybody's liking. Nice food options and even better resident halls. Financial Aid could be better, but it isn't the worst. I do enjoy this university and hope to come back next semester."
Freshman,5,This university strives for excellence. The psychology program is especially excellent. All of the professors in the psychology wing want you to do well 
Niche User,5,"My experience was really awesome. I loved everything about it, the helpers we're very nice and careful with everyone. The dorms was great and the students we're all very nice. And the campus was just amazing, i really enjoyed the group works that we did and i got to know myself more than i did before, and i also got to know my peers. "
College Freshman,5,The professors at this school are very nice and will do anything to help you succeed in your classes.
College Freshman,5,The security on campus is very good.  We have blue buttons we can press on campus if we are being attacked or feel like we are in trouble and  the police will come.  We also have police that patrol that campus every night.
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus.  I find it easier to be able to get to my classes and not have to get up as early for them.
Junior,4,"It is a great school for the price you pay.  You get a good education and you're not breaking the bank. I do wish they were a bit more helpful in their approach to internships, but I really have no complaints."
Junior,4,The approach to the online work from all of my professors has been great and they've been very accommodating.
Senior,4,"Bridgewater is a very inclusive school, that allows room for creativity.  I am in the continuing ed program, they have nothing but helpful with my returning to school."
Junior,4,I took online classes in my college and it was simple. It was easier to ask more questions to the professor face to face on a screen. The professors go out a way to help the students online and they make the lesson plan easier and they slow down so we can ask so many questions.
Sophomore,4,"I'm not sure if anything really needs to change, I really enjoy everything so far. The food is as good as it can be, there are tons of sports to choose from and lots of clubs to choose from."
Senior,4,I only took online courses through COVID19 situation. I do not know what true online courses are like.
Senior,4,"I enjoy Bridgewater State University and services they have to offer. However, BSU does need to improve on how they help students who fall in between the cracks of financial aid who are out of state but can’t afford their own instate universities (after attended community college)."
Junior,4,I love it and very great wit finical aid. I wouldn't have chosen any other place and I'm really proud I made this decision
Sophomore,4,Professors are very supportive. Many resources to help you with absolutely anything! Campus is huge.
Alum,4,"I loved the school when I was there. The classes were all a decent size and my department- Communications was fun! The professors were mostly great besides a few who were a bit pretentious. I commuted so I cant say much about living on campus or extracurriculars, BUT I loved the academic side of things. I wish they had more assistance for alumni though."
Senior,4,The school is very spread out and makes getting to classes difficult sometimes. The parking for commuters is limited and if you do not show up early to campus then you will have to park in the parking garage by the dorms. Professors are pretty good and most of the time understand that being a student can be overwhelming.
Junior,4,"Everyone is so helpful and welcoming, it is like it’s own little town. Professors are nice and accessible. Not too hard to manage as a full time student."
Senior,4,"I have been very satisfied during my time at Bridgewater State University. They offer so many different things for students to make sure they have the best college experience possible. I have not had a bad professor yet, they are all so helpful, personable, and understanding. I have recommended this school to many people."
Sophomore,4,"Bridgewater State University is a fantastic school with an amazing community, the food is the only problem I have some times, and it’s only that sometimes one or two of the four dining halls lacks good hours to eat and occasionally lack variety. Other then that Bridgewater has a wonderful teaching staff whom are dedicated to helping their students excel."
Niche User,4,I like that the school has a good atmosphere and the way everyone interacts with each other. I have noticed that many of the students there seem to enjoy the school and the way that the school faculty and staff carries them selves.
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers seem to be passionate about the subject they are teaching and make learning said subject more interesting.
Niche User,4,I love Bridgewater for the opportunity’s they offer. I also love that they truly care about their students.
Sophomore,4,"I am in the Honors Program,studying Political Science with a concentration in Legal studies. I also play trumpet in the Pep Band at home football games and basketball games. My grades have been all As since I started here last year. I love the small sizes of my classrooms,the manageable size of the campus and the ease of which guidance and assistance is received."
Freshman,4,"I’d like to a see a little more school spirit. There already is some that’s apparent, but I wish there were more things for freshman exclusively. For example, a freshman winter ball or some more large-group events in the dorm."
Freshman,4,I like the fact that Bridgewater State is very welcoming. Everyone wants you to succeed and have fun while you're there. Help is always available and everyone is nice to be around.
Senior,4,This school is a typical state school. The campus is smaller in size but the fellow students and experiences available are great. I have made a second home here and a second family. I just wish there was more parking for commuters.
Sophomore,4,"In the beginning of my time at Bridgewater State University I wasn't really sure if  it was going to be the best fit for me. As some time passed and i got to meet new people who connected me to things around campus. One of those things was my work study which helped me really get involved around campus. once i got to explore the campus more i realized it wasn't as bad as i thought it was, i just needed to get out of my room and actually take the time to get to know the campus. Once I did that i learned that Bridgewater was the right fit for me."
Senior,4,Affordable for in-state tuition. Offers a wide variety of courses and majors. Don't go here if you have to pay out of state because it won't be worth it.
Freshman,4,Great school for the price of attendance. Has a train line directly to boston on campus and good housing.
Freshman,4,I like Bridgewater State University because it is not too far from home and my family. Also the commuter rail is right on campus which makes travelling easier. The class size is not too big and my professors know who I am when I am in class. The professors are very welcoming and want you to succeed. The students are also very willing to help it is overall a welcoming kind environment that I am happy to be apart of.
Junior,4,"Bridgewater state is an excellent school with intelligent staff and a great community. Some of the core requirements are a bit tedious, making graduating on time harder for some people. Overall, the school is an excellent option for students of all abilities."
Junior,4,"Bridgewater is a great school with a lot of potential. It does have some accessibility issues on their website that needs to be fixed though. The atmosphere is great and the professors are overall amazing. They really try to connect to all their students, even the commuters which is much appreciated. The parking used to be bad but the garage has truly changed that predicament."
Alum,4,I enjoyed living on campus at Bridgewater. The teachers and classes were great and there was a lot of opportunities for community involvement.
Sophomore,4,"When I first learned I was going to Bridgewater State, I wasn’t the happiest. I couldn’t afford my top choice school, and I knew  BSU didn’t specialize in my major of Political Science, as much as their Education and Science programs. However, after joining extracurricular groups, eventually becoming an executive board member of some; making the Dean’s List, and being offered competitive internship opportunities, I realized that it’s better to go to an average school and stand out than a more prestigious institution, where it’s harder to do so."
Senior,4,Bridgewater State has a very welcoming environment for the students and I really appreciate that. They strive to make commuters feel apart of the community and work towards encouraging all students to do well in their academics as well as any other extracurricular activities.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Bridgwater State University has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I have had my highest and lowest moments attending the university. Whether it was joining a club or flunking an exam. Each moment was indeed memorable sculpting me into the person I am today. The diversity across campus speaks for itself. The clubs and students involved have been a voice for the minority. It is hard to say what would need to be changed on campus since there is always room for improvement. One thing would have to be the dining halls. At times students run out of meal swipes or dining money to eat. Students shouldn’t be denied food around the end of the semester just because they didn’t chose the better meal plan which can often be frustrating.
Freshman,4,"The students and faculty at Bridgewater State are all very friendly and try to make you feel as comfortable as possible in your transition away from home and to college overall. The food could be better but the students are trying to come together right now to try and get it changed. Some of the best parts are all the clubs, sports teams, resources like tutors and advisors, and its very own campus police headquarters."
Freshman,4,"Overall, this school is perfect for a new start, for the beginning of your life journey. You will never feel left out, I was an out of state student AND a transfer and I made friends instantly. Its a small campus, therefore,  you get familiar with your teachers and your peers. Love it here. And the food is delicious."
Sophomore,4,"Although my first year was a hard transition from high school to campus life, I enjoy going to Bridgewater State. They have been there the whole journey to make sure I am squared away financially. I would not want to be anywhere else to go to college to get my degree!"
Sophomore,4,I had a great experience my first two years at Bridgewater State University. They provided an education that was suitable for all types of learners and the campus atmosphere made it a smooth transition my freshman year. I've met incredible professors who actually care and I've made life-long friends.
Junior,4,"Great local school, very helpful with transfer students. The only problem with this school is parking for commuter students. The professors are great, most of them truly want to see you succeed and are always there for you when you need help or advice."
Junior,4,"What I love about Bridgewater are the students. They are so friendly and outgoing. It's quite easy for me to make friends the way I am. The class sizes are fairly decent, not too many people are squished in one classroom. The campus is beautiful and a great size for a person like me. When it's warm outside I like to walk around and enjoy my surroundings. Definitely, if you make friends on and off campus you guys will find ways to have fun.

What I hope the school can work on is listening to the feedback of students when there is a certain professor not doing their job and increase the quality of their foods."
Freshman,4,Great college for teaching. As a freshman I am learning so much already. The faculty helps you along the way and is excited to see you grow. With small class sizes you get 1/1 attention with professors.
Freshman,4,"The people are friendly, the campus is eco-friendly, professor take the time to strength your grades"
Freshman,4,"Since my first day at BSU, the staff and faculty have been kind and generous. The professors are willing to help the student's so that they can reach their fullest potential. These professors are here to help the students, not to see them fail. Also, there are a large range of cultures and ethnicities which are embraced with open arms. There are shuttles that run making the campus easily acceptable to everyone. The campus is accessible to everyone. Many of the dorms have been recently renovated and are spacious giving students spacious. Lastly, there is a large emphasis on safety on campus. Every new student must complete an alcohol and sexual violence course. To enter a dorm building, you must be a resident or be brought in by a resident. Security guards check bags as the students enter and check in people brought into the building. Overall Bridgewater State University is a beautiful school, with welcoming people and staff who want to make this experience amazing for every student."
Niche User,2,"Since my first semester at BSU I have been subjected to repetitive lectures about how bad and evil white people are, and if you even attempt to question this you will be declared a racist in front of your peers. It's a shock to me that there has not been any violence against whites on campus with the sheer volume of anti white propaganda from educator's on campus. I paid a lot of money to be here only to be told I didnt earn my spot or anything for that matter and that my skin color dictates who I am as a person. I spent 2 years at Massasoit in Brockton which is majority black and never faced such outright hatred as I do at BSU for simply having light skin. The rhetoric is toxic. Academics are half assed. Campus is spread over almost 3miles with 15 minutes to get to class. I've had professors clearly discriminate against me for being caucasian, and its totally unacceptable."
College Sophomore,2,there is very little greek life and what little there is is not very important or exciting
College Junior,2,"The library offers help if you need any tutoring and so on. Its 50/50 chance you get a great professor who actually cares about your success and what they teach. Registration is awful and unless you're a junior or senior, you won't get the classes you need so just set them aside till you get to register earlier (unless you're in athletics or an honor student) (p.s. its at 6AM) Workload can be crazy one semester and little the next. Depends entirely on your major and classes (Science majors (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) don't sleep. Best places to study are either RCC, Moakley building (including Hart and Burnell Hall), or the library"
College Junior,2,"There isn't much diversity. There are many groups for the minority such as African Student Association and so on. Very diverse otherwise (political beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, etc.)"
College Junior,2,Students sometimes go overboard when it comes to drinking.
College Junior,2,This school wasn't the greatest. Not very fun on campus and courses were okay depending on the professor you got.
College Junior,2,"The school is actively trying to make it better. There are Safety shuttles you can call after 7 to take you directly where you need to go and BSU police offer self defense classes. I personally don't feel safe staying after dark. Not many places are lit up as much as they could be on campus making it kind of scary walking to your car and the T station is bright but also empty. Honestly if you can avoid being alone try your very best. There are blue lights on campus for emergency services and they do use the Haven app. In the two years I've been here that have been quite a few sexual assaults, whether walking on campus or in the dorms."
College Junior,2,"Dorms are tiny and suites are awkward. There are plenty of new buildings such as Crimson and Weygand but rooms are still pretty much small. DiNardo and Miles are not great they're small, outside isn't attractive, inside isn't attractive and its also small. Best options are East, Weygand, Scott, and Crimson. Social atmosphere isn't much without the commuters. Housing is very close to classes. Freshman dorms are okay, Woodward seems newer with more space than Shea/Durgin which holds most of the freshman. Never been in Great Hill but the proximity of the apartments to parking is ridiculously close."
College Freshman,2,No one attends any games.
College Freshman,2,"The campus is not the best. Atleast once a week it smells like a litter box all over campus because it is located next to a water filterer. The food is really disgusting. It's INCREDIBLY hard to get the classes you need to take, there isn't enough classes for all the students. They purposefully try to get you to stay an extra semester for more money. When I started my freshman year my DegreeWorks already said I wouldn't be graduating on time. There are not many organizations on campus so it is hard to get involved. Also what ruined it for me was that it is mostly a commuter school and everyone that did live on campus would go home or visit other colleges on weekends so it is very boring and like a ghost town."
College Freshman,2,Boring resident halls. Can't do anything without getting written up. Security is strict. Not fun at all.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is non-existent. Pretty much irrelevant on campus. Anyone can get into one, just wouldn't waste my time with it."
College Sophomore,2,school is not known for athletics
College Freshman,2,sexual assault on campus is a huge problem and keeps happening
College Freshman,2,this college is not my favorite place and I am trying to transfer.
College Freshman,2,not the school for me.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's pretty embarassing- if you show up you get accepted.
College Freshman,2,I am not impressed by Bridgewater's sexual assault track record.
College Junior,2,"Some employees have an attitude towards students, even if the students were being polite."
College Freshman,2,Not really a big fan of the food at school.
College Freshman,2,Selections are terrible for vegetarian/vegan
College Sophomore,2,ECC is very bad an the food frequently makes people sick. Tilly has good breakfast food and is a lot better than ECC but isn't great. Bears Den is one of the best places to get food. Crimson food isn't bad but the service is very bad and orders frequently get lost. Most of the dining halls do not have a very good variety of food and there isn't many healthy options.
College Sophomore,2,If you're dining off campus I hope you enjoy either pizza or Chinese food and none of it at a good price.
College Student,2,"The school is a dry-campus, so you need to know someone who has off-campus housing that's close by."
College Student,2,"We have Greek life, but no one would ever know it. There are no special chapter house or anything, they all dorm regularly and you never see anything on or off campus about the sororities or fraternities. Greek life may as well be nonexistent here."
College Junior,2,College parties suck nmatter where you are
College Junior,2,I'm from a city and his is not a city!
College Freshman,2,There is no greek housing on campus so most just get together a few times a week and either party or chill.
College Junior,2,Small town with very limited choices
College Junior,2,"It's really gross having to walk through campus and get big clouds of smoke to the face. BSU's campus isn't overflowing with weed clouds, but it's gotten to the point that you'll probably smell it on the daily. As for alcohol, it's college...."
College Junior,2,"It's kind of depressing how overlooked the athletics are. You see great games and wicked fun games happening down in the south......and then BSU's worse than high school games. I'm serious, more people went to my high school football games than people go to these games. Very sad."
College Junior,2,The connection process to wireless internet on campus has gotten worse and worse. Basically you cross your fingers and hope for the best.
College Senior,2,"I would not live here after graduation due to the fact that there is nothing in this city to keep here.  There is a lack of diversity in the community and it somewhat resembles a town in the south, there is some racial profiling and it is not a healthy environment for me to be in.  There is also a lack of culture and history which makes this city on popular because there is a college in the middle of the city."
College Senior,2,"At this school you can notice when a person is sneaking alcohol into the dorm, by putting it into their backpack before the security check at 7pm.  You can walk down some hallways at a residence hall and smell marijuana whcih diffuses and encompasses the entire hallway.  It is unfortunate but there is little done to prevent this and personally there should be 24hr security checks to try and prevent alcohol and drugs being allowed on campus."
College Senior,2,At this school not too many people participate in the Greek Life program and students look down upon it as though it is just a big joke.  Greek life is no prominent on this campus and some of that is in part because there is no housing for it and a lack of notice about it as well.
College Senior,2,"This school is mainly commuters which leaves less people on campus on the weekends and during the later hours.  As a result not to many people pay attention to the varsity sports and it represents a lack of school spirit.  Same is in regards to intramurals, not enough people are involved which decreases the amount of programs available for students to participate in."
College Senior,2,"The off-campus dining options only consists of fast food and chain restaurants.  It is cheap food that is not the best quality and for college students they will eat any food that does not cost much money.  Examples of these restaurants include pizza, Chinese food, McDonalds, and Taco Bell.  Unfortunately in this area there is a lack of diversified restaurants that incorporate different cuisines from around the world and that makes the college students forced into purchasing low quality and inexpensive food that is not beneficial to their health."
College Freshman,2,BSU is a dry campus so that right there says it all. It is still easy to sneak alcohol into the dorms and people do go out on Thursday and Saturday nights. During the winter not too many parties take place since everything is off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus housing is owned by the University and is not modern or updated. There is little parking and nothing to do in the area, so its best to live near some of the action on campus instead, or commute."
College Freshman,2,"girls were jerks, commuting school, foods awful, no where to go."
College Freshman,2,got one scholarship for a ma state school...
College Freshman,2,there just made up to do good deeds
College Senior,2,We pay a lot of money for a parking sticker and there is usually no spots in the parking lots. There is a parking garage but it is very far away from campus classes.
College Freshman,2,Security is everywhere and pretty annoying.
College Sophomore,2,"I have learned the times of the day when I will be able to find available parking spots in the parking lot closest to my class. I usually have to arrive to the school an hour or more before my class begins so that I can either park during the period when spots are available or so that if I cannot find a spot I have enough time to walk the long distance from the farther out parking lots. They are good at catching people who broke the parking rules but that is good thing. Students need to be fair and park where they are supposed to. If you are a commuter then you obviously need a car. However, if you live in the dorms then I see no need to have a car unless you wanted to go off campus. "
College Sophomore,2,"The weather has a huge effect on my experience any day at school. Bridgewater has a huge campus and I do a lot of walking. So if it is windy, snowing, or raining, I will not be a happy camper. But when it is beautiful weather outside I love walking to class at a glacial pace. "
College Freshman,2,A lot of fast food!
College Senior,2,"The parking pass is way too expensive, there aren't enough spots in decent locations, and everything seems to fill up after 8 am."
College Junior,2,"For history majors it's difficult.  There is a high work load, and getting the classes you need is very difficult."
College Junior,2,"The police will look for any reason to harass the students on campus when they really should be monitoring the intersections (people drive through red lights a lot).  One student was arrested for having a Nerf gun during a long, well known tradition of Humans Vs Zombies where many students had the same nerf gun"
College Junior,2,Right now my financial aid isn't covering me enough and I need another 3000$.  BSU locks your account if you don't pay quickly enough
College Senior,2,"Really only negative thing about the whole school right now. Started major construction in 2011 for parking lots, etc. and things haven't been the same since. Moved main commuter lot from center of campus to one far side and turned it into a garage. Since that moved, it caused commuters that normally parked there (that had class opposite from new garage) to park in secondary lots available. So, unless you want to use the garage that is near virtually nothing, parking is usually a pain. "
College Freshman,2,I haven't seen much happen from greek life. I know it exists but haven't seen anything they do.
College Freshman,2,Most scholarships you can not be eligible for until Junior or Senior year.
College Freshman,2,Only form of public transportation from Bridgewater is the commuter rail. There is a shuttle that runs when classes are in session which excludes weekends 
College Sophomore,2,There are never enough parking spaces to go around. Parking has been a problem here for years but nothing has changed. I've heard its a problem at most schools and would rate it as sub par.
College Freshman,2,The sports are subpar with football obliviously the most popular. Students are more into watching sports rather than playing on a team. It's not a really big thing sports.
College Sophomore,2,not much of a night life for the students. Some bars for those over 21 but under 21 there is not much going on.
College Junior,2,"To be completely honest, if you don't live on campus you're treated as a complete outcast even though like 70% of the school is commuters.  Most people won't strike up a conversation with you or become your friend unless they already know it.  It's actually quite annoying.  The guys and girls are mostly stuck up."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather in Massachusetts does cause for a lower grade in this category. The rain, snow, and cold temperatures make campus a very difficult place to navigate throughout the year."
Freshman,1,Pretty awful. The teachers don't really give a shit or try to teach you. The food sucks. The parties didn't even count as parties. The dorms were always run down in some way. glad I got out of there
Freshman,1,"Bridgewater was awful. The advisers truly don't care about you. There's nothing to do in the area. There's never any food, healthy food open. It always smells like weed. Police live on campus so good luck with parties. Avoid this school at all costs. You may think the finaid is good but as soon as you decide to go there they'll change it."
College Junior,1,Bridgwater does not party. Events aren't great at all. Off Campus housing parties either get shut down or raided. Spring Fest is just a day to drink and do stupid things.
College Junior,1,Nightlife consist of either studying the boredom away or if you do decide to go out drinking or smoking at another dorm. Safety shuttle bring you to where you need to be and pick you up from wherever you are (on campus)
College Freshman,1,"Always house parties. Take place at aviation house, football house, wrestling house, black house, white house, etc"
College Freshman,1,Barely any parties. If there are any they usually suck and get shut down very quickly. One time the cops surrounded a house and brought vans to arrest everyone that was at the party. Someone got stabbed at another. Someone was pushed off a roof at another. woo party
College Freshman,1,Anyone can get in. There isn't housing. It's a joke
College Student,1,"I applied for FAFSA early January and then went back after my family and I had done our taxes to fix that part of the process. Meanwhile, I was a finalist for a local, private scholarship. To narrow down the finalists one of the things they looked at was our finacial aid package. Now, it was mid-april and I still hadn't received my financial aid package from Bridgewater. I called the school, was on hold for over THREE HOURS, and at the end of the phone call I found myself crying and at a loss for words because the woman told me the reason I hadn't received my package is because the school did not have my SSN. I don't know how! I applied to the school and put it in the application, they had all mg information except that? And why wouldn't they call or send a letter home to say something? Now I was missing out on a scholarship that without it I probably wouldn't have been able to even attend college! The woman on the phone had no answer and no empathy. I had to drive all the way there to give them my SSN (which was difficult because I live far and was in school during their hours of operation!). By far the most difficult thing I have ever been through!!!"
College Junior,1,The best time to come back to campus was yesterday... There's no point in looking for a good parking spot when you come back to campus after the weekend because you know all the good spots are already taken. Have fun walking from Tower Lot!
College Junior,1,"BSU tends to be very strict in many ways. Many things are understandable, but for the most part it's all completely unnecessary."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is a complete joke on campus. If you like to do community service and pay for friends its for you! If you like to party or want a traditional sense of greek life like in the movies then don't bother.
College Sophomore,1,Its an old suburban town. Despite the local Roche Bros. There's no actual organic/allergen free dining off campus.
College Sophomore,1,You can't get any help from the Financial Aid office and they always lose/fail to respond to emails.
College Freshman,1,take the train to south station then bus
College Freshman,1,"hate it, there are no options, not close by and look dirty, and don't help supply jobs to college students"
College Freshman,1,"four words, police station on campus"
College Freshman,1,its awful because its a huge commuting school
College Senior,1,So many tickets. Walk so far. Pricey. Inconvenient parking garage. Even employee parking is far.
College Senior,1,The majority of students that live on campus are apart of greek life.
College Freshman,1,I got no financial aid from the school aside from subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans that I have to pay back.
College Freshman,1,"im a city kid, and the school is in the woods"
College Junior,1,"250$ to get a parking sticker, and if you don't get to the lot by 6:30 you won't find a spot.  There is a parking garage but it's a 20-30 min walk from any of the class buildings.  They tore up a huge parking lot so they could put in a park in the middle of campus and it has really affected the commuters."
College Junior,1,"It's too expensive to live off campus unless you have an amazing deal going on.  Bridgewater also makes it harder for commuters to exist even though they describe themselves as a ""commuter school"""
College Freshman,1,"There is no nightlife. Literally, it sucks"
College Freshman,1,The town of Bridgewater is very conservative and when parties go on the police are always there. It is more fun if you are a freshman to have a gathering with a group of friends in your dorm on the weekends unless you want to make the trip to Providence or Boston to go to the club. Not a big under 21 scene.
College Senior,1,Parking on campus has gotten worse and worse. Lots are either being filled in or rearranged to be further away from campus. Expect a 15 minute walk from where you park to class.
College Sophomore,1,I hear it's pretty bad because Bridgewater is not city-like and there are only a few houses technically off campus to have parties with alcohol. I haven't heard anyone go to any bars nearby because I don't think there are any of interest. People mostly walk to their destination of parties I've noticed.
College Freshman,1,It's pretty small town. People ache to find something to do every day never mind every weekend. I do enjoy the quiet but not all the time.
College Junior,1,Parking is definetley a subject that all students stress. There is not a lot of options when it comes to parking at BSU. Its either you leave very early to get a parking spot if your a commuter or resident of you end up walking like a mile or something to get back to campus. The school took out a parking lot to make green space which is nice but this school is known to be a commuter school and if there is no parking then what? I agree with the example that at BSU Parking on campus can be a nightmare.
College Sophomore,1,"HORRIBLE, makes me want to puke every time i eat it, no options"
College Sophomore,1,PARKING SUCKS WHETHER YOU COMMUTE OR ARE A RESIDENT.
College Sophomore,1,dorms are petty good quality but i absolutely hate it they have way too many rules and are way to up tight about everything. security guards check your bag after 7pm in upperclass dorms and all the time in freshman dorms its very annoying and inconvenient
College Senior,1,Because my parents are considered middle class we haven't gotten any financial aid for three years and this past year we were offered loans which did not help.
College Freshman,1,"Bridgewater State University has a pretty proactive approach to drug and alcohol safety, but even though they require us to take an online test about drugs and alcohol they are not really preventing anything. The test is more of an annoyance than anything. Drugs and alcohol are very visible on campus, with a liquor store right across the street, and students still take advantage of alcohol and drugs even though it is a ""dry drug free campus."""
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately, sometimes here on campus I feel very unsafe. Hearing on the news and local newspapers about all the sex offenders that have been seen right on campus tends to scare me. One particular incident happened last semester when an older man was actually found in a dorm hall.

One of my professors is a police officer right on campus and he told our class that there were ONLY two police officers on the night before. My feeling on this was extremely disappointing because there are tons and tons of students to be watched here on campus. I seem to notice police officers pull over a lot of cars on campus but I never see them actually protecting our campus and being aware of who and what is roaming around the school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is awesome that they are building a parking garage, because there is not nearly enough parking for this heavily populated commuter college.  "
College Senior,1,"Could Be Much Better – i get stresses out every time award letters come out. i don't get enough financial aid and i don't get help with other options. i don't have much opportunity and everything is done almost too late. its frightening, the worst thing about school."
College Sophomore,1,"The Night Life Is Pretty Boring – Honestly, there is about one bar that some people go too on a regular basis but it is so run down and far from student friendly, that more of the students at BSU resort to roudy house parties"
College Sophomore,1,"Severe Punishment – I just finished my freshmen year at Bridgewater and the freshmen dorms are the most strict. They have bag checks around the clock and the RA's are ridiculously uptight. Warning: take quiet hours around finals time seriously, they will find you and write you up. If you want to do anything at a bridgewater, get out of the dorms!"
College Sophomore,1,A Nightmare – There are little to no resources and even less people who know how to find them.  Every time I dropped off something at the Financial aid office I was told I was all set only to find out a week later that I needed another form.  One form at a time.  Its very inconvenient.

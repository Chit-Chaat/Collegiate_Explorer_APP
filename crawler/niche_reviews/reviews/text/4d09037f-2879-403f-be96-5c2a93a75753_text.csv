Senior,5,"Rutgers Newark is a very good and diverse school. The school truly cares for its students. The school is known best for some of its majors. However, being a Biology Major, there are some things that could be improved upon. For instance, some labs and lecture halls can be renewed. From my personal experience, Rutgers provides a huge opportunity for its students to interact with each other and join clubs. There are numerous clubs for students to join which helps the students be more engaged and interactive. The professors are always willing to help and always have office hours for people struggling. Overall, Rutgers is a good school and provides its students with great opportunties to be engaged."
Senior,5,"Before COVID-19, I took a couple of classes online and the professors successfully communicated thoroughly with the students. It was almost the same as being on campus as they had office hours and were always able to help via email. Their lectures were sometimes pre-recorded and others live. During COVID-19, all my classes are now being conducted online. The professors are fully prepared for this transition. Although there are some issues that are bound to come up with online learning, the schools still try their best to make everything goes accordingly."
Sophomore,5,"During the summer, I took Computers and Programming I, English Composition 101, and Precalculus. My online experience with Rutgers University was a bit rough, but as time passed, it became easy to understand. During that time, My professors used the internet to help sort out assignments and to announce whether there was a test for us.  The teachers also used the internet to communicate with the students and helped us learn about our subjects. The English composition class didn't have a meetup date, but that didn't stop me from learning about what I needed to read, write about, and the topics I needed to understand."
Sophomore,5,"My in-person experience with Rutgers was great. It was a little difficult to get used to, but as time passed, I managed to adapt to the standards that Rutgers had during that time. Rutgers helped me learn about the things I need to know before I become a Video Game Designer. If not for this University, I wouldn't be able to find a college that would give me a greater chance of being hired by famous companies."
Senior,5,Really helpful and understanding during pandemic. All my classes have been on campus. I really enjoy attending school here.
Senior,5,Astounding University that offers a unique environment and enhances job opportunities. It is located in the heart of Newark where there is access to a bunch of resources. The campus is very easy to get around. Will miss this place so much
Senior,5,Loved the teachers and my learning experience. There were many projects that allowed me to interact and practice interpersonal skills. The business core classes really enhanced my interview and resume skills
Graduate Student,5,"Online, hybrid and in-person classes are all available and you will get an opportunity to be in each one.  Rutgers has the most current information and technologies, preparing students for the latest treatment options for patients."
Graduate Student,5,Rutgers School of Nursing creates a family environment and community for students and alumni.  I would highly recommend the program to anyone seeking to further their knowledge in medicine.
Alum,5,"Towards the latter part of my undergraduate years, I took online classes. The transition was seamless and one I wish I had done before. The classes were held on blackboard and include a forum for weekly discussions. We also participated in a group project, which allowed us to learn about our peers as well. Overall my online learning experience was great and allowed for more time at home."
Alum,5,"I am grateful for my experience at Rutgers University - Newark. Attending a University such as Rutgers, allows for integration and participation on all campuses. However attending Rutgers University - Newark was like being a part of a tight knit family. The campus is progressive, inclusive and diverse. The housing options are plentiful and nice compared to other on campus housing. Every once in a while you meet a teacher that's rough around the edges, but overall the staff is friendly and helpful. If there was one thing I could change, I would gate or enclose somehow the campus. Many times outsiders were found among students on campus. But overall attending Rutgers University - Newark was a great experience and one that I would recommend to others."
Junior,5,"I like how diverse and small the campus is. Professors take the time to know you, there are more than enough student organizations for everyone. There is an amazing school and personal life balance. Students make friends with each other easily, and there is more than one Starbucks on campus!"
Junior,5,Professors understand that it was harder to learn at home so they eased their coursework.  Professors were always available via email as well.
Senior,5,Rutgers University-Newark has great diversity and professors who truly care about their students. This is an institution that are truly for the students. they offer many scholarships in order to support students and their pursuit in a brighter future. People here are helpful and are all working towards a goal.
Senior,5,"Online classes can be challenging, but with the right professors that are ready to help you, it does make it easier and bearable. Most professors are reachable and will answer emails right away. Just make sure you keep a schedule and you are on top of your assignments!"
Freshman,5,"The switchover was a little tough but after getting the hang of things, all courses were manageable. It only took a chance at improving time management to feel comfortable overall, which I’ve discovered I really enjoy. Although some students learn more efficiently with in person classes, I was able to retain information both remote and in person methods."
Freshman,5,"As I finished my first year, I can say that rutgers is a very helpful and efficient school. Everything that I had questions on were answered very easily by the complying students and faculty there. I felt very comfortable within the environment."
Freshman,5,"My experience as a first year student was great for the most part. I formed so I was able to be more proactive when it came to on campus events. The many personalities that I lived with were the best. Everyone is friendly and they are willing to be a lending hand. The campus events during the day are a bit cheesy but they are fun. Most of the professors try not to make the class seem strict or boring and some even dismiss class if there's not much material to go over. Food around campus is never a big issue but the dining hall food isn't top tier so I wouldn't recommend eating at the main dining hall. Campus resources are also very accessible so there's never a big issue on availability. If you're a commuter, then Rutgers Newark is most definitely the school for you. If you prefer dorming on the other hand, explore new things that Rutgers Newark has to offer."
Niche User,5,I love the diversity in Rutgers Newark. I also love the kindness and welcoming that everyone in this college has.
Sophomore,5,Rutgers University - Newark is a very diverse campus that allows you numerous opportunities to feel involved on campus. As well provides numerous resources for your best success.

Graduate Student,5,Rutgers University Newark has provided me many opportunities. From the moment I got accepted to the moment I got into the Accelerated Masters Program. I have much more to achieve and I am glad to have been accepted.
Junior,5,Rutgers-Newark always feels like home and the students are very dope. The professor and staff are welcoming and they care. I’ve been granted many opportunities because of the relationships I have with many of the Rutgers staffs and students.
Freshman,5,Smaller than NB and you meet so many new people and everyone is so so helpful. The professors are cooperative and they are dedicated to helping the students. The only thing that I found problematic was that the campus food is not the best but its decent in the beginning. I would strongly suggest that freshman dorm their first year only because it really helps with making new friends and also for networking as well.
Freshman,5,"I am a first year nursing student at Rutgers newark in the nursing program. Don't get me wrong it is highly competitive and difficult but there are so many resources offered on campus which help you succeed. No professor wants you to fail, they all try their very best to help you succeed. The class are at a walkable distance and all the amenities are nearby."
Niche User,5,"One wouldn't expect this nice, flourishing, and little community be in this location yet Rutgers Newark makes the city itself a better place.

I definitely recommend going on a campus tour to Rutgers Newark, you won't regret it!"
Freshman,5,Overall Rutgers has been and continues to be on of the best experiences academically and socially. Throughout the lively Rutgers campus students are able to take a part in various clubs and sports teams and become active members in Rutgers Leadership. As a student who dorms I am able to easily get more active in the events going on more than a commuter student.
Freshman,5,"Since I work and attend school simultaneously, I never expected to have the ¨college experience.¨ I was definitely faced with culture shock as I entered my first year. College is different, and no one assimilates immediately. The professors and my peers made it easier and enjoyable to adapt to college life. At Rutgers, I have met many people that I can already tell will be significant in my life. I hope that anyone looking at Rutgers Newark can see beyond it’s large size and appreciate the small communities it is made up of."
Freshman,5,"Rutgers University-Newark is a surprise to me. I have been told constantly in my life that Rutgers University-Newark is not a “great” University, usually the people that say this never actually attended Rutgers University-Newark. I can honestly say is I love Rutgers Univeristy-Newark academically and socially."
Niche User,5,What I like about Rutgers University - Newark is their campus is very beautiful and their Nursing program is very good to become a Registered Nurse.

Senior,5,"I love the diversity, the professors, and communication at this university! The staff, professors and students are very friendly here."
Senior,5,"I remember sitting in a cell pretrial. My case was dismissed, but it still impacted my mental health. I knew I wanted to pursue psychology to help bridge the gap between unmet mental health resources and legal systems that disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities. Through Rutgers Newark, I learned more about adolescent development and strengthened support networks with my professors and classmates. Rutgers Newark gave me an opportunity to improve my learning and continue to grow."
Sophomore,5,It’s really a nice experience to be Rutgers Newark university because of all the opportunities in Rutgers and all the chances that you could do.
Sophomore,5,"Personally since I been at Rutgers University Newark my experience has been great. The school it’s self is very diverse, so it shows you aspects from most if not all cultures. From an academic stand point Rutgers University - Newark was a perfect fit. The professors are carefully selected which means that they are some of the best professors any university in in Jersey has to offer. The athletics at Rutgers are also very well respected. I am on the Rutgers University - Newark Mens basketball team, and it is a privilege to represent Newark Men’s basketball in the New Jersey Athletic Conference. In conclusion, my experience at Rutgers University - Newark has been the experience that I needed."
Graduate Student,5,"I am an upcoming graduate student joining Rutgers University for a specialty Masters course in Information Technology and Analytics. Rutgers University as a leading research university in USA has a flexible course structure and excellent faculty. I am driven towards the quality research and development activities in the university especially, ""Research Center for Information Management, Integration and Connectivity"" which involves applied scientific research on various issues in e-commerce and other sectors. The course would provide me excellent research oriented exposure and also help me get an edge over my counter parts and is a great opportunity to enhance my career path."

Graduate Student,5,"I recently enrolled in Tax Program and the process was quick and effortless. Rutgers is best known for its diversity. It is ranked very high as one of the best schools in the country. For Tax Program I would suggest more in-class courses for different reasons.  Tus far, I am very satisfied with courses and professors."
Freshman,5,Rutgers University is a great place for students of background and culture like me. It is one of the most diverse colleges in the nation and has one of the best Business Schools. Its close community allows students to build networks and friendships for a lifetime. The small student to teacher ratio allows students to be close to professors and learn a great deal from them. The campus life is extremely fun and allows students to grow in every part of life.
Freshman,5,Many of the students were extremely nice and welcoming and helpful. The staff are extremely helpful with all of the questions I have. It was very easy for me to find answers to my questions and help when needed.
Alum,5,"Excellent school in the central business district close to all things wonderful... restaurants, bars, sports arena, theatres, museum and library, and lots of businesses offering internships."
Sophomore,5,"I am a 2nd semester sophomore at  Rutgers-Newark and I enjoy it. Professors are great and understanding, it is once in a blue moon that you can run into a professor that you don't really like or understand. Food around campus is great and there is a lot to choose from. I work for the public safety police department so I can tell you, you're protected at all times."
Alum,5,"I loved going to Rutgers University in Newark. The student community is very diverse, so you meet some amazing people. The classes were very challenging, which I like. The professors want you to succeed and do great things, so they help you along the way. Plus, Queen Latifah was the speaker at my graduation! Truly an awesome school to go to."
Sophomore,5,"I come from a city that is very diverse and to come to Rutgers University Newark and see the level of diversity here was very refreshing. The campus life here as a commuter is wonderful. The Professors are very inventive when it comes to their students and providing the best for them. The programs here are great for students who really like a challenge because Rutgers has many to provide and challenges their students. Of course as a commuter transportation and parking is very difficult but coming to the Newark campus is perfect the bus comes right to the campus not much walking is required to get to campus and parking is no issue either, there are many parking decks available."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed the campus, the professors, and the students.  While I was on campus the professors were very nice, and I was so happy to feel welcomed as soon as I walked on campus."

Overall the college is very great classes are not to big and they are all walking distance so you don't have to worry about being late to class.
Alum,5,"Rutgers University, Newark is a diverse campus and overall professors care about their students.   The only challenge in this area is logistics and parking.  The curriculum was competitive and there is support form faculty to ensure your success.  Student life is great."
Junior,5,"My Rutgers experience so far has been a roller coaster on m behalf due to many complications from financial aid. On the other hand, that is the perks of being a college student, there is always something holding you back from getting your degree. Rutger's is a place where you have people on your side fighting with you to achieve that degree and overcoming the obstacles on the way."
Graduate Student,5,"I recently started the MSW program in January at Rutgers University. They have 4 different programs for individuals interested in obtaining a MSW. I chose to do the online program for my first two semester which is great for people who don't have the time to physically be inside a classroom. If you are good at teaching yourself and managing your time, that would be a great program for you ! I will be taking classes on campus now so that I can interact with the professors and students more. And hopefully graduate earlier than I originally planned ! This is a great MSW program. They make sure they give you enough experience so that you are ready for the real world."
Graduate Student,5,"I will be starting graduate school at Rutgers University this Fall and I am incredibly excited. Rutgers University offers a top-notch education and produces well-rounded students who not are academically strong but also have experience in community service and research. I am confident that after finishing my graduate studies at Rutgers University, I will be ready to conquer any field I pursue next."
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment at Rutgers! It makes me feel at home. The Dana Library is the best place to study and get work done. I can never get my homework done at home, so I spend my whole day on campus. I appreciate the professors there as well. They're eager to teach us and help anyone who needs it. Their office hours are flexible and open to students who need help. Professors at Rutgers look like they enjoy their job, making it a pleasant experience for all of us. Who wouldn't like to be at a school where we are taught well? I've heard we have the best professors in the state and I believe that's true. As an upcoming Sophomore, I can say I enjoyed my Freshman year and I know anyone who goes to Rutgers will too. You will meet unforgettable people and make unforgettable memories. We are a very diverse community, making you get a glimpse of people from all over the world at Rutgers."
Junior,5,"The faculty at Rutgers Newark is amazing. Any class that I would take, I would inevitably have a caring and intelligent professor.
The body of students is extremely diverse, so I have a chance to explore and get to know people from various backgrounds. 
Although everyone has stereotypes of Newark not being the safest place, I feel safe on campus. The police department is right around the corner, and the policemen go around campus on daily.  
The Student  Life is full of events. There is always something going on every day like a Fest, exhibition, talk or an event. 
I'm a commuter, so despite not having enough time to participate in wide variety of events on campus, there is always something for me that fits into my busy schedule, so I also feel involved in campus life."
Freshman,5,"The school is extremely diversed, and it offers tremendous help. The school can literally help you out with anything i need. They try their best to make up feel like one big family and bring ya together. Great school."
Senior,4,"I am in the Business school as a Business- Management Information Systems major and I currently hold a 3.97. Rutgers University has so many opportunities for business students to network and build relationships with representatives from firms. 

Regarding the classes, I prefer a small ratio of teacher to students. The classes are relatively small which I truly prefer. (If you prefer larger classes, that is something to consider). Rutgers is also closer to NY so if you want to work in this area, then going to school in this area is a great avenue to explore. 

The HLLC is also something to consider. It is a social justice minor that allows you to learn so much about aspects of social hierarchy, aspects of social economics, community, and so much more. If accepted (they accept about 10% of applicants), you also get a residential and food scholarship for the duration of your Bachelor's degree. The learning from HLLC deans, mentorship, and support is incredible. I highly recommend it."
Junior,4,"So far, I like being at Rutgers. I like that it's a small campus and you always see familiar faces. One thing I would change is the parking situation and some professors."
Junior,4,Online classes went pretty well! We were all going through something when classes switched to online and every professor was understanding and tried their best to make sure that their students were still learning.
Senior,4,"Although I always took classes on campus, since covid I had to take online classes. Most professors were really understanding and tried to work with you during these hard times."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience with Rutgers university has been good, I was able to learn online just as well as in person. My grades were well, professors answered questions and still had online office hours for students who needed them. They also made accommodations for students who had trouble online and had flexible hours for online assignments and tests. The tests and quizzes were graded fairly through a lockdown browser."
Sophomore,4,"Rutgers University Newark is a good college. The professors are from good educational backgrounds and are truly willing to take time out for students to help them succeed.  Additionally, they have creative ideas for projects and assignments for students that helps them understand the material well. The class sizes are small so it's easy to get to know a professor and vice versa. The facilities provided to students is good as well, students learn a lot and have all the facilities they need. Along with a good library and a Starbucks on campus. Campus food is good and is always available to students."
Senior,4,"It's a small, in term of the campus side, university. It's very easy to get to the class room, not need to take a bus or drive a car like Rutgers New Brunswick.  Unfortunately, Math and Science department doesn't have many students, so it's difficult to organize classes that I need to take."
Senior,4,"I took 3 ended up online courses last semester.  It was the first time experience for 3 professor and I felt they were having problems to deal with new situation more than me, have years of taking courses online, so I didn't have any problem."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience was not bad. I think that the professors gave too many assignments at once, but other than that issue, it was not an awful experience."
Sophomore,4,I would not change anything about Rutgers University. It is very diverse and has unlimited degrees and programs for students to attend. There are countless events to attend each week. Attending Rutgers University is a wonderful opportunity and there is no other college I would have chosen.
Junior,4,"I've been at Rutgers Universit-Newar for three years now and my experience there has been pretty okay. I love the diversity of the school and how we are in a city; however, parking is terrible! even if you have a permit you need to be their hours before your class to secure a parking spot in a parking garage/lot you paid for. Also, there are many professors seem uninterested in helping their students outside of class not to mention some of them assing an unnecessary amount of work! I will admit though that the students org do make up for a lot of the gaps within the academic system, they help you get in touch with peers that have already (or are) taking the course so they can guide you or help you when you're stuck. The student organization also help student enroll in developing programs as well as puting them in contact with recruited for internships and mentorships."
Senior,4,"I love the name that it has made for itself and how, in my experience, it has lived up to that name.  I had some challenges but my overall experience was a very good one.  would certainly encourage others to go to this school. The resources that they have given us access to as students are tremendous. I am grateful for my advisor who's willingness to assist me in reaching my goals."
Senior,4,"Although we all were swiftly hurled into 100%  online schooling, the administration worked really well to train our professors to transition to online schooling. Some of my professors who are older in age or less technologically savvy, although a bit more challenged, were very understanding of our challenges and changes. The only challenge I had with the online experience is that my personal computer could not hold up to use all of the virtual platforms offered."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Rutgers has been amazing! I’m finished my first year, and I have barely any complaints. The school is very diverse, and it helped me create forever-lasting networks. I’m currently dorm, and there’s a lot of support from the students and staff. Even with the transition to remote classes, I was supported by Rutgers and the Professors with all the challenges I’ve faced."
Freshman,4,"I faced financial issues at home, which made it difficult for me to participate in online courses. Fortunately, Rutgers assisted me and supplied the internet and a laptop to finish out the semester. The Professor undoubtedly helped a lot of students with our cases. They gave extensions and didn't rush us to finish working knowing our complications."
Junior,4,"The thing that I really like about Rutgers is how diverse it is. I come from Plainfield, NJ and had originally chosen to attend Montlair State. After 2 semesters at Montclair I could no longer stay. There was no diversity at Montclair which made me feel uncomfortable. Rutgers is the place to go. The professors are all nice and willing to help students. There are so many different resources for student needs."
Alum,4,The professors were all supportive but I feel registration could be smoother. The  experience was average but the student life organizations are great.
Sophomore,4,"Rutgers is very diverse, there is always something to do on campus and there are a plethora of organizations."
Junior,4,"Rutgers Newark is my absolute second home. Generally, the environment makes one feel at home, especially because of the diversity. My favorite thing about Rutgers Newark is they advocate for human rights and teach people to think for themselves. The pre-health community with their opportunities for students also makes them very strong. Something that can be improved is the parking situation- the parking lots that don't cost $600 are very far, and the buses are not always there in the times we need them. Another aspect I would work on is the availability of affordable and healthy food around campus."
Junior,4,I have a great time in the city of Newark and the school manages to embrace the business and the city culture well.
Freshman,4,My professors last semester are consistently reaching out to their students and offering opportunities for our future.
Alum,4,"Being in the heart of Newark, the campus's location made accessible to a lot of different options for food and relaxing in between classes. The four years I spent in undergraduate studies at Rutgers were some of the best years of my life. The classes were rigorous, but worthwhile. I've been able to network with numerous colleagues thanks to the easy access to various programs."
Freshman,4,"The thing I love most about Rutgers is its diversity. You're able to experience many different cultures at one University. The classes are very interesting and the professors do great at their job. Overall, Rutgers Newark is a great college to attend."
Junior,4,"As a part-student living in the central jersey, I didn't have much choice. Rutgers Newark wouldn't be my choice if I were a full-time student. My impression of the school after spending 2 semesters is ""not so bad"""
Freshman,4,"I loved the Newark experience. I always wanted to go to a college in a city, and this is exactly what I had in mind. I love the diversity, you see students from all over the world and it is something that is very appealing to the masses."
Senior,4,"As a Rutgers New Brunswick alumni, I thought coming to Rutgers for my nursing degree would be similar- this was far from the case.  Regarding academics, this program is distinct in that it prepares students for the NCLEX exam while receiving a bachelors within 14 months. The professors have taught me invaluable skills and practice that I intend to apply in a clinical setting. My least favorite part about the program is the local area. My particular school is not in an area with a ""campus-like"" feel which can be isolating. Overall, I believe I've gained insight on the rigor and prestige of this university which will make me 'stand out' once in the field."
Freshman,4,"I guess this place is great. It's an above-average school with really friendly people and some really interesting professors. The downside is that if you have a bad professor once he/she gets you ticked off, it will get worse so be careful of that but yeah it's a great place."
Junior,4,My experience has been fairly good. I have had some wonderful professors and I have passed every single course with an A or B. One thing that I would like to see change is more online courses for undergraduate classes.
Alum,4,"I attended Rutgers University between 2005 and 2009 as an undergraduate and then again between 2015 and 2016 for the Master's SPAA program. I had a great experience, the professors were very knowledgeable and the advisers really helped me when I needed. There was always something going on during the common hours and the school itself was very diverse."
Junior,4,"My college experience is great!  I am taking my Rutgers classes at the local County Community  College.   The classes are at night time.I am getting the best of  both worlds.  I get to live at home, get my bachelor's degree, work at the same business for several years and save money.  I didn't incur all the other expense's  like a student that went away  to school does.  The advisor is wonderful and very helpful. The professors are ok."
Freshman,4,Rutgers University - Newark has a friendly environment and provides a positive attitude toward improving your education and overall knowledge in the career you pursue
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student at Rutgers Newark, I really appreciate the effort that the faculty puts into making the student environment and learning experience the best they possibly can.  Because my program is only 20 students, there is a lot of feedback-based and individualized learning.  The professors are really focused on producing competent young professionals and focus both on classroom and professional development.  There are also a lot of opportunities to grow and develop soft skills that are useful in future job opportunities."
Junior,4,What I love about Rutgers - Newark is how small the campus is compared to the New Brunswick campus. I feel as if we are closer to each other and it's easier to stay connected with each other. I love how diverse it is and how that puts many topics into different perspectives. I have learned many things academic wise and life wise.
Junior,4,I love how diverse Rutgers Newark is. People might say how my school isn't in the best location but I always feel save. The Academics are wonderful! I love all the awesome people I have met at this University!
Freshman,4,"There are many resources on campus if you take advantage and look/ask for them. Some of the professors are very knowledgable, but others need some work. If the professor is not effectively teaching or being fair, the Department of the subject is 100% willing to listen and help the students. The campus is VERY diverse, which is great. Although Newark has a bad reputation, the campus feels safe. The area is appealing and clean, with good security around it. Student life is great, as there is often an activity/event taking place. Also, Newark likes to keep the campus alive by enjoying parties."
Sophomore,4,Rutgers University is the top school for diversity and academics. The campus is not as large as the other Rutger's campuses which makes it very easy to get to k ow everyone.
Freshman,4,"Rutgers University - Newark, has made a brand off of its diversity and it holds true. While on campus you will run into students from a multitude of backgrounds and ethnicities, which is why I love this school so much. Like any other college, the rigor of courses is strenuous but if one is determined to succeed anything is possible. Rutgers also has a ton of resources for students."
Graduate Student,4,"Rutgers is a hub for innovation and research. The professors especially the ones in the school of nursing are the best! the proximity to New York City makes Rutgers a perfect school for young people. Students looking to work also have a lot of choices. The Prudential Center is close by, major hospitals are a walking distance and many places to eat."
Graduate Student,4,"Loved the diversity and inclusion at this University! This is one of the most diverse college campuses in the United States and promotes inclusiveness and tolerance among students and faculty members. Great urban campus in the heart of the financial district of Newark. There is new construction happening all the time and there are great spots for coffee, lunch, dinner, as well as night life. Rutgers provides renowned education for its students and most professors deeply care about their students. There is an issue with parking on campus, but I hope that will be rectified soon."
Junior,4,Everyone is like a family and nice to each other. It's so easy to make new friends. Nothing I would change
Junior,4,"Going to Rutgers University Newark has provided me with a good college experience. Although I don't get a lot of time to be on campus often (due to me having to work/commuting) I always have a good time while there. I've learned a lot from the great professors, who usually care about the students and their standing within the class(so long as your willing to put in the work). I've even had a professor who cared so much as to help me narrow down my search in a college degree. I've also made a lot of friends who i consider to be life long, some even helping me make it through tough times in my life while here."
Senior,4,A great campus that offers great resources. This campus offers students the ability to connect with others of various backgrounds. It is diverse enough so that everyone can find a home away from home. Professors know you by name instead of a number.
Graduate Student,4,It is a great University with excellent teacher and resources. The student formation is remarkable and its location is very accessible.
Alum,4,"All of the professors that helped me earn my Bachelor's degree at Rutgers were truly wonderful and caring. They were some of the best teachers I've ever had, and I am grateful for the experiences and the knowledge they provided me with. I was an off-campus student, so I didn't have much involvement with the Newark campus, but I know that this is a school that I was proud to attend."
Junior,4,"Rutgers Newark is an amazing school. The school is extremely diverse and has activities for everyone on campus.  The professors in my major, environmental science, are extremely knowledgeable and it's an honor to be taught by them.  As a commuter, my only real issue is that there is never enough parking for the students.  We always seem to be hit with tickets for the time passing on the meter, or the lots being full and just having nowhere to park.  I also feel as if being a commuter makes it just a little harder for you to socialize while in school.  There are not enough commuter related activities provided for us and sometimes that takes away from our college experience.  Aside from being a commuter and having those few issues, Rutgers Newark is my school of choice and I am glad I transfered over from my pervious school in order to have the pleasure of attending Rutgers."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the diversity that was around. It was actually one of the most diverse schools I've attended in a while. The campus is not too large so you can easily find your way around. The gym or the golden dome is very amazing, most professors are really nice and actually care about you. Lastly there is almost always something new happening on campus, different activities highlighting many cultures, just a good college to choose overall."
Freshman,4,"It is a very welcoming school for those who are not sure where to go to in their college journey. Aside from it being very homey, it is also well established in terms of academics."
Junior,4,"The diversity at Rutgers-Newark is one of the reasons why I chose to attend school here. The campus atmosphere is something that all students dream of having and I have been lucky enough to get accepted here. The school's curriculum is, in my opinion, is one of the best in terms of how it connects with students. When I graduate, I can honestly say I will have gotten enough knowledge about the professional world in order to further excel in the field of journalism."
Senior,4,"My experience af Rutgers Newark has been a quiet one. I am a commuter so there is little time to socialize with people. But the time I do have, I have made some great friends. Because the school is so small, it provides a great environment to meet new people and experience life. The school is in the center of many famous places in Newark which makes it a good walking distance. It feels homey and safe because of the friendliness and awareness of the people here."
Freshman,4,"Rutgers Newark is the most diverse campus in the nation, and it has been for many years in a row. I dorm on campus and can definitely say it is very diverse. The student population as well as the staff population is very diverse in race, religion, ethnic background, etc. The professors make themselves available and are very open to giving help. The oncampus tutoring is very helpful as well as the on campus counseling and health center. The only thing that would make this school even better would be having more student organizations and clubs. It has a very limited variety or clubs and organizations even for a small campus."
Freshman,4,"I like Rutgers- Newark's Diversity, because I love how diverse it is. So it enables us as students to learn about multiple cultures, and Rutgers-Newark encourages us as students to learn about the different cultures through the organizations.When it comes to student life I love it because it is a small enough school that you will know most of you peers, and everyone is friendly. Overall, the professors are good they help you as much as they can but you as a student have to pout in the work to achieve your goals in life."
Freshman,4,Professors are amazing. They will help students with whatever they need. They have a lot of clubs and student organizations for students to join.
Senior,4,Small classes but still challenging. It’s the most diverse campus in the nation and the the professors are invested in education.
Senior,4,"I liked the diversity in rutgers although the parking situation could be better handled, overall the education at rutgers was great!"
Freshman,4,"This school is great for what it's worth. The tuition of going to another school for a year is equivalent to going to Rutgers for four years, specifically because of its ease of commuting. This school also has the unique quality of being extremely diverse, arguably the most diverse in the nation. Being in this school forces you to be open-minded about different ideologies, people, cultures, religions, races, genders, etc. This school also has connections to huge financial firms, if you are interested in business."
Sophomore,4,"I like how Rutgers-Newark is diverse and how everyone is accepted no matter what gender,race, or ethnicity they are. I also like how the classroom sizes are small and intimate so students can have close relationships with the professor."
Freshman,4,its more diversified university and close to NYC worlds biggest finance head quarters and expecting to get more opportunities. I have got a chance to meet athnicity from all over the world and learned so much.
Junior,4,"Honestly, this college is great. I wish when they had events they took them more seriously. I feel like the vendors they hire are for high school or even middle school children instead of mature young adults. The education is challenging and great, the instructors all vary but want their students to succeed. I would recommend this college."
Sophomore,4,Rutgers University has been an enjoyable experience so far. The university itself is very dedicated in helping the students achieve their goals. The professors are very helpful and make sure that their students are learning things that they can actually use in the long run. The campus is very diverse and it has many events and clubs to join.
Junior,4,"Rutger University- Newark is what you make of it for the most part. If you are looking for resources and opportunities, you can definitely find that (you may run into some very unfriendly staff along the way, however the professors are generally caring and super knowledgeable). If you are looking for long term friends (the campus is diverse) or just the party scene, you will find it. However, what you will not find is school spirit or a definite scene of safety (which is one of the biggest take aways, many dormers opt to go home on weekends). But it is what you make it, you can have fun, learn, and experience here if you want it."
Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, I have taken all classes online due to COVID. I think it works well for some people but I personally struggled a lot learning remotely. There would be a lot of technical issues. The program we used to monitor us during an exam would sometimes crash in the middle of taking the exam. It was stressful."
Sophomore,2,"Overall , I would not say it is a positive experience. I paid for an education that I feel I am not receiving which is disappointing. I have been charged for campus/other fees I have not used.  I feel like Rutgers was not prepared for the pandemic. There were many technical issues. We had meetings with the dean to discuss issues we as students are experiencing. The responses we would get from staff would be unclear. It was very frustrating. Despite all the negative, I think the professors are nice and helpful."
Junior,2,"I didn't like online classes at all! Well, that's an overstatement since I did take one online class that I did enjoy; however, that was tailored to be an online class since the get-go. The classes  I didn't enjoy were the ones that were made online because of the Virus. I feel that these classes translated poorly to a virtual classroom. Maybe it was because of the short time in which teachers had to reivest their class structure or that it just does not hold the same value as a face-to-face lecture."
Sophomore,2,"Honestly, the school does not function very efficiently. The business school is great, yet the faculty that runs the university does an extremely poor job. The school is nice and so are most of the professors, yet the executive committee running the school is horrendous because of how poorly they work. Their entire system and though processes for their offices are super bad. They don't know how to be organized and on top of that, the people are rude and can care less about you. There are only a handful of people I have personally seen that truly care. The rest just get by the day and ""do their jobs."" The people suck, school is nice. They need a new management change asap."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics is not a big thing at Rutgers Newark. We are a D3 school and we do not have a football team, so sports isn't really payed attention to by the students. No one comes out to support or schools games. And we don't have much school spirit. I don't think that we would have to funding to get a football team, but if we could have more events and pride/spirit programs, I think students will be more invested in athletics."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There need to be updates, but everything you need is there.  Just an updated needed!"
College Sophomore,2,"They are mostly bad, however, some of them are really great at the same time."
College Sophomore,2,No one really knows of it/
College Sophomore,2,greek life is not big here
College Sophomore,2,I feel like this year our safety was not good. We are more aware but i feel like our security measures can be much better. I am scared to walk around sometimes after my night classes.
College Senior,2,"I've never been a sports oriented person and athletics were never the thing I was looking forward to in college—my expectations were met perfectly. Rutgers Newark doesn't really have an active athletic life. The basketball team makes a hullaballoo every once in a while, but honestly I went my entire experience without really caring about it and I don't think I missed anything. Only the athletes and their immediate friends really care."
College Junior,2,I do not think School Spirit for the team exists..
College Freshman,2,"If you live in Woodward, if you are or were a freshman, you will live with mice. Aside from that problem the building in generally as clean as you keep it."
College Freshman,2,They play a very small part of the school's life. Also they are isolated and far off from the school making it extremely difficult for their publicity
College Junior,2,"The cafeteria does not have a lot of options, and most of them are pretty unhealthy. There are barely any restaurants or cafes around campus."
College Freshman,2,Make sure you keep calling them and going because the financial aid process at Rutgers really sucks.
College Sophomore,2,I don't have a meal plan. So I pay out of pocket whenever I need to eat something. However all the surrounding restaurants are horrible including the food trucks. On top of being horrible its expensive. Sometimes I rather just go hungry until I get home.
College Freshman,2,"The food in Stonsby is horrible. Students pay too much to eat poor quality food. It isn't fair that Rutgers Newark Funding goes to Rutgers New Brunswick because they are the main campus. We are here and we exist too. We too are humans, and we should be treated as such. It is disappointing and takes away from the college experience. Often times students have to go into their own pockets to purchase food. That money that we used to purchase food could be going towards school expenses such as books But we have no other chose but to."
College Senior,2,There is very little school spirit at Rutgers Newark. Most people are commuters and go home after classes are over.
College Senior,2,"The food around campus is pretty bad, Starbucks is usually my last resort and it is way too expensive for a college budget."
College Junior,2,"Not a good neighborhood, but good job opportunities in medical/health care careers."
College Junior,2,Mostly fast/junk food in the area. You have to prepare your own meals/snacks if you are interested in eating healthy.
College Freshman,2,Police should be on campus at all times.
College Freshman,2,There are many assaults and robberies.
College Freshman,2,Ghetto city with many robberies
College Freshman,2,They don't really give out scholarships
Recent Alumnus,2,"Hot summers and long, cold winters full of snow."
College Freshman,2,There's 6 spots that are free throughout the whole campus
College Freshman,2,"Newark isn't a safe town but if you stay on campus you'll be good, you can also venture out to njit."
College Junior,2,"Unless you follow the teams schedules online you will not know when and where anyone is playing, unless by word of mouth or someone in a dorm organizes a group to go to a game."
College Senior,2,The snow removal took too long and parking was limited.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not safe to walk around Newark at night, which makes it difficult to experience nightlife."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Again, Newark isn't the best city. The city is rundown, but at the same time, it feels like it has a lot of potential. The proximity to NYC is nice. However, the city has a very drab and dreary feel to it."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not house around campus, live at home."
College Freshman,2,I don't go to parties so I wouldn't know
College Junior,2,At my school there are a lot of robbery. It is not very safe and students are held gun point at times when they walk the streets. I get scared staying on campus on this campus.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is so annoying. You have to make sure you pay the meters or park in the Rutgers parking garage but even if you have a permit, space is never guaranteed. "
College Sophomore,2,they dont give as much
College Sophomore,2,It is hard to find parking space
College Junior,2,"It's nearly impossible to get the classes you need during the semester; probably because it's such a popular major, but none the less, the school could make more of an effort to help students who are obviously in need of specific classes. Other than that, the major itself is very interesting, and so are the classes when you actually get to take them"
College Junior,2,The f-aid office is a mess.
College Sophomore,2,"Newark is not the safest town.  The campus itself is very secure, but as for the town it's located in, not so much.  Venturing off campus can be very dangerous."
College Junior,2,Still working on financial aid. the staff at the school is not very helpful. Have to call to confirm every detail. They are not forthcoming with information.
College Junior,2,It is in Newark. Surrounding city has bad areas. Campus is fine. Some good places to eat. Up and coming.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much to do around the campus. There are a few events held by the school, but besides that it's pretty boring. Thankfully Rutgers Newark is filled with interesting and colorful students who make up for this problem. The campus needs more places for students to eat and socialize."
College Sophomore,2,There are programs like the Writing Center to help students with their English classes. The campus  tends to look like a ghost town starting Friday and begins to repopulate on Sunday night.
College Freshman,2,The basketball and soccer as well as the track team are excellent. everyone goes to the games so there's still school spirit. This school doesnt have a football team but we all go to the games in new brunswick. The train station isn't far so we all take the train to new brunswick to watch the games.It's not bad.
College Sophomore,2,"For me, the university did an average job at the dining halls. Sometimes there is not much variety. However, there were menus of take-out at the entrance of the dorming halls for students to peruse. Also, there was a very quaint, hip, and affordable sushi place 2 blocks away from campus that delivered and that was very convenient."
College Sophomore,2,I am involved in an engineering program with Rutgers-New Brunswick in which I am to complete two years in Rutgers-Newark and the rest at Rutgers-New Brunswick. I am not too pleased with this because I wish I would be able to continue my education at Rutgers-Newark but the university does not currently offer the resources for my major.
College Senior,2,"Most of the time when the weather gets critical in the winter, classes are not cancelled. It is honestly terrible for commuters because the roads are bad to drive on and public transportation is delayed. But in the past year, this has changed somewhat because we did get a couple of snow days."
College Senior,2,"Rutgers Newark is an urban campus, like NYU in NYC. Unfortunately, Newark has fallen into economic troubles and the area immediately around Rutgers, while good for a few hours of entertainment, wouldn't be good for frequent hangouts. There isn't much to do/see."
College Junior,2,"I always walk in a group when I can. I do not feel totally unsafe, however there is a history of minor crimes. Mostly intimidation and nothing too serious. It is still wise to be on the safe side. The campus can be safer, but it is not ""dangerous""."
College Junior,2,"I commute, so I still live with my mother. So i can''t really answer this question"
College Junior,2,Public transportation in Newark sucks. But what are you going to do?
College Sophomore,2,Unlike brunswik almost every sport is d3 in newark besides volleyball(what i remember off the top of my head). school spirit is okay theres usually a decent home crowd at home ball games.
College Freshman,2,i wasted a lot of time trying to get some fanciable aid but in the end i ended up with one loan for 2000 after all that work was not worth it i suggest finding someone that knows how to do it and ask them to help you.
Recent Alumnus,2,"When it does snow, the campus can do a better job @ notifying students on cancelled classes."
College Junior,2,"Needs Work – Financial Aid office is always headache, long lines..etc"
College Sophomore,2,"Too Much Stress – The amount of financial aid I get varies every semester. This semester I happened to get a very significant increase in the amount of financial aid than in my previous semesters. Although I am pretty satisfied with the amount of finanical aid I got this semester, the process of getting to that amount was not easy. I had to make constant trips to the finanicial aid office to fill out forms in my request of recieving more aid. It was stressful being that I do not live on campus during the times when my term bills are due. The cost and time of transportation to my school was very stressful. I would have liked if the process was completed in a one time visit."
College Sophomore,2,Unhealthy Choices – the choices are unhealthy but cheap and convenient
Senior,1,The professors had to learn how to adapt to the computers and teach online. Many would just record their lectures and say to email them with any questions. basically if you are unable to teach yourself in the course you will not do so well.
Sophomore,1,"The commute above all else was awful for me.  However, in regards to the school itself, I found that the environment was abysmal, and both the students and teachers seem not to care about anything rather than getting a degree or earning a paycheck.  I would not recommend and I have already begun applying for transfer."
College Junior,1,There is no party scene.
College Freshman,1,Do not recommend to anyone
College Senior,1,Incredibly difficult to successfully find any help and you'll be left to your own devices.
College Freshman,1,There's worse areas but I would never live here
College Freshman,1,The dining options here are very terrible
College Freshman,1,It's an unsafe area with little attractions for the students.
College Sophomore,1,No one is ever here. It's deserted during the weekends. Not worth the money or college experience.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus crime is horrible, but his is Newark."
College Freshman,1,"No parking availablity, and of by chance there is, it's expensive."
College Freshman,1,"Many restaurants around campus are usually expensive, costly, and low quality. It's also inconvenient to go off campus dining."
College Sophomore,1,I do not receive any financial aid.
College Junior,1,There is really no help on off-campus housing at all unless you live on campus. The resident assistants help a lot with any questions and guide you where to go for specific things. The off campus jobs would be done by the student and not the people working for the university. 
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible, cars are broken into all the time, and you pay $200 to park there."
College Junior,1,"Newark, is not safe at all, students cars are always broken in to. There are also a lot of arm robbers, where student’s cell phone and money are taken."
College Junior,1,Our campus is un Newark. It is kind of safe during the day but at night not at all. I need the police to escort me to my car. I even cannot hold my phone when walking
College Sophomore,1,Parking is scarse even in the University parking garages. You need to arrive early in the day to find a spot in the garage or on the street
College Freshman,1,"Park is NOT FREE! There are free spots on campus but finding them can be very tedious and annoying. There are parking lots but you either need a parking permit, which is expensive or pay the daily fee, which isn't worth it at all. There are spots with parking meters if you REALLY need to park, I recommend those spots."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Since Rutgers Newark is a commuter school there is limited parking available. There are parking decks, but there are not enough parking spaces offered. Street side parking used to be free, now theres meter parking which I believe should be eliminated."

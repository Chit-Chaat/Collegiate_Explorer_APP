Senior,5,"CSUF is a very good university in Orange County. The classes are excellent. CSUF also has many departments for different majors from business, engineering, to art. On-campus activities are diverse with a wide range of student clubs and organizations. The tuition is affordable."
Junior,5,"As a recent Business Admin CC Transfer, I've been welcomed warmly by the Titan community. I initially wanted to go to a UC for business, but I am very content with my decision to attend CSUF because of how the curriculum is very up to date with business and how hands-on they are with students. 

I feel very supported at this school with all the resources to have a successful future."
Junior,5,"It is definitely a tough time adjusting, so all of my professors have been very understanding. They are there to answer any questions and even have the option to schedule 1 on 1 Zoom calls to understand concepts."
Sophomore,5,"This was my first choice dream schol and I am pleased to stay that it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. All professors are true professionals who really want the best for their students. They are there to guide, inform, and of course educate. The campus is beautiful, clean, with plenty of resources and amenities that make any day easier to take on. The general atmosphere is very friendly, everyone has their own path but it truly feels like one community."
Sophomore,5,"I am an art education major and I can honestly say that all my professors that I have had so far are incredibly intelligent, passionate, and talented in theri respective fields and specialties. Every class feels like a look into another universe- I learn so much. There is no ""busy work"", filler talk, or easy A- it's an atmosphere of knowledge through and through."
Junior,5,I like that all of the professors are very well versed in their fields as well as they are always willing to take the time to help you in your studies. The staff here really does want you to succeed. They really drive diversity and provide opportunities to create more as well. Our athletics programs are top notch as well. Downtown Fullerton is a great hangout spot along with Disneyland and the beach that ae pretty much right down the street.
Junior,5,"First, I like that the staff and students are all very kind. I have gone to schools where simply asking directions has given me nothing but ignored. The campus itself is very beautiful and clean. I love the fact that it's a smoke free campus as well. Overall, it is a wonderful school."
Junior,5,"When we first had to turn into online only classes, I was concerned it would be too difficult, however the professors were very kind and did everything they could to ease the process. The adapted very well and made sure they could could do everything so that we all could have a maximum learning experience without being physically present. One example is one professor who set out multiple sessions where he would be available to give tutoring and answer any questions. Another set out a chat where students could connect to him directly in case of any questions."
Sophomore,5,"Professors have adjusted very well to online teaching and have eased in the students very nicely . Some teachers will do online meetings on zoom and some of the teachers will have assignments and power points posted. Overall whichever method the teachers chose, you are able to tell they have gone through some great training."
Sophomore,5,Amazing school that cares for each one of their students. Awesome professors who know exactly what they teach
Freshman,5,"As a 20202 freshman at CSUF, I really appreciate how the professors and administrators have done an amazing job handling the transition from in class to a full virtual school year and have been very understanding and patient with students that have a hard time accessing the virtual classes. 
I don't think I'd change a thing and I can't wait till we’re back on campus !"
Alum,5,"My experience at CSUF was excellent. The Steven G Mihaylo Hall is where all the business classes are held and I loved it. The coursework was challenging and the professors were helpful. I think the Entertainment and Tourism Management option for business majors needs to be split into two options: either entertainment or tourism, to better serve students and the industries they want to pursue. The new rec center is awesome. Various clubs on campus exist."
Senior,5,"CSUF is an amazing school with a very diverse student body, and amazing facilities that are accessible to all students! The library is quite impressive with it even having an online database for students to access anywhere. The facilities accessible to students are all covered in the tuition and one can enjoy everything from the Titan Student Union to the Titan Recreation Center or even the Arboretum! Professors at this university are amazing and will try to push students to their absolute maximum potential, with many professor becoming very influential role models and even connections for real world jobs and references!"
Freshman,5,It was difficult to sign up for classes online as the website did crash and many students couldn’t get their classes but I enjoyed the classes
Freshman,5,Kind of stressful at first but enjoyed the program the system to sign up for classes was stressful as it was not explained to freshmen
Sophomore,5,"After the one year that I spent at this school and having it been cut short by Covid-19, I really enjoyed my time at this college! Everyone was so kind and welcoming when you get there and as long as you join clubs and plan on meeting people you will have a great time."
Alum,5,"I loved online classes, professors made it easy to understand what to do and also made it easy to get in contact with them. The school system was easy to use and used throughout the entire school for almost every class. It was easier to access documents and school work."
Alum,5,"I LOVE CSUF! Would highly recommend, I met lots of great students and had great professors as well. Everyone is very helpful and knowledgeable. The students were pleasant to be around and the professors were good at explaining and being available. The environment was the best and the campus in general is beautiful."
Alum,5,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at California State University Fullerton. The instructors I had while at CSUF were very caring and it was evident that they enjoyed teaching their subject. I also made so many wonderful memories while at CSUF; one of which was being able to attend a week-long study abroad trip in Costa Rica in which we created lesson plans for children in a low socio-economic elementary school. When it was time to graduate I was very sad to be leaving CSUF but very excited to be graduating with my Bachelor's of Science in Child and Adolescent Development.
Junior,5,"The online classes I took online are cool, and the professors are very good at teaching the class the material."
Junior,5,"The online classes I took online are cool, and the professors are very good at teaching the class the material."
Freshman,5,"As of  right now, I have not started any of my online courses. I look forward to beginning them in the fall, but I cannot accurately rate Fullerton on an aspect I have not experienced."
Freshman,5,"I am going to be attending CSUF this year, 2020. So far in the current situation we are in they have been so very helpful. I have zoom sessions with advisor to help me register for classes and people who are currently attending the school have reached out to help me. People from clubs have also reached out and asked me to join. It has been super helpful."
Junior,5,I personally had a good experience in my first semester in CSUF. In the beginning I only had one online class but due to COVID-19 I had to take my other classes online as well. My classes on campus were good and my classes online was good too. I had a very good experience this Spring 2020 semester.
Junior,5,"I am currently attending California State University, Fullerton and I love it! What I love most is the campus because it is not as big as other universities."
Junior,5,I had to switch over to online classes during the spring semester in 2020 and the professors gave us leniency due to COVID-19.
Freshman,5,What I like about it is that it is a really good college for natural science or any type of STEM majors and they give lots of emails on whats going on in the school and current upcoming events.
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience was definitely a breeze. I am more comfortable with technology and the ease of completing all of the assignments and tests at home enabled me more time to dedicate it towards my studies. However, I did think that taking math courses online were fairly tricky as some of the equations required on assignments were incorrectly read by the computer. This type of problem would not have occurred had the assignment given been a take-home or in-class task."
Alum,5,My experience with this university was great. There were an abundance of resources available to ensure students' academic success. There were also many opportunities to gain research experience that would help prepare students for graduate school.
Alum,5,"I did not take online classes before graduating from the university. However, I heard positive reviews from many students regarding the online learning format."
Sophomore,5,"During this pandemic, all of my classes have been switched online. All of my classes haven't been too difficult. Not only have my professors offered extra office hours to help, some of my professors even offered extra resources to help understand the material."
Sophomore,5,"Despite being a bit skeptical at first, California State Fullerton has had nothing but opportunities open for all kinds of students. The library has different kinds of rooms to reserve if studying or having a meeting with students for a big project. I personally like how the school gives multiple options to students to get things done."
Alum,5,I took three classes online and found them to be doable. The professors replied quickly to any of our questions and provided our assignment deadlines with enough time to complete them.
Sophomore,5,I was forced to finish my classes online due to COVID19 and the professors were excellent.  Even thou these professors were doing this for the first time they were able to manage and master their way through it all.  I have been very satisfied with the result of my education at CSUF.
Sophomore,5,Fullerton has provided a strong educational program and a very supported staff to back it up. I have been received not only as a student but as a family at  CSUF.
Junior,5,Overall a very welcoming place and I would highly recommend to anyone that may be transferring or coming in as a freshman. All the professors are friendly and willing to help!
Junior,5,Cal state fullerton has adapted quite well and offers a pretty painless online learning platform. All of the professors are tech savvy enough to be able to still aid you.
Senior,5,I love my online classes and the freedom to earn my degree without having to go to the campus all the time.
Senior,5,I love my school. It has the best professors and programs. The campy is really modern and accommodating. Cost is low. What is there not to love.
Junior,5,When transitioning to an online learning environment during COVID-19 professors did a great job especially in the Anthropology department. They made classes engaging and equal to in person sessions.
Graduate Student,5,Everything was very organized and teachers were always available and willing to help. You could tell they really wanted you to succeed.
Graduate Student,5,I loved my time at California State University Fullerton. I did have trouble with limited class availability but the classes themselves were great.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed my first year of college, it is a beautiful campus and it is very diverse as a community. There are lots of places to eat and hang out with friends and study on campus."
Freshman,5,"CSU Fullerton is a really good school. The professors really care about the students and are willing to help anyone. The atmosphere of the campus is also great because students are extremely friendly and outgoing. Overall, the vibe while at campus is very good."
Senior,5,"Cal state Fullerton makes a student feel like at home. The staff is always there to help you, and students are mostly always friendly and willing to help. The environment is pleasant, as the campus is pleasant. Classes can become overwhelming but there are always resources and workshops to help. Parking can be challenging, but it improves every semester."
Senior,5,Cal State University of Fullerton is a school of great diversity and has very clean and well structured dorms. The campus is very big and vast and everyone is very dedicated to their studies.
Freshman,5,"When you enter college, you may feel scared and alone in such a new and big place. It is important for college students to be knowledgeable of the programs provided at our institution and how the involvement can shape a person in many ways. Greek life allows you to explore what your campus has to offer and can teach you life lessons that other organizations can’t do in the same ways. The impact that greek life has had on me as a person is tremendous. Involvement in philanthropies and leadership can really give students great experience in charity and planning events. I believe that greek life is beneficial for college experience and teaches students lessons learned can carry on into adulthood."
Freshman,5,Cal State Fullerton is a great campus. There are so many friendly people and so many activities on campus. The professors are kind and really take the time to help their students. I would love to dive into more clubs and experience more cultures.
Alum,5,Campus is beautiful! They offer many different resources needed to fit unique individual. Their Dean of Students stays well connected with us. I never had an issue with enrolling in the classes I needed. They are building a new parking structure which is a must and would've been my only complain. All professors were helpful and dedicated to their students.
Alum,5,Diverse study body with excellent teachers. CSUF is a great school for those who want to get involved with student clubs. Easily some of the greatest 4 years of my life spent here.
Freshman,5,OVerall it was very fun and all of my proffersors were very nice and understanding and the parties were great along with the campus food. .
Senior,5,"CSUF is an amazing school with very supportive professors and faculty. The campus is very nice and safe, and everyone there is welcoming and friendly."
Junior,5,"I am still attending CSUF, and I personally think this is a great school. My major is Criminal Justice, and so far I have gotten all the help that I am provided. The professors here are very helpful and informative about everything. The campus is always clean! Its not too big and its not too small, it is the perfect size campus."
Junior,5,I really liked the campus because it is so diverse which is really important because people will not feel left out or discriminated. Something that needs improvement in this campus is parking. A lot if not most people that attend this university are always struggling with parking because there are a lot of people that attend this campus and there is not a lot of parking spaces/structures for every person that commutes to campus.
Senior,5,"I liked the environment and the resources that were made available for students. However, I would like to see more cultural events and celebrations."
Junior,5,My experience at CSUF has been great. The teacher I've had so far in my time there have been very helpful. There are a lot of activities the campus has. Lots of places to study comfortably.
Freshman,5,"What I liked about California State University Fullerton was the diversity between the students and staff. I grew up in a community where they wasn't many ethnicities so seeing that in my college made me proud. What I wished would change about California State University Fullerton is the parking. Many students including myself have to take away that extra hours of sleep to arrive to school way earlier before class just to find parking and not spending thirty minutes to an hour cruising around the parking structures. Instead, I think the school should install sensor lights above the parking spots with the colors red and green indicating if the spot is taken or not."
Freshman,5,"As a first year, I already love my campus. The diversity is community and resources available are incredible. Perhaps the best CSU to attend. I always felt safe in the dorm and made friends quite easily. The student life is great."
Sophomore,5,"All of the professors and faculty care and connect with the students. The academic atmosphere here is welcoming and while it challenges students, it is not overly pressured. The connections among the students themselves are not as prevalent as they may be compared to other universities, mostly due to the fact that it is a commuter school."
Freshman,5,"I love this school because it is very welcoming. The professors really care about their students even in a class of 300. It is a very diverse school, and you never feel like an anomaly."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, and despite what’s been going on in our economy and Covid currently taken place, professors and counselors have been super helpful and have made this year amazing so far"
Senior,4,"Because of the pandemic, most classes are now conducted virtually. Professors have tried to adjust the class's structure to better fit with the situation. However, an in-person interactive classroom is still a better college experience than studying through Zoom."
Junior,4,"While our school has gone completely online, the professors that I've had the pleasure of learning from have done an excellent job of using online forums, zoom, and video assignments to make our transition easy."
Freshman,4,"Fullerton offers great courses and not only has a very diverse student community but also diverse professors and staff. The diversity is the thing that I really love the most sense most of my life I was just in a one ethnicity heavy concentrated schools, including the teachers. I have had a tour of the campus and it is very firm on safety and to make sure the students feel safe and are open to talk to our local authorities. The professors are giving it their all every single day to teach which is really inspiring."

Sophomore,4,Great school . Nice campus and great teachers overall. With online learning you can’t be on campus which is unfortunate but overall the people here care about you .
Freshman,4,"Well, because of the pandemic all of my classes are virtual and so far all my professors have done a great job helping us transition from in class to online. For me, online learning is a little harder for me to understand because I personally just work better in an in class setting, but the professor all offer office hours and usually email back within 24hrs if you ever have any questions, which helps me out a lot."
Freshman,4,Online learning has been an overall positive experience. The classes have translated well from learning in the classroom to learning online and I'm still able to learn effectively.
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty diverse and the campus has a nice location. However, due to the student body being so large, it can be difficult for the school and staff to reach all of their students."
Freshman,4,"So far at California state university, I have found a helpful facility in the school. Though I believe that the school is a bit strong when it comes to political preference which I believe that they should be non-bias on the subject."
Senior,4,"The online program is amazing, and is currently in a transition period from the previous system Titanium to Canvas, and while the transition is not easy, it has been managed in a very respectable way. Professors are constantly communicating with students and updating their classes as need be."
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience was not too bad as the professors were really lenient with assignments especially in the transition during the shutdown.
Senior,4,"My overall experience at California State University, Fullerton has been great. I am a graphic design major set to graduate in Fall '20. I have been at CSUF since Spring of 2017 after transferring from Irvine Valley College.

The professors at CSUF are incredible. They inspire to you to be better and challenge yourself. As a graphic design major you are always challenged to deviate from the norm. The best advice I ever got from a professor is ""nothing is more dangerous than having only one idea"". I carry this with me whenever I do a project and will carry it with me in the professional world. I will have more satisfied clients who I can present multiple ideas for them to choose from."
Senior,4,"My school convertted to online classes in mid-March. So far the experience, although limiting, is still engaging with the right professors. They are able to keep the same enthusiasm so students do not feel bored. I also appreciate that they modify their curriculum to fit the current times and not stress out students.

I am currently taking an online summer class where our professor has been flexible in regards to the curriculum and situations happening in student's personal lives."
Junior,4,"This school has great professors, a very clean and modern campus, and great class availability. The food is average, it's alot of fast food options, like Carl's Jr., Panda etc. 

One thing I would say is that tuition is more expensive during the COVID pandemic and although I've tried reaching out for financial help, no one has gotten back to me."
Sophomore,4,"Teachers are very understandable since the courses are online. As long as you turn in assignments before a mandatory due date, you're fine. If there are any problems, always email and try to figure things out. Overall very chill if you can focus. A few hours and you'll get a lot done."
Sophomore,4,"Firstly parking, terrible. GET THERE EARLY. The people there are chill and some of the nicest people. Teachers are so sweet once you get to know them. Rate my professor will be the best thing in choosing those professors. Super safe with campus security. The campus itself is rather safe."
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes while at California State University Fullerton. Instructors, however, do use the online portal to post the syllabus, assignments and sometimes quizzes. I always felt it was very convenient to have access to class content at any time."
Junior,4,"California State University, Fullerton was a great learning environment to be part of. It was an amazing experience to be a titan"
Senior,4,The school environment is a commute school. Not many people talk to eachother unless they are associated through some sort of club or class.
Senior,4,I actually really enjoy the transition to online classes at Fullerton. They make the teachers try harder and actually challenge them to teach in a different way. It shows them that it is not easy for students so they have more sympathy.
Freshman,4,"Although I haven't had much experience with my college as a whole, as I'm an incoming Freshman, the majority of my experiences have been positive. The staff and administration are friendly and approachable. Even with COVID-19, they are attentive and respond to emails and calls expediently. However, the process of enrollment and communication with Freshman as a whole is a little confusing."
Junior,4,Tradition to online was seemless and easy for the most part. I had no major problems throughout the semester that my professors could not help me with.
Junior,4,I love the school. COVID 19 invaded on my first semester however. My professors were extremely helpful and accommodating throughout the entire semester
Freshman,4,"So far my experience has been very enjoyable and easy.Zoom sessions with alumni, current students, and advisors has been so helpful with my admission."
Junior,4,I really love how the campus looks and I get to meet knew people and new professors. It is a very big campus and I get to walk everywhere and find something new. This school has a lot of resources to offer but one has to look for them if they are really interested.
Junior,4,"Currently, the online learning experience is alright for myself; however, I have heard that many students are struggling to transition. Luckily, the school has provided many resources for students to reach out for assistance."
Junior,4,"What I like about CSUF is the diversity that you can see among the students and staff. Additionally, the administrations provides many resources for students to access regarding a variety of purposes."
Senior,4,"Before the semester ended, the school transitioned to online learning. Some professors were understanding and flexible while others were not. Some were willing to modify the class rubric to give the students time to adjust whereas others gave out more assignments. I find online learning to be both difficult and easy at the same time. I do not have to travel far to get to campus and attend classes but now I have to teach and learn by myself more than before. The school should not charge students the same tuition as in previous years when quality of education is not same as before."
Senior,4,"CSUF offers decent quality education. Some professors are friendly, approachable, and willing to help students get through their courses. Depending on the major and classes selected, there are professors who read slides verbatim and hardly teach. The campus is nice and has an arboretum. The school is located near various businesses that are within walking distance."
Sophomore,4,"The professors and faculty here are very approachable and friendly; it’s not hard to see that they truly wish the best for the students’ success. I do wish, however, there were more events where the students would be able to bond. It does feel more like a high school or a community college than a university I am paying to go to. The parking here is always hard to find as well; especially during the afternoons. Nonetheless, the past two years I’ve spent here were truly memorable and have equipped me with proper education to prepare me for the real world."
Alum,4,"I transferred to Cal State Fullerton from my local community college. The professors were very kind and helpful. The campus was well kept and provided great resources (i.e. free food, dog therapy events,  during finals."
Junior,4,"One thing I really love about CSUF is how large the campus is. I prefer to be alone, and there are plenty of places where I can comfortably work on my assignments alone or in a quiet environment. 
Many of the professors here have been the best I've had out of the two colleges I have attended. 
There are many popular fast food options on campus, such as Panda Express, Carl's Jr, and multiple Starbucks. Unfortunately, the lines for these places are usually quite large. Thankfully, there are a few shopping areas near the campus that offer many more dining options. 
I don't like to participate in school activities, but it seems like there is always a lot going on here - lots of stands and events. 
The only negative thing I can think about this school is that the parking is horrendous. However, all in all, I enjoy my time at CSUF."
Freshman,4,California State University Fullerton did an amazing job of transitioning the students from face to face learning to online learning. The teachers were able to guide their students to their online lectures to zoom. It wasn't difficult for me to connect to the zoom platform since I already owned a computer and have the skills to use one. What was difficult for me to learn online was keeping focus from the distractions in my house. It is not easy for students to learn online because not everyone has a good learning environment. Many individuals and families have been negatively affected by the coronavirus in one way or another. My performance was stronger in the face to face learning while on online learning my performance was greatly affected.
Junior,4,"I have had a great experience at CSUF, my professors have been wonderful and very helpful as well as the students within my major."
Junior,4,"I’ve loved most of my professors. The Financial Aid office has been very informative and helpful, and the Irvine campus makes my commute so much easier. My only issue is how rocky the transition was to virtual courses and support. I had one professor stop meeting at our scheduled time and post his lectures. We didn’t have much dialogue or connection after we moved out of the classroom. Otherwise, I’ve loved this school, even during the pandemic."
Sophomore,4,"California State University, Fullerton has a beautiful campus. I enjoy walking around campus and enjoy the nature involved on campus.

The different colleges on campus are mostly placed near each other. It is a large campus so I would have to choose wisely where the enrolled courses are located to have enough time to go to each of them. The professors that I had are friendly and understanding of their students and do their best to help them. 

The campus has many resources available to help students. There are writing centers and supplemental classes that help go over the course topics. Printers are available at the library which is very useful when needing a quick print.

Parking is a big problem the students face, with not enough time or space to park their cars. There are different parking lots located around campus that allows students to park near their classes. 

The housing may be a problem near campus, but the dorms on campus were ok with providing students what they need."
Junior,4,Cal state Fullerton is an awesome school if your looking for a clean campus and diverse campus. The only reason i didn't give a full five stars its because of their parking.
Freshman,4,"So far the school has been very communicative during this time, the pandemic. Has really set aside any worries about the starting year. I am proud to be a Titan!"
Alum,4,I really enjoyed having multiple options to take courses; such as online. CSUF has great professors that taught me well. My favorite part of this school was that I met my Husband.
Freshman,4,I like the campus experience. It is very lively especially during club rush where a section of the campus is filled with a lot of people. The professors are very nice and dedicated to teaching their students. Some of them are very passionate about the health of the students during quarantine. They understand what the students are facing and make improvisations that accommodate everyone.
Senior,4,"It's a fun campus! The campus is in a great location, and there's a lot to do if you're just trying to kill time between classes. There are many ways to get connected and get involved with other students and organizations. I feel comfortable going to CSUF and I've never felt anxious. Students and professors are also quite friendly and willing to get to know you."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the psychology department. The professors in the psych department are caring, passionate professionals, and I enjoyed learning from them."
Junior,4,"I am a recent transfer student for this current Spring semester, therefore, I am not able to fully rate my overall experience since it is short-lived. I was not able to attend school much since the COVID-19 had us transition online."
Niche User,4,"I went to tour the campus and loved the clean, sleek look of the campus. It was in a nice area, but it is right by the freeway."
Freshman,4,Cal State Fullerton has many clubs that give students the opportunity for student involvement. Professors in the communication department are extremely knowledgeable and have been my biggest support.
Sophomore,4,"California State University, Fullerton is a very peaceful campus and a very good school. The diversity is incredible, as you really meet any different people everyday. Most of the professors have passion for what they do. For being one of the leading CSUs, it really is one of the cheapest universities out there in price, which is very important for someone who does not have that much money but still wishes to pursue a great education and become successful. The housing however, is incredibly expensive, and the double apartments are not in good condition for the price. Other than that, this university makes me feel  at home."
Junior,4,"The professors are very well educated and enthusiastic to teach the information. The school provides equal opportunities to all students through tutoring centers, supplemental instruction, and various organizations."
Senior,4,The student body is comprised of very friendly and engaging peers. There are lots of resources available if you choose to find them. The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the Electrical Engineering Department at CSUF is subpar.
Sophomore,4,Fantastic Campus. Kind staff. Very user friendly. The library is my favorite place to study because it have different floors for diferent purposes. The top floor is more for social purposes and they have quite floors exclusivly to study.
Niche User,4,"As a postbaccalaureate student taking an online program, I feel exceptionally supported by the professors and advisors as they are readily available with answers. The professors are knowledgable, organized, and care about student's success. Also, the resources that the school provides are endless. I utilize online resources the most such as setting up Zoom meetings with tutors and librarians when I need guidance writing my papers."
Freshman,4,"My experience at CSUF Is great! As a very involved member of the performing arts department I am constantly being occupied with doing activities that I love the most and that would help me for my intended career. That is what makes the school as great as it is. The opportunities provided by school gives students such as myself, the chance to express who we are and what we love. CSUF is very accepting and inclusive towards the students background  and identity, creating a safe space for students to gain an education. Of course, a great education must also come from great educators. The faculty are very understanding of their students and try to provide the best environment for students to learn. One thing that I would like to see more of is action against littering. There is too much trash being thrown onto CSUF beautiful campus and not reaching a trash bin. It would be nice to adopt a program that would help get rid of the waste more properly."
Junior,4,Endless amount of resources to help students while enrolled and after graduation. I wish they were more clear on how to graduate in 4 years.
Graduate Student,4,CSUF really provides the resources for their students.  It feels like a second home.  A few improvements they can make includes more accessible parking for students.
Alum,4,"I attended the college 7+ years ago and when I recently visited the campus, I noticed that a lot has changed. They redid the library, the quad area, etc. 
When I attended, I liked the college overall but since it is a big commuter school, the parking was AWEFUL for ALL 4 years. When I went, I also noticed that they were building an additional parking lot so hopefully future students have an easier time parking."
Freshman,4,"This is a great school with great academics and professors. This university offers meal plans, residential housing and there are many extracurricular activities to do."
Alum,4,"The campus is fairly large and visually appealing. In recent years, they have been improving a lot of cosmetic look of the school. The school is near downtown, so the night life is very nice. They have many clubs and organizations where students are able to be more involved. Parking can be quite difficult when I was enrolled, but they recently have been building more parking structures to increase space. I enjoyed going to this school."
Freshman,4,"The overall atmosphere of the college campus is great. The professors especially are the backbone of the institution. They are able to provide clear and accurate instruction while also understanding that college students have work cut out for them. The students I meet on campus or in class are one of the friendliest you can imagine. As a kinesiology major, my main places to go during breaks are either the library or SRC which is a really great building if health is a high priority. There really isn't really anything wrong with the campus, but if I had to improve something, it would be bringing back college football for the school and having more parking structures. The parking structure situation is already in progress and set to open next school year, so driving will be much easier for all the commuters."
Freshman,4,I LOVE Cal State Fullerton! It is a beautiful small campus with thousands of resources and study spots at your fingertips.
Sophomore,4,"The safety at the campus needs to be improved. All students should feel comfortable walking to and from campus. Also, more parking options need to be available. It would be smart if CSUF had a bus system where students drop their car at the brea mall and get picked up."
Sophomore,2,"I don't feel connected to the school at all. I don't feel involved. I put myself out there, but because it is a commuter school, it is really, really hard to create a genuine connection with people."
Sophomore,2,"Some of the professors were great with the transition to an online format, others were great. Most professors will post their lectures (most of the time just the slides with no voice over recording to further explain the information provided)"
Senior,2,My biggest issue with this school is how apparent the university administration does not care about its students. Within my four years of attending this school the class size have grown to a point where students are stuffed into a room together without enough elbow room to take notes. they have been accepting more students but not hiring more teachers. there is a lack of diversity in professors. timing on construction projects have been made with complete disregard to the students. major pathways all throughout campus are blocked off during the fall and spring semester so that construction will be finished in time for the summer (for campus tours and recruitment).
Niche User,2,"The system doesn't care enough for students. They use the excuse that they are ""impacted"" for everything. If they can't provide resources and help to their students and incoming students as well, then what is the point?"
College Junior,2,It doesn't appear to be easy to get into a sorority or a fraternity. Each sorority/fraternity has different application processes but most judge on looks before academics.
College Sophomore,2,We do have multiple Men/Women sports that are good in the Big West coonference but for the most part not very good along with our athletic facilities.
College Senior,2,Pretty much all of the sororities and fraternities consist of rich white kids who wear monogrammed clothing and pass out fliers for their vapid events.
College Junior,2,"Many don't care about the party scene, seems irrelevant."
College Junior,2,Not too many parties and most clubs are 21 and over.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't started school yet, but I went to orientation and I didn't have a great time. Most of the volunteers said, ""feel free to ask questions, we want to answer any and every question you all have. We don't want you to leave without us asking any questions that you want answered unanswered!"" I asked a probably a hundred questions and no one was able to answer them and I felt as though they all gave the same, vague answer. In addition, I didn't feel much school spirit from the community there."
College Sophomore,2,It was convenient living on campus but it was actually a long walk to get to some classes. The food was okay. Dorming was too expensive to be worth it.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not very significant on campus.
College Student,2,"At this school, Greek life is not really all that popular. Fraternities and Sororities do not take the initiative and promote their organization. With that said, they are not that well known."
College Freshman,2,I was a resident this year and did not enjoy much
Recent Alumnus,2,"CSUF is a commuter school which makes it very difficult to feel a strong sense of school community. While our baseball and soccer teams are good, I never saw any advertisement for games. I never even saw people in the stadium for that matter. I don't understand why the school has such nice sports facilities when nobody goes to games."
College Freshman,2,Cal State Fullerton is only good at Baseball.
College Freshman,2,"The cost of living on campus is close to a fortune and definitely not worth it. The dorms have just enough space but I do wish there was more. My room faces the freeway so I cannot open my window without it being incredibly noisy. Our air conditioning system is motion sensored, so at night it turns off! It can get pretty stuffy in there. We have an active room on our floor which is always filled with people and they are pretty friendly, we watch TV, talk, eat, and just unwind. The walk from main campus, however, is pretty long, I need at least 20 minutes before class starts to leave, and find a decent seat. I thought the Gastronome food would be stellar, considering that the meals are $10 each. Maybe I was spoiled with my mom's amazing home cooked meals, but the food there makes me go, ""meh."" Breakfast is always the same. Lunch and dinner is okay, it switches up pretty much everyday. Although, I felt like lunch was made pretty late, I usually eat around 11:00am and it is never ready. On weekends, the Gastronome is pretty much shutdown with sandwiches being your only option, so I usually make arrangements elsewhere. Best food options include the tacos and sandwhiches and the worst is any kind of meat, because it is super dry and really salty!"
College Junior,2,"I have no clue about the alumni involvement in the school and if they want us to succeed or not? I feel like I'm really on my own to find my career out of school at csuf. However, business college I heard is much better with this than the other departments so good for them!"
College Student,2,"I tried rushing for a sorority. I had an okay experience but ended up dropping out of the running since it caused too

much stress on my academic life as they asked me to continue to due events to rush all thru the midterms and finals.

I continued thru midterms but decided to drop once I neared the time for my finals. I did not feel comfortable about the

level of commitment they were asking for as they did not consider how important my academic education was to me. I was distraught as I feel I wasted my time in the end and could have put forth more effort on my academics had I decided not to participate in that venture altogether. As a freshman, I think most freshman should stay away from the idea of joining something that requires too much of your time and effort when you are just beginning to learn the ropes of manipulating colllege dorm life as well as life onto a new campus. If I had it to do over again I would NOT even consider participating in something like a sorority until perhaps my final years of college if at all."
College Junior,2,I don't hear many positive things from Greek life on our campus or any other campus. Greek life members are usually very anti-social with non-Greek members and are usually very rude to non-Greek members. The process to enter a Frat or sorority are also very stressful. I personally have never applied but many of my friends have and the process to apply and be accepted is never fun or enjoyable.
College Sophomore,2,I am not really a fan of the school. It was up there on my list of top universities but once i arrived it was very disappointing and that happened quite quickly. The commuter factor really detaches students from the school and makes it hard to enjoy actually attending.
College Freshman,2,We are a joke in most sports. We have not achieved much other than soccer. We don't even have a football team.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not involved, but I never hear any mention of parties. I hear it's pretty dead."
College Sophomore,2,You don't always hear about great parties.
College Senior,2,Administrators only care about not getting lawsuits so protests and demonstrations are a burden for them if they go out of hand.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Campus-wide rules not typically enforced. A no-smoking on campus rule was passed last year, but I don't think I've ever seen any administrator enforce this rule when they see a student smoking."
Recent Alumnus,2,I gave up applying for financial aid. I never received anything but unnecessary loans.
College Junior,2,I had a bad experience with campus housing because my building was flooded and I had to move to another room for a couple months.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of them are white. There's 3% black/African American people, so I won't call it diverse and accepting of various cultures"
College Sophomore,2,"No football team, makes this school's athletics very weak."
College Senior,2,"Since there is no football team, I feel the school support is not prominent. The other sports available are not followed much by the students."
College Junior,2,Any environment where sexual assault is not taken seriously by a portion of the populace is a considerably bad one.
College Junior,2,I did not qualify for financial aid through the school. I had to use my own personal bank to get my financial aid/loans.
College Junior,2,To much paper work and its a hassle.
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the staff in administration's office give a vibe of annoyance and not really helpful.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the dorms, but every one that I've talking to that commutes hates it,"
College Sophomore,2,"Fullerton has always been known as a commuter school, and that's how it still is."
College Junior,2,"Ever since I moved out from home in order to attend school, I have had a difficult time finding adequate housing. There are many housing opportunities around campus, however, the cost of living compared to the quality is not good at all. It is very expensive to live in a small apartment with very little utilities. This makes it really difficult to live near campus without stressing over rent."
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in the dorms and had a 5 day meal plan. After Thanksgiving break I was absolutely SICK of on-campus dining. They try and serve ""vegan"" and ""ethnic"" dishes which mainly consist of black beans and rice. The food is not very good and in order to avoid whatever weird dish they concocted that day, I grew extremely tired of the regular pizza and burgers they served on a regular basis. The only reason I did not gain Freshman 15 is because I mainly AVOIDED the food served on campus. It was a waste of a few thousand dollars, the convenience was not worth dealing with that gross food."
College Freshman,2,"Maybe because I don't live there or attend parties, I don't realize if Greek life is bigger than it really is."
College Sophomore,2,"Since I was unable to dorm, I was forced to find an apartment with my roommate and we ended up finding a place a mile away from Cal State Fullerton with two other people and paid $320 each. What was really helpful about finding a place is that there is a Facebook page called CSUF Roommates and people basically explain there situation if they need a place to stay at or if they have a place for others who are looking for somewhere to live. 

The con about living with other people that you do not know is that some might be as helpful around the house which can cause some disputing between roommates."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The cost of a permit is ridiculous however, the price is mostly determined at a state level and not by CSUF. If you get to school in the early morning parking is not bad. Like between 7 and 8. As the day goes on it becomes harder to find a spot. Very strict on ticketing. You don't really need a car on campus but it is a commuter school."
College Senior,2,"The off-campus housing is very limited. All the apartments close to campus are always packed and rarely available. Plus, it's really expensive. I tried looking for an apartment to live in but everything was too expensive for me. Moving forward, finding off-campus parking is really hard because it is distanced from school. Some near parking spaces are private property, so we have to park outside of houses that are about 15mins away from campus. However, it is a really safe city. I have never been frightened when I walk alone to school."
College Freshman,2,I do not not have an opinion on this subject. Pass.
College Freshman,2,August and June feel like death but it is otherwise decent. I only ever needed winter clothes very late at night deep into winter and it rarely rained.
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is pretty horrendous in this area. The apartments are small and overpriced because they are located so close to the school. While it is far cheaper than living on campus, it is very difficult to come accross an apartment that is actually leased for it appropriate value. Most people choose to live with 3 people to a room in order to even afford the costs of housing in this area."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life students support superficial views on women and society. They party all the time and only associate with other people within their fraternity/sorority.
College Senior,2,Cost for parking is too high. Parking is a struggle after 8:30am.
College Junior,2,"The train isn't terribly far away but it can be a hassle to take the train, then a bus to get on campus. The scheduling can often make students late. Parking for commuters isn't always guaranteed and it's so expensive for a parking permit."
College Junior,2,"I have been lucky to receive financial aid, but for other students that has not been the case. Recently they put a cap on how many units you can take in order to get the State University Grant. It sucks, but the school is really trying to push out students staying more than four years."
College Senior,2,I need to petition more fin aid and they wont let me
College Sophomore,2,ive been to one and it was pretty empty
College Sophomore,2,"my first semester here at csuf, i did not get my fafsa due to delayed paper processing. i had to pay out of pocket because they were not able to give me loans either. my application was not going through. however besides that first semester, i have been getting my financial aid"
College Sophomore,2,"fullerton is very dry, hot, and humid. maybe because im used to living near the beach with the breeze, but it was hard for me to live in fullerton."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is poorly distributed. I know plenty of people who get a large over of abundance of aid who do not need it. In fact my friend just got a car with his extra $8,00 in financial aid. Both of my parent work part-time jobs and I don't even get full financial aid, which is very unfair. So I have to take out loans while others are abusing the money and using it for luxury."
College Junior,2,This review is aimed at parking enforcement only.  It's absurdly strict; I got a 60 dollar ticket for parking for 35 minutes in a 30 minute parking zone.
College Freshman,2,I haven't had the chance to experience the business program yet
College Freshman,2,"No one goes to the games, and were only good at baseball"
College Freshman,2,"If you have a car, you can get around fine.  But people that don't have one are constantly asking for rides"
College Freshman,2,The wifi is always going out
Sophomore,1,"Online is horrible with this school. They'll expect you to have the best internet in the state, have a laptop, and being able to share your screen, share your browser history, open the webcam and to stand still for the entirety of the exam. Thats how much trust this school has. (Faculty members of CSUF: P.S. All rights reserved.)"
Sophomore,1,"Corrupt faculty members with the ideology of ""You scratch my back, I scratch yours'"" They protect each others backs and have no trust in students. I had a professor in the math department reporting a false claim through the student conducts office just to cover up what I had against him which I made to the deans office by removing my credibility to ""save"" his ""job or promotion he had"" exact quote from the deans office. I went through the legal process to fight his claim against me to which I was clueless enough that I didn't know at the time that the deans office, HOD and the professor having a meeting without hearing my side of the story and when I reported it to the academic board, I kept getting excuses such as ""You didn't attach the claims, now you cant submit another appeal with us."" I reported another case to them linking to the same professor to which they replied with ""We still have the professors back because he is credible."" I understood if you had a degree, you are credible"
Junior,1,"I only had to take online classes because of COVID-19, it was a tough transition and it was hard because students and teachers both did not know what they were doing."
Sophomore,1,"CSUF is the worst Cal State College, they are not able to help student during (COVID 19). They do not answer phones or responding emails. It is worst services I have seen. I was not expecting that."
Sophomore,1,"CSUF is the worst Cal State College, they are not able to help student during (COVID 19). They do not answer phones or responding emails. It is worst services I have seen. I was not expecting that."
Junior,1,"I was only able to take one class online and unfortunately, I had to drop out because I do better in an actual classroom setting. I did notice that the online course was well organized."
Sophomore,1,"Online learning has been difficult beyond what I expected. Attending Zoom courses is basically watching a slideshow. You could get the same effect from a prerecorded video. It takes away a lot of help from asking questions in person. Even asking questions over Zoom is more difficult because the professor can only clearly hear one person at a time, and more often than not we need one-on-one assistance. Online learning was extremely difficult and I would never take online courses if I can help it. Some people joke that college is basically you teaching yourself the course. Online courses is literally that without any room for exageration."
Freshman,1,"If you need to house on campus and need to rely on financial aid to cover almost everything, don't come here. The financial aid office is terrible and not very helpful. I had two roommates, and for all three of us they said that we never sent documents needed to receive the pell grant, even though we did. We sent the documents a second time and were told that we ""sent them too late."" Because of this, all three of us essentially had to leave after one semester."
College Senior,1,Im not a fan of greek life
College Junior,1,"For how many students that attend the school the stats are horrible compared to other 4 year D1 university's. It's sad that the school has hardly any real school spirit and pride. This is one of my least favorite aspects of CSUF. The teams are not that bad but the support is not good. I've experienced both sides of the athletics at Fullerton. I was on the soccer team and am currently not anymore, but I still attent the university. With that said, from both sides it's poor support and not encouraging to play or go support to schools teams."
College Sophomore,1,"Living on campus was terrible. The dining hall made me sick every night, and no one warns you that only the 'weird' students live on campus. I couldn't walk in any hallway without getting hit by a lightsaber or nerf gun."
College Sophomore,1,The greek life is just annoying.
College Freshman,1,There is little point into greek life and is not a necessary point of college like they hype it up. I don't buy into that nonsense.
College Sophomore,1,"I was promised financial aid, which was pulled out from under me once I registered (of course) apparently due to state vs. school interpretations of who is in need of financial aid. A big headache that resulted in no aid. As for scholarships other than FAFSA and the like, no one ever seems to be endorsing or advertising them."
College Junior,1,There is nothing good to eat on-campus...
College Junior,1,"Oh my god... There are only 4 off-campus restaurants nearby, which is terrible..."
College Sophomore,1,I didn't recieve any scholarships. Hope someone else has better luck.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I do not remember the name of the sorority, but I tried joining and for a reason I am not aware of I did not get in. Now as i walk around campus I see that the majority of the girls in that sorority are Caucasian (I was able to identify them because of their pink backpacks) and I am Hispanic so maybe that was the reason."
College Junior,1,We do not have a Greek life
College Junior,1,They can be so rude
College Freshman,1,"It was long, tiresome, and I did not end up receiving any aid."
College Senior,1,"I paid $229.00 for the parking permit and I don't think it's worth it. If you get there at after 8 am, best believe you won't find any parking space. I have taken up to 2 hours to find parking. Students are always fighting about parking spaces and that sometimes scares me because you never know what they are capable of doing. I hate it because i have to come 2 hours early and I'm sometimes late because I cannot find parking. Not fair to pay $229.00 and not find any parking space."
College Freshman,1,"I lived on campus this past year but, I hear that commuters have to leave a couple hours before class both for commute time and for time spent finding a spot. I would try to only leave campus on weekends because otherwise there would be virtually no parking near housing until late at night."
College Freshman,1,"I loath on campus housing. The really screw over the freshmen. Basically, you pay as much as you would to live in a one bed/ one bath apartment off campus but, on campus you share a room with one person, share a bathroom with 7 people and share a living room with the whole floor. This, I assume, isn't that bad if you get along with the people on your floor but I ended up being confined to my room. Also pooping is awkward. All you can eat food is included in housing cost but since the food sucks you'll end up eating out frequently and feeling bad about it."
College Junior,1,"Terrible. It's a commuter school, cars are essential for most students. Parking permits are more expensive than my books for the semester. If you get on campus before 8:30 maybe 9:00 a.m. you'll get some decent parking."
College Junior,1,The wi-fi sucks on campus. Most of the time you can't log into the internet because so many people are using it. They need to really fix it.
College Junior,1,"It is terrible! Try not to eat on campus, there are other great food locations not that far."
College Junior,1,"Not that great, most people are commuters so they don't stick around once their classes are done with."
College Junior,1,"Public transportation is almost non-existent.  If you don't have a car, you're in trouble.  If you do have a car, be prepared to be killed with parking fees, tickets, gas, smog checks, insurance, registration fees, and everything else."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is awful, I live in the dorms so I usually have a good spot, but if I leave in the middle of the day and come back, its very hard to find parking"
College Freshman,1,"Barely any parties, occasional frat party, but only girls can get in."
College Freshman,1,"The 2 frat houses that are actually a part of campus are trashy. If you don't rush, they won't hang out with you. If you don't rush, you can't really party even though the parties here are awful."
College Freshman,1,I haven't had any opportunities for internships.
College Junior,1,There are never enough computers in the labs and the wireless is a joke.
College Junior,1,"There really is NO transportation around my school. It's pretty much a commuter school. Some people ride bikes but it is pretty risky considering how much traffic there is around the school constantly. Plus, let's face it, students don't make the greatest drivers. I would say if you're only transportation option is a bike or walking then look into a different school."
College Junior,1,because of a mix up i have been denied financial aid twice and have been working full time just so i can afford one 4 unit class. 
College Junior,1,"Most students commute, so a car is necessary"
College Senior,1,there's only one school around us or near us and that's fullerton college
College Freshman,1,"I do not live in off campus, but I hear from friends that it is not that great, the housing isn't that great especially disappointing because it was just built. The cost is too high still for me to afford to live away from home."
College Sophomore,1,Parking here is horrible at certain times during the day
College Senior,1,CSU Fullerton does not do a good job when it comes to campus transportation. I feel most colleges do not as well. They have the option of registering your Titan card with US Bank and obtaining free transit from OCTA Busses and the train that goes up and down the coast of up to 100 dollars in charges.
College Senior,1,"Parking is always tough on campus.  Even with the parking structure, finding available spots is difficult.  Most of the time I have to budget at least 15 minutes or more to find a spot."
College Senior,1,Parking is horrible.  The cost of a permit is over $200.  The problem is that they sell more permits than students can park.  I have waited over three hours to park.  They need to make more multi-level parking garages.
College Sophomore,1,The airport is far and ride sharing can be dangerous
College Sophomore,1,The parking permit is too expensive and far from my classes
College Senior,1,"It is difficult to find parking. Students can be circling around the parking lot for at least 15-30 minutes before a space is available. However, the parking lots does have an sign that indicates how many spots are available when students enter the lot. Parking is mostly plentiful during the morning."
College Junior,1,"My school is a commuter school. This means every day during the semester you have to battle for a place to park. I have heard about a few carpool options the school provides but I have not done my own research into these programs. The location is somewhat convenient, my school is located right off of the 57 freeway in Orange County. However, this area is prone to heavy traffic for about 50% of the day."
College Junior,1,The transportation at Cal State Fullerton is either the public transit bus or a personal vehicle. Both can be extremely frustrating. The bus usually runs late and is very unreliable. Parking on campus can also be tough unless you get there before 9 in the morning. The parking pass can also be very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Really difficult!! Depending on the day of week, time of day...It is the largest Cal. State, put that into perspective!"
College Sophomore,1,School really is just school. Sometimes as a commuter I feel like it's just an extension of high school which I have to pay for.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a nightmare if you dont have a class before 10 am you will never have a parking spot. You will most likely be late if u dont come at least an hour early
College Sophomore,1,financial aid office takes an extremely long time to get back to you with information and i had my financial aid terminated a month before registration with no prior warning.
College Sophomore,1,Extremely packed no organization. Parking tickets are given on a daily basis there is no tolerance on parking permits. Parking permit prices are extremely high and it is extremely difficult to find parking even if u have a permit.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible here, especially for the dorms. Warning they give out parking tickets during school vacations. $60 per parking ticket!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is horrible at CSUF, even with the new structures they built, the cost of the parking is also outrageous."
College Freshman,1,Parking sucks for commuters in the morning. The permits cost $220 per semester! That's just ridiculous!
College Senior,1,I suppose you could take the bus but people who are locals either walk or ride their bikes to campus.
College Sophomore,1,Its basically about who throws the best parties and who has the hottest girls. The only reason a lot of people join is because Fullerton is a huge commuter school and its the only way some people make friends
College Freshman,1,"The parking here is a nightmare for those living on campus and those commuting to the school. There is usually never a parking spot for those who live on campus and they have to find a spot away from the dorm rooms. For those commuting, most students are late to class because they cannot find a parking, same goes for some of the professors."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible here, especially if you get to campus around 10-12. It's the craziest at the beginning of the semesters, but it dies down towards the end. It's smart to get AT LEAST 30 minutes early to campus. Oh, and you won't be able to get away if you don't have a parking permit where it is required."

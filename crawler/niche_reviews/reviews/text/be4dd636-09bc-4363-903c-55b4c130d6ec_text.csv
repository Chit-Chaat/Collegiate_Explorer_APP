Niche User,5,Love the teacher-student ratio. Safe community. The campus is beautiful. Incredible place to learn. I am going back for my second degree in Nursing.
Niche User,5,The teachers at LaGrange are genuinely invested in your education. They want you to thrive after graduating.
Junior,5,My experience so far with Lagrange College has been wonderful. I will be attending the college this Summer for two core classes and then I will begin the nursing program at Lagrange College in the Fall. I unfortunately did not receive the Sims scholarship. It is my dream to go to Lagrange College for Nursing and the tuition is very costly.
Freshman,5,I love LaGrange College! The small college experience is fantastic. It makes it easier to make friends and feel more comfortable within this small community. The campus is pretty as well and often times we have gorgeous sunsets. The professors are awesome and are willing to work with you on a given situation.
Junior,5,"The faculty and staff are excellent. The city is small and has everything you need. The college has a beautiful campus. This is a smaller school so it’s not overwhelming for your first time away from home. I would love if the dorms were a little more updated. The food is average, wish they had longer hours for the hot food. Would be nice to be able to get food to go as well when we’re pressed for time."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at LaGrange College has, in many ways, surpassed my expectations of post-secondary school. My experiences with my professors have been amazing and they have been extraordinarily helpful. With LaGrange being a small school, they are able to provide as much help and guidance as anyone needs. Campus life is also great as students and faculty are friendly and there is always some activity to get involved. I could not wish for anything better"
Junior,5,Lagrange College is a great place to get your education. All of the students and professors are very polite and love to help people whenever they can. Every professor I have had at Lagrange College has been very attentive and willing to work with students to make sure that they understand everything in the class so that they can succeed.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the friendly, small town atmosphere that LaGrange College has. I'm a freshman and I already feel at home every time I step foot on the campus. I don't feel like an outsider and that's one of the great things about the campus. Everyone makes you feel welcomed and it is a very inviting college. If I had to changed anything, it would be the expenses but overall it is a great college and the faculty are amazing."
Junior,5,"As soon as I took the tour, I knew this is where I belonged.  I didn't want to be a number at a big school.  With only 1100 students you get to know so many people and the professors really do want to get to know you and help you succeed!"
Junior,5,There's so many school events and the faculty really cares about you and wants to see you succeed. The library is so fantastic and helps with any and all assignments. The food is good but gets repetitive from time to time. The morning Starbucks lady is so sweet and I look forward to seeing her smiling face.
Sophomore,5,"Small college campus for introverts and extroverts a like. It has amazing nursing, theater, education, and music composition programs. Safe and friendly campus, with faculty that want students to thrive."
Junior,5,"I love the small college atmosphere at LaGrange. It's about three times the size of my (large) high school but the classes are smaller. Student engagement always has fun activities planned and while the city doesn't offer much, surrounding areas do."
Junior,5,"Im currently in the RN-BSN program and am very pleased with the administration, help from the educators and ease of use the program offers.  The fact that the school has maintained accreditation for the nursing program since the opening of the program is amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a little bias, because I am apart of the Greek life on my campus. But what I can say is that it is absolutely wonderful to have a group of students that want nothing more than to see each other succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"So far I have no reason to be disappointed! This school continues to offer me advisors that care about my future and staff that don't see me as ""just another student""."
College Freshman,5,Greek life here is all about finding your family
College Sophomore,5,"The school is great at providing students with job internships, has great relationships with alumni, and has many employers constantly giving people. The career center has paperwork you fill out and they will doubtlessly find an internship for you to go to. The army, waffle house, and many other places constantly come to the school to recruit workers. There is even a month (JanTerm) when students are encouraged to take part in internships. There are even chances for students to earn class credit hours for completing internships. The career center is awesome and can help provide anybody with an internship or job shadowing experience if they need it."
College Sophomore,5,"There are three sororities and three fraternities at LaGrange College. They are currently building a new ""Fraternity Court"" with brand new fraternity houses that will open in the Spring of 2016.2-3 guys will live in each house. Pretty much everybody at LaGrange has something to do with greek life, but nobody takes it personal if a person is not a part of greek life. There are a lot of philanthropy events held to support the fraternities and sororities on campus weekly, and all of the groups are very supportive of each other. There are 3 sorority houses on campus as well and there are 2-3 girls allowed to live in each and those people are chosen by their sorority to live there. All of the sororities attend each other's parties; however, the fraternities are picky about what guys are allowed to enter their house. Non-greek students usually get along with greeks really well, and I know that I personally am friends with many non-greeks. Non-greeks are constantly invited to the socials and parties, so there is a very good relationship there. It is really great."
College Student,5,Lagrange college is a great school in helping students with financial need. Financial aid process went smooth and quick than any other school I attended
College Freshman,5,"The best department at LaGrange College !!!!

The ladies are the best, they helped me do it all and answere all my questions ."
Sophomore,4,Good learning environment with Lots of resources. Serves terrible food To students in the Cafe. The food served in the grill is better quality but not great.
Sophomore,4,LaGrange College is a very welcoming and small college. Although the tuition is high (like every college) it has been an inviting institution.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my first year at LaGrange and can’t wait to come back for my sophomore year. I am involved in the athletics here and I had a great season with them. My teammates and I got a long very well and I can’t wait to for this upcoming season with them. Even though this is a small and historical school, I do think the dorms should be updated especially Henry and also provide another food option on campus. The campus is really pretty though especially during the fall. The historical brick buildings is one thing that drew me to this school. This school also has great professors that tend to you and help you through courses. One course is their nursing program which is what we are known for and is what I am majoring in, which I am very excited about!"
Junior,4,"LaGrange College is a place that prides on Civility, Excellence, Diversity and Service. With its affiliation with the United Methodist Church, we pride ourselves on being suitable people for the society that we live in. It is not a large school housing around 1000 students, so the opportunity to be in a leadership role is very welcoming. The small class room setting allows students to interact with professors to truly understand the criteria that is being taught. Athletics and Fine Arts are seen as gifts at LaGrange. Each athletic department supports one another and strives to be the best in the USA South Conference. The theater department also brings much life to the school by showcasing incredible performances for students and surrounding public."
Freshman,4,Its a family based environment with small class sizes. The teachers will work with you to ensure the you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I like the professor, the cost is way to high. The basketball program is not good at all. On away games $8 is not enough to feed a grown man who has been running up and down on the court."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming Freshman. So far my experience has been great. Very individualized attention, and assistance. Everyone is helpful and wants to see you succeed.  My concern is the cost of attendance and the debt I will have when I graduate. I have been told there will be plenty of support around internships and job placement--hope this holds out to be true."
Sophomore,4,I came to LaGrange solely for sports and ended up falling in love. This college is what you make of it. If you sit in your dorm of course you aren’t going to have fun. Get out and get involved!
Freshman,4,"LaGrange College is great if you are interested in an environment that is similar to a close net community. Classes are also nice because they are so small, which allows the professors to help their students more than if they were to attend a larger school."
Niche User,4,"I liked the small college atmosphere. There will be a lot of one on one tutoring with the professors teaching such a small population. It is also very close to home. Since I will be playing football there, the coaches were very great people to be around. Also with me wanting to be a civil engineer. Lagrange has a pre-engineering program and has dual degree program with Georgia Tech and Auburn. Those two schools are well known for the engineering."
Niche User,4,"I liked the tour of LaGrange College. I was able to take a tour of the campus, and I even got the chance to sit in on a class. Also, I met with the coaches and the team sounds like it would be a great experience."
Freshman,4,"LaGrange College lacked in the overall category student life, but it compensated for this weakness with its prestigious academics. While I would like to see a more student-friendly environment at LaGrange, I would change nothing about its engaging and professors who make the strong academic reputation of the institution possible."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the small campus feel and the amount of one on one time you get with your professors. There are more sustainability efforts on campus, which is really exciting. They have a great English department. However, the campus is not the most diverse. This is to be expected in a small town, but unfortunate nonetheless. There are also not very many extracurricular opportunities outside of Greek Life."
Graduate Student,4,"Awesome school! The professors are great and care about your education! The professors are very accommodating and are willing to go above and beyond to ensure that you succeed! The school is located in Downtown Lagrange which makes it convenient to local attractions (movies, restaurants, etc.)."
College Junior,4,"Greek Life is the easiest way to get connected to people at LaGrange College. There are only three fraternities and three sororities currently offered, so rushing isn't overwhelming. Greek Life tends to throw some parties, mostly the fraternities and almost anyone can go. It's only mixers and socials that invites matter, or Greek status matters. Overall the three of each tend to get along, but some of the sororities are cliquey and others could care less if you come from a different group. Rush is later in the year allowing you to really get to know each option and figure out which you like best. However once you join, you realize some groups are different than you thought."
College Senior,4,"My college is unique and a wonderful experience. The classes are small. Therefore, extra time and energy is put in so that each student and professor learn to know each other."
College Sophomore,4,"Lagrange is a Division 3 school, and I can say that I am lucky to be a part of the football team. Unlike bigger D1 and D2 schools, we do not get compensated for our athletics. That is saying a lot considering that majority of the school participates in a varsity sport. Over half of the students compete in sports, and many of the other students play intramural sports. The students are our biggest fans since many people on the outside don't appreciate D3 football, but it's just as challenging as any other division. Our sport teams compete at high levels. Golf recently went to the national championship while basketball recently won back to back conference championships. The football team is on the rise as well as volleyball, baseball, softball, and soccer."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the size of my school. Small classes make the work more face to face rather than being considered a number. Everyone on campus knows each other, and it feels like Lagrange College is its own community."
College Freshman,4,"I have only been here for one semester but so far class sizes have been no more than 30 for me. I have also had good experiences wit professors as well, as far as them being approachable and helpful."
College Freshman,4,"Housing process is relatively simple. There are a decent amount of housing options, especially considering the school size. The dorms aren't the best but I've seen worse."
College Freshman,4,I love how it's not hard to get to know other people and make connections in the community. It's nice to have so many opportunities to give back and get involved.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life here is not about parties or who has the nicest house. Greek life here is about philanthropy and serving the community.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty and staff are always there to help and are willing to help.
College Freshman,4,The professors I've had are very dedicated and work with you and want you to succeed.  Registration for me hasn't been very difficult and the workload varies based on your major and how many/what classes you're taking.  The school overs tutoring on campus most nights in all subjects by students that major in those subjects.
College Freshman,4,Class size has been great and it was part of the reason I chose LaGrange College. The classes are usually around twenty or so and sometimes smaller.  Many courses on varying topics are offered giving you lots of opportunities to explore.
College Freshman,4,"The housing process was easy, you either fill out a form so they room you with someone who's answers match mostly with yours or if you know someone you can room with your friend.  My dorm is on campus and close to just about all my classes which makes things a lot easier."
College Sophomore,4,"There is not a lot of campus crime, and every time it happens, the school is on it immediately. There are great counseling services available and police are constantly police to protect people coming from parties at fraternity parties to prevent students from drunk driving and to protect against sexual assault or any other problems that occur. Securitas is a joke for campus security, but it is slowly getting better."
College Sophomore,4,"Every single course that I have been in at LaGrange College has been challenging, and since college is about an education,that is fabulous. Each professor I have had has been willing to help me with whatever I need in order to succeed. I have a personal relationship with most of my teachers and that is very important when it comes to school and networking for future jobs in the future. There are a few courses that the school requires that we take that I don't agree with, but every school has those courses. The class sizes are mostly very small which is very helpful during the learning environment because that means that the professor is that much more focused on each individual student. The school provides many activities and speakers from everywhere to help with our learning experiences."
College Sophomore,4,"The rooms are all bigger than most college dorm rooms. There are some buildings that are very old and you can tell their age, but it is still better than most of the state school dorm rooms. The school makes it impossible for students to choose to live off campus in most ways. Henry is the worst dorm, there are bugs everywhere and it is a motel set up. I currently live there and it is honestly very loud and the ventilation system is not very good. The apartments are very very nice and each student gets an individual room and two people share 1 bathroom, and 4 people share a living room and kitchen. It is actually a great space. There is a workout space in one building and not really many amenities in other buildings. Laundry is usually a hassle, but I feel like that is typical of any college except that our laundry is free. The housing process is simple, so there can't be any complaints there besides the fact that the housing lottery is just time consuming. On campus housing is very expensive, so I feel like they should allow for some off campus options for more students. The best thing about housing is that you are always less than a 5 minute walk from all of your classes!"
College Sophomore,4,"LaGrange College has provided me with many great experiences. I have to opportunity to be a college athlete and I currently play softball for the college. I am in a sorority there (Phi Mu) and I am a part of multiple Christian organizations at school. I love the fact that the school is religious, but doesn't throw the religion down your throat or force you into doing any religious activities. It is a small school, so you have to make an effort to get yourself involved. The school has many great clubs and activities for students to participate to make sure that they stay involved enough for them not to get bored. It also provides opportunities for all students to be able to study abroad and take some random, but fun classes during Jan Term every year and that can provide some rare life experiences. The teachers are always available to talk to students and most of them remember your name every single time you meet them. My largest class was 50 students and my teacher still answered any questions in or out of class that I could possible have. The school has challenged me in every way possible, but it has only helped me to meet to challenges and expectations and to overcome all of those. The only downfall I have with the school is that it is very pricey; however, to me, the money is completely worth every penny when you thing about the great quality of an experience you get there. I would not trade any minute that I have spent at that little school because it has been fabulous and provided so many amazing opportunities for me to learn and grow."
College Freshman,4,Nothing as occurred on campus that I am aware of - I generally feel secure as I walk about.
College Freshman,4,I am an art major and the program is very nice.  They have plenty of options to choose from and I'm eager to attempt them all.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a pleasant experience.  The staff and class mates are relatively friendly and I would recommend this school."
College Freshman,4,"It's been a great improvement from high school and West GA Technical College.  I have been able to achieve the majority of my goal.  The staff seems to be competent and engaging with the students.  My academic advisor has been extremely helpful and pleasant.  I only worry about the finances, but then again, what college student doesn't?"
College Freshman,4,"Classes are difficult, but on a private college, professors are more than willing to help during their office hours, and tutoring is available every weeknight, which most students find very resourceful. Also, being on a small campus, gives me the experience to talk and build relationships with people outside of school. I love my choice in school and the independence I was granted once coming here."
College Sophomore,4,I love my college very much. I met new people and professors who are helping my reach my degree. I also play a sport at my college and glad that I got recruited. The small campus and classes were a bonus plus the many activities going on the campus.
College Freshman,4,The houses are a safe and fun environment to party. They are always looking out for the safety of the people at their parties. The best parties were Margaritaville at the ADG house. I think the party scene had a positive impact on the student experience because it gave the students a chance to socialize and let loose in a safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,Apply early to get funds needed
College Sophomore,4,Like the apartment style living
College Freshman,4,"All the good places cost too much for a student, but it's all great food."
College Freshman,4,"I would say it's perfect, but I got a parking ticket, because I accidentally parked in a lot commuters can't use. I personally think that commuters should have all the parking priveleges of residential students."
College Freshman,4,They gave me plenty of aid.
College Freshman,4,The Administration is helpful and fair. They try to get along with everyone and they treat everyone really fair. They understand we are college students.
College Student,4,The food is delicious and you can have as much as you want.
College Student,4,The dorms are very nice and I enjoy them.
College Senior,4,There is a very diverse group of students on campus
College Senior,4,The academics are great. Small class sizes make a great learning experience
College Senior,4,There is not very much crime on campus. Cars get broken into sometimes but not by students
College Student,4,Student involvement and great team performance
College Student,4,It's great and offer student discount
College Student,4,The cost of transportation is cheap and very convient
College Student,4,It's a great in whatever it takes to have achieve.
College Student,4,The housing off campus is great and reasonable for students. The environment is safe and clean
College Student,4,The safety and security is great
College Sophomore,4,"I didn't really have to ""get in"" to my program, I just declared my Major and was accepted."
College Sophomore,4,The professors make sure they develop a personal relationship with each student which is very helpful. Workload is achievable yet challenging.
College Junior,4,The Composition and Music Technology program at Lagrange is one of the first in Georgia. The CORE is spread out through the years and not all at the beginning like a lot of schools. I have taken music classes right from the beginning.
College Junior,4,"Don't know if it's the best, but it was the only school in Georgia that offered a Music Technology degree.  Since I have been here, they have opened up a songwriting track.  I was offered a work-study job in the music department, in my chosen field of study and I am able to learn the basics of music engineering as I go through school.  The classes are small and we all get individual attention."
College Junior,4,Financial Aid department has always been very helpful.  I have received more scholarships than I thought possible.
College Freshman,4,"lots is offered but the building are always closed at strange times.

NEED BETTER FOOD IN CAFE !!!!!!!!!!!

WISH WE HAD MORE CHOOSE AND THEY WERE OPEN LATER.

THEY HAVE STANGE HOURS AND ARE NEVER OPEN WHEN YOU NEED THEM !!!!"
Niche User,2,"Okay so far.  Not fond of Nursing Schools grading policy.  Grade inflation is out of control and doesn't make sense.  Students who study and pass exams end up doing worse than students who fail after Professors give points back?  Like if someone makes a 60 and another person makes an 80 why does the person with the 60 end up making a 90 and the person with 80 ends up with 84?  Ridiculous!  This happens on a regular basis.  Sure, I am happy for my fellow students who are able to stay in program because of it, but when their GPA surpasses mine because of it, it's not okay!  Not worth questioning their method of madness since it is such a small program.  They could make your life hell.  They definitely have favorites. Many students receive the SIMS scholarship maybe they have to inflate grades so they don't fail out and money isn't wasted."
Freshman,2,It's over all not too bad. The athletic program is amazing and the Proffesors are dedicated. That being said all of those great things coupled with the extremely poor faculty and staff leave me resting it 2 stars. I am personally a student at LaGrange College and have found the staff to be very disrespectful (The business department specifically). I know it's a cliche but if I'm paying to be here I expect a certain quality of service. The whole reason they use to sell the school is that it is a small school and that means a great support system. I have found that to be utterly false and it's very disheartening. I'd love to see them bring in new faculty and staff to make this college as great as it could be.
Sophomore,2,The academics are fantastic and the professors will do anything to help you succeed. The downside is there is no social scene unless ur in Greek life AND love to party. The campus is pretty but no one does anything outside. This school is a great fit for those who are devoted to their studies and like to drink and play a sport. Outside of that you will not enjoy being at LaGrange
Sophomore,2,"It is a very small school. Some of the professors have very strong liberal opinions and push it on to their students. The school food is awful. The taste is poor and it makes you sick. The dorms are worse than a one star hotel. There is mold in the showers, filthy dirty carpet, bugs everywhere, and brown water coming out of the sinks. The only enjoyable thing is the athletics. Although it is D3 the facilities are very nice and field is great. This is the most enjoyable part of the school even though most teams have losing records. Most professors and staff members are hard to find when you have questions are not very helpful at times. The classes are not challenging at all. I breeze through my classes a lot easier than I did in high school."
Freshman,2,"LaGrange College is an excellent institution for learning. Do not get me wrong. But the required classes you have to take are ridiculous considering the fact everyone has a different major, minors, etc. so that’s a problem. The nightlife is awful. No parties, events, barely anything. And there’s barely any people of color. Don’t go here if you expect to do your work then relax with a good party because it’s not happening."
Sophomore,2,"LaGrange college is very good on academics and helping you get a job, but the overall annual price of the school is too high!"
College Junior,2,"The sports teams here, rarely win. And students don't tend to choose to attend sporting events. They will show up to the ""big"" games, or those games with free food or shirts attached to the entry. Basketball is one of the more widely appreciated teams at this school, given that they are usually the only team that carries a winning record. Football games have very poor turnouts and they typically loose their games. The school tries to make games for other sports more appealing by giving out CE credits, but even then you can only earn 6 CE credits for athletic events. The facilities are great if you are an athlete for the college. Otherwise you are pretty much left with a tiny room with a few treadmills, and elliptical to entertain you in one of the resident halls. The area the campus is located in doesn't provide you with safe running or biking routes, and most non athletes buy gym memberships from outside parties. Intramural sports tends to have a wide variety of participants, but as a non athlete it is very hard to get connected to a team."
College Freshman,2,"I think the quality of food could be better. We play a lot of money to go to the school, so there is no reason the food should be bad all the time. The food choice is a wide variety, however, I found myself eating in the grill a lot. If I was not eating at the grill, I had to go out to eat because I missed caf hours or the food was just bad."
College Freshman,2,LaGrange needs major updates and hot spots
College Sophomore,2,I would love to live off campus because expense wise it would be ten times cheaper than living on campus. However there is nothing available.
College Freshman,2,there is none except taxis
College Sophomore,2,It is very hard to park because all the places close to the dorms are small. You can only get a good space if people go home for the weekend. During breaks it's imperative to come back on campus as early as possible so that you can get a space close to your dorm. Freshman females cannot park close to their dorm at all because it is on the highest peak of the hill.
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife at Lagrange College is a little below average. The reason being is because most of the parties are held at the fraternity houses and they are required to shut down parties at 12:00 AM. This is usually the time when most people are starting to have fun. Even though I don't party,  I think 12:00 is a little ridiculous. We're practically adults now."
College Sophomore,2,"While some meals are average, some of the meals' variety has shrunk since previous years."
College Senior,2,Meal Plan – Meal plan is mandatory even if student live in a on-campus apartment with access to a full kitchen.
College Senior,2,"The Buildings Have Character and History but Need Better Care – The buildings are old, and I love that, but honestlty the staff does a horrible job of insuring that everything is well maintained. My refrigerator was broken 6 months befor the repairman came, and he told us there was nothing wtrong with the fridge and left. two weeks later I had to file another report for the same problem and it never got fixed. Also the windows in some rooms aren't sealed correctly so rain can sometimes find a way in. In addition, it's very expensive to live there."
College Freshman,2,"False Warm Friendly Faces – This school was once a upon time, very friendly and warm that it would melt your heart with the homing feeling you always loved.Now, while the landscape is warm and friendly, the faulty here has changed their ways and are not willing to help someone who is shy and does not know who to fight to get people to know she means business. I am tired of those blank, cold, non-friendly stares I get at Financial Aid office; where I need to go to because I need help and they are not willing to do anything."
College Freshman,2,"There are good days and bad days, mostly bad when it comes to the food. A few things have flavor and cooked right, but not everyday. There were many people who get sick from the poorly cook meals. Some foods are spicy when they are supposed not be spicy like baked chicken or cheeseburger pie."
College Sophomore,2,"Lagrange College is extremely strict. Compared to other schools, Lagrange is strict when it comes to alcohol on campus, and alcohol in the rooms."
College Freshman,2,"I did receive some scholarships, but the fact is LaGrange tuition is way too high, and puts most of their students in serious debt."
Sophomore,1,"The college is greedy and only cares about how much money they can get out of you. The cafeteria had mold on the ceiling for a year straight. The food is terrible with ridiculously short hours.  The people in charge are fake, they act and seem nice but when you don’t do what they want they become mean and vindictive.
NOBODY SHOULD EVER COME HERE."
College Sophomore,1,The dining options on campus are terrible. Not healthy nor enjoyable.
College Sophomore,1,"This parking at Lagrange College sucks. In order to get a good and safe parking spot in front of your dorm hall, you would have to be parked at least by 8:30-9:30. After this, one will rarely find a parking spot in front of the dorms and will have to park across the bridge. This, to me, isn't safe.Walking across the bridge at night for me, is scary since I am alone and a female."
College Freshman,1,Not Very Helpful – No one is willing to help find more scholarships and seem to prefer if you take out a loan instead. Process is slow and confusing. Non-friendly faces does not help either.
College Freshman,1,No Fun – It is boring and depressing here unless you have a car and friends.
College Freshman,1,"Drinking Is Popular – Even though they say it is a dry campus, there are a lot of students who drink here. I saw only one person taking illegal drugs; however, I never him again. So I couldn't report him."
College Freshman,1,"I think LaGrange is a bit too strict, I think the the rules about visiting hours between boys and girls is silly, and there's no point. Just because you put in visiting hours doesn't mean sex is not going to happen, so what's the point? The dry campus thing is also idiotic, everyone just goes to the frat house to drink, and also, the frat houses are giving minors alcohol, WHICH IS ILLEGAL!"

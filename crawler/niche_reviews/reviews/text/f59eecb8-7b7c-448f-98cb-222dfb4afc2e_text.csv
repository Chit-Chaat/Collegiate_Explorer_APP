Junior,5,"This school has no white girls. I only like white girls, so that was kinda balls. Everyone here is ratchet. The teachers honestly don't give a single care about my success. It's honestly horrible here; go to trade school."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Rust was wonderful. My first year was full of surprise . However the staff is great so is the school and students. Everyone is so kindhearted coming from a big town city to a small town will teach you so much about life.

Also, I know where to go if I need anything fixed or check out, Rust College has a very Mass Communication program. But I really like the way Rust College students and professors get their business and class assignments done."

College Junior,5,"No Regrets Here – With me being a science major, all my professors have taught me a great deal of things. The most fun part, to me, were the labs that we had for each class. For example, in organic chemistry, we made aspirin and the process was very interesting, yet fun. The faculty works with you closely. We are the only department that can come in and graduate within three years or in my case, if you are biology majors, you can tack on four more classes and graduate in four years with a bachelor's in both biology and chemistry. Overall, this is the best choice that I've made so far in my life."
College Junior,5,"Need for a Car on Campus – With Rust being a small hbcu, there is no need for a car. Buildings are in walking distance from the dorms or any other place on campus. With every building being in close walking distance, there will be extra money in your pocket from saving from gas."

College Freshman,5,"Parties and Fundraisers With the Greeks – Greek life is not label only for club dancing or showing off their stroll on campus.

College Freshman,4,"Rust College is in a really small town, making it hard to do things for fun. The campus life is not really all that big but there are improvements happening. The dorms are older but eventually you get used to it. The food is alright but after a while you get tired of eating it. We have most regular sports besides football.Some of the policies are a little outrageous, especially when it comes to the dorms. But, once again, eventually, you get used to it. It is what you make it."
College Junior,4,"The weather is typical Mississippi weather, one minute its hot the next its raining."

You really don't need a car on our campus, all classes are in walking distance"
College Junior,4,"My Campus – The facilities at Rust College. There is a big gym and workout center for the athletes. We have great campus activities such as pageants, parties, and games. The library is a great place to study an free access to the internet.The student center is awesome. It has different types of games, pool tables and a movie theater.It is a great place to hang out on campus"
College Sophomore,4,"Stressing Then Rewarding – The Science and Math Department is very challenging. With professors from foreign countries, the language barrier could become a problem if you're not paying attention. However, they show extensive knowledge in what they teach, and in the students. One on one sessions are available upon request, and professors do there best help. My course of study, Biology PreMed, can be very overwhelming at times, but it is all worth it. Especially when you have administrators, and teachers willing to go the extra mile with you. Facilities and technology could use improving but the critical knowledge is very essential to excelling."

College Freshman,4,Rust college has several different areas on campus where there are numerous of computers to use. We have the library and each divison has there own labs. It is unlikely that you will not be able to use a computer. The only bad thing about the computers are you have to pay for printing.
Freshman,2,The experience was really different from other schools.The academics is rather easy. Most of the things in class you work on you will have already done in high school. The cafeteria food is not healthy. There are not healthy choices to choose from.The school does not offer scholarship opportunities and lies to students about what is offered there. 
College Junior,2,"Rust needs its wifi network updated. There isn't enough equipment for students and even if they bring their own computers, the wifi is down every half an hour."

College Senior,2,"There is no public transportation around Rust College. So therefore you have to either have your own ride or share rides with someone that's going your way. Another option is to get a ride with the school to the airport or bus station. There is a need for campus transportation. Even if it's just a ride to the store on the weekends. Also the need for local transportation is high, so students won't be stuck on campus if they do not have thier own transportation or can't get anyone to take them where they need."
College Sophomore,2,"Black Owl – Some people are EXTREMELY immature at my school.  There's a thing called ""The Black Owl"" which is sort of like a burn book.  So if you're not careful about what you say or do, your deepest, darkest secrets will end up in the Black Owl."
Niche User,1,"My daughter is a freshman at this college. She was home for Christmas break and returned to school on January 2, 2017. Normally her Dad drives her back to school.  This time she returned by greyhound bus. School was to resume on January 3, 2017. When she arrived she went to her dorm. When security came with the police and threw her and her room mate out of their dorm room stating, they couldnt be in their dorm room until 10 am the next morning. Leaving them without anywhere to sleep overnite. My daughter called me in tears, not knowing what to do, or where to go. If I could give a zero rating to this school, I would. Inappropriate protocol, and endangering students. What a horrible way to treat students of your school. Im beyond pissed. Im definately gonna assist my daughter in finding a better school that care about student safety."
College Freshman,1,Security is really bad. Locals are always on campus
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do in Holly Springs

College Sophomore,1,The only way to get anywhere is to catch a ride with students!
College Sophomore,1,"The Gym – Rust College has the ugliest gym ever.  The volleyball court is made of blue scotch tape, and the bleachers are the wooden pull-out bleachers that my high school upgraded from.  I think they should tear down the gym and build a dome or a coliseum.  I play NCAA sports and I'm actually embarrassed when we have home games.  However, the library is great ..!"
College Sophomore,1,"Small, Boring Town – Holly Springs is a very small town with no recreational activities. To be able to do anything you have to go 30+ miles. There aren't many job opportunities for college students either."
College Freshman,1,this school is the strickess school i have ever seen
College Freshman,1,"Campus safety is poor. We have security guards that are old and if there was a serious incident, I do not think they could help or make a difference. It seems like anyone can get on campus at any time."
College Junior,1,"Most facilities on the Rust College Campus are fair.  The campus is quite small, which causes the campus to have some limitations in some extra buildings.  The Rust Recreational Center is good.  Even though it is limited in recreational activities, the activities that are provided gives students the chance to free themselves from the stress of class work."
College Junior,1,"Limited to Activities – There isn't much to do in Holly Springs. For activities, cultural events, shopping, or sports/recreation students travel to Olive Branch, Memphis, or Southhaven."
College Junior,1,"Here in Holly Springs, MS, students of Rust College are limited to a variety of dining areas.  There are not any good dining areas considering that the city is so small. Students have to travel to nearby cities such as Memphis, Olive Branch, or Southhaven to have the choice of various dining areas."

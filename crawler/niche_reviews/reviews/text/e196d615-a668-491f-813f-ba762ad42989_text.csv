Junior,5,"As a full time student and a commuter, I made my schedule at WPU convenient for me to attend throughout the week. Although I enjoy learning in class, online classes were enjoyable as well. Students may be assigned weekly assignments, along with tests and quizzes, but students are given enough time in order to excel in their classes."
Sophomore,5,"I love William Paterson University of New Jersey because of the different ethnic and diversity groups all around campus that you'll never feel like you don't belong or don't fit in. Especially if you stay on campus you're going to love the different events you can attend to meet new people and learn about different cultures at the rep your flag party hosted by the student government which so fun and you're going to eat well. There are many events that are hosted either during common hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays or randoms that's why it's truly important to read your emails for the announcements to check out what's going on or happening on campus throughout the week and weekend. Even though, it counts for being a Division 3 school the sports are pretty good, such as the basketball team and volleyball the list can honestly go on and on. Through it, all your experience at William Paterson University is where you want to be. So if your thinking about applying just do it."
Sophomore,5,"This was my first time taking online classes because of Covid-19.  Other then the coronavirus happening I wouldn't be taking online classes at all, truthfully I don't like doing exams online at all or assignments. The Professors tried there best during this time of adjusting, switching from the classroom to the computer. Most of the time, Assignments were pushed back and postponed with everything going on. Lord willing, I go back for Fall 2020 I'll be a Sophomore and most likely I won't be taking online classes at all. Unless my work needs to be done online that's how it will happen but other than that I won't be choosing online classes for my own liking."
Freshman,5,William Paterson is great. I already finish my two semester. Everything is good about about William Paterson University.
Sophomore,5,"Its pretty great! With the COVID-19, the school has failed tremendously. Hopefully the school will be able to help the students financially and give us a lot of opportunities and benefits for our education."
Sophomore,5,Great educators! Awesome atmosphere! I transferred here about a year ago and the experience has been nothing but great. I have met a lot of my friends here and have had lots of networking opportunities here as a result of transferring here. I highly recommend William Paterson University.
Niche User,5,"I toured William Paterson in May of 2019 and I absolutely fell in love with the school not only is it a beautiful campus the students and staff were so welcoming.

Senior,5,I love William Paterson because it has so many great services and it is filled with extremely helpful and kind people!!
Freshman,5,William Paterson is a very diverse school and really express how much it supports minority groups and sexual identification groups. It is a great learning experience for me and very affordable.
Freshman,5,"Before I even started school at William Paterson our school admissions counselors kept in contact, through email or text, to make sure we were ready to start our first year of college. For us freshmen’s they had a class seminar to help us better understand the resources we have on campus. William Paterson University always have options to keep us students having a good time if we weren’t in class or doing homework. I like the fact that they have an app to connect the students with the activities happening on campus and apps to keep everybody informed and protected.And the most important thing that I like about William Paterson University, when it came down to finals week they instructed in quiet hours and opened the library for 24 hours so us students had the ability to study. And being a first time freshman that was such a reliever."
Senior,5,So far the experience has been great! The staff I’ve worked with care about their students futures!
Alum,5,"As a transfer student from Bergen Community College, William Paterson University was the perfect match for me. I say this because I attended another will known N.J college before deciding to go to WPUNJ and the experience was not welcoming. At WPUNJ the faculty members are always there to assist whenever needed. There is also a lot of on campus activities and support for incoming and current students. For example when I was having some problem with my organic chemistry 2 class and I was directed to the student for success where I was being tutored for an hour twice a week along with other that needed help. The school also have a host of extracurricular opportunities for students to explore. I recently graduated in August of 2018 and I loved everything and would not change a thing about WPUNJ."
Junior,5,"William Paterson is a great school, love showing up to all my classes and all of the Professors care about the students."

Graduate Student,5,I love the campus and I love the diversity. The professors are all professional and care about their students.
Freshman,5,This an amazing university! This is my first year in college and the amount of resources they provide students is endless. I picked this college because my dad is an alum and because of how they want every student to succeed at any cost.
Sophomore,5,I love that William Paterson University is associated with community colleges to provide the same education to those student that cannot travel.
Sophomore,5,"Being a student from  William Paterson University it has been a great experience to me. College is the most difficult, stressful and terrifying experience in my life. My first semester in college was scary and stressful but I pushed myself to began reevaluate my thoughts about my purpose in life.  I walked into a classroom with no knowledge of what was to be thrust upon my abilities to learn the experiences in college. I was scared at first because college is way different than high school."
Graduate Student,5,I love everything about William Paterson University and I'm glade I will spend my  next four years of college there
Junior,5,"So far I have a great experience here at William Paterson. Great  professor  and the classes the teach are very good. There are also many clubs. There are dance team, cheer team, football team, basketball team, BSU club, GLEE club, and Christian Club."
Freshman,5,"I like how friendly everyone is, they try their best to help you in any situation. When I first went to the campus I felt so welcomed"
Senior,5,I chose to continue my schooling at William Paterson University because of their reputable teacher education program. The courses prep you immensely for the education world. The professors were very helpful in guiding me along the way and all were available for extra help. The education program requires you to work with students in neighboring schools and this provided me with the necessary experience I needed in order to succeed in the teaching profession.
Niche User,5,The university is pretty average with a kind social life. The dorms for students seem to very small with about 4 students sharing a connect bathroom. During the students third year they have access to an apartment the does come with a fairly sized kitchen. There are parking lots but for most of the school year students are not permitted to drive on campus grounds up to their dorms.
Niche User,5,Great university to consider going too. Very diverse campus with plenty of activities to do on campus. Looking forward to attending this school in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"its been a great journey and staying in willy p has been outstanding. I learned the value of originality Those who celebrate their individuality are not only unique but strong. It takes great strength to defy the definitions of others, and because of that strength, those who create their own paths discover a different world than those who travel the same worn road."
Junior,5,"Diverse campus, many clubs and events on campus.  Students very friendly and professors very helpful.

Brand new buildings built and state of art new dorm opening Fall 2019.

I am a communication major specializing in journalism.
Just got a paid internship in New York City at CNN and I love it!

William Paterson University rocks!"

Sophomore,5,"I love that it is so close to my school. There is always something to do on campus; events, shows, game nights. Such a great college experience. Academic wise all the professors are amazing, they are very eager and care about the students education. I went to Kean University before but the environment was not for me and their financial aid wasn't very good. But at William Paterson everyone I have spoken to is very helpful and no questions go unanswered. I have a lovely adviser that helped me plan out my four year plan in college and helped me get on the right track to success. All the students are very loving as well, no is left to sit alone and they are always introduced to others. Its such an easy environment to make new friends, and new connections."
Niche User,5,From hearing the experience of friends and family that attended it influences you and teaches you so much of college life and opens up the experience and new found journey

Niche User,5,My sister goes to this college and throughout the entire process I was with her for support and I saw everything that the college had to offer and we would visit her almost every other weekend since we only lived an hour away.
Junior,5,I am a transfer student here at William Paterson and I love the campus from the diversity and students being very helpful to me when I was lost trying to find my classes and each building. The surrounding area is very peaceful and calm. The professors are very helpful and very understanding. I was so glad to pick to university and would recommend people to also apply here as well.
Senior,5,"I really like the campus and I find the professors to be very encouraging. As a transfer student, William Paterson University has helped me to choose the right major and career. It has also helped me to get out of my comfort zone and learn to communicate with people among the campus."
Freshman,5,The university open to anyone. There is no negative energy when it comes to the feel of the campus and the staff is committed to helping the students succeed.
Freshman,5,I love the school.  Facilities and staff are great.  Lots of activities if you are living on campus.
Junior,5,I transferred here from a community college. the transition has been easy and i'm happy with my choice about coming here. the classes and professors are good so far. the campus is big and there's a lot of places where i can study and hang out. i haven't found anything about the school that i would change.
Niche User,5,"My experince with Willy P was that they had a lot to offer and a lot of knowledge to share they didn't hesitate with answering an questions,, everyone on campus was approachable with telling you where to go and how to get there, the experince overall was one to braga bout and one to share and to be able to reccommend a school such as william paterson. I believe that william paterson is a great school and that it has a lot to offer to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"The staff is always willing to help and keep pushing their students forward, they encourage good effort and bring attention where the students need improvement so that they may continue to prosper."
Graduate Student,5,I have enjoyed William Paterson University of New Jersey since my undergraduate degree. It is an extremely diverse campus with diverse professors as well. The students are friendly and welcoming. This campus is a home away from home for me and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I am now a graduate student and feel the same way about the university and it’s professors. Am grateful and fully recommend this campus to any student out there!
Junior,5,"I love WPU. It was my first choice college, but I never assumed that I would love it the way that I do. As a communications and music major I feel like I have a lot of support and hope for the future. I’m very happy with the decision I made to come to this school. The community and campus life is more than I could have imagined."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at William Paterson has been awesome. I transferred from another university so it was easy for me to compare the two and William Paterson definitely out shinned the other. At William Paterson I experienced a number of clubs, organizations, and activities to be apart of. The environment itself also felt comforting and enjoyable. It is an awesome school for commuters and for residents because it provides great opportunities for both. Therefore in my opinion William Paterson University is not just a great  university because of its organizations but because of the great programs and opportunities they provide as well."
Alum,5,"My sister went here and is very successful, she graduated from psychology and is now pursuing her masters and will soon be doing the rest of grad school in william paterson so we might be in the same school together."
Senior,5,"I love everything about William Paterson University. From the diverse student body, to the top level programs they offer. I experienced great times while I've been a student there. I can't wait to get back into the university, and earn my degree."
Alum,5,"William Paterson is a phenomenal university for a pretty affordable price. Professors work diligently to help their students achieve and each add their own flavor to their teaching. For students there are many opportunities to get to know each other, but even more than that there are many ways that students get involved in groups and clubs. This school is a great local school for students in the Passaic County Area, but it is also great for students wanting to venture out of their home states and embark on a journey of learning adventure."
Senior,5,"I enjoy my being a student at WPU. All the staff and professors have been very supportive and enthusiastic about reaching out to students. You'll find that the campus is diversity and filled with ambitious students taking up one of the many majors/minors WPU have to offer because 9/10 they will have the major of your liking while other universities may not have a program of what your looking for. Overall it's a huge campus, great school, small classes and I'm any freshmen, transfer or grad would appreciate what this campus will have to offer a long with so much more 😊📚"
Sophomore,5,I love living on campus and how much the school provides for us students. The one thing I would change is the accebility of class registration and resident life process.
Junior,5,Great campus with great opportunities to make you education better. Professors make the environment work friendly and are very helpful woth students.
Senior,5,"William Paterson University is perhaps the best decision I have ever made. The professors here truly want to see you succeed. They prove this by offering extra help outside of class times, making themselves available at night and even on weekends, and giving second chances of some assignments. They truly believe that education and learning means making mistakes, giving unmeasurable effort, and utilizing the resources around you. The campus itself is like the cherry on top. It is both beautiful and historic, creating an atmosphere conducive of learning and social interaction. The resources available to students are in abundance, and include program such as free tutoring, EOF, work-study, and a disabilities and military veterans’ office. The only downside I can truly say William Paterson University has, is its hills. The campus was essentially built on a mountain, which means depending on your major you may be climbing a hill with a 45-degree slop or higher every day to get to class."
Junior,5,"I love William Paterson University! It's so diverse and the faculty and students that assist you are so kind and helpful. The campus is beautiful and I feel at home when I'm there. If could change one thing is the food court options, they should be better, and more healthy. I really do feel safe and comfortable when I go to my car even at night there, it's not a unsafe campus to be on."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience at this university. The subject matter is relevant, and they are extremely helpful."
Junior,5,I just started William Paterson in 2016 as a transfer student and it's been great. The university has a lot of opportunities for students to grow and succeed. There are also many resources to help you in anything that you need. I feel like the professors do care about their students.
Freshman,5,"William Paterson University is a great college to go to because it is one that cares about their students. As a Freshman, I was nervous about going to a new environment. This University is so welcoming and helpful. if you need help, they have it. From free tutors to an on campus health and wellness center. there are so many activities to do on campus as well. every tuesday and thursday there is something called,"" common hour"" which ther are no classes and everyone interacts to make friends and have fun! there are a lot of cool events like there are DJs on campus, spa days, yoga and fitness activities as well!"
Senior,5,"It is a calm campus, for the most part. If you want a place where you can relax, eat, and take classes that aren't going to make you walk a marathon to get to, William Paterson is the place to be. If you are introverted or not that social, you will be comfortable here."
College Junior,5,my professors have all encouraged me to pursue a career and law and have opened up the door to an array of opportunities.
College Freshman,5,the great and the best
Graduate Student,4,When i went to william paterson univeristy i was amazed at how well published and versed the mathematicians were and how open minded they were.
Alum,4,"I took a few online classes and had good luck with the experience. For the most part, the professors are tech-savvy."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at William Paterson. Most of the teachers are excellent and really care. The campus is easy to commute to as well.
Junior,4,"As an upcoming junior at William Paterson University, I believe WPU is a great school. Although I'm a commuter, there's many clubs, events, and activities on campus to get more involved with campus life. As far as academics go, professors follow by their syllabus and may go through their material rather quickly, but aren't hesitant to go over the material again if needed. Overall, I'm excited to continue my journey at WPU and graduate with the class of 2022."
Sophomore,4,I love that this school is very diverse and has many opportunities to further you knowledge. I enjoy that they have many clubs and events for you to attend to help you branch out more in our school community. Smaller classes give me an advantage on getting a chance to have my questions be heard and answered. One thing I would change is the food that is provided. It isn't terrible but it definitely could be better.
Junior,4,My professors have been extremely understanding and done everything they can possibly do to make the transition as easy as possible
Junior,4,William Paterson is a very well diverse University. The class sizes are nice and small with a average class size 40. There is very limited parking which could be a problem when trying to get to class but overall a great experience so far!
Sophomore,4,"I did not take online classes but, with the pandemic we have switched to remote instruction until further notice. I believe that the school did a good job with the sudden change and were very understanding when it came to how students felt about the change in our education."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the setting and the fact that the university is so diverse. I also enjoy my interactions with my professors for the most part- they are understanding people that care about your education as well.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. It's diverse, has great housing, and tons of resources there for you to succeed. I just wish the food offerings were higher quality and safety measures were increased (sidewalks, lights, etc.)."
Niche User,4,"I liked the statistics of graduating nursing students. Their program seems to be very intricate, and well-devised to help students learn. I am excited to see more of their lab rooms, and mock hospital rooms."
Junior,4,"William Paterson University is a comforting place that has faculty members that connect with the students. The diversity is amazing, and there are no dull moments on campus!"
Freshman,4,"My experience at William Paterson is great I love it. Also the people there are very helpful and friendly,"
Sophomore,4,"Large and beautiful campus with experienced professors and staff. The only fault is the layout of the university itself. Little student parking, restricted gated access, two shuttles for 10,000+ residential students."
Freshman,4,It’s a very active school. The common hour every tuesday and thursday allows students to interact with eachother and make new friends! There are a bunch of clubs to join and people are super nice!
Freshman,4,"I enjoy William Paterson University because everything I need is practically right next to me. Since I dorm, all of the classes I have, are a 5 minute walking distance and I love it because it's hard to be late for classes. But other than that, the school is very accommodating, and the professors really try to help you as best as they can."
Sophomore,4,"William Paterson University is overall a great experience however, there are more than that can be approved as in food, housing and certain academic wise."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at William Paterson has been great because I was not afraid to put myself out there and get involved. I immediately joined the Dance Team, Student Activities Programming Board, and became a peer leader and orientation leader. So joining these clubs helped me meet people and even connect with staff members. It is a great community here and most people are very friendly and opening."
Junior,4,"William Paterson is an efficient one to transfer into, and the process has made me know that WPU is a very helpful place, focused on making sure students have the tools they need to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I really like that the Professors care about their students and forge very close relationships with us. They genuinely care, and therefore make our experience better, as they remind us of upcoming due dates, remind us if about upcoming fun events, and days we have off that we might be unaware of. They are always available to talk about class, and if we have any questions.

I also like that William Paterson has commuter breakfasts, and sometimes, during common hour, they will hire a DJ and set up Volleyball and Cornhole. It creates a fun atmosphere and is a nice way to relax in between classes."
Sophomore,4,William Paterson is a college that is for the people who like the outdoor experience. The classes are small enough that the teacher is able to learn my name and able to build a connection with. That is most helpful for me because i was able to process information and receive better grades because of it. There are always resources available to me for extra help also. I lived on campus so it was much more easier for me to take advantage of it. The only downside is that cafeteria food isn't all that good or flavor-full. Also sometimes there needs to be more spots available for some courses because if you don't register on time for the course you may not get it.
Sophomore,4,"The applying process was extremely easy, especially since there was no essay required. I got accepted as a finance major, then applied and got into the honors part of the college. I strongly recommend applying for the honors college, at it not only greatly increases your academic experience, you also get better housing and more in scholarship. My freshman year I resides in Hugh Mountain East dorms, which I strongly recommend. My advisor is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, as I seem to know more about my major and the program than she does, not helping me very much."
Niche User,4,I visited during a campus tour and liked what I saw.  I was accepted and will be attending in the fall.
Freshman,4,I’m in my first year of college and it has been fantastic. Most of the teachers are really great and the advisors are very helpful. They want to make sure you succeed. I wish the food was better on campus.
Freshman,4,I went to a college tour and I was so amazed and I asked so many questions so I can be prepare myself of what to expect for college.
Junior,4,College here makes me feel like I’m at home. I always feel welcome wherever I go and my learning experience has been very successful so far.  I wouldn’t want to attend another school.
Sophomore,4,The one thing about William Paterson is that their connections are terrible when trying to contact a student about important events.
Junior,4,My overall experience at William Paterson was good. The school always held events and different activities. The professors were very nice and helpful and the classes were okay.
Junior,4,My overall experience at William Paterson University has been great once I joined the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated the Sigma Nu chapter the brothers help me get more involved with the William Paterson community. By holding various events to bring fun and connect everyone by making new friends at social events as well as educational ones as well.
Sophomore,4,So far I have visited WPU about 5 times and I love the atmosphere. I really am looking forward to continuing my education and becoming more active with campus activities.
Alum,4,"Nice campus, close commute to home, great professors but tuition has gone up a lot since i graduated in 2009"
Junior,4,The school staff and students are very helpful and extremely welcoming. They encourage you to do great things in life.
Senior,4,What I love about William Paterson University is that the community is very open and welcoming. Everyone is happy to help whether it's the professors or the staff working on the grounds.
Sophomore,4,My experience here has been pretty good. Living on campus isn’t too expensive and the biology program is really good.
Junior,4,"William Paterson University of New Jersey is a solid school with solid teachers, although it doesn't hurt to check ratemyprofessor.com before registering for a class. William Paterson University does its best to help students through their college education through guidance counseling, workshops, and constant job opportunities sent to their students' emails. It's affordable, straight forward, and has a beautiful campus. You can really tell William Paterson University cares about its students."
Senior,4,"What I liked about William Paterson University was that all the professors, from the moment you meet with them, they want to answer all of your questions so that you don't leave with any doubts about coming to study there. The campus is not too big or too small and the environment is welcoming. It is welcoming in the sense that you feel safe because it is not too close to the city and it is also not in the middle of nowhere. I really liked the dorm rooms because the main hall has sofa chairs and a long table where you can sit and be able to finish homework. It will be my first year attending this university."
Sophomore,4,A great school with a lot of opportunities and is open and available to everyone. The teaching staff has a lot of accreditations and there are many things to do both on the inside and outside of campus.
Junior,4,William Paterson University is very diverse and the campus has plenty of events.  Teachers here take pride in what they do and you really will leave this school feeling confident to take on your future.
Freshman,4,"My experience at William Paterson University is very abnormal. It's like I'm in a different world when I walk on campus. I feel that this place is home and it brings me that comfort that I would want to feel from my real home. Willy P is a place of genuine, different, and intriguing people. You'll never know who you'll meet here at William Paterson University. There are so many choices for food so you can get tired of one thing and it's so many that after a while you don't know what to choose; but hey better undecided then having to rely on the same food source everyday right? Anyway my experience here is even growing founder. I have some new opportunities that are coming my way and I'm loving the fact that your all on your own here; yet your not. Get It? Well if you don't you will when you decide to attend such a beautiful institution. It's a great experience I can't stretch it enough. Let's not take my word for it though, come on over and be apart of a wonderful community."
Sophomore,4,William Paterson has been a great school to go to. I've made many friends and gotten involved around campus
Sophomore,4,"William Paterson University is a very good school for students wanting diversity. It is mostly a commuter school because many students live near the area or at least close enough to go home mostly every weekend . The campus life is really what you make of it. Freshman year I hated it but I was shy and didn't get involved in much. Now I'm a sophomore music major , involved in clubs and a touring chamber choir. Also Greek life is great on campus and joining gave me sisters and friends that I would have not made on my own. There are many student activities posted daily by email or just on the webpage to get student out and active on campus. I would recommend this school to any student looking for a good state public university."
Freshman,4,"Becoming a Pioneer student was one of the best decisions of my life. I love the atmosphere, and I am excelling in my academics due to all the available resources on campus. The people here are kind and helpful. Also, my residence hall is not as obnoxiously noisy as college movies made me think it would be. The best part about WillieP is the campus itself. Anyone can relax easily on this campus because the setting is lovely and evidently safe. It is very pretty. The food is my only concern. For instance, the dining hall hours are unrealistic for a college student's schedule. My friends and I always complain that the dining hall is not open late at night and that certain places to eat on campus are not open before our 8 AM classes. Overall, I am still happy with my college selection, and I cannot wait to see what the rest of my four years will be like."
Junior,4,"There’s diversity, some of the professors are very nice and helpful and good socialization, the science enrichment center and math centers are very helpful if you ever find yourself struggling with any course. Flexible schedules and also nice sirene enviorment for learning overall."
Sophomore,4,love the school however food and dorming could be better and more events for student involvement can be useful
Niche User,4,I  went to an open house recently and the experience was good.  The faculty was extremely nice and very informative towards my questions and gave depth on the steps i need to achieve it.  Also their campus life was okay but my only problem was dorms.
Junior,4,"william patterson is a green large beautiful campus with a warm welcoming enviornment. You make many friends from all over the world , and the campus food choices are endless. There are alot of clubs and orginizations and opportunites to get involved! One thing I would like to see more at william patterson university is more fun campus activities that are interactive and draw out the students to enjoiy and participate."
Junior,4,Overall I have had a good experience at William Paterson. All professors and staff have been extremely helpful
Freshman,4,"I have not yet started school yet, but from my visits and from the phone calls I have made, William Paterson is ready to assist whenever you are in need. The campus is also very nice and they are working on updating programs. The buildings are also undergoing refurbishments-making the learning environment even better for their students. I am excited(and nervous as any freshman would be) to be starting at a great school that is not too far away from home."
Senior,4,The best part of the university is the academics. The professors here are amazing and are very knowledgeable about their subjects. Any course taken will make the student think harder than they have in high school.
Freshman,4,"WPUNJ has an amazing atmosphere above all else. Professors are great, students go about their business, campus is always clean. Only issue I have is that advisers rarely pick up their phone and makes it impossible to have questions answered if you can't make it to the campus."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school academically, but it needs more campus enthusiasm and spirit and enthusiasm. There should be more open events besides closed door events you need to be apart of or signed up for in order to enjoy."
Senior,4,"Their art course is very good and has good reviews by many other students. The campus is big and it has a library, gym, dining area, art buildings, etc. There are also many activities or events to go to while on campus."
Freshman,4,"William Paterson University of New Jersey is a well recommended college, in my opinion. As a first year student, my experience was great. Having trouble in the beginning adjusting to live away from home, i soon enough met great people who i began to bond with. The campus is very clean and well kept, and the food there is also very good. It is full of diversity, so you can literally meet people from all over the world. Being that there are so many students, your possibilities for meeting wonderful people, are limitless."
Freshman,4,"William Paterson is a nice school with a good atmosphere and great professor. Like any school it has it's ups and downs, but overall I have enjoyed my time here.  The building I live in on campus is extremely nice and well worth the extra money, even if the shower gets cold every once in a while. The academic buildings are also very nice and are a great place to learn. The professor are nice and willing to help students. The food could be better but I do see the dining hall staff trying to work on that."
Junior,4,"what I like about William Paterson university is the classes are very small and the professors are able to interact with student more.  I enjoy the community here because there are also of animals on campus and in the spring and summers the plants are so beautiful. There are not a lot of things I would want to change about this school but if I could I would change the food distribution system and how roommates are assigned. The food here at William Paterson is not the best. Often time I feel as though their is not much effort put into the food made, but then I have to remember you get what you pay for. I have realized over time the William Paterson assigns roommates based on your back ground. All of my roommates seen to always be from the same place or similar places and of similar ethnicity and race. Not that this is a bad thing but I feel as though this prevent one from getting to know and be apart of a more diverse groups of people."
Sophomore,4,William Paterson University is a small school so it allows you to meet other people easily. People are friendly and academics are okay.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman so far my first year is coming to an end and I'm definitely considering staying here to complete my undergrad. You meet so many people, including ones that can become the beginning of life long friendships. Professors almost always put a lot of effort to educate their students, but occasionally you might have some bad luck with an unenthusiastic professor but that's everywhere just plan and look at reviews for your future professors. As resident as well you have a good amount of food options you can use your pioneer express for outside and inside campus for food including places that do delivery around campus. Overall it's what you make the school and take advantage of the opportunities on campus."
Freshman,4,"William Paterson University is a wonderful university. People are very kind,generous,helpful. WPU has many events and activities for eachother to get to know one another. they have common hour twice a week. They have educational events as well . Overall this is my second home "
Freshman,4,"I truly enjoyed all of the opportunities that were available to me. Whether it be study opportunities, discounted tickets to events, free apparel, internships, etc. There was always something that the school was offering, and that felt very good! "
Recent Alumnus,4,i feel very safe when on campus
Graduate Student,2,take my word with a grain of salt as i do not like online classes but every online class ive had during covid there was no contact no video classes and that threw me off
Sophomore,2,"William paterson, i lived on campus at my time here, there were plenty of nights I needed to walk off campus because the dining hall food was the same undercooked and cold chicken for days at a time. The enviroment of the school is fine, Some teachers don’t care and the workload is very easy. But you will not be pushed to succeed in this school. So many people drop out of the school, if you’re struggling your professors may just look at you as a number. This school is a community college with dorms that is a last resort for most. The Greek life is full of wannabe frat bro’s who will haze you for weeks on end, throw mediocre parties and think they’re the shit. The school throws events for students for the first month of school, and then falls off. Kids smoke week in their dorms all day. It’s very easy to get caught in the wrong crowd. Spring semester is a little different; Half the people don’t come back. This school has a 50% graduation rate for a reason."
Freshman,2,"I would like the Common Hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:30-1:45 to be changed or have some changes, there’s hardly anywhere around campus that isn’t crowded and there’s almost no room anywhere to study in a quiet area and the freshman pre-packaged scheduling sucks and is a disaster and the freshman Will Power course that is mandatory, with no credits, is ridiculous and should either be taken out, or count towards our credits."
Sophomore,2,"The very redeemable quality for WP is the foodservice. I can vividly remember the taste of the cookies, but can not remember learning anything in my courses. The academics at the school are pretty poor and one will find this out pretty early. The communications program is well talked about because most do get involved, yet, the issue lies in the student body. These people are proactive when it comes to the TV club, but not when it comes to internships and jobs. I could not find myself seeing a return on investment. A lot of the environment seems very impersonal and more about getting a degree and winging out. It's a very middle place to be and more people leave after junior year with reason. Also, highly recommend not dorming, many friends have left after freshman year and just commute. If you are expecting a party all year round, look to Rutgers or out of state."
Alum,2,"I graduated in 2008 from the Psychology program here. While I don't necessary blame the school for the lack of advancement I have had for only a undergraduate degree. I do blame the school for lack of networking and advisement that occurred when I was there. I currently work in Mental Health which has been the worst choice I have made in my life. Luckily, I was accepted into a graduate school recently. I also believe their are far more quality schools in the area and this is an extension of basically a higher level community college. If your interest is Business, Teaching or Nursing. Willy P is a great choice, but anything else you can find far cheaper and better schools in the area! Stay away."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing to do on weekends. The only time you see people is during common hour on TR and if people are walking to classes. Bound to see 1 person around campus if you're out
College Sophomore,2,they are not very good. D3
College Freshman,2,"A big commuter school, lonely moments, sometimes."
College Senior,2,"I transferred in and had a very difficult time. I was in the education dept and had to drop out because of all the misinformation. I was talked down to and was treated poorly.  I decided to dorm there one semester and the school put me and my friend in a building where the heat wasn't working properly(only my room, it wasn't anyone else's room). My credits didn't transfer over right and many staff were rude. I have found one person who now helps me but I am still treated poorly. I wish I went to another school. I cant wait to get out of this school and live my life. I am thankful for the hand few of staff that helped and cared. My advice is look into each school carefully before deciding."
College Sophomore,2,The Financial aid office at my school is very unorganized and difficult.
College Sophomore,2,There is not enough Variety available at the dining hall and we should be able to use our meals anytime of the day. There needs to be more healthy options and they shouldn't be really expensive. The best place is The W and they need to accept meal swipes.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, the party scene is very dry here. Most students go home on the weekends. Also, I tend to go to nearby house parties or end up going to Rutgers instead."
College Junior,2,Parties were cancelled in 2012. Willy P students don't know how to restrain themselves when given party privileges due to drinking. You're more likely to have fun by joining a club/organization on campus.
College Sophomore,2,They really made a big deal out of me receiving financial aid this year. I won't be getting any next year.
College Sophomore,2,There are rarely any parties held on campus or off campus. If there are any off campus they are usually limited to frats or sorority members.
College Sophomore,2,"The variety is the worst. They pretty much have the same thing every week. Their food isn't quite as healthy. The ""healthy"" options are really boring and most have options are dressed in oils and fatty dressings."
College Senior,2,My bill was always screwed up on my account when it was time to pay my school bills. I think that was partially the schools fault though
College Senior,2,The dorms really are not anything special. The apartments have mice
College Senior,2,The nightclubs are holes in the wall but close to get too so that's a plus
College Senior,2,"The staff for the most part is terrible and the advisors are even worse. I took at least three courses that I was advised to take by an advisor then found out I didn't even need them

for my major"
College Student,2,It is always easy to find parking if you are early before time.
College Sophomore,2,"I receive an okay amount of financial aid but the office is beyond difficult to work with. They talk over you, rush you off the phone and don't answer any of your questions. Making in-person appointments might make this process a lot easier if it isn't a far drive."
College Sophomore,2,"William Paterson is located in Wayne and is known for floods and being snowed in. Sometimes classes get canceled but not all of the classes do. I feel it is a safety hazard during snow storms. The dorms are located away from the buildings we need to get too. Especially when one of the buildings is located off campus. Once the weather is nice, it is so beautiful outside that everyone wishes to be outside."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally know people who have been sexually assaulted or stolen from on campus and did not receive due justice after reporting the incidents. The sexual offenders were allowed to remain in the campus dorms, and staff took no action against cases in which dorm theft was verifiable through evident proof. Considering the fact that a number of these types of incidents occurred within just the small group of people I personally associated with, I can only imagine how many more similar incidents may have occurred or be occurring throughout the 12,000 person student body. I feel that William Paterson hardly takes the student voice as seriously as it should."
College Freshman,2,"Up at the apartments is fair game once you've been signed in or if you were there before 8. Most dorms are dry, but discreet drinking is very common. RAs only get called if they get rowdy. Most parties are off campus anyway. They're stricter with pot and drugs. I've seen guys escorted out in handcuffs for drugs. If they smell pot, you will be searched."
College Junior,2,"It's all about timing at William Paterson University. Right now, parking garages are being built. This is helpful, because parking can be a pain if you arrive at the university at the wrong time."
College Senior,2,"There is almost zero nightlife. Most of the parties are hosted by fraternities, and most of them are off-campus. The off-campus parties are the ones to go to. Outside of that, people host ""parties"" in their dorm rooms. If you're going to drink underage, make sure the RA and RD don't find out."
College Freshman,2,"No School Spirit – Although, WPU has a wide variety of athletics including varsity and intramural sports, school spirit has run extremely low on campus. The baseball team has a chance to do very good, but no one supports them. The REC Center in very large and has long hours for the availability to students."
College Sophomore,2,Freshman dorms can be described as a jail cell. Its small and you have to share a bathroom with three other people. Disgusting!
College Senior,2,"William Paterson University has a decent network and also allows an average amounts of prints per year however, for reduced stress a personal computer is essential. Labs are often filled to capacity Monday thru Thursday when most individuals have classes. Often times the printers get jammed due the vast amount of people striving to use the system at once. In addition, library and atrium computers are notorious for shutting down and losing assignments. Having a laptop has made my college life much easier than many of my peers who do not have their own computer."
College Freshman,2,Errybody Smokes – Some people are into crazier drugs but walking outside the dorms at night you re guaranteed to smell pot.  Campus police has students walk around and call in when people are smoking but they rarely catch anyone.
College Junior,2,"Pretty Strict Punishments – The police force can be strict about underage drinking and/or drug use, if caught.  Some of the dorms are dry, so no alcohol is allowed.  If you are caught you with it by an RA, they make you pour it out.  If the police get involved, letters can be sent home and repeat offenses can lead to getting kicked out of the dorms.  Most loud and obnoxious parties in the dorms get broken up."
College Freshman,2,Greeks at Willy P – you never notice the Greek life on a day to day basis. Greeks only show them selves at the party's they throw.
College Junior,2,Need to Be Very Poor – I think with most scholarships and financial aid most are given to those that come from a very low income family and a racial minority. This is the only way to get most or all of your schooling paid for or loans. If you have very good grades you increase your chances of getting one though.
College Junior,2,"Studio Apartments Are Expensive. New Jersey apartments are extremely expensive. Most students opt to stay at home or in campus. I personally have searched for apartment threw websites and other resources but with it being so expensive and the crime rate being so high, the options are very limited. Also for you to get to class from a nearby apartment you must have a car since transportation also limited."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't Expect Too Much.. The school isn't that bad, but the staff are very hit or miss. General education courses have way too much required work for their actual worth. There are different ways to get active within the school, but the only way to go out and have fun is if you have a car (without one, you're stuck on campus). For a college campus, I expected a lot more than what was given."
College Freshman,2,"If You Have a Laptop, You're Set – if not, have fun waiting around for free computers"
College Senior,2,"Food for Commuters – There is food available in the dining halls but the meal plans offered are not worth the price for the quality of the food, so rarely does a commuter student like myself purchase a meal plan. Besides the dining hall, in the student center there are fast food stops where you can pick up something to eat, usually only in desperation. The food isn't entirely horrible, but healthy food options in these fast food places are rare to find. It is very diffcult to eat healthy on campus!"
College Senior,2,It Was Okay – The only positive outcome for me being in this school is the dorm life because I lived independantly for the first time.
College Senior,2,Needs More – William Paterson has a very good science department with a lavish amount of supplies including a brand new building. But then you will have the English Department whose building does not even have wireless internet. There are no computers in the student center which would be useful. The library and atrium building do not have enough computers for the students during exam times. Parking is utterly ridiculous. I think a C is generous.
Sophomore,1,By far a terrible experience the people that work their that are supposed to help never do any effort majority of the professors are terrible do not recommend to go here at all.
Sophomore,1,William Paterson university is by far one of the worst schools I’ve been too. The people that work with your financial information are not helpful. The professors always  90%  are not good and give you a hard time . I do not recommend this school.
Sophomore,1,"I was a new transfer student and I received little to no help getting started. I figured out how to sign up for two online courses. But since I was never guided on how to do this, I signed up for a course that was not required for my degree. I emailed my advisor and he confirmed this, so I dropped the course. But then I get an email from financial aid that said I had to be taking at least 6 credits for my aid to be used, which I was not aware of, so they cancelled it without any warning! So then I started rushing to find another course to join. So I emailed registrar that I wanted to join a course. They told me to contact someone else. Then that person told me to contact someone else. Then someone else. This went on for TWO WEEKS. So by the time I got to the person I actually needed to talk to it was too late to join a course. And since I no longer had my financial aid, I had to pay $2,200 out of pocket. I withdrew from the university after that and I will not be coming back."
Niche User,1,"Class of 2006 (shockingly didn't finish). At the time the campus was a disgusting quilt of various  construction projects which I hope are actually finished by now. Made the mistake of living on campus. DO NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS. There were a handful of exceptional educators here that were either very well paid or fulfilling the terms of plea deals. I didn't really like most of them personally, but I have to admit they were good.  The other ""teachers"" were the sort you'd expect: frazzled after a long day of dodging paper airplanes and spitballs at their substitute teaching gigs, eccentric and charismatic and interesting yet totally clueless about the subject they were supposed to be teaching,  completely the opposite of the last one except also clueless,  and finally, not even there. Campus life? No. Local culture? Lol no. Safety? Eh. Athletics? Yeah, they have some of those. But honestly, no.  Again, DO NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS."
Senior,1,"This is my experience based on the Science department.

The advisors are awful and does not care which leads you not to graduate on time. Please choose a different school. The professors for the biology and chemistry departments are awful and have no care in the world. The school only care about money."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school is not for backing up its students.  It does not want to see the best for them and their only goal is the money making scheme they currently run.  Every teacher speaks English as their second language and rely heavily on online learning software such as McGraw Hill and Pearson.  Save yourself time, energy, and stress by just picking a school that value their customers.  3 times have I been signally attacked and targeted by this school to drive me off the path of graduation.  I've even been ""misguided"" by the dean just to have her turn around and act like her hands are tied. 

William Paterson...Hands Down....Is the worst.   I'd drop out or transfer but I am already on my ""last semester"" for the 3rd time.  I wouldn't recommend this college to my worst enemies."
College Sophomore,1,"Overlook North & South are old, rusty, and never clean. The elevators break every other day. The rooms are small and the plumbing sucks. They need to fix the plumbing issues in Hillside and get rid of the odor. High Mountain East & West are awesome very comfortable and peaceful."
College Freshman,1,Campus hallways are never clean. The janitor sits I'm the floor lounge and watches tv. The dorms are extremely small and bathrooms look moldy.
College Freshman,1,"I'll be honest, I partake in some recreational use. But I don't indulge myself in hard drugs like a good majority of students. One girl in my freshman class was caught using heroin in her dorm and still lives there."
College Freshman,1,"No parties at night, unless you want to go to a warehouse party in the heart of Paterson which is extremely dangerous and there are no hot girls there."
College Freshman,1,"I am actually transferring because of campus police. They harassed my friends and I and took a huge toll on us. They walk around wearing bullet proof vests and use profanity towards students. They use intimidation and fear to exploit kids and they try to self-incriminate students. The Sarge is a small lady who is the meanest person on campus. She does her job well but is just a dick. Two officers that have continuously harassed not just my friends and I, but every student on campus are officer Holland, and Officer Mcniel(younger brother) of campus police. They will freely enter your dorms and claim it smells like marijuana just so they can conduct a search. After they rip your room apart and find nothing they will leave it for you to clean up. They will charge you for the smallest things such as rolling papers even if there is no drug evidence around. (I got charge for papers) I can't stress how unprofessional campus police is at this university. It ruined the relationship between my roommate and I and that's what hurt me the most because now we don't talk. Campus police is the reason why I am transferring. They drive their cars over the grass and park in no parking zones. If you are idling your car for a minute for dropping your child off, you better hope you don't get towed or a ticket. They conduct random searches on select children. Yes I am talking about profiling against minorities. It is sad because even the colored officers act racist to their own kind. Police are here to protect and serve. As a student paying thousands of dollars to go to this school, I shouldn't feel depressed by a law official that is supposed to be there for me and you."
College Sophomore,1,"WARNING IF YOU ARE COMMUTING AND NEED TO GET TO CLASS ON TIME SHOW UP EARLY. 
Parking in the main lots fills up quickly and all other lots are OBNOXIOUSLY FAR."
College Sophomore,1,"I've only gone out once to a club near campus. It was a frat party held at Zana Lounge in Paterson. There were several fights that spilled out onto the street and SIX police cars showed up to mace people off of each other. It was awful. Especially after paying 15 dollars to get in. I prefer intimate gatherings, some of the frat and sport houses host parties and those are alright. If you're going out for the night, stay away from paterson. Going into the city is the best, but transpiration is costly and trains stop running at 1:20 AM so, take the PATH or have a place to stay for the night."
College Senior,1,people are boring and fast pace up tight nj people
College Senior,1,you will fail a class beacause  you can not get there parking is dumb
College Freshman,1,There's never commuter parking past 9 am 
College Freshman,1,Most internships here are unpaid and for companies that no one has ever heard of.
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall food could kill animals, seriously. It lacks variety and flavor, but luckily there are other places to eat on campus, which are really good. There isn't much variety if you are a vegetarian or vegan."
College Freshman,1,Everybody drinks or smokes or both.
College Freshman,1,The scholarships are only for honors kids and athletes and it isn't that much money.
College Freshman,1,"There are a lot of rules here, but no one is around to enforce them."
College Freshman,1,"There is very little parking unless you wake up extremely early to get a spot. If not, be prepared to hike to class."
College Junior,1,"Everything is great. But I think it kind of sucks that if someone causes any types of damage on school premises, money will be token out of our security room payments."
College Senior,1,Parking is such a hassle at WPUNJ. They are in the process of building a parking deck because it is such a problem. There have been many instances where i have had to get to campus an hour early just to make sure I wasnt late for class from searching for parking.
College Sophomore,1,"I find it very disappointing that the largest scholarships they give are to new applicants. When they have new scholarship opportunities, they are rarely open to existing students."
College Sophomore,1,"Since William Paterson is primarily a commuter school, parking is atrocious. If you get to school before 8AM, you can usually find a good spot, between 8 and 9:30, you can find a spot, but it's a hike to class, and after that, you could be searching for a half hour."
College Sophomore,1,"The university is largely made up of commuters, which means parking can be difficult to attain. Parking spaces typically fill by 9:30 am and don't open again until noon common hour. Recently it was announced that a parking garage will be constructed this year, which should eliminate the lack of space."
College Freshman,1,"parking is horrible and sometimes it takes me up to an hour to find a spot, especially after 930"
College Freshman,1,This place is awful. All the resident students go home on weekends and you will be all by yourself. So lonely. The only good things here are the radio station WPSC 88.7 and the Jazz program. If you are a commuter it is okay I am sure.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is pretty awful at Willy P! So far this semester it has not been very bad. But my last semester (Fall) it was terrible! I had to leave an hour before my class even started just to try and find a parking spot which did not always happen even though I left so early! Thankfully, they are working on a parking structor that will add 1000 new spots which is great to hear! Sadly it won't be finished until 2014 but it is definitely a must! The parking is very ridiculous and I am happy they are taking action!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Tuiton Is Bad. Too Much – I grow up in a very low cost poor house living with a single parent and she cant pay for college for me so whatever loans I take out there under me and so far  I have alot of loans.
College Student,1,they are very strict you get caught and you are out
College Senior,1,"Apartments Are Rare and Very Expensive – Wayne has very expensive apartments.This area is not ideal for college students who are working part time jobs for low wages.  The surrounding areas are Haledon and Paterson , apartments in these areas are very affordable however, numerous locations are very dangerous."
College Junior,1,"You Need a Car – The only thing you can walk to is a pizza place, a CVS and a 7/11"
College Junior,1,"Welcome to the Ghetto – Teachers and academic programs are very good but do not live on campus, you will regret it."
College Junior,1,"They Don't Care – I would not recomend living in the dorms it is unsafe, noisy, dirty and old. Anyone that has a school id can come into any dorm building during the day. The residence life staff do not enforce quiet hours policies. There are many verbal and physical fights in the dorms. Some people even have a record of physical vilonce in the dorms and they are still not kicked out. The ""kitchen"" are on each floor is disgusting because people do not clean up after themselves. It has been recomended to keep your door locked at all times because of theft. Theft is even a problem in the lirary and any where else on campus. Most cars will have dents on them after going to this school, people always open their door into another car or side swipe it and leave. Campus police will only help if someone has been physically harmed on campus otherwise they do not do anything except pull people over for traffic violetions sometimes. There is a thing called student patrol, its students paid to walk around campus and report if they see anything. These people are usually very rude and don't care about helping people they just walk around and hang out with their friends. Many women I have talked to on campus do not feel safe there at night. They have a service called ""safe walk where someone will escort you to where you need to g but no one uses it because we do not trust them either. I think these problems are based on a broken system, the emplyees don't care and the low class people that attend the school."
College Student,1,"Nothing to Do but Smoke – Pot everywhere, including in the dorms. Everybody drinks in their dorm, and goes out to hookah bars when they get sick of smoking on campus. Nobody monitors pot or underage drinking in my dorm. IF you want something fun, you pretty much have to go into NYC, though a bus takes you right from school to Port Authority, so that's a nice feature."
College Student,1,"Don't Expect to Sleep or Study – The dorms are great if all you want to do is party, but while the RD is nice, he doesn't know his stuff and there are always people yelling and playing music during quiet hours, every day of the week."
College Freshman,1,"It's out of your pocket, but it's probably better because you're not under stupid rules like you would be in the dorms"
College Junior,1,Policies Are a Bit Much – The dorms are very strict when it comes to the wet and dry parts of campus. their are only three buildings that are wet on campus and you still cannot be open with the alochol that you do bring in. School does have a time that guests can stay in your room unless your signed an overnight pass. They limit how many guests you can bring to your room as well have times you should be quiet on campus. No where is it permitted that you can smoke on campus  so people usually go outside.

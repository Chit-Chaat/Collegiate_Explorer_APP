Junior,5,In my time at Lindsey Wilson College I have taken a couple of online classes. Most classes are going to be on your own time. The professors of the classes are always available to answer any questions one may have as well
Junior,5,I love Lindsey Wilson College. So far it has been a great environment to learn in. All the professors are very dedicated to the success of the students and are here to help.
Junior,5,I’ve been to five colleges and this time I am doing so much better than ever!!! This school is so much better than I ever expected.
Alum,5,"My experience at LWC helped shaped me into a better professional and a better person. The people are what really sells this place. Every professor I had truly had a vested interest in my success. I was given countless opportunities to thrive and grow through internships, work study, clubs and organization and more. I love this school and I’m proud to be a Blue Raider for Life!"
Alum,5,I grew up in this campus. My mom and step dad both worked there. I loved the atmosphere and the professors knew you by name.
Alum,5,"Small town feel with the heart the size of the nation it resides in. Great school, great education with caring staff and instructors. Lindsey Wilson feels like home from the time you walk into the front door to returning for your next further degree.  No other educational institution even comes close to compare."
Junior,5,Lindsey Wilson College is the best College to look at because it is such an amazing and friendly place where everyone knows each other!
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman in my second semester here at Lindsey Wilson. It has been such an incredible experience going to school here. They are not kidding when they say that Lindsey Wilson is family. It is so easy to get connected, make friends, and everyone is so kind and helpful."
Sophomore,5,I love Lindsey Wilson. They are a small school so they are centered on students. Class size is small so it is easier to get the help you need. There are always many activities to get involved with.
Freshman,5,"Amazing!!! Everyone is so kind, patient and willing to work with you. The staff are very caring about their students, and the students are very caring for their peers."
Graduate Student,5,"Great school that provides an accelerated weekend masters program! This program provides flexibility, and is CACREP accredited. The professors are PHD’s and are very helpful. The accommodations for the graduate cohort are as convenient as possible and the locations available to the weekend students are also convenient. This is a program that I plan to continue through for my doctorate. I would recommend this program to any serious students attempting to complete their advanced educational goals."
Freshman,5,"As my first semester came to an end, I had a great experience. Great professors at LWC and great atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"Lindsey Wilson has a small campus feel. All teachers and advisors make each and every student feel welcome. Being from a small town it became normal for everyone to work in a factory, I wanted more but was a little afraid because neither of my parents nor brothers had attended college. My advisors and teachers have pushed me through that worry. They helped make the process of registration simple, and the teachers are great about talking with you about your abilities to make sure you know they realize your strengths and don't just see you as another test to be graded."
Freshman,5,I love the school. You get know the people who are in your classes and the professors are take the time out of the day to make sure that you understand what they are teaching .
Alum,5,"My experience at LWC was a very enjoyable one. I recently graduated in 2014 with a BA in Communication. Overall there was a very close bond not only with the friends that I had but also with the other sports teams. Every sport and athlete at LWC supports and attends each others sporting events to cheer each other on. Not only did we have school spirit we also reached out to the community with several different outreach programs. One of which is ""Safe Halloween"" which provides a safe place for the youth to participate in a happy and safe Halloween."
Freshman,5,Lindsey wilson college has always been a friendly environment not only to me but to my friends and family!
Freshman,5,"My first semester as a college freshmen was the very best thanks to Lindsey Wilson! The professors are kind, caring, and helpful when needed. I left as if I ever needed help they would be there to guide me the best they could. Student life is also excellent! Tons of athletes are on campus, so we can all relate on a physical level. Everyone is friends with everyone. The campus is small but very comfy. There are many student activities that go on sch as inter mural sports, volunteer work, and worship sessions. It's definitely my home away from home."
College Freshman,5,Lindsey is extremely safe. I have no problem walking around campus at night alone and I feel safe the entire time and if for some reason I didn't I could always call public safety.
College Freshman,5,I have not yet used the career service but have talked to them about future conversations I will have with them once completing my education and I have high hopes that I will not have a hard time finding a job in elementary education as a Lindsey graduate.
College Sophomore,5,Campus is very involved. Teams do good and go to nationals
College Student,5,the tean is often recongnize in everthing
College Freshman,5,"So far I've been exposed to and gotten more opportunities then I ever did in high school. There's always some sort of event going on on or around campus. My favorite would most likely be the root beer fest Lindsey Wilson hosted as part of an awareness campaign done by R.A.V.E. Lindsey is different in that it's a smaller private school so it really takes the time to get to know its students and help them to succeed. I would choose this school all over again because you can tell they really care and the professors know what they're talking about, the curriculum is challenging and what I'm learning will help me accomplish my future goals."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My overall experience at Lindsey Wilson College has been outstanding, the people are friendly and the campus is very inviting. My major is Sustainability, a new topic that most don't offer and that is a heavy factor of why I chose this school. Sustainability is what makes my school unique, we are making a difference that everyone involved on campus can see and I think that is amazing. I am a hands on type person and in the Sustainability major we focus on project based learning and problem solving. Some of my favorite experiences at Lindsey are during Earth week when the Sustainability team sets up a tent and has class outside all week to relay the information we learn. If I had a chance to choose a school again I would choose Lindsey because of how much this school has transformed my way of life."
College Junior,5,While it is EXPENSIVE it is my home away from home.
College Sophomore,5,"while there are a few rainy day's, most of the time it's sunny."
College Sophomore,5,While LWC is a christian private school they still find many fun things for us to do.
College Sophomore,5,It feel's like my hometown.
College Sophomore,5,"I think it's great! You get one main meal and you can get as much as you want from the salad, fruit, and dessert bars!"
College Student,5,"Wonderful classes, selection, and scheduling process."
College Junior,5,"I don't know a lot about this topic. I'm not sure how much ""partying"" or whatever goes on, and I don't really have much awareness of any crimes happening. Someone got robbed one time, a couple of people have had some of their things disappear, and I heard a rumor that a lot of people get raped in the lower parking lot where there's not much light, but other than that I have no idea. I don't know how much I believe the rumor though. The only thing I know about campus security is they help me when I'm locked out of my room and they give out parking tickets occasionally. I feel really safe on campus. Like, leave my stuff somewhere and it will be there when I come back safe. I don't mind walking around by myself either, although I never really minded that off campus either."
College Sophomore,5,you will always see students using the facilities on campus. 
College Sophomore,5,there is always something going on at campus and everyone is involved in it. 
College Sophomore,5,i play volleyball at Lindsey and sports is a big deal on this campus. almost every one plays a sport. 
College Sophomore,5,the people here are very friendly and are great to be around 
College Sophomore,5,we have students from all over the world at our school. 
College Sophomore,5,i feel very safe and secure on campus. i know that if anything was to happen the school would take care of it.
College Senior,5,"I have never had a problem with the computer labs.  I actually quit taking my laptop to class, if we need to use a computer there are 2 labs and you can check out laptops if needed."
College Senior,5,"Being on a commuter campus, we all leave together at night, campus security is there if needed.  Parking lot is well lite at night."
College Senior,5,"Classes are on Friday afternoon/evenings and Saturday all day-so other students are not on campus.  Parking is not a problem at all.
"
College Senior,5,"Lindsey Wilson believes in it's students growing not only as an individual  student but as a cohort.  As a Cohort we work closely together to achieve our goals.  We, as a Cohort become a support system that is needed for this type of work.  Our Cohort, and friendships will last long after we have graduated from Lindsey Wilson.  I believe the atmosphere at Lindsey Wilson is unique to Lindsey, the support you receive not only from fellow students, but the professors is remarkable."
College Freshman,5,The athletics at my school are well supported by the students and we have a lot of pride. We show a lot of school spirit at the games which helps the players perform better.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Athletics are a big part of the campus and the top teams are Volleyball, wrestling, football, men and womens soccer and baseball and softball."
Recent Alumnus,5,Our computers come in very handy at school and they provide a great service. We all wish printing was free or at least a nickel for every two pages.
College Senior,5,very good and there are always some available for use.
College Freshman,5,"The athletics here at Lindsey Wilson College are second to none. The support we receive from the school and also the community are amazing. The students that are not involved also enjoy it here. If you are doing anything it is going to a sporting event, whether it is a swim meet, baseball game, or even a football game, you are sure to have a great time."
College Junior,5,"Lindsey Wilson's athletics plays a huge part at our school. We were National Champs in Women's Soccer, and the year before that, we were National Champs in Men's Soccer. We have wonderful fan support and great school spirit. We have a very nice workout facility open to everyone. Sports allows our campus to come together as a whole and able us to watch our fellow classmates compete for the school."
College Junior,5,"Lindsey's public transportation is very conveniet and relibale. We have a small campus, so it is easier to maneuver around. The staff is completely nice and always around especially if you need to take a trip to Walmart to get personal items, food, etc. Not only do we have shuttles, we also have Public Safety, and they can come pick you up at any time even late at night."
College Junior,5,Because at Lindsey Wilson we have a nurse avaiable at the school if we need a nurse for sickness.  Also we have public safety at our school and we can call them if we feel unsafe and they can escort the students where they need to go on the campus.
College Senior,5,"ladyotto
Lindsey Wilson College

I came to Lindsey Wilson beccause of the accreditation for the Human Service and Counsleing program. The Master of Education in Counseling and Human Development is accredited through the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP)  is only 1 out of 17 within the US with (CACREP)."
College Senior,5,Parking lot is well lighted ER phone close by. There is plenty of parking
College Freshman,5,I have changed my major 3 times not because the programs sucked or anything there is just so many areas you can try. Every program I have tried there all great and nice and helpful.
College Senior,5,CLASSES ARE SET FOR THE WEEKEND SCHOOL AND ITS EASY TO DO JUST LONG CLASSES
College Senior,5,outstanding I go to the Hopkinsville Campus and am in the week end school and it is the best to fit an adults life style
College Junior,5,"While some student partake in the drug scene. it is very possible to stay away from it if that is your choice. I have never been bothered by it and my RA's have all done a very good job kerping anyone who does, for bothering those of us who take college seriously."
College Sophomore,5,One Big Family – It's hard to feel homesick at Lindsey Wilson College. The Resident Director is constantly planning activities for the dorm community to participate in. From Christmas Parties to movie nights there is always an opportunity for everyone to bond. The more you bond with your surrounding peers the less homesick you find yourself. Definitely a good way to enjoy your college years.
College Sophomore,5,"We Get It Free – Lindsey Wilson is a very supportive school. They understand that many small expensives can add up to one large expense. Therefore, the college helps students with printing paper, network ability, and computer labs.. it's all free. Those are just a few little things that students do not have to add to there stress list."
College Sophomore,5,"Very Safe. Lindsey Wilson, is a very safe college, from the Public Safety being right around the corner, to housing authorities, walking and keeping an eye on everything. You shouldn't have a problem with being safe."
Recent Alumnus,5,My Grades Are Excellent – My grades are really great just struggling to continue paying for my classes that I need
College Freshman,5,"Very Diverse – Campus is very diverse. Lindsey Wilson has a lot of foreign students because there is a large amount of recruiting for sports done in foreign countries. Students are very accepting to students from the different cultures and are usually friends. Students are not only open to other cultures, but to other ideas as well."
College Freshman,5,"Love It – I love Lindsey Wilson College, and I plan to stay here for the rest of my 3 years. I love the small town, slow-pace, and relationshiop with professors. This is a great school that has much to offer."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online classes yet. I start this fall and when i did my orientation, the online people were very helpful."
Freshman,4,"For an incoming freshman, this college is a great choice. Its in a small town and it has a very homey feel to it."
Graduate Student,4,Lindsey Wilson College admission process is easy and affordable. They have very good recruitment staff who assist you throughout the process and the residency.
Freshman,4,They have been helpful and friendly. They have responded to any question quickly and efficiently. They never hesitated to assist me with all my initial paperwork and helping me decide which path is the right one for me.
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere and where it is located. It is in a small town and the campus is not that big and everyone is so nice!
Senior,4,Small campus with students and community very involved and willing to reach out to help others.  Several ways that students may become involved with student activities and events.
Sophomore,4,Lindsey Wilson has been great since I first toured. Ever since I stepped foot on campus the people have been very friendly and makes it feel very home like. The student life is full of different activities and there is something for everyone! I am so glad I chose to continue my academic and athletic career at Lindsey Wilson!
Sophomore,4,Very good for getting your degree and getting out. It will be best to commute rather than living on campus due to a very expensive price. It is even cheaper to rent than to live on campus. The food on the campus is all you can eat but have some type of potato for every meal but has amazing ice cream.
College Junior,4,Everyone is very caring and helpful.
College Freshman,4,Althletics play a large role at Lindsey Wilson College. Many students are athletes and are well supported by fans and school spirit. The athletic facilities are great for athletes and non-athletes alike. The Wellness center has many different activities for student and the local community.
College Freshman,4,The best part of Lindsey Wilson College is the atmosphere and the more one on one attention from professors. The small class sizes allow professors to get to know the students better than larger schools. This provides students with meaningful connections and enhances the overall learning experience. Professors and staff are encouraging and do everything they can to ensure students succeed.
College Freshman,4,It has been a great experience here at Lindsey. My work load this semester has been hard since my original advisor did not take into account the work for my two education classes and me being a student athlete so that has been hard and sometimes it would be nice if the surrounding county was a little more developed. Other than those two things I have enjoyed my time here and have made many friends.
College Freshman,4,Housing is good depending on where you are placed and what parts of buildings you are in. Overall seem to be spacious enough though.
College Freshman,4,Our athletics are very successful and bring a lot of attention and students to our campus. A lot of the students are student athletes and a big majority of the nonathletic still attend athletic functions.
College Freshman,4,My school is very close nit and it is easy to communicate with professors and other classmates on our school work. I also love how beautiful the campus is at how judgment free the student body is. It is a safe friendly place to me that I am proud to get my education.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are well trained and educated in their fields.
College Sophomore,4,I have never been involved im the career center but I have heard plenty of good things about it.
College Freshman,4,The school has a lot support from the students and people who live around the college.
College Freshman,4,"It get my normal classes finished, I like LWC. I like the art classes because they are small and i get more attention. Only thing I do not like is that this school doesn't offer animation which is what I want to be my future career."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Masters program is very flexible for working professionals. Classes are on friday and saturdays, your in a cohort until you graduate, your schedule is set and followed until end of program, and offsite campus on 4 states."
College Sophomore,4,Lindsey Wilson College is a great choice for me. The student activities always have something going on and so do clubs. There is always a sports event to go to as well. The college is full of great professors and education; I'm really confident in my studies because of how knowledgeable they are. The campus is also very diverse which is a great chance to become friends with many people from different cultures.
College Sophomore,4,It's the best experience I could ever ask for!
College Sophomore,4,The professors make classes great. And class sizes are not too large.
College Sophomore,4,Like any other school sports are a big part of campus life and tradition.
College Freshman,4,The Lindsey Wilson staff enforces the rules and regulations where they see they need to be enforced.
College Freshman,4,For the most part I received all the money I needed from the choices and options presented to me. I owe very little out of pocket.
College Freshman,4,Overall the food is good and hot when it is supposed to be. A good hot meal is what is most important to me. There are some items that do not taste the best. But this is never a problem for me because there is always a choice to eat something I enjoy if I do not enjoy that choice.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are kept well clean. It is very easy to get along with those who I share the building with. I feel that the best thing about the housing is the distance from the buildings I have class in. It is not too far away which I appreciate during the colder months of the year.
College Junior,4,Most students follow the rules and regulations without any issues or complaints.
College Junior,4,My financial aid advisor is great.  My advice to new students is have constant contact with your financial aid advisor to make sure everything is submitted properly and in a timely manner.
College Junior,4,The food is well prepared and the desserts are delicious.
College Freshman,4,I got lucky with a good adviser
Recent Alumnus,4,School has age / year requirement to be off campus if not a resident. Campus ln apts were great and new
College Senior,4,The faculty and staff care about the student body and keeping the campus safe.
College Sophomore,4,It's as diverse of a school that I've seen.
College Sophomore,4,everyone is unique in their own way but every kind and always wanting to meet new people.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't seen anyone doing drugs, and anyone drinking alcohol is reported quickly."
College Sophomore,4,I earned all that I needed my first year without any problems. They do all that they can to help you find the money that you need.
College Sophomore,4,They have a wonderful tutoring center and writing center if you ever have trouble with anything. They also provide plenty of quiet study areas in each building that are open almost all the time.
College Sophomore,4,Malvina Farkle day is the best LWC tradition. A day off for community service.
College Sophomore,4,It's a great way for student's to go places if they don't own a vehicle.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone on campus attends all the games.
College Sophomore,4,I normally tried finding a spot by Phillips hall when I came back from home after the weekends. If they were filled I would just find a space near McCandless  hall.
College Sophomore,4,The entire college takes a day off from classes to engage in community service. I felt it was a great way to make new friends while helping the small community.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't seen any negativity.
College Sophomore,4,Just follow the rules and things will be great.
College Sophomore,4,Different strokes for different folks.
College Sophomore,4,Everything from fast food to fine dining.
College Student,4,The weather is mild. Nice Fall and Spring Days. Not too much snow in the winter but this winter was colder than usual.
College Junior,4,"This kind of falls under the same category as drug use in the sense that I probably don't have the best idea of what's actually going on. The policies themselves are pretty strict, although smoking is allowed outside of buildings, but as for enforcement I have no idea. I'll go with the idea that no news is good news and say they don't have to enforce a lot of misconduct and/or they do a really good job enforcing it, but that could just be my obliviousness talking."
College Junior,4,"Lindsey Wilson is in Columbia Kentucky, which is pretty much just like where I grew up - very small-town, with not a lot to do but everyone is very friendly. There are some fast food places and a Wal-Mart, but not a lot of other choices. There are a lot of farms and countryside around though."
College Junior,4,"I live in McCandless Dormitory, which I like. It has pretty small rooms, but I don't need much space in the room. There are community bathrooms, which was weird for me at first. McCandless was kind of thrown together because they needed more housing quickly, so the walls are really thin and sound carries really easy. I really like living in McCandless though. It's closer to my classes than some of the other dorms, it's at the top of the hill so I don't have to climb the hill every day, and it is literally right beside the bandroom and the Health and Wellness Center. The things I've mentioned are things I heard other people say; I don't really see much wrong with my dorm. I can't say much in the way of amenities and ease of the housing process. I live close to campus, so I do laundry and such at home every weekend, and I don't participate in the housing lottery, I just sign up for McCandless again. I like the people here and the social atmosphere is pretty great. The cost is a little rough though."
College Junior,4,"I don't know a lot about the athletics department - the closest I come to sports is marching band - but I see a lot of student athletes in my classes. Everyone seems to really support them, and we have a lot of excellent facilities for sports. There is also a Health and Wellness Center that is open to all of the students that I feel is really top notch."
College Freshman,4,Every sport is good and all the equipment is good.
College Freshman,4,love our work out center & pool
College Freshman,4,"I was fortunate & received one already, thank GOD for this, I need all the help I can get."
College Sophomore,4,I love the school and the professors. Every once in a while you come across one that is not that great but it is that way at every school.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the students come for sports. This means that the school gym is applied to them. 
College Sophomore,4,there is always some party going on or even just people sitting around drinking. you just have to make your own fun 
College Sophomore,4,they are great computer but the problem is being able to find a time when they are not all taken. 
Sophomore,2,Dorms are very dirty and they accepted more people than they can actually house this year. My room wasn't cleaned when I moved in. Cafe food is disgusting. President thinks students are naive and doesn't care about students. Professors are usually nice and tend to help if needed.
Graduate Student,2,"Honestly Lindsey as a whole is Ann ok campus. People are nice and friendly. But I was in the nursing program, which by the way is a newer program. It only has had 5 cohorts (classes) graduate. My experience there was horrible and the only reason i honestly went there was because a had a full scholarship, but my advice to you is to not just choose a school because they are paying your/most of the tuition but because you have researched that it has the right qualities you are looking for especially within the program you want to go on in to.  But the nursing program there was always changing last minute things like exams, policies, tasks, etc. Also there was different teachers like every semester or year and not a lot of them lasted there. But I just want to help some people out in not choosing this school of your going into the nursing program. I which you good luck in finding the right school for you!!"
College Freshman,2,I wish I had never made the move to Lindsey Wilson College. The school is very small in a town where there isn't much to do.
College Freshman,2,It's bad because there are barely any options.
Recent Alumnus,2,Most were pretty quiet if on campus... Off campus was better
College Freshman,2,Few people live off campus. They go home instead.
College Freshman,2,"You can get ""starfish""ed if you choose to not go to class, which is very childish. You'll learn what starfish is if you went here."
College Freshman,2,The visiting hours are dumb and they break up the only things there are to do on the weekends
College Freshman,2,There aren't many parties and if there are they are small or they get broken up quick. You mainly get drunk in the dorms
College Freshman,2,There are no covered walkways so if it is raining you will get wet.
Recent Alumnus,2,You have to make you own fun so you can have a good time.
Recent Alumnus,2,could be alot better for the price it is. We want the best for our buck
College Freshman,2,"The business program at Lindsey Wilson is small, but is definitely growing each year. I enjoy the small class sizes, availability of professors, number of professors, and personal help when needed."
College Junior,2,"There is only one apartment complex off campus, but it is extremely close and pretty clean. The students who live there will throw the closest thing to a party that you will see at LWC."
College Freshman,2,There are a few parties not as many as big universities but we have the lake and that's a great place to hang out when it feels good outside.
College Freshman,2,"Columbia is a small town, there's not much to do at all unless you go out of town. the campus can be entertaining if you like playing pool, working out and swimming."
College Freshman,2,Columbia is a small town and the college is the only thing keeping it alive. Cafe on the Square is the best place to eat in town. If you want something else you have to go to Russell Springs or Campbellsville.
College Junior,2,The off campus housing that my roomates and I have looked at are not the best. Prices are responable enough but the on campus housing is simply better in the terms that buildings are in much better shape and the maintence is speedy.
College Senior,2,"Drugs are easily obtained. They are not hard core drugs.Weed and alcohol are the main. Even though Adair county is dry, there are many bootleggers"
College Freshman,2,"Campus Security – The only transportation I know of on campus is the campus security. If you need to get somewhere across campus or to a school for observation hours, they will gladly take you where you need to go. There are vans through the week that take trips to walmart. Depending on if the sports teams have to travel across the state, or out of state for sporting events, we will either travel via greyhound bus or take vans if it isn't too far."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,No greek life in a town that has nothing to do. You're going to be bored out of your mind more than half the time.
College Freshman,1,Football weight lifting room doesn't even have bench presses. Only dumbbells and a squat rack.
College Freshman,1,"1subway,1sonic,1burgerking,1mcdonalds,1tacobell (that closes at 8)"
College Freshman,1,Visitation hours are absurd in a room you're paying for
College Freshman,1,There are no parties here. All you have is schoolwork.
College Freshman,1,"On my tour, I was excited to go to Lindsey Wilson. The dorms they SHOWED US were somewhat tolerable. But as this year went on I was more disappointed in this school every day (putting it nicely.) I received a scholarship paying a percentage of what others are paying (especially out of state) and I feel as though I am not getting my moneys worth. I have had constant problems with dorm life as well as all other freshman. I lived in Weldon Hall (freshman dorm) for a few weeks, but as soon as it hit winter it was intolerably freezing in Weldon. I put in a maintenance request to resolve the issue, but weeks go by and nobody says anything about it. So I move dorms to Parrot Hall. The morning I woke up to take a shower my mind was blown. It was amazing how neglected these bathrooms were, there was black mold all over the shower curtain, the was mold all over the floor around the urinal from people urinating in the floor and on the walls in the bathroom. Not only this, but there were no locks on the stalls. (We begged for these issues to be addressed, it took an irate student who caught SCABEYS (a sexually transmitted disease that grows in standing water and is a parasite.) emailing the president to get these bathrooms cleaned. So I move again to the final freshman dorm, which is Horton. I thought everything was fine there, heat and air conditioning (that I figured out later that you cant control) new windows, and clean bathrooms. But as the night went on, I realized that there was a draft coming from the window. It was -20 that night. So my room was approximately 40 degrees. I was irate. I waited 5 days for someone to fix it because they did indeed know about the problem, but the excuse was that they had other things to do. Not only this, but you'd better hope you have neighbors that don't like any entertainment, because you can hear everything CLEARLY through the walls. The only thing that you wouldn't be able to hear is a whisper. I would suggest not attending."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Friend raped and blamed because they were drinking.... One of many, few report because drinking has a bigger reprecussion."
Recent Alumnus,1,The on campus dining is ok... Probably best to stick to that
Recent Alumnus,1,Um... Theres a lake.... Otherwise be prepared to drive 30min to an hour for anything you cant get at walmart.
College Freshman,1,3 fast food places and 1 mexican place.
College Freshman,1,Way too random and cold.
College Freshman,1,You'll need a car of you're going to hate it.
College Freshman,1,It's a dry county. No alcohol sold or allowed.
College Freshman,1,"Very old, been around since campus opened."
College Senior,1,there aren't many off campus housing
College Freshman,1,We do not have any frats and it makes me sad because I want to join one
College Junior,1,"We have no legitimate Greek life, though many students have tried in the past. Most students seem to be interested in the possibility. For some reason the school itself has no desire to go Greek and has a tendency to shut down any attempt to change that. There is rumor of a ""Christian"" sorority and fraternity coming to campus. But, they won't have a house and will be little more than a bible-study group."
College Junior,1,"The closest thing LWC has to a ""night life"" is the cycling team. They have a team house which always has around 20 people drinking in it at a given time. Other than that, girls should bring some pepper spray, some of the more worthless football players like to roam campus and harass female students.
P.S. LWC is in a ""dry county"" meaning no alcohol is sold and drinking is not allowed on campus. Sounds fun, right?"
College Junior,1,Since the new nurse building been built parking has not been very good.

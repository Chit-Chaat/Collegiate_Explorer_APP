There are so many nice people here and all of the staff members are willing to help anyone at anytime. I absolutely love being here."
Sophomore,5,The online portion at Minot State University is pretty good. The teachers still try to keep in touch as much as possible.

Freshman,5,"I am attending Minot State University as an art major. I've only been there for a semester so far, but it has done wonders for me. The art department is like a community, and I've never felt so welcomed. Everyone is kind and connect easily. The professors go out of their way to help and teach you. The classes are fun and educational, and every project serves the purpose of furthering your skills in one way or another. I've already seen incredible improvement in my art from the art classes I've taken so far, and I can only imagine how much more improvement there will be in the coming years. There's even two different art galleries on campus- one of them is a student art gallery. There's numerous opportunities to showcase and further your art. It's easy to find a place and a community in the people here. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."

The campus is gorgeous, the professors are knowledgeable and easy to communicate with and the opportunities are limitless."
Sophomore,5,Minot State University is a great place to get an education. The facilities are nice and the student to professor ratio is a big plus for me.

College Freshman,5,"It is really professional and nice, especially for a D2 school"
College Student,5,I feel very safe on campus. We have lights all throughout the school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Through out my study period I have come across different professors, everyone has their uniqueness. On of my favorite , yet most challenging was HRM with Dr. Gary, Statistic with Dr. Andy and Capstone with Dr. Jim. The variety of courses offer are perfect for both MBA and Management. Styles and sizes of classes were average which make it easier to learn."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Minot City is peaceful place, so is Minot State University campus Health and Safety"
Recent Alumnus,5,"It was the best experience I have ever had in College, not because it was all roses but because it happened that they understands you personally and try to bring solution to help you achieve your academic goal. a special reference is Dr. Gary Rose from College of Business which was also my graduate advisory."
College Freshman,5,"They are great, I joined the Beta Theta Sorority!"
College Freshman,5,Everyone at the school was very nice and helpful in applying for classes.

Recent Alumnus,5,The bars are a blast and draw big crowds on weekends.
Recent Alumnus,5,My program creates many opportunities for me and will help me get a career by graduation.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Minot State.  The smaller class sizes made it easier for me to speak with my professors and build professional relationships within the nursing program.  The cost was ideal too, the cheapest in state and out of state rates in the whole state of ND and surrounding areas. Cafeteria was decent and had a lot of selection.  Mini-Starbucks Cafe on campus. 
Some things to be improved: the freshman dorms could be updated."
Alum,4,"Classes went through Blackboard, which if I'm honest was a very glitchy system.  I had issues with it frequently.  However, the IT dept was always pleasant to deal with when I had trouble if needed.  However, all the professors I had online were timely in responding to my questions and messages."
Sophomore,4,My online experience has been good so far. Only one class was confusing and I struggled with it. Overall the classes have been great.
Sophomore,4,"I like the friendliness of the campus. It also feels very safe on campus as well, never really have any issues there.  You'll find some really good professors there, and of course some bad apples. But overall great professors. The bookstore is also a pretty awesome and all the employees are amazing."
Alum,4,Nursing program is small enough to feel like you can always count on the professors for any questions or problems you may encounter. The program was intense but worth it to as prepared as we are upon graduation. Our NCLEX pass rate was almost 100%.
Freshman,4,"It's a nice place to be and study at, though there are some areas of lacking for me. I have some classes and a minor I would love to do, but the university does not offer the class or minor/major."
Sophomore,4,"Very enjoyable and welcoming to incoming freshman and transfer students like me. I am a second year transfer student from Wisconsin, and my time here so far has been great. When I was walking in between classes during our Welcome weekend, I was stopped multiple times by groups seeing if I wanted to join. Very happy and welcoming atmosphere, when I thought I was going to be a man on an island here."
Sophomore,4,"Minot State is a relatively small campus with low tuition prices and small class sizes. The professors are all extremely nice and open to any questions you may have. I originally picked MSU to further my degree because it's my hometown, but it turned out to be an amazing decision."
Freshman,4,Minot State is a smaller college.  It has a nice campus that is easy to get around.  Administration makes you feel important.
Freshman,4,"Could use more diversity within staff. Inclusivity about LGBTQ is fine, but could be better. Some areas of campus are not very disability friendly."
Sophomore,4,I love the smaller setting the campus has that offers students the ability to make close relationships and valued education because of the teacher to student ratio!
Junior,4,I like living on campus and being able to work on campus. Good options in both areas. I've met a lot of people from all around the world. I've gotten a lot of opportunities to work with small and local galleries. (I'm an art major)
Freshman,4,LOVE all of the activities on campus. The environment is awesome. Great wellness center facility and they offer many intramural activities as well as fitness classes.
Freshman,4,"From orientation to welcome weekend, Minot State has offered great activities and opportunities to meet others and be involved.  Just a week into classes and am feeling more and more at home."

Freshman,4,"The staff and students at Minot state university are very nice and welcoming. They prepare and build students for a bright future through their various counseling, tutoring and mentoring programs. There are also many activities and clubs for students to join, in the school. The academic system is very good. There also a lot of students from various part of the world. The campus and it's food is very good."
Freshman,4,"Minot State, I believe, is a fairly good school with lots of diversity and campus itself is beautiful. Dorms at Minot State are all Co-Ed so not the bet in my opinion. Food's not that great but it gets you through, and not a lot of parties."
College Freshman,4,I really like the Minot state university!
College Junior,4,I am able to participate in activities without the drug/alcohol being an issue. I don't drink or do drugs and I am very involved in student life
College Junior,4,blue lights and security available
College Junior,4,Some instructors are better than others. There are some classes where I feel I haven't learned anything
College Junior,4,I am enjoying my college experience. Some classes/instructors are better than others
College Junior,4,Plenty of escorts if needed
College Junior,4,Easy to get into and flourish.
College Junior,4,So far I've gotten what I've needed out of my return to school.
College Junior,4,"Aside from one terrible online-only class, I have had a positive experience so far. This has been aided by my advisor."
College Student,4,There are many opportunities after graduating from Minot State.
College Student,4,I have loved all of my teachers. They are always available and willing to help.
College Student,4,"I do not live on campus, but a lot of people love living in the dorms. It is fairly cheap, and very close to the classes at Minot State."
College Student,4,"I love Minot State because of it's size and affordability. Along with this, it is also a great school. The teachers are always willing to help, and the classes are fairly small. I would continue to graduate at Minot State, however pharmacy requires me to transfer to NDSU."
College Sophomore,4,I am very happy with my choice of school. The classes are interesting and geared toward my career choice. The cost is less than most other schools in the area.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I personally experience some issue on campus, mostly with the housing president Davy, I believe he wasn't fair most times to foreign students and not just myself alone a whole lot of other student felt the same way. I act and behave favorable to some skin color and preferences and sometimes send letters of eviction to student on monthly bases which make people sick and tired of living on campus. His harassment and disturbance, has negative influence of student performance. However, I will give campus Great in terms of every other aspect of the campus, though some buildings are old but they still look very new and well kept. the atmosphere is very conducive for study, and this is why i decided to study here."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I think the athletics are doing just fine because its a less populated place compare to other city. Students are involve but I think few are mainly require from international students, which could have be of benefit to the school, however it is understandable due to regulation. Nevertheless, the athletic facilities are very updated and the wellness center its very passionate about their activities. The gym is perfect for Olympic which is my most favorite of probably i because i like it the most and as a two time gold medal in indoor rowing, I also appreciate the initiative of adding indoor rowing to the facilities."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not very athletic, therefore I am not a fan of the sporting scene, but when I have an opportunity, I do attend different sporting events."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience so far: I work part time so outside of class time I have to focus on studies and homework, not much time for recreation. I socialize with just a few friends (less than 5). I try to get some of the college experience, but it's difficult to participate in everything, as you have to keep focused on achieving educational goals. My school is one that I really enjoy because it's in a quiet place - city lifestyle is non-existent. The greatest thing for me now is to complete my major. I would choose my school if I had to do it again because of the interaction between the professors with the students. They are very interested in success of their students."
College Senior,4,Class sizes are great! The most frustrating thing I've experienced was a stubborn professor who was unwilling to help me improve my grade.
College Senior,4,"I had an unfortunate run in with a man on my way to class a couple years ago, and the following year the security blue lights went up and cross walk signals. It shows me that my school takes security seriously."
College Senior,4,I would choose this college again. There are some good opportunities here.
College Freshman,4,The blue lights are great!
College Student,4,Ilike my school because its a smaller college which helps me focus more and my professors will pay more attention to me. if i had to start all over i would definitely pick it again.
College Sophomore,4,"I go to Minot State University where the staff is friendly and helpful. Class sizes are usually 20-25 people, just like my high school classes. I love that I can meet with my professors outside of class to get extra help or advice on my college career. The curriculum for my major is challenging, but it makes me feel accomplished when I do well. Minot State has enough diversity from students that come from all over the world to study there without being overwhelming in size or population."
College Freshman,4,"The school has very reasonably set policies and are lenient on some and make it fair like visitation and noise. If a group of us are just sitting in the hallway talking and hanging out having a good time they give us warning to keep it done but mostly let us have our fun. But they are strict where it matters like drugs and alcohol, making it a better place to live with les drama and worry."
College Freshman,4,"As far as first year dorm experiences this went extremely better than what I originally expected. Its open and spacious and the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The dorms are within walking distance of every academic building and provides easy access to the student center, post office, and library. It is also very affordable especially for a first year college student with little to no funds. It was a great overall experience, all I had to do was send in a houseing application and down payment and I was placed in a room. Then the RA's planned little events and get togethers so that we could get to know each other better and that provided grat opportunites and was a lot to go to."
College Freshman,4,Campus life is okay. Very comfortable and clean. Good roommates give you a good stay.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is fairly nice here at minot state. In the athletic training department there are some really awesome people who know there stuff well and i love listening to their stories.
College Sophomore,4,"We are a division 2 NCAA school, so we have some great teams on campus. we have a lot of international students that come to play sports, so it is cool seeing different types of styles of playing in the different sports. i feel like our school is mostly athletes, but it is fun."
College Sophomore,4,"For athletic training at minot state, i think it is a fairly new program so there are not a lot of students in the program, but that makes it so the students in it can do more hands on things and a better feel for there career choice."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall I like the classes I have been in, but some professors go very off topic and rant on about non necessary things. Also, the teachers talk about certain topics and have strong views on them, which makes it seem as if they were trying to make us believe what they do."
College Sophomore,4,"Since the town is not very big most things are only a 5 minute drive away or in walking distance from campus, and many places deliver."
College Sophomore,4,There have been extensive measures taken to provide safety both on and off campus.
College Senior,4,The undergraduate communication disorders program includes a semester or two of clinical practicum which I have really appreciated. It's so much better to learn by doing and I enjoy being able to apply my knowledge in an educational setting.
College Junior,4,The athletic department is full of hardworking people that have fun while working hard!
College Junior,4,"Lots of diversity, lots of athletic guys and cowboys"

College Junior,4,We are a Division 2 school. We support all of our athletics programs and we are in the process of completely renovating our entire athletic facilities which are becoming some of the best in the region.
College Junior,4,MSU is a great school! Small where you can get individualized attention by your professors.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I think the alumni network is not effective enough, I;d suggest they are supposed to get in touch with every of the graduating students and encourage them t be part of the alumni network, help in looking for jobs/internships. However, their are various employers, coming for annually job fair on campus. the career center/ services on campus is not effective."
College Freshman,2,The school is not competitive. No job opportunities here in this school
College Junior,2,"If you don't have a car you are stuck with eating either cardboard pizza, subway, or taco johns."
College Junior,2,At first the food selection is not bad. The issue with the food on campus is that they serve the same things every few days so after a few months of the same food it becomes bad.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not very big at Minot state and i rarely see them try to bring new people in.
College Sophomore,2,Many students would like to live off campus but it if very difficult to find housing and it is VERY expensive.
College Sophomore,2,Our sororities do not have houses to live in and do little for the community. I know little knowledge of what the fraternity does for the community.
College Senior,2,have no idea. I don't pay attention nor have any interests at all in this topic. good luck.
College Freshman,2,Unaffordable unless you have roommates
College Freshman,2,"Minot is a growing small town, but it's still very tiny. Most people say that the only thing to do here is drink, and that's kind of true. The shopping is extremely limited, there is no night life unless you enjoy sitting at a bar, and community activities are pretty cheesy. There is one event that is somewhat enjoyable and that's the state fair that takes place every year not too far away from the university."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very clean but really strict and don't promote many social interactions.
College Junior,2,They have taxis and they are expensive. I have heard they are late a lot of the times. There are also busses. I don't use the transportation since I have a car.
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of places to go out to eat. A lot of fast food, which I am not a fan of. I don't want to have the same thing over and over. There seems to be more restaurants coming in, however with the oil."
Recent Alumnus,2,housing off campus is very costly and since most students can afford they end up staying on campus which much chipper!
College Student,2,Football players just got suspended for drug activity. They should have got more of a punishment than suspention
College Junior,2,Minot State is a small town state school so I am nervous to apply to medical school but the classes have seemed moderately rigeorous but i do not feel supported.
College Junior,2,I was a tranfer student and I feel that I was not well supported. My advisor did not help me plan out my classes at all so I feel like I am figuring this all out alone and it is frustrating. Hopefully this semester will be bettter!
College Student,2,"I guess it all depends on your attitude towards cold weather.  About 8 months out of the year, the temperature is below 50 degrees.  Minot sees a fairly good amount of snowfall each year.  However, the summers are beautiful."
College Student,2,"There isn't much Greek Life at Minot State. I previously went to UND and Greek Life was a vital part of campus. At Minot however it doesn't seem to be as significant. Personally, I prefer this."
College Junior,2,"Sports on Minot State's campus aren't very big. We are getting better and we just moved to Division 2 which is very exciting, but provides tougher competition. I love sports and hope that our fan support will get bigger."
College Junior,1,"I came back as a non-traditional student, and haven't had any interaction with frats or sororities."
College Student,1,We only have 2 sororities and 1 fraternity. We only have a house for the frat. I would say something with Greeks need to change.
College Junior,1,I was involved in a domestic abuse situation and the school did nothing to protect me or make sure my safety was taken care of. I was the victim and I felt like I was basically being pushed off campus by the administration.
Recent Alumnus,1,Very cold unless you are a native of North Dakota. It can get really cold especially that its the prairies and so no trees to block the wind so can get to -20's due to the wind.
College Student,1,There's really nothing that seperates them from other schools
College Student,1,"If it snows, people forget how to park and take up 4 spots of the already limited parking.If you dont get to campus pretty early you won't get a spot and will have to park at the top of the hill behind the dome. And considering it costs $35 to park in an unreserved lot for the year, the amount of times you probably won't get to use it makes it a waste of money. Its better to not buy it and park just off campus"
College Junior,1,Nightlife is non-existant at Minot state. The college is too small to support a university-style nightlife. People over the age of 21 (and many under 21 year olds with fake IDs) will go to the bar but won't have a lot of fun. I usually have to drive to the university to go to Greek life parties. The University of North Dakota holds some very wild parties!
College Freshman,1,"Only One Frat; No Sororities – There is only one frat at MSU, and it isn't very big. There are NO sororities whatsoever. I think they are working on starting a sorority, but so far, we only have the frat."
College Junior,1,"The parking here sucks. There is limited space for the number of students they allow to have parking permits. They give out too many permits, and half the time, you can't find a spot to park in, or if you do, it happens to be on the edge of another parking zone and you don't realize it and get a ticket."
College Junior,1,"No Housing – There is a housing crisis in Minot. For those few who are lucky enough to get a place to rent, the cost is skyhigh for this size of town. With the recent flood, practically every available living location is already occupied. I recommend living in the dorms, if you're lucky to get in them now since a good share of students have now lost their houses as well due to the flood."

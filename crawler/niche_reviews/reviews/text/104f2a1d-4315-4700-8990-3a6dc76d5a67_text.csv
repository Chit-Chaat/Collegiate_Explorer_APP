Niche User,5,"Small school with intense academic expectations, but really great community of students with very supportive faculty and staff."
College Sophomore,5,"It's fantastic. I'm vegan and I never feel like I have to veto options because of it. Moscow is very friendly to all types of ethnicities, tastes, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"The friends you will make will last a lifetime. We are a tightly knit and honest community. We stick with one another through the good and the bad. The teachers are always there if you need them. They're the type of people who invite you over for dinner and make sure they know if you're hanging in there. Coming to college can be so hard, especially if you're close with your family. The community here makes it all worth it. On top of that, I've never felt so intellectually challenged. I love the studies and I feel like I've grown more in the last two years than in my entire high school career."

College Sophomore,5,"Most people think going to college is an opportunity to drink and have sex. 
What a sad debauched view of higher education. The Nightlife at NSA is usually full of homework, yet also tons of fun. There are tons of ""parties"", climbing the mountain, watching movies, walking the palouse, cigar smoking, house parties etc. none being the expected drunken stupors of today's college life. I've had a number of dull nights, but also some of the best nights I've had."
College Student,5,"NSA Community – NSA is located in a small town on the border of Idaho and Washington. It is a college town, since WSU, UofI, and NSA are all within 20 miles of Moscow, Id. It is populated with a wide variety of people. There are the permanent residents of all ages, hippies, and college students. It creates a very healthy atmosphere with no lack of variety."
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome (But Safe) – Nightlife almost always involves a party. Whether it's a dinner party, study group, sports event, or just a party party, there's always something going on. Students try to make everything they do fun and glorifying to God, whether it is reading an insane amount of pages or playing group games."
College Sophomore,5,"Couldn't Be Better – The students at NSA are great. We all mingle well together and there is a lot of accountability to be honoring to each other. There's a diverse collection of interests which helps keep the school vibrant and healthy. We love to party, even in the midst of a strenuous workload. Relationships here are great because people are encouraged to enter into a relationship only if it is going to be 'serious,' not just for fun. And everyone is held to biblical standards in the way they conduct themselves."

College Freshman,4,"My financial aid went fine, the Financial Aid director makes sure to keep things working like clockwork."
College Freshman,4,"The classes here are very challenging and rewarding. Not only do you gain new knowledge, but you grow as an individual learning about foreign material."
College Freshman,4,"It's a small school with relatively little need for computers, so the number of computers in the library is plenty. Most students use laptop, and the Wifi is easily accessible. Printing is 10 cents a copy and easy to access."
College Student,4,"If you are going to apply to NSA, plan on having your own computer. They don't have computer labs. They do, however have relatively reliable internet access. Although there is a campus printer, everyone is expected to have their own supplies, etc."
College Student,4,"Professors at NSA – The professors at NSA are all learned in their fields and love what they teach. They inspire their students to greatness,to strive for their best. They are all Reformed Christians and incorporate their beliefs into the college curriculum and the students."
College Sophomore,4,"No Worries: Fun and Safe – At New Saint Andrews, I feel incredibly safe. The students there are accountable to good moral standards by the faculty and the community. However, these standards are not oppressive to students. Rather, we have lots of fun and are encouraged to do so safely by the faculty. Watch out for some pranksters, but in general, NSA is a fun and safe place to go to school."
Niche User,1,"One of the worst years of my life. Unless you want to be a part of a cult and act in a certain way to make your way into the ""in"" group, I would strongly encourage you not to attend. Professors are not understanding or helpful, the people who graduated still mostly work in grocery stores or insignificant jobs, and the school is not REGIONALLY accredited, which I was not told until after I transferred out. Those were some of the loneliest months of my life. I was offered a cigarette my first semester, told of the incredible bar scene downtown, criticized when I was ""myself,"" and altogether horrified that the main goal of nearly everyone there was to get married. Academics were horrible--I learned nothing truly meaningful during my time there. Best decision I made was leaving."
Niche User,1,There were no online classes offered when I was there. It was nonexistent and there were no options.
College Freshman,1,"There are hardly any Apartments close to Campus, and mostly hotels. They are also far from campus."

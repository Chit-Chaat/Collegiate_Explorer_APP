I've came here for a few volunteer opportunities and I've had a blast every single time."
Niche User,5,"I am taking a few classes online connected through different universities as dual credits for college. I have heard from fellow friends about their experiences with BSU and online and with all the craziness going on, they are completely fine with it. yes it's tough but college is built with the up most rigor. It's manageable and totally worth it."

The campus is very clean.  The buildings are well laid out and housing seems to be abundant.  I like that BSU focuses on good values and integrity.  It also is very accepting of different races and beliefs. I feel like diversity is accepted and encouraged.  Everyone is very friendly and I feel safe while I am on campus."
Freshman,5,"The professors are extremely flexible and willing to help you through the process, they are also lenient on the turning in policy as we all know that technology has it's downfalls but they do a great job and they are here at the end of the day so we all learn and pass!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Boise State, but I cannot attend this upcoming semester due to health problems. The school has worked with me one on one to help me get on track to graduate after a short gap year, and has made my admission to the Honor's College a priority! They've always been lovely to work with, and I can't wait to see what my future college plans hold."

Junior,5,I love everything about boise state. The involvement is amazing from other students to professors to even parents!

Sophomore,5,"I love BSU. The campus is extremely safe and the size is ideal, not too big or too small. The weather in Boise is also perfect all year around. The professors and students are amazing, super thoughtful, and always willing to help. There are so many helpful resources that the campus provides, such as the study rooms, the writing center, math center, chemistry instructional center, and much more. Overall, my experience at Boise State so far has been amazing and perfect for me."

Junior,5,Wonderful school and amazing classes and opportunities. Good professors and safe school environment. Lots of great resources and programs to help students. Lots of fun activities.
Junior,5,"My first online course required a bit of a learning curve. Fortunately the professor was patient, informative and quick to make a personal appointment with me. I just needed her non-judgmental coaching once. After the first two weeks, I was on my way to a well-earned ""A""."
Junior,5,Counselors and academic advisors are hands-on and supportive. The Registrar's office has been extremely generous with their help in coordinating my previous academic credits from previous California colleges.  I feel confident and motivated.
Sophomore,5,"Boise State University was the best decision that I have ever made. My favorite part of this school is the community. Everyone is so welcoming and involved with the city and school. It has the perfect mix of everything you want in a college experience. It has the city but also the feel of a small spirited college town. I would like to see the professor and student relationship improve. I understand that it is difficult for professors to connect with students when they have so many but I had one professor who required us to meet outside of class and I believe this meeting helped me to excel and feel motivated in the class. Overall, I do not think one could have a negative experience at this University."
Sophomore,5,I  have so far loved my experience at Boise State. The people there are super nice and caring. The professors care for you and your well-being and the staff is nothing but helpful!
Niche User,5,I love how there is an education path for everyone. The professors are very helpful and the other faculty are very helpful when it comes to technical difficulties or financial aid questions.
Sophomore,5,"Boise State University is a really great college. In the beginning I was very skeptical of it, but it grows on you after a few months. The students and professors are so nice!"
Sophomore,5,"I am going to be attending online for nursing. They respond quickly to emails and seem to be very friendly. They have assisted me with all that I needed. I am excited to be attending Boise State University to receive my BSN. It is a go at your own pace program, so I can complete the program quicker than usual. Thank you Boise State University for this option. I can't wait to get started and to advance my education in nursing so I can become a critical care nurse and help those who need it at their worst. I want to help my community and Boise State is making that possible."
Sophomore,5,This university exceeds every expectation I have of it. The social and academic opportunities it has given me have helped me to improve not only as a student but as a person as well.
Freshman,5,"There are plenty of things to do around campus and near the university for people with many different interests. There's music, workshops, skateboarding, hiking, fishing, swimming, skiing, cycling/mountain biking, etc. The dorms and campus community are very welcoming and there are plenty of opportunities to make friends. Most classes are close together, there are great campus dining options, and almost any resource you could need is available on campus. I have been having an excellent experience here."
Junior,5,Boise State is an amazing university community. Staff members and on-campus workers are very welcoming. There is always exciting events happening on campus and they do a great job of providing quality athletic programs. The professors at BSU are extremely knowledgeable in the areas of expertise and it is clear that they are passionate about teaching their subject. I have had some professors that have made a hug impact on my life and my learning experience. This is the place to be. Boise is incredible and I would highly recommend it to ay student looking of an amazing university experience.
Niche User,5,"I am transfer from the College of Western Idaho graduating with my Associate's Degree, and I plan on earning my bachelor in Interdisciplinary Studies. I think going to Boise State University will be amazing since I have been born and raised in Boise, Idaho. The fact that having the school near me is very benefiting to have access to, and allows me to use my resources that I have close to me."
Freshman,5,I love everything about Boise State. I do not think anything needs to change. I love all the activities at this school.
Freshman,5,"Boise State University is an amazing college with endless opportunities. The dorms are nice and well designed for new students. The school has a welcoming, friendly vibe. There are so many different activities and clubs for students to join to get involved! It is located in a safe town with nice people."
Sophomore,5,"I have been attached to this university since high school. I have been living without my family for almost 5 years now and it has been tough to be an adult. But many BSU staff members have helped me in my education and personal life. I am really thankful for having this BSU family and knowing that I can count on them. I wouldn't change anything about this university. Everything about it makes it unique and wonderful. I don't regret attending BSU and when I graduate, I will come back to stay in the BSU community and help others as well."
Senior,5,"Boise State has an inclusive culture that allows students the freedom to explore new interests and connect with new groups, while continuing to foster a safe and respectful learning environment."
Alum,5,"Department of Chemistry&Biochemistry is AMAZING. When going to your advisor, instead of saying Idk to something they don’t know the answer to, they say “let me call this person & see what they have to say, & we’ll figure it out from there” (or something along those lines). Overall, teachers seem to care about their students, both in&out of the classroom, &care about students having a good learning environment. They are pretty much readily available after class/during the hours they say they’re available. They welcome questions&are willing to answer them without making the student feel stupid. The teachers are pretty personable too. Idk how other departments are at BSU, but I give the Chemistry&Biochemistry Department a BIG thumbs up :)"
Freshman,5,Boise State University is a great school with a great community! It is also close to home which is very important to me.
Sophomore,5,"BSU is a clean, well-kept campus with an active community and some pretty amazing professors. While I don't care for sports, there's no denying the following for the Broncos. Downtown Boise is just a 15-20 minute walk away and is easily the nicest city I've ever seen (the farmer's market!)."
Freshman,5,It is a very good school and It offers potential to incoming students. They were able to offer me and oppurtunity to attend there wonderful. The student life at Boise is stellar and they offer many activities for students to be apart of. They also have very good athletics and a lot of support for the sports games.
Freshman,5,"I have moved across the country to attend Boise State University. I am only a freshman but my experience has been exceptional. The extra activities provided, the friendly people, the gorgeous nature, the rigorous academic classes, and the downtown scene have made my trek so worth it."
Niche User,5,I really like Boise State because it is right in the middle of Boise and there is a lot of stuff to do down there.
Sophomore,5,"The staff is incredibly helpful and they offer flexible class hours and options. Also, many opportunities to get involved both on and off campus."
Senior,5,"Boise State University is a large institution, yet it can offer assistance in many ways to the student body. From study workshops to tutoring Boise State provides avenues to encourage academic success."
Sophomore,5,Even though Boise State is a Division one school it still allows for people to get close with their professors and learn in a smaller classroom. Which I feel has benefited my education greatly.
Freshman,5,"I've loved my first semester at BSU. I'm an out of state student and I like the independence I have now. Dorm life is going well, the facilities provide me with everything I need, from kitchens and laundry to places to gather to watch TV or study.  I'm really enjoying my classes for my GIMM major. The food options could be better, it gets boring just having a couple of places to go with sub-par food. It is easy to get around campus, I haven't needed a car. I either walk, bike or skateboard to classes. Downtown Boise is just a 10-minute walk and a great place to hang out with friends to get off campus.  Boise is a great city and I'd recommend this school to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"With a broad campus, lots of school community activities, and a wide range of well developed programs, Boise State provides one of the best college experiences."
Niche User,5,"Really nice school with nice people and most professors are nice, the surrounding plant life provides nice shade in the summertime."
Junior,5,"Professors and Staff are professional and very supportive of the students. I can attest to this personally; as a member of the Idaho Army National Guard, I was called away a month from the end of a semester. Each of my professors was more than willing to be flexible with this difficult scheduling situation. I received nothing but support and encouragement from my instructors. 
Excellent university. I have yet to have a negative experience here."
Sophomore,5,I'm a second year at Boise State and it has been by far the best experience I've had. The University community is very friendly and welcoming. If you enjoy the cold and snow this is the right spot for any one that wants to experience some winter weather and have a white Christmas. The city of Boise is a football town that supports their Broncos from year to year a fun place to go see a game on the famous blue turf at Albertsons stadium.
Niche User,5,Visiting Boise State University last year was how I fell in love with this school. Everyone is so nice and friendly and the campus is super close to downtown Boise. The size is a perfect medium and overall is an amazing school!
Alum,5,Attending Boise State was one of the greatest decisions of continuing my education and set me up for success. The university allowed for many growing opportunities to become well developed in my field and as an individual within the community.
Niche User,5,Absolutely amazing school. Awesome school culture and spirit. Feels like a small town but is right in the center of Boise off the Boise river. Absolutely beautiful. Can't recommend enough.
Freshman,5,"Easy application, quick response, good counselors. The virtual showcase was super informative and you could ask questions too."
Freshman,5,What I like about BSU is that your connected to a very supportive community with strong school spirit and people here really do care about your goals and career path to success.
Sophomore,5,"As a returning student, I appreciate the welcoming atmosphere. I value the level of energy from other aspiring students."
Senior,5,Boise State University is located in the heart of downtown Boise which is a great location. You can spend your time in the city or drive ten minutes and you will be in the mountains. The facilities are very nice and they are continuing to construct new buildings. The students here are very friendly as well as the facility and staff. Boise is also a great place for internships or to obtain a job after graduated since the market in Boise is expanding quickly.
Senior,5,"Boise State university is a great university due to the friendliness, community-based atmosphere, the numerous resources for active lifestyles, and the exceptional education offered. Boise State is a diverse place where you can meet someone new everyday with so many students attending. The professors at Boise State University love to interact with the students and care if they succeed. They want to get to know each student and want students to enjoy what they are learning. There is always something going on at Boise State that someone can be a part of weather it be activities, volunteering, internships or a football game.  Boise State University is in the heart of Boise, so there are a lot of things to do on your free time and students are never bored especially on a Boise State Broncos Football night!"
Senior,5,"Boise State University has an amazing staff and a beautiful campus. BSU lies right on the Boise River and is nestled close to lots of outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and boating all in the heart of Idaho's capital city!"
Freshman,5,Boise State has an incredible campus and great teachers. The campus is beautiful and has a great athletic scene.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing, especially my criminal justice and psychology professors I had. They teach in a very informative and interesting way that got me engaged with the material. The campus itself is very lively and full of students with true school spirit. This is the kind of environment that I've wanted in a college, and I've got it."
Freshman,4,"During Covid, being able to come to campus and experience life and classes in person has been a life saver.  While they are still keep us safe by requiring masks and 6 feet distance, there is still a sense of community and activities to keep us busy.  The city of Boise, which the campus is part of, is beautiful, clean and vibrant.  I feel so blessed to get to be on this campus and part of the Bronco's clan!"
Freshman,4,"Some of my classes are online, but they have learned how to make it effective and streamlined.  My professors have online office hours where we can reach out to them."
Niche User,4,"I like the level of education provided. It did take a while to get a personal contact with someone, but I believe that they will be able to help me. It is pricey, but compared to other state universities, it isn't that bad. I just hope to be able to find scholarships. BSU is really good about costs though, as they theselves offer a couple of differrent college scholarships to help their students out."
Freshman,4,"It is such a great location, great molecular biology program,  I love the student and greek life it's just the great college experience that every one truly deserves to have!"
Alum,4,"Devoted to education, culture and student well-being, Boise State University helped me to both survive and thrive in college. Concerning education, I enjoyed professors who are passionate about their field and cared about improving their classes. At the end of each semester, students filled out surveys for each class and professor. I remember several times professors mentioning they changed their course because of student input. This shows their dedication to best serving their students. Culturally, Boise State makes an effort to create a welcoming environment through clubs, events, and facilities. As a freshman, I created lasting memories with friends through events. These events helped me to feel part of a community. Lastly, I found Boise State University Health Services to be an available, professional and educational program which helped me stay healthy throughout my college career. Without this facility on campus, college would have been much more difficult."
Junior,4,"I have only had online experience from COVID so from the circumstances the online was good. The sudden switch was a struggle for all, students and professors but we had to make it work and we all worked together to get to a great overall online experience."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely fell in love with Boise State. I did not grow up in Boise, so being new there was a struggle at first, but Boise State has the most friendly students, which made it easy to make friends and get to meet new people. One thing that I do wish would change is seeing more diversity on campus. I was shocked to see there wasn't many people of color on campus it did scare me at first. Yes, Boise State does have diversity clubs but there isn't that many just because there is not many diverse students on campus to create new clubs or programs. Other than, that Bsu has great sports team which us students like to be involved in as well."
Junior,4,"I really like the community of people within my major (Construction Management). Not only is the team of staff very friendly and ready to help students succeed, my fellow Construction Management peers are willing to drop what they are doing to help others out in their classes. We have the only building on campus that is student owned, and its wonderful that we have a place that we can not only do homework, but relax and hang out with each other. I've had a wonderful experience in the program and I couldn't think of being at any other university because of it."
Junior,4,"When Covid surfaced, it was hard for all of us to adjust to. Most of my classes were difficult at first to get used to zoom meetings and the online atmosphere, emailing being the only source of communication (besides during zoom meetings), and the altered way of doing assignments and tests, but it didn't take too long to adjust. One of my classes, however, was already set up to go online if we ever needed to, so that transition was very easy.

Other than Covid, I've only had a few online courses before during the summer, and they were very easy to do, especially with my summer schedule. Overall, it's been a pretty good experience and I appreciate the professors adjusting to Covid in good time."
Alum,4,The online experience was much better although I do not like blackboard. Once I transferred to Northwest Nazarene University I like the platform canvas way better. It is organized better and is much easier to use for online classes.
Senior,4,"I think that Boise State does an excellent job in working with students to get their degrees, regardless of your outside life. The advisors are amazing!"
Senior,4,"I generally take at least one class online every semester, and so far it has been great! The professors really know what they are doing. They are great at making the course engaging so that the students don't forget about the class. Even the professors who have had to adjust to online/remote schooling due to the current circumstances have done a wonderful job."
Sophomore,4,The online classes are easier in aspect of getting a job and able to be flexible with homework. Only downside when everyone went online were some teachers didn't know how to properly use the technology to its full potential. Also harder to ask questions in the moment about homework.
Sophomore,4,Boise state is a very open campus with a lot of opportunities to learn. They offer many classes to suit many majors. A lot of the teachers are super nice and willing to go the extra mile to help you learn. Only downside are the bigger and more common classes are harder to develop a personal relationship with your teacher.
Senior,4,"Boise State University has a small college feel but as a university. The campus is easily navigable and clean. Technology is up to date. The downfall is parking. You can buy a permit, or pay everytime you park on campus. Off campus parking is rare but campus parking tickets are affordable. As an independent student who has limited income, paying to park is a huge issue."
Senior,4,"Online classes are a little more work in terms of having multiple assignments and discussion posts with other classmates. If you are employed and taking classes, online classes are the way to go."
Junior,4,Online classes are Boise State are fairly easy to follow as professors are very lenient and work well with you to ensure that you have a positive experience.
Sophomore,4,"I did not intend to take any classes online but once classes were moved to an online format, I think that all of my classes and professors produced a smooth transition. I knew what was expected of me and my professors were extremely understanding and accommodating. All of my assignments were already submitted on a digital format anyways so there was not much of a difference. I do not prefer online classes but with the circumstances, I feel that Boise State handled it very well."
Junior,4,"Boise State is a safe, well organized campus. It offers many activities and a community that is unbeatable."
Senior,4,"I love the campus and the variety of classes. Some of the professors aren't that great and don't care, but there are also some who have been amazing to connect with!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the smaller campus. It makes it very easy to walk around campus between classes without rushing. The faculties are all very nice. However, I would like to see some changes in the student government structure since it doesn't seem to represent the student body very well currently."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at Boise State. Campus life was entertaining and alive. I was in two smaller programs at the university and was able to get to know my professors very well as a result. My cohort of students was supportive and engaged in their education.
Sophomore,4,Boise State is such an awesome school! It’s growing and the university sees that and is building and allowed the campus to grow! We are expected to get a baseball stadium within the next 5 years & everyone is extremely excited for that!
Freshman,4,I liked how Boise has the city feel as well as a small town feel. Boise state has amazing school spirit and is in a safe area ten minute walk away from a lively downtown.
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a great time as a student at Boise State University. The town truly bleeds blue and supports that school, in fact, most of the state does. The professors seem to be concerned mostly with their research, however, you can definitely someone that is invested in you as a student, as long as you show the same interest back. I hear that business school is great, but I was a STEM major."
Sophomore,4,"The attendance policy is a little wacky. New art building is beautiful, Boise is a lovely town, and the free shuttles on campus are extremely helpful for getting around."
Freshman,4,So far I have only visited  Bosie State but I loved the campus and am very excited to spend the next 4 years attending the school.
Niche User,4,Boise State University is a very good school to expand your knowledge and create many memories with old and new friends! There are many fun and enjoyable activities to do their with your peers.
Junior,4,I've had a positive experience at BSU so far. Professors as a whole are helpful and teach useful materials.
Junior,4,I  have really enjoyed the time I have spent here. There are so many opportunities to be involved from student research to intramural sports and student organizations. Once I started becoming more involved I felt a deeper appreciation for the University and everything it offers. I would like to see tuition rates freeze instead of increasing each year and I would like to see courses make an effort to find affordable textbook options.
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Boise State University. The campus is beautiful and well maintained. It is easily navigated and feels roomy even though it is not all that large. The professors employed here are wonderful and generally care about what they are teaching. The academic advisors I have worked with have been incredibly helpful and worked with me to make my time here the best possible. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus and in clubs or groups. There are great university held events that work to get students together and form a real campus community. The university is inclusive and welcoming to all. There is something to be hoped for in relation to resources for students of the sciences, and I wish only that the university would dedicate a bit more to bringing the programs up to speed.  Overall, I have loved my time at Boise State University and would recommend coming here to anyone that asked."
Freshman,4,"Boise State is a good school. I feel as though most classes are effective, most teachers are understanding, and there are countless resources to help the student become the most successful version of themself. That being said, there are a few issues. Parking is sparce on campus, food isn’t great, the dormitories are either sparce and sterile or old, run down, and dirty."
Junior,4,"Boise State is a very comforting, safe place to attend school. The campus is beautiful, and it is right on the Boise River making it a great place to get some fresh air. Boise is a very home-y feeling place, I see friends on campus multiple times a week, and nothing is very hard to get to."
Niche User,4,"I liked the student life a lot. Just the good vibes from students passing by. I feel like this is a place I can make friends, grow, and thrive."
Junior,4,There's flexible schedules and most professors are welcoming and encourage questions as well as office hours. Campus is lovely and there are parking options. Wish there you had to pay less for parking.
Sophomore,4,"Most of my professors are or were extremely helpful. Campus always looks really nice, there's never really any garbage lying around. The grounds are well maintained. The staff are always friendly and willing to help whenever you need it. The school tries to look out for their students while they're at school and while they're at home. For example, the school has a food pantry for students if they ever fall on harder times and they also have an ""emergency fund"" for students that suddenly can't pay for school to give them a free semester if their circumstances weren't the greatest."
Junior,4,"Overall good college. Have had some issues with particular professors, parking, class availability and counselors. Great college but it is having some difficulty keeping up with the increasingly growing city around it."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed attending Boise State University because I felt as though the professors truly cared about their students and wanted to see them succeed. The classes were all organized and I learned something in every class. I did not feel as though I was required to take a course that did not benefit me in some way with my degree. The campus is beautiful and a place that you can feel safe.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very nice and want to help you succeed! Greek life is very popular and everyone seems to have a great time. Not only do we have a successful sports program, but also there are always fun activities that are going around. Whatever it is you are into, you are likely to find someone else who shares your same passions."
Niche User,4,"College Tours are good, very informative. Excited to be a Freshman next year. Campus is great, a lot of things to do on campus. Clubs and sports to get people out and do something. Its much more then just another school, its a place where you can meet new people"
Freshman,4,"So far, I like the majority of my classes and the instructors. I’m not a huge fan of the UF 100 courses and I wish there were more class options for the biology and chemistry classes."
Freshman,4,I realy like that there are a lot of things you can do on campus. I also appreciate all the resources that are available to students.
Niche User,4,"I went to Boise State University for a competition, I like how many trees and plants are on campus and how many walking trails there are."
Junior,4,"I have completed a dual credit class, and it was very exciting and it was an easy process to apply. I will hopefully  be transferring their next fall to receive a degree in education. I am positive that this school will be a great place to receive my degree, so that I can start teaching."
Sophomore,4,"Boise State has a beautiful, modern campus with excellent resources. There is a lot of inclusion and diversity."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman college can be a little intimidation, however the campus of BSU is set up in a way that I feel safe, and there are different places to study or eat. There are also several events that happen and informative emails that are sent out.  Most teachers care about their students education and advise them to on ways to study or be successful in their classes."
Junior,4,Beautiful campus right by the river. The staff is very helpful. And the people on campus are friendly.
Graduate Student,4,"Local university located in a hidden gem of a city. Close to tons of outdoor recreation opportunities (e.g., skiing, hiking, backpacking, biking, etc). Campus is tidy and most of the administration is very helpful and thoughtful. The Graduate College is growing and values student input. Very reasonably priced for a graduate degree program!"
Freshman,4,"I have lived relatively near Boise State University my whole life, it has a really pretty campus. The football games are exciting and energetic, people are generally nice and accepting. It is a really friendly environment and it has tremendous support from the city. Classes offered are good, and the class sizes are a good size too. 
This school has a ton of outdoor activities, which include skiing or snowboarding in the winter, floating the river in the summer, hiking Table Rock, and many more activities if you are into those. The student recreation center is a nice place to get a workout in, it also includes a climbing wall, and a pool."
Niche User,4,"I took a tour at Boise State. The campus was very nice and pristine. I wasn't very impressed by the cafeteria, but maybe that's just me. The tour guides were sweet, and the Honors College interested me."
Junior,4,"Teachers are very understanding of my medical condition and they have lots of classes to chose from. Unfortunately counselors are hit and miss so you have to do a little research on your own regarding jobs and classes. Food on campus is ok, but there are not as many options at Southfork and Boise River Café as I would like. Tons of ways to get involved on campus with clubs and special events every week! Also, the shuttle is free to students and can be taken around campus or into downtown Boise!"
Sophomore,4,"I love all of the opportunities for student involvement on campus. There is a multitude of clubs, organizations, and societies on campus for me to find a place where I feel welcome and supported. There is an abundance of on-campus resources no matter the issue. All of the professors I have had are highly qualified and have worked to ensure the student had an understanding of the material."
Freshman,4,I really like Boise State it is every inclusive and they really try and show that they care for their students. In this University there is a lot of resources to help out students. Something that I would like to see change is more equal focus on majors.
Freshman,4,I like the people there! Everyone is so kind and helpful! I love the classroom environment because the professors are always there to help you! There are also classroom learning assistants that are able to help you understand the material after class if needed kind of like a tutoring session.
Senior,4,There is a great mix between social and school scenes. The majority of people you see on campus are very inviting and friendly. The professors are always looking to involve students more and engage on a personal level.
Sophomore,4,"I love the location of Boise State. It is right across the river from downtown which makes shopping and adventures so easy if you don't have a car. However, Idaho is much more conservative than I would prefer. I feel like I have learned a lot about the subjects in my classes while also challenged to learn more about myself. There are no bad options for on campus housing, but mostly just freshman live on campus. My one wish is for a Greek Row. The athletic department dominates the Mountain West Conference but fans only go all out for football."
Sophomore,4,So far I have loved Boise State University. The campus is beautiful and shows off the beauty of Boise. I also love my classes. Every single teacher I have encountered has been quick to offer help and my advisor is excellent. I am currently very happy with my choice and would not change a single aspect.
Freshman,4,They have been prompt in responding to my inquiries and helpful thus far. I have not yet attended classes.
Sophomore,4,"I have liked the majority of my teachers, and I really like that it has a university feel at the same time you can walk from one end of campus to another in 15 to 20 minutes at most. The location is great- it is right next to Downtown Boise, and the landscaping is also very nice and well-kept. There are a couple downfalls. Parking is hard to find, and they also oversell parking tickets, so sometimes I don't have anywhere to park even with my purchased permit. Also, dealing with their housing department was such a nightmare that I moved off campus solely because of it. The townhome I lived in was very nice, but the faculty for housing was disorganized."
Senior,2,"Don't fall for the educational industrial complex. College might have been the way to success in the past but now it is just a business focused upon making as much money as possible. The college president makes 425k a year while our society faces a student debt/school accessibility crisis. The school itself is awesome and I have loved my time here but college isn't what it used to be. Now it is all about having high prestige teachers so as to look more appealing on paper and get more customers (students) but the truth is that high prestige teachers are in high demand and in turn demand high wages. The only way to pay those wages, however, is by jacking up tuition prices and shifting the burden onto the already financially struggling youth who have been brainwashed by the educational industrial complex to believe that the only way to make something out of yourself and enjoy life is to go to college. Do yourself a favor, don't come to college. Explore/discover who you are instead!"
Junior,2,"I am a transfer student at BSU. I guess I haven’t really felt like I’ve fit in just yet. My ratings may reflect that. With financial burdens weighing me down more every year along with more credits added on from the transfer, I’m finding it harder and harder to want to stay. I wish there was more of a support system in place for transfer students."
Sophomore,2,"As a business major, I've had many struggles with professors. In my experience, it's pretty much up to you to teach yourself most classes, which is really frustrating considering the amount of time and money college is. Might as well have just bought the books instead of paying tuition. Most professors are experienced in their respective fields, but don't seem to try and convey that information in a way that makes sense for students. Frankly, it feels like most profs left their previous jobs to come here and wait to retire rather than trying to inspire and educate. It's discouraging trying to register for classes and seeing terrible review after terrible review for professors I have to take. I don't feel I'm getting an education worth going in debt for."
College Junior,2,There isn't much intolerance but mostly everyone is white and conservative
College Junior,2,"You really can't say Boise State is at all diverse. The few minorities we have here stick with each other. The student government is white, faculty is white."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Depending on what you're majoring in, it can be pretty tough to find a job after college. The career center from what I know is only online and I've applied to jobs through there and haven't heard back."
College Freshman,2,"When I went to U of I I saw huge faternities and sororities taking part in the community they live in. At BSU there are no sorrorities or faternities that I am aware of. If there are some, no one knows they are there."
College Freshman,2,Most places are  expensive but not compared to the dorms which are the most expensive.  Some places are close to campus but you will have to find a place fast because they fill up quickly.
College Freshman,2,The only real expensive food is the food the School sells at the store.  The prices of these items are sometimes twice the price of the original price somewhere else.
College Freshman,2,"I don't live in Campus, but I have heard that it is not worth the money and that the dorms are really small and roommates are sometimes not the right option."
College Freshman,2,There are absolutely no late night options and that totally sucks.
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive any scholarships and I think athletes get far too many of them. It's entirely unbalanced and disgusting.
College Freshman,2,"If you get stuck with a bad roommate, you're pretty much screwed, its very rare that an RA will help."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive the financial aid I needed, but it's not the schools fault."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a student paying for my education, however I'm very limited on my financial aid due to my parents income. I've applied for numerous scholarships, however because I'm not a minority and my parents income I'm very limited. This is extremely difficult when in school."
College Sophomore,2,"The reason why I'm saying its bad is because, WHERE ARE THE HEALTHY OPTIONS. For instance there is an extreme limited amount of fruit in the BRC."
College Sophomore,2,I live in a terrible apartment complex. I would have rather lived on campus.
College Freshman,2,"There aren't any fraternity or sorority houses on or off campus (as of now, there may be one in a year or two). I do see a lot of students dressing up for meetings for Greek life and they do have activities sometimes. But overall, Greek life does not have a large presence on campus... at least it's nothing at like in the stereotypical college movie. I wasn't expecting that, of course, but it would be kind of cool if we had a Greek row at least."
College Freshman,2,"Good luck finding a party. Unless you know people or are in a frat/sorority they are hard to find. They are mainly dorm or house parties; dorm parties always get busted and there's a good chance a house party will too but the parties are crammed with people and I've never really enjoyed them. You have to be careful not to get caught if you're underage because they hand out MIC's like candy, and we don't and never will have a Greek row."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a huge selection near campus unless you like fast food. Nothing healthy on or off campus besides Whole Foods market which can be expensive. Once it's winter though it's impossible to go anywhere unless you have a car because of the snow, ice, cold, or combination of all three."
College Freshman,2,"I ended up in a suite with 7 other people so I get my own room which is nice, but it is shaped oddly so it can be really tight and crammed. I think they did a bad job with the roommate selection and RAs are apathetic and don't really care what you do but they're not very helpful and I don't feel like I could go to them for help. The dorm itself that I'm in is ""new"" but it looks and feels like its 30 years old. You can hear everything in the suite."
College Freshman,2,Not very many activities are going on and if they are no one goes to them. The ILC and the SUB have a modern look and design to them but every other building and even the dorms on campus are old and gross. There's not much to do and if you do find something fun to do the BPD will bust it sooner or later.
College Sophomore,2,The food sucks and is always the same stuff and way over priced
Recent Alumnus,2,"The vacancy rate in Boise currently is around 2%, and rent rates have only risen over the past several years. Because of this, even qualified candidates have a difficult time securing a rental because so many people are applying for the few vacant properties. I would also say that the average rent has increased $100-200 since 2010. Even professionals are having a difficult time finding rentals."
College Sophomore,2,Boise Police has it out for College kids underage drinking and hundreds of tickets are given out every week yet the administration does nothing about it.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life here is mediocre at best. A lot of the greek take pride in their organizations and tend to be very exclusive. IF you're not greek you cant party with them, but their parties suck."
College Sophomore,2,"I can't say enough bad things about campus administration. They let just anybody onto campus to get in students' faces as they're walking to class, and often times you get yelled at by religious nuts on the Quad. It's a very liberal campus, and so the students often formulate opinions based on very little facts and research, and will put signs up on the quad and disturb you while making your way to your classroom. It's good to be involved in politics, but I hate people who always try to shove it down my throat. There's a time and a place to talk about political issues, and when everyone is trying to get to class, is not an appropriate time."
College Sophomore,2,Campus dining has minimal options and very limited hours.  The latest time that you can get any food source on campus is 9:00 PM which is extremely early for a college student's late night study.  Food options are not adequate for vegetarians or vegans even though it is advertised as is.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life at Boise State is not very large. We do not have a Greek Row, and I have not heard much buzz about joining fraternities or sororities."
College Student,2,"Parking sucks on campus unless if you get a permit. General permits give you a variety of places you can park but they fill up quickly and are not guaranteed. Other permits are specific locations only and can't transfer to different locations across campus. They are very expensive but guarantee a spot. If none of these options are utilized then you must pay meters or parking garage fees, which cost even more in the long run, or park off campus."
College Freshman,2,They aren't growing with the times
College Freshman,2,"are on a power trip 

take their jobs too seriously 

only a few cool RA

Overpriced for what you get"
College Junior,2,Underage drinking is a nono
College Freshman,2,No general parking anywhere near the other end of campus from the stadium and other parking is too expensive
College Sophomore,2,Housing is very expensive. Ridiculous how you have to pay a lot to share a bathroom and have no stove to cook on.
College Freshman,2,"Just not great, a lot of fast food and no student discounts at all"
College Freshman,2,"Winter lasts for a very long time, which is something I was not expecting. But, you get used to it after a while."
College Freshman,2,"Buses don't run very late, so plan your activities around the bus schedules."
College Freshman,2,"Housing tends to be expensive if you want to live near campus, but it's also super poor. The neighborhoods are run-down and extremely questionable. In addition, most housing is only available in June, which is a problem if you want to save money by living with your parents over summer break."
College Senior,2,I spend 3 hours a day commuting for school
College Freshman,2,"Quite honestly they're ridiculously strict about some things. If you get a cool RA you're set but if you don't, look out for some of their more strict policies like visitation. If you're planning on drinking in the dorms you better know that no one is around and nobody else knows. There are snitches everywhere."
College Junior,2,Mountain town.  No real nightlife.
College Junior,2,"Core classes are good. Junk classes like ENGL and UF cost a lot of money, take up all your time, and deliver no value."
College Junior,2,This is a little city in the mountains.
College Freshman,2,In the winter when things start to freeze I hate having to waking across campus for my next class. The whether here is so unpredictable too
College Sophomore,2,I was not eligible until this semester.
College Sophomore,2,I do not participate in sports.
College Student,2,This campus is not strict people get away with a lot.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not very apparent on campus and not many people take part in it.
College Sophomore,2,"I park in T-lot which is between the Brady garage and the Morrison Center.  This parking lot is probably one of the most expensive because you are guaranteed a spot to park no matter what!  Its super close to all the main class buildings and food areas as well.  Its far from the dorms (expect Towers).  However, if you forget your permit sticker, but your car is registered with a t-lot permit, you will still get a ticket!  That's bit ridiculous in my opinion.  The general lot permit holders always have to move their car to a garage or another part of campus for the football games or basketball games so that the public has a place to park.  The school provides rent-able cars for you on campus as well.. a lot of people just walk though.  If you don't want to pay for a parking permit, then you will be parking far away and walking quite a distance, but some people don't mind that.  I, personally, wouldn't want to walk in the dark, cold, across a busy street though!"
College Junior,2,"I am a journalism major and they're J school is a disaster. The year I came to Boise State they offered a communication degree with an emphasis in English and journalism. They told me that they were phasing it out but because that is the catalog I was starting with that I would still be able to get that degree.

What they didn't tell me is that they would stop offering some of the classes that were necessary to graduate making it virtually impossible to attain that degree, even though technically I still could. I was forced to change my degree emphasis before my junior year which caused all sorts of havoc.

That being said, Dr. Seth Ashley, the only journalism professor Boise State currently employs, is great. He teaches several journalism classes and is working tirelessly to improve the options for journalism students.

The student media program really fills in the gaps as well. It offers a chance for so much real world experience. Over all, I do enjoy it. The people in the program are great but Boise State doesn't take it very seriously."
College Junior,2,Campus parking is a bit of a mess. There aren't really enough spots for everyone and permits are really expensive.
College Junior,2,"The amount of aid I received was not bad at all. However dealing with the financial aid office can be trying. I have never gotten my financial aid on time. I always have to pay my tuition on my own and be reimbursed for it later. Luckily I am able to do this but if I weren't it would be even more of a hassle.

The financial aid office ""randomly selects"" FAFSA applications to verify each year, meaning you have to fill out some extra paperwork. That's fine but out of a school of 22,000 people I have been ""randomly selected"" each of the three years I've been at Boise State. I really wouldn't mind but the way they do it is such a hassle. You go to the office, they give you a form, you fill it out, return it, wait for them to process it (2-6 weeks usually) and then they'll call you back and give you ANOTHER form to fill out and go through the same process. I've had to do this as many as five times for one year and it really delays you getting your aid. I wish they would just give you all the paperwork at once. It seems like an obvious solution to me."
College Freshman,2,Boise State is not diverse in ethnicities
College Sophomore,2,The school pays the police department to be extra strict on drinking students.
College Sophomore,2,"Its pretty boring, and the cops just love to give out MIC's "
College Freshman,2,"Cops break up most parties, hard to find sometimes"
College Freshman,2,Most everyone is white and conservative
College Freshman,2,"Unless you brought your own car, getting around Boise is impossible. The bus hardly ever runs and is dirty. There are plenty of taxis, but most of the drivers are pretty sketchy. "
College Freshman,2,"Since I want to be a writer, a degree from Boise State is probably the worst idea and no, I would never look to go here for that again. "
Alum,1,I attended Boise State for one year before transferring to Northwest Nazarene University. In that year I experienced many bad things at BSU that were terrible and realized that once I transferred to NNU. Boise State is overpriced. The parking is ridiculously expensive and you are not always guaranteed a spot in the parking garage you pay over $500 for. The class sizes are so large you cannot get any help. Administration and other offices are so hard to get ahold of and never reply to emails. My experience was terrible.
Alum,1,"(BSU housing is a JOKE cont.) In the end, the RD believed the RA because apparently the RAs can do nothing wrong and made me move out to another place. He said normally the person who makes the complaint is moved, but since she's the RA, we're making you move. So I called them out saying that the RAs get special treatment, and that's not fair. The RD defended himself saying it's not special treatment....um....that is a PERFECT demonstration of special treatment. I HIGHLY recommend living anywhere else other than in on-campus housing."
Alum,1,"BSU housing is a JOKE. I got stuck with a terrible roommate, who also happened to be the RA. She complained about everything everyday, claimed I never helped out around the suite when I was the one doing the dishes (even though they weren't even mine), taking out the trash, wiping down the toilet, etc. I got so sick of her complaints I ended up staying in my boyfriend's room most of the time. She STILL managed to find something to complain about with me. She even went so far as to talk to the RD (Evan Oglevie). They decided on a day and time to meet with me (at least twice), without even consulting with me first. I had to drop everything, leave tutoring early (tutoring for a class I was struggling in, I might add) just to attend those stupid meetings. That RA had the audacity to lie in front of the RD, saying I shoved her boyfriend even though I've never laid a hand on ANYBODY. So I naturally I called her out on her lies and her bs."
Freshman,1,I attended one year of school at Boise state university. I was a student athlete and had a terrible experience. If you are involved in any sport other than football or basketball you are going to be treated like dirt. Athletic director is a very dishonest person aswell as many other higher ups at the university.
Alum,1,"Boise State is a sorry excuse of a university. To piss on the face of a veteran and discriminate is absolutely atrocious. When you have a degree from these people and try to get a job and the companies you go to laugh in your face and say they will never hire someone from that university you know there is a problem. To steal money from your students to fund a stupid sports team after screwing over the other teams shows the lack of character BSU has, and to lose documents and lie about it until the time is up to do anything then admit it is absolutely pathetic. If you value your money and your time DO NOT ATTEND BSU"
Graduate Student,1,"I would 0/10 recommend going there for music school. It is terrible, there are so many other public colleges that provide a much better experience."
Senior,1,People's Republic of Boise. This a Communist state . Parents beware.  Students run for your lives.  Expelling students for Christian beliefs. Open Marxist professors.
Alum,1,"If you like being forced to do group projects with slackers, this is the place for you. Professors have too many students--don't expect individual attention. New buildings and expensive administrators do not make a great university. Everything from admissions to curriculum to class scheduling is designed to make the university money. I would rather take classes in a basement with smart people who care. If you want to learn, go somewhere else."
Junior,1,The campus is so dead. It is not a fun place. I wish there is more things that you can do around campus. Food are so expensive.
College Junior,1,"Greek life on campus is terrible, mostly because it glorifies drinking, encourages drug use, and all the volunteer work in the world isn't going to cancel out the bad karma most members have coming their way from their gossiping and ruination of other people's secrets and lives. Pretty much every person I have met who is a part of a sorority or fraternity can't keep their mouths shut to save their lives, so telling one something even remotely personal means you are telling the entire university as well."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not much of a scene. They try to be cool, but don't understand that they are a joke compared to other universities."
College Sophomore,1,I am tired of hearing about the greek life.
College Freshman,1,I have food allergies and it is very hard to eat
College Sophomore,1,"DONT COME HERE TO PARTY! This is not the school for you. Parties are often shut down and police don't mind writing 100 Minor in consumption tickets. These are Misdemeanors and will go on your record.  Literally no way to avoid them other than not drinking. BPD will pull you over for walking, riding with a sober driver, and bust a party. They live to give kids these. Totally ruined my experience here."
College Sophomore,1,"I was an honor student in high school, and I really did a lot of extracurricular activities and I didn't get any scholarships or financial aid, and I still don't. This school is a joke in a lot of ways, and this in particular is one of the biggest reasons, along with the cost of tuition."
College Sophomore,1,Downtown closes way too soon and nothing is ever open past 10 and its sucks.
College Sophomore,1,Parking should be cheaper and more parking meters. The tickets are way too much and half the time they leave a ticket before the time expires.
College Junior,1,Too strict on partying. This is college it's supposed to be fun!
College Senior,1,They have such a weak selection of history classes available. I wanted to do Asian studies but it is nearly impossible with the classes to chose from.
College Senior,1,I never hear anything about it.
College Junior,1,Can't get one unless I'm a graduate student.  Does me no good for my first four years when I could use the money and work experience.
College Sophomore,1,I barely even see the greek life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Parking passes are too expensive. The general lots are too far from classes and if you park somewhere else they will definitely ticket you.
College Freshman,1,More concerned punishment than safety of students
College Freshman,1,"The people here are terribly average, ignorant, and cliquey. If you don't dress like them, listen to the same music as them, and talk like them, there is no way they will ever accept you. They'll just whisper when you walk by or after you've left the room (especially in the dorms). The professors are nice overall, but that doesn't make up for how terrible everyone else is and how insultingly easy the classes are. Coming to BSU was one of the worst decisions I've ever made. "
College Student,1,"I did not receive any financial aid this term and even when I submitted a special income request form, I was still not awarded any money. They didn't help me apply for scholarships, even when I asked so I did the research myself. I am not able to take a class next term because I have no money to pay for it myself with no help from Boise State. This school made me feel like they didn't care about my education because I don't have the money to pay for a class. They need to work on this for sure! "
College Student,1,"Parking permits are very expensive, and students are still not guaranteed a spot.  Reserved parking can be purchased at an even higher price.  If you don't have a permit, don't even think about driving to class.  The school is downtown and there is nowhere to park without being ticketed or towed.  Also, the parking police her are EXTREMELY RUDE.  They have absolutely no mercy, and they ticket bikes with just as much hostility."
College Sophomore,1,"Its horrible to say the least, and way overpriced. I would reccomend not even bringing a car to campus, go green and get a bike. You will keep away the freshman 15 and also save a ton of dough. If you don't have classes that start at 6 am, you wont find a spot, seriously."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus can be a major issue! if you do not purchase a parking pass which will run you 300+ you had better to campus 30 minutes early just to find a spot so you don't walk a mile
College Junior,1,"The BPD is crazy strict on underage drinking, everyone I know has gotten an MIC. It is rather out of hand so I recommend being smart and avoiding large parties because they will get busted."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Horrible. Sporting events, concerts and other activities will take priority of student parking even during school days. The passes increase in price every year and they aren't adding new parking. They've been slowly eliminating it in an attempt to force everyone to live on campus."
College Senior,1,Parking on campus is a nightmare and there are never any available spots.  The cost of a parking is outrageous and is never guaranteed.  You might be able to find a spot if you leave at least an hour before your class starts.
College Junior,1,"Boise's population is mostly Caucasian, followed by Hispanics. As an African-American I have been acutely aware of these demographics. However, for the most part, Boise is accepting of all cultures. Campus especially is very open and you will find a much more diverse population there than in the city. There are a lot of Arabic and Asian students as well as some African-American students."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is nearly always difficult for every individual. The permits seem to be very expensive considering that general parking permits are not guaranteed. There were plenty of times that I drove to school and searched for a parking spot for two hours despite having a permit. In addition, there is zero free parking unless you want to walk from Julia Davis Park across a busy street. Students have to anticipate arriving to school very early if they expect to make it to class on time. In addition, even permits for the Brady Garage while living in the suites is a rip-off considering we pay 300 dollars and are forced to park on the fourth floor even when there are plenty of parking spots available on lower floors."
College Freshman,1,Parking is expensive and an obtrusive process that boise state seriously needs to work on.
Recent Alumnus,1,Pack your lunch or eat downtown. You are very close to non campus food sources. The food on campus is over priced and not that great.
College Junior,1,"The parking situation at BSU is awful. The parking permits are ridiculously expensive. I could only afford the general parking which is a pretty long walk to my classes, which I didn't mind except for in the winter when I had to walk back to my car in the dark. They allow general parking to park closer after 4:30, but I had classes from 10 am to 6 pm and 9 pm. The one day I tried to move my car to the closer lot at 3:00 I got a 15 dollar ticket. As a girl, it bothers me that because of the parking situation I can get stuck walking on the dark green belt back to my car after class."
College Student,1,The permits are very expensive for the garages and they are all very far from classes. If you don't get a permit you probably won't find a space.
College Freshman,1,"Public transit in Boise is basically non-existent.  There are taxis, but that is expensive unless you live near downtown.  In which case it would be cheaper still to invest in a bicycle.  There are some cool bars downtown.  I would suggest the Cactus, the Nuerolux, Mulligans and the Red Room.  I no longer drink or 'party' so I usually stay at home at night."
College Freshman,1,"Parking permits for the garage are expensive, and students aren't guaranteed a spot even with a permit. There are about 8,000 parking spots for a school with 20,000 students. On days with special events (athletic games, entertainment events) parking is nearly impossible."
College Senior,1,"Parking at BSU's campus is sub-par to say the least.  You need to get to campus early (before 8) to get a close spot to most classes.  The parking permits are expensive.  The cheapest is $150/semester and is located no where near classes.  You might as well park across the street and get free parking!  The garages are $300/semester but are right in the center of campus and close to most campus buildings, beware however, that price is per parking garage, it doesn't gain you access to both garages!"
College Freshman,1,"Parking in a pain. The permits are really expensive and the major parking lots are really far away from the rest of the campus. The tickets they give out are also expensive. The only positive is that there is a lot of paring spots, it just depends on how far you want to walk."
College Freshman,1,I was promised more money than I actually received.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid has been a rough process for me. Forms got lost. Extra information was requested. I turned in the requested forms but then it wasn't initiated in time for the deadline. I suggest getting help from a school admin.
College Freshman,1,"As if college and everything that goes long with it isn't expensive enough, they tax any parking within a mile of the school. It's pretty ridiculous. I wish they would work on making parking at or near schoo; more affordable."
College Senior,1,"There is little to no public transportation in the Boise area. Most people have a car and those that don't limit their travel or hitch a ride with someone who does. If you live on or near campus, a bike or your feet are sufficient, but otherwise you'll need a motorized vehicle of some sort."
College Junior,1,"I don't think there's even a ""nightlife"" at Boise State. Downtown is about a mile away, max, and to and from campus it's a fairly decent cab fare (between $7-10, with tax and tip). As far as house parties go, BSU is a very nontraditional campus, meaning that a good chunk of students are those who are around their 30's, have families, and whatnot -- so there aren't many house parties, unless you're friends with people who do throw them."
College Sophomore,1,"There is always room for growth in any place or field that a person is studying.  I see it as a difficulty to complete with other students to get into my required core classes, such as biology for human anatomy/physiology and basic chemistry courses.  I am not only competing with students in my same field of study but with all the other health professionals such as nurses which is so competitive at my school.  We have an amazing professor that does great test skills on the academia but it is difficult to find a place in that class, I have been waiting to take that class for a year now and am hoping to get into the course soon, since I am in my fourth year of school and can't continue my education without the course.  I am extremely happy though with the professors within my degree program all have been so helpful and great individuals to learn from.  I would say it has been frustrating at times but the education is great.  I have big plans for my future career goals.  I always want to help other individuals in promoting health and am currently working on a study with obesity pertaining to children in the united states and I want to help promote those exercise and health goals across communities.  I eventually would love to be a part of the physical therapy occupation but school for graduates is very expensive and it will take a lot of time to work to get the money to pay for graduate school especially since loans pay for my education already and I want to pay them off as soon as possible.  I do have some concerns with finding a job in my health field just because it is becoming more popular of a degree choice and very competitive for graduate school.  I know I have the motivation and skills required to find the best job I can and help the people I can the best way I know how.  I just am looking for others support in my school finances so that I am able to continue to help the individuals in my community!"
College Student,1,"The general parking lot used to be on campus, now it's across the street.  It's really hard for those who have general to even find anywhere to park.  It's just better to get a permit for the garage or reserved.  Though, even reserved have a hard time finding a parking spot.  You either park at one end or the other; and it's always better to park on the side you actually have classes."
College Student,1,"Freakishly Overpriced – There are loads of off-campus housing around Boise State; however, the nearest ones are always so overpriced, it's ridiculously.  As a college student, it's very difficult to pay 400-500 dollars a month.  The only option is to find a place about 15-30 minutes away from campus and room with other people.  The drive isn't that bad either because Boise State is next to the connector, so getting home doesn't take too long."
College Freshman,1,the school tends to over sell the parking passes. they are expensive and do not grantee you a spot. the area the school is built in is surrounded by residential area and parking in front of somebody's house can get you towed. most available parking spot are on the opposite side of campus then the classes. it is easier to park in the parking garage but if you spend money on a pass you will still have to pay every time you park in the garage or risk getting a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,"No One Wants to Be Greek – there is a Greek system at Boise state, but it is not appealing to the vast majority of students. The system does not provide any benefits that make it more desirable than the dorms or off campus living."
College Freshman,1,"Boise Is Tough on Crime – Boise police are pretty alert and always circling the neighborhoods around BSU. They are strict on giving out MIC (minor in consumption)tickets, so be careful if your going to party! You'll definitely get caught if the party gets to loud!"
College Freshman,1,"Parking at Boise State is chaotic for one, and expensive for two.  Parking permits are about $300 for a year, and they are all the way across campus, meaning, you have to walk about 10 minutes to get to your car to go anywhere.  The rest of the parking usually is taken up by mid-day, and most of it requires a general parking pass.  All the other slots are minimal and require you to pay for a specific allotted time."
College Freshman,1,"The student section for football games at Boise State is completely ridiculous. Although the price of the ticket is included with our tuition, I would rather watch the game on TV."
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife consists of house parties that are pretty secluded. There is an all ages night club called Bogies, but no one goes to that because it is pretty trashy."
College Senior,1,The parking at Boise State is one of the worst things about it. There is NEVER anywhere to park. Ever.
College Freshman,1,"Super Harsh Punishments – For even having an empty beer can in your room, you can get suspended from school. If you show up high on campus and are noticed by the campus security, you can get suspended or banned from campus. Undercover cops on longboards patrol the campus at night to see if anyone walks home drunk, then breathalyzes them on the spot and gives them an MIC. It's a joke."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs and Drinking Are Very Popular – Overall, it is completely obvious that there is a drug and alcohol issue on campus. There have been over 4 citations for drugs in my residence hall already (3 months). Almost everyone drinks and smokes weed and there is a pretty heavy party scene among people who live on campus and who are involved in Greek life. Although not everyone participates in such activities, most do. The policies are somewhat enforced. A lot of people get Minor in Consumption's from the local police, but as far as RA's go most are pretty relaxed about it from what I have heard."
College Senior,1,"Drugs Are Rampant – Living in the dorms on campus, I was exposed to a lot of drugs and alcohol that I never say in high school. There aren't many precautions taken to prevent drug or alcohol abuse. There are obvious group of people who are involved and smoking/selling weed."

Senior,5,This was such a great school I loved the faculty they did an amazing job with my whole experience there from start to finish.
Senior,5,I took most of my classes online and it was so easy to use and made my life so much easier and allowed me to complete my bachelor's degree.
Alum,5,Best 4 years of my life! Loved my experience there. Although they definitely favor athletes and do not treat all fairly I found my people and stuck to them. The classes tho were definitely not challenging and I did not enjoy much of my education. I loved the social aspect though and all the opportunities presented!
Freshman,5,Misericordia University is a great school with lots of opportunities to get involved. The student/faculty ratio is excellent and the professors are always willing to help you.
Freshman,5,Misericordia is a great school with professors who take the time to get to know you. at this school you are not just a number.
Graduate Student,5,It's a rather small campus that is bustling with life. The campus itself is beautiful. The professors and students are amazing. The food is okay. The Dallas area is beautiful and there's tons of places to go shop and eat. I love it here!
Sophomore,5,"As a Speech-Language Pathology major, the program is amazing and will prepare me extremely well for my professional career! The staff are educated and kind, and will help any student with any trouble they’re having. Campus has such a great community and positive feeling as well. Roll cougs!"
Senior,5,"I liked Misericordia, because it is a safe campus focused on the academics. Misericordia is a great school to go to if you are interested in the health sciences field. The school is welcoming and makes students feel at home. I would like to see there be more things to do on campus to get students involved in the resident life as many of the students are commuters or leave on the weekends. I would like to see an improvement in food options available daily. The dorms are comfortable and living on campus is very nice. It is nice to see the community around Misericordia often visiting, walking their dogs, and joining in on activities on campus. The small class sizes are nice and many teachers will know you by name and invest a lot into your education and future. The individualized attention and one on one time with professors is unmatched and valuable. It is fun to attend sporting events on campus, many students and faculty will come out to cheer on the teams and spend time together."
Freshman,5,"I feel as Misericordia from my short time there , is very diverse , very different from other schools i have visited. Overall people and others ive met have been very nice and welcoming"
Graduate Student,5,"I love the people I have met at Misericordia, both the students and professors. Everyone is kind and will always hold a door open for you! The classrooms are small and professors know your name, which is exactly what I was looking for when I was searching to find a college. I'm in a 5 and 1/2 year health science Master's degree program and I love the way it is set up. The professors are involved in the classroom, research, and they are clinical supervisors for the student clinicians at our on-site clinic. I know that Misericordia is preparing me well for my future because of the diverse clinical experience I am getting and because of what alumnae have reported back after graduating!"
Freshman,5,I am a freshman on the football team studying Mass Communications. I recently finished my first semester with a 3.6 GPA and made a lot of new friends. The classes i took were engaging and fun. All of my coaches and teachers pushed us to do our best.
Senior,5,Misericordia University is such a warm welcoming atmosphere for all students and provides and equal and well rounded learning experience.
Niche User,5,I loved Misericordia University because of the prominence of  faith based learning approach they offer.
Niche User,5,"I really like the online program they have set up. Easy to use, and the instructors are helpful along the way."
Senior,5,Misericordia has great staff that are extremely accommodating. The Hybrid programs help adult learners tremendously!
Niche User,5,"Misericordia  University truly cares about their students. When visiting, the President of the campus made an appearance at every event. He even invited the tour group into his office. All of the sport coaches made an appearance and talked to every student interested in their sport. Everyone at the campus were very friendly. Everyone was smiling and it was obvious that they wanted the very best for everyone visiting. One of the  staff even asked if we wanted a ride to our car after talking to her for over an hour. Every bit Misericordia was amazing and I recommend everyone to visit there."
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at Misericordia University and after four years, it has become my home away from home. The small campus stimulates a family atmosphere and close knit community. All of the professors are approachable and they truly care about helping you succeed. I have made friends at Misericordia that I now call family. I will always cherish the time I spent in college learning and growing at Misericordia University."
Graduate Student,5,"From the first time on campus, on my individual tour, I was welcomed with open arms by the students, faculty, and staff at Misericordia. Everyone made me feel welcomed on to the campus and like a part of the family, even during my first visit. The teachers all create an environment that encourages all students to share their ideas and ask any questions that they may have. The school also offers different activities throughout the semester to allow students to participate in something fun, and allowing them to make new friends at the same time. Overall, the biggest thing, besides my degrees, that I will take away from Misericordia when I graduate is the relationships that I have built here since freshmen year."
Graduate Student,5,"Misericordia University is home.  Throughout my 4 years attending Misericordia, I have nothing but positive remarks.  From the friendly atmosphere to the incredible education, Misericordia has taught me how to be successful and independent.  The professors at Misericordia are both supportive and encouraging as they instill the belief in every student that they can accomplish whatever brings them happiness.  The small class sizes promote relationships with professors as well as fellow classmates.  Through being an RA as well as an active member of various clubs and organizations, I have been blessed to meet many different friends as well as serve the community."
Sophomore,5,Misericordia is great for the non-traditional student. It officers a lot of courses and degree options online.  The campus is very large and has something to offer anyone looking to go back to school. The advisors and instructors are always will to help the student in any way they can. I have been at MIS for 2 years now and don’t have a single bad thing to stay about it!
Freshman,5,"I love the small campus size as well as the small class sizes. I have not had a single class with more than 30 students, and it allows the professors to get to know each student's progress and individualize lessons for the students."
Junior,5,The best thing about Misericordia University is that you can make it feel like home very easily. The faculty and professors here are the best and they all want the students to succeed. The students are very nice and it is easy to find people to make friends with in and outside of your specific major. Athletics here are at a different level and really inspire the athletes to want to be better at their sport while also enforcing the philosophy that a hard work ethic will get you to where you want to be whether on the court or in the classrooms.
Niche User,5,Misericordia has a beautiful campus. The grounds are beautifully kept and well maintained. The staff is excellent and very knowledgeable in their respective fields. The professors are well educated and helpful to all students. The food is also very good and there is a chik-fil-a on campus. the dorms are gorgeous and spacious as well as well layed out. The school also has stellar athletics and a football team that is second to none
Sophomore,5,"I love Misericordia. It is a comfortable and friendly university. The professors/advisors are willing to go the extra mile always for a successful academic experience. It also is a safe campus with security always. I believe that is very important especially to not only feel comfortable, but with the way the world is now. Misericordia University is a wonderful university and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small, comfortable college."
Sophomore,5,Excellent community environment backed by excellent education. In the past year I have learned so much about my major and life in general because of this amazing school.
Sophomore,5,Misericordia University is a beautiful campus with professors who truly care about their students. It has small class sizes and it feels like home.
Sophomore,5,Misericordia is a small private college. The campus is a small contained campus. Class sizes are small and the campus community is close knit. All the professors are extremely helpful and are willing to go the extra mile for their students.
Niche User,5,"I have visited misericordia many times, and every time I am pleasantly surprised with the extremely nice people I find and meet. I always have the best time. Everything is overall great. There is not much to do around though. But Wilkes Barre is close by."
Senior,5,Overall Misericordia is a wonderful university. The students are nice and friendly. The professors actually care about your future. They are always available for office hours. The class sizes are small so you get to form a relationship with your teachers.
Junior,5,"I am getting an excellent education. I am an Occupational Therapy major, and i have learned a lot about the field. I also get my masters degree in five years rather than six years. Another benefit is the fact that i do not have to apply at graduate schools. Misercordia University is the school to go to if you are interested in Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, or Speech."
Junior,5,Misericordia University is a great campus that provides students with numerous opportunities. There is friendly and helpful faculty and staff everywhere you look.
Niche User,5,Great experience at this school. Welcomed me in with open arms and worked with me every step of the way. This university is small and very family oriented. They treat you like their son or daughter and always make sure you're on track. No changes needed.
Freshman,5,"I love the faculty, the small campus feel, being on a sports team but still seeing the importance of academics to all the coaches and administration."
Junior,5,Everyone is very nice and will always hold the door open for you even if your half way across campus.
Niche User,5,The school was absolutely gorgeous. The campus was very clean. The staff answered all my questions and more.
College Junior,5,I feel extremely safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are very nice and always kept clean. Cleanliness is a guideline that all of the RD's and RA's push to students especially the incoming freshman.The social atmosphere is very friendly, you can make many new friends each and every day."
College Sophomore,5,"I had the tremendous opportunity in being a part of the Men's Basketball team. I grew into being more team oriented and gained the trust as a leader on my team from my coaches. All of our home games are packed and our school loves to come and support every team, not just basketball."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall my experience is great at Misericordia University. One of my favorite experiences is Midnight Breakfast. The day before finals week starts, the school has a free breakfast at midnight to appreciate all the hard work the students put in. I would choose this school again because the professors and students are great people to be around and always helpful when needed."
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about my school. The professors are more like friends to the students, which I think is great it makes easier for the students to go to them. My friends are amazing."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,So far I love my school. I'm finding it was the right school to pick. Everyone is so helpful and it is so easy to gain great friendships.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel that we have one of then safest campus' around.  If you ever feel unsafe you can call campus safety and have them walk you to wherever you need to go, however I feel that this is not really needed. We have a very small/ compact campus and it feels very secure."
College Sophomore,5,I love Misericordia. I am in one of the countries top SLP Programs.  Everyone on campus is friendly.  Small class sixes allow for lots of student-proffessor contact and I have yet to meet a professor who is not willing to help you.
College Freshman,5,"There are a variety of ways that Misericordia helps students. The Guaranteed Placement Program offers workshops every semester and completing these workshops guarantees that they will help you find a payed internship after graduation if you struggle finding a job. The workshops are helpful and include resume writing, interview techniques, and other necessary skills.  Many programs have built in time for internships in which the school helps you find placements around the area.  They are a necessary part of some programs and very helpful."
College Freshman,5,"Every professor, part-time, adjunct, or full-time is extremely caring. My core classes and classes for my major are taught well and all professors encourage students to come to office hours and truly make an effort to get to know you."
College Freshman,5,Lots of sports to become involved in
College Sophomore,5,"Misericordia offers several job fairs and networking expos for students. Along with the Guaranteed Placement Program, and the University's reputation in the Health Sciences field, career prospects are promising. The school could benefit from having more recruiters, both military and civilian workforce, visit."
College Freshman,5,An OT degree from here is highly value because it's such a good program
College Freshman,5,So many houses within walking distance of the school. School posts/emails local realestate
College Freshman,5,There are so many dining options and delivery options that are convient and have a great variety.
College Freshman,5,Great classes & great teachers!
College Freshman,5,"The people here take this very seriously, and will not allow any harm to happen to their students."
College Student,5,Even when I owed money I got help and the school helped pay for the remainder of what I owed.
College Senior,5,Conference Champions usually every season
College Junior,5,I love my program of study here at the school. I really enjoy the nursing program and many of my close friends are also nursing majors. The curriculum is difficult however they want you to be prepared for when you graduate.
College Student,5,"I feel more safe on campus, then in my own home. The nurse is always there to help when ive needed. The ra's and rd  

are nice and always compasionate towards everyone in the building but also know how to lay down the law."
College Freshman,5,"Though it is a strict program, every instructor in the Speech-Language pathology department that I have had thus far has positively changed my life. They are very knowledgeable and sincerely amazing and intelligent people. The program offers many amazing opportunities to students and is very informative in every aspect of what we will need to become SLPs. I am very thankful for the program and the instructors. "
College Freshman,5,"I always speak very highly about the academics at Misericordia University. The professors that I have had are very knowledgeable and take great interest in students' learning and interest. They are always willing to spend extra time if one needs help as well. There are many free tutors for any subject, which is extremely helpful and who I am very grateful for. "
College Freshman,5,"I resided in a dorm building for a year and a half at Misericordia University and cannot remember one time that I did not feel extremely safe. The staff is very helpful and personable and addresses any concerns immediately. Not only are they addressed, but are followed up on as well. There is very little campus crime, but what does occur is immediately addressed and resolved. "
Alum,4,"Took some online classes and enjoyed my experience. Was not challenged, but they were easy and the teachers were very nice."
Graduate Student,4,"My online learning experience in my undergraduate years sucked. There weren't many professors that recorded lectures for me to listen to and I basically had to teach myself. For graduate school though, my professors are recording lectures and having live online classes which is really beneficial and has helped me so much more than the ones I took during my undergraduate years."
Sophomore,4,"As something that had to be set up last minute and unexpected, I think Misericordia handled it as best as they could! Although it was not the same as normal, every professor tried their best."
Junior,4,Choosing to go to Misericordia was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I would have never met the friends I have made there and I wouldn't have met my lovely girlfriend either. The worst part about Misericordia is the cafeteria food. IT IS TERRIBLE. The food is absolute garbage and is severely overpriced. I wish they would bring in another company so the students wouldn't have to suffer.
Freshman,4,"Everyone is so nice here and it’s such a welcoming and diverse environment. The campus is small, which isn’t for everyone, but it is for me. The campus is also beautiful and so are the buildings. Professors here seem like they actually care and try to help in every way possible. The only complaint I have would be about the food, it’s not the greatest and I can see why the freshman 15 is a thing."
Sophomore,4,"Misericordia University is an outstanding health science school well as Division III athletic university. With a small sized campus, it is very easy to make friends and get  involved! The life outside of campus is not very exciting, it's a very residential area. Student engagement hosts events to keep people entertained and involved. There are numerous other clubs and activities to keep students involved. Game nights and weekends are the highlight of many peoples college experience, whether an athlete or spectator. And there is not enough to say about the professors. With small class sizes, you receive much more individual attention than other universities. Misericordia University strives for greatness."
Senior,4,Very nice campus. Classes were in 4 main buildings but were scattered which made it difficult at times. Facility are very willing to help. The classes were small which enhanced learning
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors are great and want you to succeed. Campus is beautiful, students are very nice and polite."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently attending misericordia and overall, I love my school. I'm on the women's lacrosse team and love being part of a team. However, the food is not good and things tend to be very expensive."
Sophomore,4,I love my college experience so much better than my high school one. The professors are kind and very approachable while the environment all around is very friendly and positive with some drama but not much. I am only in my sophomore year but am looking forward to continuing improving and growing as an individual here. The only thing I do not like about the school is that there are not really convenient places to go to hang out or do something.
Senior,4,"The academic opportunities and the student-professor relationships at Misericordia University are excellent. The academic programs are reputable, and graduates are highly sought after by employers. Each student's needs are met with respect and understanding."
Sophomore,4,"Misericordia University is an amazing school to go to if you want to feel at home. It's a small university, but very active. You make friends quickly and everyone is very nice. If you're struggling, whether its with a class or more on the personal side, there are tutors and counselors to help. Misericordia tries their best to have everyone involved, they don't like to see anyone left out and it is rare to see that."
Sophomore,4,I chose Misericordia University for the stellar academics. I am very confident in both my program and the courses offered. One of the things I love about the school is how everyone there looks out for each other. If you have any problems the upper classman were more than willing to help and guide you. It is a close knit school where you feel welcome from the start.
Sophomore,4,Very safe. Nice community. Great student teacher ratio. Great scholarships. Beautiful campus. Some fantastic professors
Freshman,4,"Students and faculty are extremely nice, and caring. As an athlete and an occupational therapy major, I think the school was a pretty good fit for me. The downsides of the school include awful food and little social life. That said it is what you make of it.  The school is great for health science majors, and the campus is small and homey, you won't have to walk over 10 minutes to get anywhere"
Sophomore,4,I love the importance of learning. The Health science programs are amazing!! My teachers have been so helpful with the transition from high school to college.
Alum,4,The professors were attentive and cared about my education. Area lacked entertainment activities. Five year Occupational Therapy program was very valuable to me and important in advancing my career.
College Senior,4,"Our school is small, and everyone is accepting to everyone."
College Junior,4,Everyone seems to support all the teams.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is very friendly and welcoming,"
College Junior,4,"Fairly clean and what you would expect, usually the RA's aren't bad"
College Junior,4,"I live in a very secure environment and feel safe on & around campus. Campus is always visible to make me feel safe at all times. There is sufficient lighting around campus, and most students don't give me any reason to feel unsafe."
College Junior,4,"Many of my professors are great people. They are so knowledgeable in what they are teaching that they making learning the material easy. They are patient and offer alternate means to reinforce the material - study groups, for example."
College Junior,4,"I am a medical imaging student, and my school mandates they we do clinical hours at local hospitals to prepare us for life after graduation. We have guaranteed job placement courses that aid in resume preparation for our future."
College Junior,4,I have participated in cheerleading my first year and track & field the last 2 years...I find the facilities up-to-date.
College Freshman,4,Our campus prides itself in making sure their students are successful.
College Freshman,4,Our athletics are strong and are always inthe playoff. Most times are achieving the championships from them.
College Junior,4,"The programs are large and oftentimes do well in our MAC division. The facilities are great. The coaches are okay, sometimes inflexible. The scheduling for indoor practice can be inconvenient sometimes. Messages go out about home games/meets."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in Dorms is living in Dorms.  The Freshman dorms are very nice, there is a lot of closet space- especially in comparison to other schools.  Sophomores have a hard time getting the housing they want because of the lottery system going from Seniors down.  There are only two housing options on campus that give you a kitchen in your room which is one downside.  Gildea is the best rooming option as a sophomore if you can get it"
College Freshman,4,"Campus safety is very friendly, but serious. I feel very safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Its very convenient to live on campus, especially during winters when commuting in the snow is difficult. The dorms provide what is necessary, but they are expensive."
College Freshman,4,"Its a great, small community. Everyone is very friendly and professors and staff truly care about your well-being and education."
College Freshman,4,The buildings are all fairly nice. Overall they are what would be expected for a college dorm.
College Freshman,4,Personally do not part take in any athletics bit they facilities are very nice and well maintained.
College Freshman,4,"Misericordia is a great school that makes studetns feel as though they are not just taking courses for a future career, but that they are part of a family."
College Sophomore,4,People get really into the guys basketball games. Football is only entering it's fifth year of having a team so the team is not very good yet. Women's soccer and Baseball are the best teams on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I'm a sport management major and I love my professors in my major. They are experts in the field and have a lot of real world experience. They are also very helpful with internships.
College Sophomore,4,There is always campus safety on call and patrolling the campus. I feel very safe on this campus. No matter the time of day I do not feel afraid to walk anywhere on campus alone.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a guaranteed job placement program where you just attend one meeting a semester that helps students develop resumes and learn other needed skills and information on what they need to get internships and jobs. They also help students find internships and jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"If you want small class sizes where the professors are very personable and care about your success this place can be exactly what you're looking for. My largest class had maybe thirty people, and being an athlete the professors are very accommodating and are easy to meet with them during office hours."
College Freshman,4,Core classes are run well.
College Freshman,4,Lots of hard work in Occupational Therapy Courses
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy this school because everyone is friendly. The teachers are passionate about their job.
College Sophomore,4,"To the best of my knowledge, our campus is very safe.  I have not heard of any instances of sexual assault.  Few instances, if any, of theft. On more than one occasion, I (and many others) have left valuable electronics and personal belongings unattended. Not once has anything been stolen from me. Campus security is easily reached."
College Sophomore,4,"Both dorms and off campus housing options are decent.  If you do not like the dorms, there are various special interest housing and off campus housing, as well as on-campus apartments and suites to choose from.  The housing itself is decent, the only thing that can detract from the value are any loud/messy floor mates."
College Sophomore,4,"As a school with a 3:1 female:male ratio, the women's teams are typically more competitive.  There are exceptions however.  All around, Misericordia provides many sports, none of which are sub-par.  A member of the cross country/track teams, I have seen the continual growth on both the female and male side. Fan support leaves something to be desired, partly due to Misericordia's size.  What we lack in number, we more than make up for in quality. Facilities are great for student and athlete alike, however, the indoor track is not ideal for track athletes."
College Sophomore,4,"The transition to college is made easy at Misericordia. The faculty and staff are all welcoming and willing to help however possible.  Though a smaller college, I enjoy the close-knit atmosphere as it is more conducive to furthering ones' studies and making meaningful relationships. As a student who was originally in the Physician Assistant program (which is no more), I am eternally grateful for all the school did to help the displaced students like me find our way again.  Misericordia has become a second home, and everyone there I consider family.  No matter your personality or interests, it is amazing how such a small school can be so welcoming.  If you are looking for the opportunity to grow and mature, all while surrounded by a strong support system, Misericordia University is the place for you."
College Freshman,4,Professors are very accommodating and treat you as a person
College Freshman,4,"While expensive, I wouldn't trade it for any other school. It's the best school for my major and the people are great."
College Freshman,4,The campus and the surrounding town are very safe and i have not experienced any safety related issues.
College Sophomore,4,I like the school I'm attending. I got to meet my closest friends here and wouldn't want to go to another school based off of it. I like my University.
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience in college is excellent, during my orientation and days here they made me feel welcome and comfortable with my surroundings and people here. My school is unique from all the colleges because of our support systems, we genuinely care for the students around us and form tight bonds quick. If I had the opportunity to do this again my choice would always be Misericordia University"
College Student,4,"College was a huge adjustment, but my school worked hard to make it as easy and smooth as possible."
College Freshman,4,"Finding off-campus housing is basically up to the student, but the school does sometimes post listings to a bulletin board by the cafeteria and online. Most housing is at least fifteen minutes away. Landlords are most of the time lenient and willing to work with students, but prices remain pretty high. I looked at off campus housing and it was in a great location close to a good number of places to eat. The landlord put safety first and had outside security lights and cameras put up."
College Freshman,4,Misericordia is right off of the memorial highway which is basically a strip of restaurants and fast-food. If you drive a little further down the road into Wilkes-Barre it is full of restaurants and shopping! I personally always want to eat off campus because of the on campus food.
College Freshman,4,Parties off campus are usually very fun. There are lots of people that attend. The downside is finding a designated driver and supplying your own beverages. Parties sometimes get noisy and the police come which is very bad so you have to choose where you go wisely.
College Freshman,4,Campus safety is not about getting students in trouble. It is very easy to have visitors on campus. If students get in trouble for underage drinking they try to get them help instead of in trouble with the law. The only thing campus safety is annoying about is parking. There is very little parking on campus and they have many parking restrictions and are very quick to fine.
College Freshman,4,"Campus security will leave yo ualone as long as you aren;t endangering yourelf or others. They are a little more serious about drugs than they are alcohol, but they won't search your room unless youre obnoxious"
College Freshman,4,"Most off the ""parties"" are low key groups of friends just drinking together, but if you are looking to go out there are usually three of four parties a weekend."
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty reasonable, except transfer students have very limited chances"
Alum,2,"Misericordia University was great for providing the academic and financial support for my needs, but it was stereotypical for majors and jobs on campus. This school focuses mostly on the arts and sciences and not so much on the business school where it needs the most improvement.  Students were not so great to talk to because they made me feel intimated. Whenever you go for a job or activity in the Student Success Center, you feel rejected because they seem to be looking for a particular student. This school can often play favors for students that are active with activities and functions. I was never guaranteed a job placement after graduation because the career development center does not have a counselor that focuses on the computer field jobs and internships in the local area and further areas. It feels like whenever you connect for support, it seems like no one cares about what happens to you rather than they care about themselves."
Freshman,2,"My freshmen year of college was at Misericordia University. The university is held to such high standards, but led me to great disappointment. The professors that I had were not great and seemed to try and belittle you. They were also not helpful during class time. Although, there was one great professor I had at Misericordia and I'll forever be grateful for him. The school is also way to expensive for what is given to students. The food quality is poor, the professors are poor, and the financial help is poor."
Sophomore,2,"The professors are great and always looking to help (especially occupational therapy professors). Campus is pretty but the weather is terrible so it makes everything miserable. Freshman cannot have cars on campus, but many of them bring them anyway, which makes our bad parking even worse. If you are looking for school where parties are good and frequent, Mis should be past on your list. Most weekends there aren't parties, sometimes Saturday nights, but police are always on the prowl. Most people here are either here for sports or health programs, and if they aren't it's probably because they didn't get into their top choice schools and are just settling- I don't think anyone actually enjoys it here. The food is so bad, the dining hall has a four week rotation of bad stuff, so everything is so repetitive and it gets gross really quickly, but they are good with people with different diets (vegan, dairy/gluten free, etc)."
College Senior,2,The campus is small so no where to hide underage drinking until you can live off-campus
College Student,2,"For the cost of tuition, food, and room and board, this school leaves much to be desire in terms of quality. Though there are gems in each department, professors in the Business and Science departments tend to be stereotypical in their dry, long-winded and boring teaching styles. The Science department, especially regarding Lab classes, are difficult for the sake of being difficult and some professors are proud of the superfluous challenges they pose. The Humanities departments have excellent staff members that engage students to excel in each class, especially the English and Philosophy departments. The rooms are mediocre for the costs ranging from $600 to $1200 per semester and I have been in 5+ person rooms in each my two years here. The food, provided by Metz, is tough to get used to. For about a month, your body will most likely reject it and cause one to replace their drinks for Pepto Bismol every meal. It also does not taste very good, and the meals during the week are reheated on the weekends. The student body is a boring one: not many parties that don't get busted after a few hours, boring student activities, and strange niche events for certain departments. I would rate this school 4/10 for high price, poor departments, boring student life, and bad food."
College Freshman,2,"Not many teachers in my major seemed qualified or interested in their job, I believe this was because i was not in any sort of therapy major which is the most important major this school has to offer."
College Student,2,The elevator works randomly same with all of the areas you can swipe into the build as well as locks on the doors
College Junior,2,A lot of the houses and apartments are very highly priced and not affordable by many of college students.
College Freshman,2,From what I have seen it is below par
College Freshman,2,We need to develop more programs soon
College Freshman,2,"I commute to school, so I do not have to worry about long distance travel. With that said, the college only has one realistic way of getting there. Since there is only one way to get to the college, the route gets backed up at the beginning and end of breaks and semesters. Transportation from lower campus to upper campus is decent though. There is a shuttle that runs at convenient times and is rarely late."
College Student,2,We are not really diverse.
College Student,2,"The health center is useless.  My friend had stomach pains they said they couldn't do anything but she could go to a clinic.  when she told them she had no way of getting there, they offered to call an ambulance.  Needless to say we called the ambulance the next night because she had appendicitis "
College Student,2,"They are a lot of snobby people here because mommy and daddy are always there with there credit cards to get them anything they want.  if you brush it off you will be fine, when they decide to go out on the weekend just stay in a watch a movie or go to the gym.  thats what i did."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do around here
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do around here, unless you live closer to the city and commute to campus."
College Freshman,2,The school gives out financial aid but they are very annoying to deal with. You can never have questions answered and they often do not return calls.
College Sophomore,2,Theres never anywhere to park
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is crazy, you can wake up one morning and it will be 30 degrees and cold, and when you get out of class its 60 and sunny. It always seems to be raining"
College Freshman,2,I have not been challenged at all by the academics. I did more challenging course work in high school classes.
College Sophomore,2,Parking is a growing issue at Misericordia. A student may have to drive around for quite a while to find a parking spot. It is definitely an issue that should be approved upon.
College Junior,2,"Theres a shuttle, but good luck getting to class on time!"
College Junior,2,"You get spring and fall, but a lot of winter. The higher altitude makes it really bad compared to the rest of the area (the valley). You'll get snow when other places dont see a thing.. oh and the wind!"
College Student,2,"The amount rules that Misericordia has established for underage drinking are extensive. Their main goal is to keep everyone safe and they do a good job. People do get away with drinking but when they do get caught there are serious consequences like community service and fine that can cost hundreds of dollars. My advice is to not drink and if you chose to, do it discreetly so you won't get caught. They are also really strict about grades and keep on top of you to do well. So study hard and try your best."
College Freshman,2,Parking isn't very great. It fills up quickly during the week. Weekends isn't bad though because most people go home for the weekend.
College Senior,2,Must Arive Early – There is very limited parking on campus at all times. Many spots are taken early so you have no choice but drive arround in circles or come to campus early. There are no cars for freshman living on campus so that cuts down on volume. Still there are many commuters that need a place to park at all times. Tickets are given out fairy routinely. For a small campus with a growing population there needs to be a better system.
College Sophomore,2,"Sholarships Are Few and Far Between – Wiht a high GPA in high school you can get some financial aid. The opportunities to recieve this aid are limited unless you play sports. A minimum GPA of a 3.0 is required to keep those scholarships and as with everything else, tuition is going up while the scholarships are not. Searching elsewhere for scholarships is a necessity, but every little bit helps."
College Sophomore,2,"On my campus diversity is prized. There is a diversity club, there are clubs for disability awareness and acceptance. There are ga acceptance clubs. My school is big on making everyone feel welcome and I think they do a very good job of that. Certainly a much better job than some of my friend's schools. However, even thoughdiversity is praised, my school is still mostly white when it comes to ethnicity and mostly Christians since it is a Catholic founded school."
College Freshman,2,"They Are Strict – The campus is very small, so people are always being watched. It makes it hard to enjoy college life and the freedom that comes with it."
College Junior,2,"Apartments Are Hard to Come by – The area around campus is really nice, but off-campus housing is hard to come by. If you do find a place, chances are it's going to come at a high price and expect a drive of at least five minutes to get to campus. There are some nice places in nearby Harvey's Lake if you're willing to drive ten-fifteen miutes to get to campus. Overall, it's a pretty safe area to live and neighbors are friendly. However, parking is hard to come by, so expect to park off-street."
College Freshman,2,Crowded and Broken – Most of our labs get very crowded because they are too small. Also half of the time you can not use them to print on the campus printers because they are broken. Using the labs is stressful to say the least!
College Junior,2,Misericordia is currently under construction and there is not enough parking for the students at the current time. However they do plan on making more parking for students by the fall semester of 2012.
College Junior,2,There is not that much to do unless you are 21 and over. if you are younger you could go to the club and house parties but that is the most fun or random nights with all of your friends which is always a good time!
College Freshman,2,"isnt all too great – When you are a freshman you have to rely on the shuttle since we aren't allowed to have cars. Its awful because sometimes you have to wait up to an hour to get any where. Also not many things are in walking distance, except a restraunt and CVS. Anything else is probably about a 20 minute walk or so."
College Sophomore,2,The sports teams aren't really viewed as important at Misericordia and there isn't much school spirit or student support. The new football team might change things though.
College Junior,2,"Lots of White Female Students – Since Misericordia was an all Female school for a while, there is still a large number of female students and not so many males. Most of the students are white, but there are some students of other backgrounds."
College Sophomore,2,"Fairly Strict – The policy in the dining hall affecting the amount of double swipes per semester is very strict. We have already paid for the food so we should be able to spend it how we like. The Desk Assistant is a stupid addition to the school. We are all adults and we know who we can and can not trust. We are living away from home and the dorm environment is supposed to be an introduction to being on our own, however filling out a permission slip to have friends or loved ones over is stupid."
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't all that much diversity on campus. The school has many a few different religions, different sexual orientations, and backgrounds. Since the college is a private Catholic college there is not a wide variety of people on campus because the school is very selective as to who come to this school."
College Senior,2,"The parking permits went up $10 this semester. It isn't a bad cost to buy a permit for $35.00. It is better than getting a parking ticket for not having a pass, which is $10.00 every time you get caught. I feel that the parking situation at school isn't very good. We have way more students than parking spaces and it is very obvious to see. It is annoying since I live at the townhouses and there are 18 townhouses 6 people to each and not enough parking in that area for every one that lives down there. If you commute you need to arrive at school earlier in the morning to be ensured to get a spot and if not you will be driving around for a good 15-20 minutes sometimes to find one."
College Junior,2,Boring Town – Not much to do around the area. Have to drive at least fifteen minutes to find something to do.
Freshman,1,"This school is a scam. Lower than average academics, and the Chistian values they preach to incoming freshman are false. Yes, they’ll hold a door for you, but that’s it. They recruit very good student athletes out of HS with high SAT scores and GPA, make written GUARANTEES  of roster spots, then cut you. It leaves you with a choice - stick it out and lose the best 4 years of experience of your life, but keep your scholarship, or transfer and lose your scholarship. There is absolutely NOTHING to do outside of sports at this College. RUN, don’t walk, away from these scamsters. Even when I transferred, the attitudes I got from the administration was hard to fathom. RUN."
College Junior,1,"We don't have it, would be nice to have, but not even an option"
College Freshman,1,I would not know because I am a first semester freshman. from what i have heard it is lacking.
College Freshman,1,Freshman Dormitories in need of major remodeling. community bathrooms are very unclean.
College Freshman,1,I just finished my first semester and i was highly dissatisfied with my overall college experience at this school. It is far too small and the surrounding area is desolate and lacking in things to do. This school is a good fit for medical majors who plan to invest most to al time in college to their major. Not a very fun school otherwise and does not feel like a real college experience.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Junior,1,Mostly single white kids just out of high school
College Freshman,1,"We don't have one, and that needs to change"
College Student,1,"We don't have frats or sororities, sorry."
College Freshman,1,I do not care for this school and truly wish I had never committed to coming here. It has been an awful experience
College Freshman,1,"There is not any diversity on this campus
"
College Freshman,1,There are never any parking spots available
College Freshman,1,THEY DO NOT TREAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES APPROPRIATELY.
College Freshman,1,"I am in the Speech Pathology program and was treated horribly. I had medical issues come up halfway through the semester that prevented me from being at school. I was told by the Dean of the program that I cannot continue in the program because I am a bad student and do not have the capabilities to finish it. I was appalled at how I was discriminated against because I have medical issues, I would never come to this school for this major."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do around here and the shuttle is very unreliable.  They do not always pick you up when you call and some of the shuttle drivers can be very rude.  If you plan to go out just make sure you have a lot of time in case you get stranded somewhere.
College Freshman,1,I had asked for several weeks for help with the financial aid process and was told. If you cant get a loan you cant go to school here.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is terrible. There is not enough spaces for everyone. Its not right for someone that lives on one side of campus is required to park on the other side.
College Junior,1,"Your freshman year, there are like 12 sections of every class you want to take. Your schedule is really easy to make. Things seem ok. Then you fast forward to senior year, and the only classes you can take are an 8am and 6:30pm, and the one class you need to graduate isn't even offered the semester you need it. This university SUCKS. Also, tenured teachers are horrible! I dont know how they got tenured in the first place, but they're lazy. They don't want to teach you the things you need to pass. It seems like the teachers who are up for grabs go above and beyond to help you pass their classes. Just, dont go here."
College Junior,1,"All white. If you're not white, good luck. I hope you like that kind of thing."
College Junior,1,"LOL. Well, F if you're a girl.. but if you're a guy you still have some ugly girls to choose from. the ratio of guys to girls is 7:25, or like 28% of the school was guys. When i was a freshman, the ratio was less than 1:3. Mostly everyone on campus is super homely looking."
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible. It was horrible before they built a new dorm, then they decided to add room for hundreds of new students (and eventually ones that have cars). But no plans for parking!"
College Freshman,1,"Parking is a joke here. Even though freshman aren't allowed cars, they still bring them. And considering there are lots of commuters, you'll be parking extremely far away. The school desperately needs a level parking complex."
College Freshman,1,"there are some attractive girls but the majority of the girls are very, very ugly"
College Freshman,1,"Practically nonexistent. Unless you have a ""cliche"" here, you'll spend most nights trying to find something to do."
College Freshman,1,"Our School Is Not That Diverse – We do not have a diverse student population. I do believe they try to change this, which I believe a positive thing. They do have some diverse faculty."
College Student,1,"There is a lot of construction so parking is extremely difficult. Freshmen are not allowed cars on campus, but because there are a lot of commuters the parking lots throughout the week are packed."
College Freshman,1,Behave When Your Here – They give you strikes when it comes to alcohol. You get 3 strikes but you have to take classes and be clean for 6 months. But overall it doesn't give to much room depending on who you get caught by.
College Junior,1,"The parking at Misericordia, to be honest, kind of sucks.  There is not enough parking for all the students that go there.  Then there are the freshmen who disobey rules and bring their cars on campus, which takes up more room and it is just very hard to find parking much of the time.  Permits run about $35 but it is very the whole year, meaning two semesters.  The security like to ticket cars like it's their job.  They ticket it if it does not have a permit or if you are parked in a non-parking area.  Sometimes you can get away with it, but you see it a lot where they are writing someone up because they aren't parked in the right spot or they don't have a permit.  Fines for the tickets though are only $20-25, so it isn't horrible if you get one.  The need for a car on campus?  Well, Misericordia is set back a bit from the main road, so a car comes in handy if you want to go anywhere.  For freshmen though, since they are not allowed to have a car unless they have a special reason and permit, there is a shuttle van that is available especially on weekends that will take you to almost anywhere you want to go.  Other than parking, Misericordia is a nice school."
College Junior,1,"The weather is awful here. I have lived in Kingston, PA my whole life, only twenty minutes away from the campus and the weather up here is like a completely different world. High winds, freezing cold, icy roads, it is just horrible and being a commuter here is not easy because of the awful weather and not enough parking, especially when it is bad weather and some spots get iced over, not plowed, etc. The weather is the worst part of this school, hands down. Classes do not get cancelled enough in the snow and the teachers are not lenient for commuter students who are expected to risk their lives to get to class on these icy, steep hills. Walking around is very bad too, not matter how much they salt the walkways."
College Junior,1,No School Spirit for This School – There is no football at this school it's a huge down fall. The level at which sports are played is not very good.
College Sophomore,1,Not Much to Do – There are not too many places around the school to go for people under or over 21. There are a few small bars but in order to go to a club or a popular bar scene it is necessary to drive at least twenty minutes. Since clubs only have under 21 nights about once a week there is nothing for those people to do. The school is not surrounded by anything so it is difficult to even go to the movies or mall to hang out because it is such a drive.
College Junior,1,Terrible Parking – Parking is awful because there are never any spots yet they keep upping the number of incoming students.
College Senior,1,"Not enough ethnic diversity at this institution.  It's a tough situation for Misericordia because the surrounding area isn't conducive for retaining students of diverse backgrounds, preferably Blacks and Hispanics.  However, there are some things that can be done on campus to make it more welcoming for students of color."
College Sophomore,1,"There is some diversity, but I'd say 98% white. It is because it is a rich and wealthy school, with people coming from wealthy backgrounds."
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't many houses, and those that are provided are not in practical locations for college students. You can't even have 10 people over for a get together without police being called by elderly neighbors."
College Freshman,1,"Misericordia as a whole is great, the campus is beautiful and the people are friendly even the dorms are better than most. But as a commuter, the worst part of my day is finding a half-decent parking spot each morning. When I have an 8am class it's not too bad, but rarely do I even get one in the main lot when I get there around 10 am, most of the time I end up somewhere by the tennis courts...which is basically off campus.

Not to mention that the baseball field in right next to a lot of the better spots and if you park there, you risk getting your car damaged by a foul ball (as a friend did a few weeks back).

Long story short, parking sucks."
College Junior,1,The campus itself is nice but something has to be done about the parking.  There is never any spots available and that is a problem for someone paying for their education. They claim to have a shuttle but I have called them with no luck.
College Senior,1,"Nightmare for a Spot – Finding parking is near impossible if you do not get there super early to find a spot. If you do not have a class until mid afternoon, get there in the morning just to drive around the parking lot."
College Senior,1,"This year the parking pass cost went up from $25 to $35. Which is totally outrageous. No matter what, if you are coming or going on a weekday you can hardly ever find a spot. The school is accepting way too many new people and they do not account for the spots that students need. Teachers are allowed to park in the student spots but students are not allowed to park in the teacher's spots. Which makes it totally unfair! You cannot be late for class or you won't get parking, its the worst! Even down in the townhouses we can't get parking at certain times of the day and there are no other spots to park."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cold,Snow, Rain – Its snows alot and classes never get cancelled, its hard for people who need to walk far to class and for people who drive."

It is a wonderful small town college to attend!"
Sophomore,5,It is a great school. The professors know you by your first name. If you are looking for a small university then this is the place to go.
Freshman,5,University of West Alabama is a great school. The town is very welcoming to new incoming students. The professors actually are easy to talk with and are very knowledgeable in the area in which they teach. Class sizes are small so your not just a number. The school is rated #1 in Alabama for safety. I highly recommend this school.

When it comes down to it I have a a great experience at uwa.

It's worth your wild."
Graduate Student,5,"My overall experience at The University of West Alabama was fantastic. I made a lot of friends, and the people and professors were all very nice and helpful. The town is smaller then what I am used to but it was still beautiful. All of the buildings and classrooms were nice and they are still upgrading! The class size is no more then 30 students which fit me perfectly. I enjoy the smaller class room size because I can learn better and the professor knows who you are instead of being in a 200 student lecture hall."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Greek Life at UWA is very different. The members of each organization get along really well and there is a lot of unity. At UWA, Greek Life is not elite or secluded like at many other schools. It's for everyone."
College Sophomore,5,Class size usually vary upon on the professors and majors. Professors are more than willing to accept more students if need ed or asked.
College Sophomore,5,I not really sure. Most internships and/or jobs are generally offered to students when they reach a certain level in their studies.
College Sophomore,5,"The spirit by athletic and non-athletics is amazing.

College Senior,5,i am definitely having a better experience living off campus
College Junior,5,"Registering as a transfer student and feedback of what was needed was done either by mail, phone or email. Every step was simple and well detailed and organized. Only snafu was from my end which limited me from starting when I wanted to, but it has been a great experience."
College Freshman,5,"Livingston, Alabama is a college town different from other college towns. It is in the middle of nowhere and the college is the central hub, while other things within the town are built around it. Most services are made specifically for college students and people who live around or work for the college."
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy science, and the professors here attempt to make it as interesting as possible. Most professors have a Ph.D. in their field of study, which means that they are well versed in teaching, and since the classes are very small, it allows for the classes to be much more personal, and reminiscent of high school."
College Sophomore,5,"One thing our tiny campus does have is fantastic security. We have buildings you can only gain access to by having a specific magnetized card, security cameras in every inch of the buildings and staff that monitors any suspicious behavior. There is rarely a day that passes that I do not see several campus police. You can find them in the campus police building located on campus, strolling the grounds, eating in the cafe or ridding around in their campus police cars and patrolling."
College Sophomore,5,I am learning a lot and the workload is manageable. The teachers are very helpful and most of the work is applicable to my field!
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved computers since I was a child. The field is constantly growing and technology makes huge advances almost every day. I don't believe that I will have any trouble securing employment in my field. I hope to become a database administrator once I finish my studies, but as I learn more about the varied ways computers are used that may change by graduation."
College Freshman,5,There were computer labs and printing available in almost every building and wifi throughout the whole campus
College Freshman,5,My overall experience was awesome! It gave me a whole new aspect on life and I met a lot of good people
College Freshman,5,The facilities are average but the professors really are a big help

College Freshman,5,"Athletics is pretty big here, But football season has the most hype and the football team has the best record for the overall University Sports there
"

College Freshman,5,Drug and Alcohol abuse is a zero tolerance policy on campus
College Freshman,5,"I love the weather here. Sometimes it's cool, other times it's either very hot or just mild."

Recent Alumnus,5,I have done internship for limestone college for the social work program. I have to do an internship for psychology in order to obtain license in counseling.
College Sophomore,5,"There are plenty computer labs on campus for the people that do not own a laptop. In every building, there are at least two or more computer labs that hold at least 20-30 computers. The library is open later during midterms and finals, so if you need extra studying on a computer, it is available to the students."
College Junior,5,sport arenas are an excellent place for students to gather and to have an enjoyable time
College Sophomore,5,"UWA has a beautiful flow that makes it seem like a home away from home. The freshmen dorms (Gilbert Hall), the one I lived in, was very adaptable. It came with it's own bathroom and kitchenette, which was very nice and acceptable. There is plenty of space throughout the campus to hang out with friends and also places to find food whenever the CAF (cafteria) wasn't open. Usually, there isn't a day without an event going on at UWA, so it is no excuse to be bored. Everyone also has the opportunity to join any organization, whether you are an incoming freshmen or a senior."
College Sophomore,5,"The diversity at UWA is phenomenal. There foreign exchange students from all over the world, here to either play sports or the heard about the wonderful education that comes from this school. Although, majority of the people living on campus are white, there are so many other races of people that it appears to be really diverse."
College Sophomore,5,"I am in the University of West Alabama Secondary Education English Language Arts program. I will graduate from the college of Liberal Arts. Being in my specific major at UWA is very rewarding. Our college has some of the best professors. Our professors, advisors, and deans are very helpful and expect excellency out of each student. The workload of our college is very busy, but definitely not too stressful."
Sophomore,4,It has a very warm and welcoming place where everyone is friendly and the students enjoy helping each other.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year of attendance and it's a place that makes you feel safe, the dorms are very nice and clean and the food is good.  Being away from home has been pretty easy to deal with due to the culture and the environment.  There are plenty events and clubs to attend or sign up for.  At this time, I am playing football intermuals and it's a lot of fun."
Junior,4,So far everything has went well. They have been very helpful whenever I need anything. It is pretty easy to get in touch with someone. They disburse the remainder of your financial aid within the first month of classes. If you have a problem with something they will try their best to fix it. Professors are very understanding of working students as well.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at the University of West Alabama. During the time I was there they began changing many things for the better. The school increased their safety standards, built new dorms, remodeled and expanded the cafeteria. Many of the students were from small towns around Alabama and Mississippi, however there were a lot of foreign students who played on the sports teams and were enrolled in the business department. This created a fresh new sense of diversity on campus. I enjoyed learning from most of the professors that I took classes from. There were a few that I felt were unqualified to teach certain classes and I shared this information with the Dean's of the prospective departments. If you are looking for a big party scene, this is not the school to go to. The people who did party usually partied on Thursday nights. Since most of the students are local, campus clears out on Friday after classes."
Sophomore,4,"I love the University of West Alabama. UWA is a good school when it comes to academics, safety, and athletics. However, UWA lacks in overall dorm/housing, party scene, and campus food. UWA is a PBI."
Sophomore,4,"The University of West Alabama is a great school. The school is affordable and provides a great education. The professors are really caring and strive to help students perform. It is located in the city of Livingston and is only one hour away from Tuscaloosa, AL and thirty minutes away from Meridian, MS so there are plenty of things to do outside of campus as well as on campus."
Junior,4,"I love the down-home feel. With a relatively small student body, the university feels like being back home in a small town."
Sophomore,4,I love the small campus and it's also very beautiful. It's close to many places and we have on campus events so we're never bored. The campus really feels like home.
Freshman,4,"UWA has a comfy campus,everyone is friendly and heart warming. campus is clean and the new dorms for the freshmens' are so nice."
Freshman,4,"The environment is very safe and peaceful, the teachers really care for your well being, and the students and faculty are very welcoming. The only thing I would change is the food: I wish they put more effort in making it taste good."
Junior,4,"Good school, small town. That isn't a problem though. This makes the school feel more like home and a true college town. The professors are dedicated in making sure you understand. You get that one-on-one relationship with you professors."
Freshman,4,"West Alabama has a lot of great things but at the same time there are not a lot of great things. For example, the campus is small, but everything is so far apart. The food places don't stay open on the weekend unless you want to go to Burger King. The teachers are not as understanding and don't listen. There's nothing exciting that makes West Alabama come out. As far as friends, West Alabama has the best friends you could have. You meet some real important people here and you have the time of your lives with them. But this is my experience of the University of West Alabama."
Freshman,4,"I visited West Alabama for a future student preview day, and I was very impressed with the school as a whole. I am looking to walk on with the football team, so I was really interested in the campus and what it had to offer. After my visit I knew that West Alabama was where I wanted to start planning and building my future. It is a nice friendly campus that seems really safe and secure. I am looking forward to getting on campus at start getting involved with my athletic and academic goals."
Sophomore,4,Having a smaller campus is nice. I like being a smaller university. I love the class sizes and the fact that the campus is small so you don't have long walks to each class
Senior,4,"Although it is small, the community is welcoming and kind. There is always something to do on campus and everything is close enough to walk to."
Sophomore,4,Overall it is a good shoot. It is a small community making it easy to meet new people. The professors are always looking to help their students in any way possible
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student to this university. I've been here for 3 years and it has been a good experience.  Their academic expectations are really good. They make sure their students are getting something out of attending this university. All the departments like financial aid, housing etc they are very helpful when it comes to finding information. I am enjoying my stay here."
Sophomore,4,I didn't really like it at first but it's definitely grown on me. Everyone who attends UWA knows there's just something about this place.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy going to the university of west Alabama. The school is very clean, love the atmosphere. Professors are very helpful, they take their time and try to help you. Just hate the walking distance from classes to classes. "
College Freshman,4,Safety is very important on campus. There is no tolerance of assault nor violence. The campus gives tips to the students on how to stay safe and where to report it. The camps has campus police. They advised you to go in groups and leave in groups and let tell friends where you going and comings.
College Freshman,4,"The Dorms are coed. It's neat and clean in the room the day I arrived. We recently had inspection. Inspection rules are to report anything that is damage before or at moving in day. If damages are not reported at moving in day, the student is  responsible for any damages for that day forward."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus security constantly patrols the entire campus, so it's easy to feel safe. There's also always a dispatcher at the Campus Police station as well as emergency towers around the loop on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"UWA's admissions counselors are very helpful, and they will transfer you to whoever can answer your question if they do not know."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Sports are pretty important at UWA. People see the athletes as regular people rather than ""celebrities"" like at other schools."

College Freshman,4,The Greeks and non-Greeks get along great. We don't look at each other as any different.
College Freshman,4,The atletics at my school are amazing. They play a big role in bringing people together.
College Freshman,4,The school is all-around great! The students and professors are very helpful.
College Student,4,The social level and friendliness
College Sophomore,4,"Students are encouraged to ask questions or seek help from tutors from. Generally most students prefer their studies to be done in a library, computer lab, and/or the school's union building."
College Sophomore,4,"Students of different racial background, religion, and sexual orientation are treated equally and fairly."
College Sophomore,4,Safety and Security is strongly enforce throughout the campus. There are day and night patrols that checks for any criminal activities on and off campus. The school have a zero tolerance for trespassing and solicitation.
College Sophomore,4,"Each dormitory are different from each other but have a unique and socially active atmosphere. There is quite a diversity in ethnic groups, age, and college level. Quiet hours are always followed and respected and open to change if there is a need to do so. The are usually more active into the night due to late night studies or fun events hosted by residents assistants."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life, especially in the fall semester, generally active because of the freshman that are interested in joining. Almost every week fraternities or sororities are promoting events for awareness, health donations and/or entertainment."
College Sophomore,4,currently I have not experienced some a the above career prospect. I have talked to some of the upper class and they seem to be very satisfied with the career center service on campus
College Freshman,4,"Most professors I have had are very good at covering the courses, while others are bland and act as if they do not want to be there themselves."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors I have had are very good at covering the courses, while others are bland and act as if they do not want to be there themselves."

College Junior,4,"Classes are great, student to teacher ratio is very acceptable!"
College Junior,4,"I transferred from Tuskegee University which had terrible housing, Both years at University of West Alabama and I have absolutely loved my on campus housing."
College Freshman,4,"Great caf, great professors, and great campus. The only down side is that there isn't very much to do in Livingston outside of campus but, if you're up to drive a short distance you can be in Meridian, MS or Tuscaloosa in no time."
College Freshman,4,It is a very friendly environment with teachers that help with whatever they can.
College Freshman,4,I like how the teachers acknowledge you as a equal
College Sophomore,4,my experience was great i got really involved in my school through my sports team and becoming great friends with my neighbors in my dorm.
College Junior,4,"There is a great local bakery//luncheon restaurant that is open Monday thru Friday that offer a great variety of food but is a scheduled menu. They grow their own vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers), bake all their own pastries and is a great place to have lunch."
College Junior,4,"Process was simple and efficient. Had no issue with the financial aid office or the people that work in the department. Always reachable either by telephone, fax or email. Responses within 24 hours."
College Junior,4,"Food on a whole is good. There are times that soups are salty, overall, food is good, hot and wholesome."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The football stadium is very nice and well supported by current students and alumni. The baseball facility, softball facility, rodeo grounds, and intermural areas are an asset. All are well attended by people in the community along with students of the school. It is often a family affair to attend any of the sporting opportunities. The athletes appreciate the fan's support."
Recent Alumnus,4,I was able to fax or email the required forms with ease. I was able to communicate by phone with the person in the financial aid office who handled my paperwork. It was a very easy process once everything go started.
College Freshman,4,"Basketball, Football and Volleyball are generally going to get the most spectators, while Tennis and Soccer don't. In fact, I didn't even know we had a Soccer team. The Football field's away side is basically half of what an average high school has. The home side isn't any better."
College Freshman,4,"I don't go to many parties, but there are parties thrown by one certain fraternity every Thursday, and greeks try to keep it common so there is much to do in the way of a social life."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is especially diverse. We have students from all over the country who come to either participate in one of our several offered sports or to get an education. The campus is accepting of these individuals and almost welcomes them more than students from the U.S. Economic background, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation never seem to be a problem on our campus and most students do not pay these things a second thought."
College Sophomore,4,"The curriculum is very current, which is hard in the fast paced computer world of today. The workload is not the hardest but leaves no time for slacking. "
Recent Alumnus,2,There is not much going on in the Livingston area because it is so rural
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life and soccer house threw decent parties. It really is about all you have to do here in your free time.
Recent Alumnus,2,I do not feel like people are treated equally here. There is definetely some discrimination going on in all parts of the university.
Recent Alumnus,2,Parties are pretty big and often out of control here. I feel like many people drink a lot because of the area not offering much to do.
Recent Alumnus,2,A girl on a sports team accused a guy on another team of assault and not much was done about it. The guy got to play his game the next week. He said/she said deal but seems like nobody wanted to punish the athlete.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I feel like throughout the state of Alabama we are looked down on by other schools and my degree is not worth as much as one from UAB, Alabama, Auburn, and those bigger schools."
College Senior,2,they only have six restauratns which are mainly fast food...
College Senior,2,"people need to dance and stop drinking until they are wasted, the fun part of a party is remembering what happens"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is just okay on this campus. If you park only in your dorms parking lot, you're pretty much safe. The parking rules are confusing and you could possibly get a ticket for accidentally parking somewhere that you think is a student parking space but it isn't. It's best to just walk everywhere."
College Junior,2,parking is horrible . the campus has plenty of green areas but at the expense of parking
College Junior,2,the town itself is extremely small . The town is a low income area with the college being the only source of income
College Student,2,They tell us that there is a noise after a certain hour but when there is excesiv noise after that hour nothing is ever done
College Sophomore,2,"I live in an off-campus apartment about two miles from campus. From my experience, all off-campus housing facilities are expensive and typically not worth the money spent."
College Sophomore,2,There is no where near enough parking at either buildings where classes are held . There should be more parking spaces added for student parking.
Sophomore,1,"The University of West Alabama is unorganized with the documents of their students. They accept more students than they have appropriate housing for. Showing they do not value or respect their students. The University of West Alabama only cares about receiving money from their students, they constantly show this by cramming 3 and 4 people into rooms only equip for 2 people. They also overlook mental illnesses of their students more often than not. They show no concern for the health and well-being of their students. Overall my experience at the University of West Alabama has been one of complete and utter disappointment. I started my journey at the institution with an open mind, and so frequently did they show me reasons I should have went with a different choice. I would not recommend to anyone that the University of West Alabama is the college for them. They are not a college for any student, they are college that simply wants to reap financial benefits for themselves."
Recent Alumnus,1,Students attend a lot of the events but the facilities are very old and need updating badly
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school is in a town that is openly racist. The local 9 hole golf course is ""white only"". My friends and I were not allowed to go there. I think the school has a golf team and is building a driving range, but it ain't done or open either. I feel like my experience is ruined because of the area. Some professors do a really good job and others you can tell do not want to be at this place. I feel like most people including staff and students are only here because they do not have a better option."
College Sophomore,1,I did not receive sufficient financial aid. Whenever I call I literally have to let the phone ring for a solid two minutes before someone answers. Overall the financial aid staff is not overly friendly or helpful.
College Sophomore,1,"I can offer no tips, and the school is absolutely no help."
College Sophomore,1,Stuck at School – If u dont have a car u might as well be stuck in the middle of no where.
College Sophomore,1,Very Poor Athletic Skills – There is absolutely n fan base. The cheer leaders are crappy. No one really supports any sports team.
College Sophomore,1,Not Much to Do – There is not very much to do here if u dont have a car. A near by school is The University of Alabama. It's only 45 min away.
College Freshman,1,there are never enough parking places at any of the dorms so thatsituation causes students to have to park where it is not necessary.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing Worth Traveling for. Hardees isn't my choice of fast food. There is no variety.
College Sophomore,1,"It Is a Big Let Down. Nothing Spectacular about the facilities. Most of them are in need of updating, especially the fresshman dorms."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing Unique – There is nothing unique about my school it sucks, and I plan to transfer as soon as i get 30 hours."
College Freshman,1,Dorms & Restrooms – The dorms look like upgraded prison cells and the restrooms are just not up to par.

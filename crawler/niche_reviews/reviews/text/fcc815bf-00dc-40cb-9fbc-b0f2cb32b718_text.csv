Alum,5,"Though I only had one online class with no class room component, Delval courses did usually have online materials and supplemental. In this respect They were usually fairly intuitive to use and IT was 24 hours to assist if things were not running smoothly."
Alum,5,Delval has a focus on in-person experience based learning. My professors were amazing and supportive. I am still in contact with a few even as I move on to graduate school. I had enough hands on animal experience even in my second year to have summer work in my field. Every where I went my school had an established positive reputation from my local zoo to the Walt Disney Company. I feel that Delval was the best possible program for working with animals.
Freshman,5,Their faculty and administration was so welcoming and helpful.  All of my questions were answered by many different people.  The University offers a wide range of sports and activities to get involved with.  The students are very nice to each other and make the campus feel very welcoming.
Senior,5,"Amazing campus, family-like atmosphere. Will make life long friends and academic connections. Amazing professors and courses. Flexible degrees so you can pursue exactly what you would like ( or sample different courses to find out what you enjoy). A lot of school spirit and activities to do outside of campus. I could go on and on about how amazing this school is. So sad that my year was cut short because this college makes everything so enjoyable."
Niche User,5,Delaware Valley has been extremely helpful in my college journey. They have people who will personally contact you when an issue arises. This University has is so helpful with the different things they offer to better the student.
Alum,5,I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biology with a specialization in Zoology in 2017.  I was a member of the cheerleading team and Biology Club.  I had professors very knowledgable on their studies who assisted their students in succeeding.
Niche User,5,I love it just wish it was a little more modern. Everyone is so nice and is very welcoming. I love the library even though it has a haunted feel. You can get food 24/7 and it is always so good. If you do not see a food that you like than you can just ask for something different. Also thee campus is so beautiful and there are beautiful plants everywhere. The community is so tight nit and everyone there is so friendly. the 360 program is amazing because it will really help me to get a job once I graduate.  It is an amazing school.
Niche User,5,My overall experience at Delaware Valley is definitely a 5 star. The school has everything I am looking for in a college and a perfect Pre-Vet program for which I would be majoring in. The campus life seems very fun and the life science building is my favorite.
Sophomore,5,Delaware Valley University is a small school which I like.  Most classes only have 15-20 students which gives students more one on one with the professors.  I believe this gives students a better learning experience.
Freshman,5,"I love Delval! Everyone there has been so helpful in the enrollment and financial aid process so far, and I can't wait to start school in the fall!"
Sophomore,5,"Although Delaware Valley University is a very small school, it is the perfect school for me. The main reason I chose to attend this school in the first place was because the department of athletics was planning to start a womens wrestling program. However, the beautiful environment and the comfortable feel it gave me to be a resident on campus made me find other reasons to appreciate the school I was so lucky to be accepted to and attend."
Freshman,5,"It has been an amazing first year experience living on campus! The professors care about each and every one of their students, and know them on a first name basis, and they have really flexible office hours."
Freshman,5,"Great small school, and close to home. Small class sizes to actually get to know your class and professors and not get lost in the crowd. Has a gre side music program and opportunities for someone like me whos not a music major bu loves music."
Freshman,5,What I like about Delaware Valley University would be the resources on campus and everyone is friendly to one another.
Niche User,5,"This school has been my dream school since I was 12. The campus is on the smaller side, most of it being farmland and grazing land for all of the animals they own."
Freshman,5,"I love this school because it gives the rather niche majors a place to go and learn about what the want to do. Everyone in the faculty is helpful and is straight up with what you can and can't do with your major. There are also many hands on opportunities. Most people on campus are very friendly and welcoming. The cafe food is terrible and the buns snap when you bite into them, but the pub is good they have a pretty good variety. The campus is small if you like that. Its a lot easier to get to know professors this way. There is absolutely nothing to do on the weekends however."
Niche User,5,I have not begun my attendance there just yet but as soon as I found this school online I fell in love with it. I stopped looking at any other schools nor did I apply anywhere else because I knew this is where I belonged. This school specializes in everything I want to go for in an amazing area. The campus is gorgeous and everyone there is just so helpful. I have nothing bad to say.
Niche User,5,"I went to the campus to explore by myself and everyone there was extremely friendly. The entire campus was beautiful. The South campus is where most of the agricultural things are, the scenery is absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to go back and explore with a guide!"
Sophomore,5,"I like that the campus is just the right size that almost everyone knows who you are and is a very welcoming campus. I feel like I am at home when I am there and that it is easy to fit in. The academics are also really good. I really like that the classes are on the smaller size so you can gain a better relationship with your professors and are able to go to them easier than that of a larger school. If you like a friendly yet small area, this is your school."
Niche User,5,I loved how personal the professors were with their students and the impressive nature of the campus and its environment. I would appreciate it if the professors were to incorporate some form of business into all of their horticulture courses as a small side lesson throughout the duration of the course.
Alum,5,"Delaware valley university is an excellent school with professors who are currently employed in the fields which they teach. Students are given opportunities to have hands on experience in their chosen field prior to graduation, giving you a unique opportunity to build your resume while still completing your degree."
Sophomore,5,"I recently transferred from Rutgers to Delaware Valley and I can honestly say it was the best decision of my life. Everyone is genuinely kind and friendly, professors are willing to help and are eager to teach, and students enjoy the smaller class setting compared to larger schools. Everyone at DelVal is willing to help you move in the right direction for your career. I only wish I came here sooner!"
Sophomore,5,Delaware Valley University is full of exciting and hard working students that help you stay motivated. The university helps expand your mind and experiences by providing events and internships that gear toward your major.
Senior,5,Came here for plant science only to find out that the plant science department is crumbling. A little too conservative for my taste and little to no focus on organics which was disappointing.
Graduate Student,5,"In 2010 I started my Bachelor's Business Administration Major and I have only 18 more credits to go!  The teachers, advisors and entire college atmosphere is both accommodating, and convenient for my educational experience.  I highly recommend this university in PA."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Delaware Valley is the community. Everyone is so welcoming and warm-hearted, you will always have a friend somewhere. The student body and professors work very hard at bring everyone together with many activities to do in our dining hall and pub. This university makes many efforts to celebrate many different holidays and also celebrates it with the food in the dining hall. The atmosphere is very welcoming and living more than an hour away from home, it makes it very easy to get adjusted here. The dorms are very communal and you get to know and make friends with everyone easily on your floor. The resident assistant's are very dedicated with getting to know everyone which makes them very approachable. At first glace, I knew that Delaware Valley was the place for me and I am happy to say I will be spending the rest of my college years here."
Freshman,5,"I just started Delaware Valley University, and as soon as I started classes I realized how much the teacher were happy to be able to teach students. Everyone is so helpful with anything that you could possibly need. The students are very friendly and you can join in so many clubs and sports."
Junior,5,"It is a very hands on school with a lot of opportunities for students. The professors are friendly and approachable. DelVal has the same problems every other college has (poor wifi, low quality food) but the education and academics are great. I love it here."
Senior,5,I wish the food was better.  The university is fantastic but there are minor little things that remind me of a newer institution that hasnt figured out all of the bumps yet. Overall though  i would never choose another school over Delval
Sophomore,5,"DelVal is a great school for anyone interested in agriculture, animals, or the environment. The professors are all extremely experienced and knowledgeable. The campus is beautiful, with our own farm with horses, pigs, sheep, and beef and dairy cattle. There are also two smal animal labs for pre-veterinary practice and learning. DelVal provides the most hands-on experience out of all the other colleges and universities. I visited before choosing my school. I love it there even though the dorms are below average and the food isn't too great. Everything outweighs the few negatives."
Sophomore,5,I like how small the campus is. It allows me to get familiar with different areas of the school very quickly. I would like to have a more diverse student body.
Senior,5,My experience at DVU has been exceptional especially with the amount of hands on activities I can participate in.
College Sophomore,5,"Based on the quality of the education and the excellence of the professors here at DelVal, it is the best school for me! I am very happy to be here and many of the professors have really helped me find who I am and what I want from college and life. The hardest part about attending this school is the hefty pricetag that comes with it. That was the only reason I considered transferring out of DelVal to another school. But for me, the culture this campus has and the experience I have and gain from DelVal is definitely worth the price."
College Freshman,5,Everyone will be offered an internship at least once during their time at DelVal. What makes companies so interested in DelVal's students is the hands-on experience we all receive.
College Freshman,5,The professors really care and are like family. They want every student to succeed and will make sure that they do. Professors put plans in place so you are very unlikely to fail.
College Freshman,5,"Most students , including myself, feel safe on campus. I f one were not feeling safe, they could press a button on poles that the schools have on campus to contact a security guard. The security will even offer to walk some students to their dorm if they are feeling unsafe."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is the best. It's great to be able to stay on campus and get the full college experience. Everyone is super nice and polite. Even though the cost of living on campus is quite high, it is more convenient for classes and making new friends. The housing process is extremely simple and definitely hassle-free."
College Freshman,5,Students at DelVal love to attend football games as well as soccer and other sporting events. People enjoy participating because they have lots of fans who love and support them. Most students will wear their school gear around and outside of campus. DelVal students always show school spirit. There are great workout facilities on campus which are good for students who'd like to start in sports or just use the area to stay in shape (workout).
College Freshman,5,DelVal is a small but amazing school. The great thing about it being so small is that everyone knows everyone and it's a family. No one feels alone because you always have help there. The teachers are what make this school the best. They really care about students' educations and whether or not you're doing well in classes. I would always choose DelVal because I know everyone would succeed there.
College Freshman,5,"We may not be the number one teams in our divisions, but every team creates a family. I play volleyball at DelVal and I can honestly say it is the best thing to happen to me at DelVal. I was a walk on, but still got every opportunity to prove myself. I met some amazing girls and have the four most amazing coaches. I also have attended almost every men's basketball game this season. My group of friends involves a lot of athletes and we all support each other at our games."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love this university. I am a sophomore and it is everything I have desired in a school.
College Sophomore,5,"If you match up with the scholarships the school provides based off SATs, the minimum is about $8,000."
College Freshman,5,The financial aid I received really showed that my hard work in high school paid off.
College Freshman,5,Lots of different types of people here. Muck boots and jeans are widely accepted and it's awesome.
College Freshman,5,As long as I don't have to hear the parties I am ok with whatever happens out of my sight.
College Freshman,5,"I love my major. Depending on the major you're looking for, however, there is different criteria. My major is Conservation and Wildlife Management, but i originally applied for Zoo Science, which only accepts 25 students. Some are very selective while others don't cause trouble to get into."
College Freshman,5,This campus is among the top rated for safest campuses. There are blue security light posts everywhere that you can press if you're in danger as well as patrolling public safety officers all day.
College Freshman,5,"The town is beautiful. On one side, it's all commercial centers. Every store you can think of. But, on the other side of town, it's all small-town charm with local stores, restaurants, houses, etc."
College Junior,5,"Biology kids are normally studying, and if not studying at least 2 or more hours a day you're failing. It's one of the toughest majors on campus, but well worth it."
College Junior,5,"Being part of the international co-ed fraternity on campus makes me a bit biased. We don't treat anyone differently, and fight against the stereotypes. We are a service fraternity,and if you get caught drinking in letters you're inactive no questions asked."
College Junior,5,"Our Stop the Hate program has teachers and students reporting ""bias incidents"". You can not call someone a ""fag"" or any other biased term unless you want the whole school coming down on you!"
College Senior,5,The head of my major is very helpful and understanding.  A pleasure to work with.  Love the program.
College Sophomore,5,"It's about an hour drive to the airport, the train is right on campus, bus stops are convenient, and it's only $80 a year for a parking pass."
College Sophomore,5,"My only wish would be that the financial aid increase after freshman year, should it be appropriate. I am not complaining about my academic scholarship what so ever, but my grades, in comparison from high school to freshman year, took a great turn for the better. It would have been nice to see my scholarship reflect that as well."
College Freshman,5,"I'm in the zoo science program and so far I love it. You really have to show that you want it in order to get into this program since it is so small but if you think its anywhere near what you want to do its great. I love the classes we get to take and I'm looking forward to the internships in junior year. Plus an added bonus is the professors. SO far I've only had Maggie, for Intro to ZooKeeping, but she is so great and has plenty of advice and stories for us about her experience. Every time she talks about it I get a more and more excited because I can tell that it'll never be boring."
College Freshman,5,We have a wide selection of majors and it is definitely specialized for agricultural and animal fields.
College Junior,5,"I am very excited about my career. If I could do it over, I would not change a thing. I plan to attend Dental School after completing undergraduate. My biggest concern is getting into a good program."
College Junior,5,"At Delaware Valley College the Experiential Learning Program is a course that is required in order to graduate. Within this program, students must complete at least 40 hours of internship or job shadowing. This program is designed to prepare students for entering the career world or gain a better understanding of their major. I found a position for job shadowing and I am currently enrolled in the Experiential Learning Program. I think this program is great for students."
College Junior,5,"One reason I chose Delaware Valley College was because of the atmosphere. Doylestown is a small town with fun shops and great places to eat. It is not a college town, which I like. It is more sophisticated. I also like how there are small markets with local grown produce. This town is self-sufficient and a beautiful place to live in."
College Sophomore,5,"DelVal is EXTREMELY safe, I have never felt in danger or have had anything bad happen. Security can be a pain in the ass."
Sophomore,4,I like how small the school is. It allows for students to get to know each other and their professors in a way that allows for them to  learn better.
Freshman,4,"This university is very much agriculture-based. With majors ranging from Small Animal Science to Zoo Science. But aside from the agricultural majors, there are also majors like Food Science and Counseling Psychology. And as a whole, the majors are all very hands-on. Like many other schools, there are some amazing professors and some not so amazing professors. The campus is very aesthetically pleasing as it is a small campus with a lot of greenery. The school does, however, lack a lot of diversity, and there is not a lot of representation of minorities and the LGBTQ+ community. As far as food and housing, you either get used to it or get tired of it. Some students live off-campus after their first year. The food could use some work but there are alternatives to the food that is served in the dining hall. One con is that it is very hard to go to places if you don't have a car on campus. Otherwise, this school is very good especially if you like small schools and small class sizes."
Freshman,4,For my first year at DelVal it is going okay. The professors do what to see you succeed and are easy going which makes it easy to ask them questions. The food selection become routine after a while and you that is when you start missing homecooked meals.
Alum,4,Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time at DelVal. The faculty was accommodating and thorough in what they taught. If I have one critique it was that I could not enter an undergraduate program that I felt would have expedited my career earlier and I may have been further along in my career because there were program enrollment prerequisites that the program advisers failed to mention to me and I had to earn a degree that did not readily match my career path and delayed my transition from college to the workforce
Senior,4,"Overall, Delaware Valley University is a good University. I love the smaller class sizes and how everything on campus, including the farms is less than a 10-minute walk from each other. The Experience360 program has allowed me to get experience within my field before I even graduate. The food isn't terribly good. Most of the buildings are pretty old but nothing too concerning. The surrounding area is great but, there isn't much on campus or directly around if you don't have a car."
Freshman,4,I just graduated from Bethpage High School and will attend DelVal in the fall. So far my application and orientation experience has been positive. The dorm rooms look lack luster and underwhelming considering the price of housing.
Sophomore,4,"When you first step foot on campus at Delaware Valley University, you can tell that the school is designed for the students' best interest and throughout your time here this thought does not change. The school's small, yet personal, class sizes and unique hands-on learning experiences make you feel that you are truly learning about your desired field and that you will be prepared for anything you are looking to accomplish in the future."
Junior,4,"Being in Delval is great for any undergrade that want  real world experience first with  professors that care. The University has a very rigorous Biology program that  teach's students the ins and outs of the subject with an emphasis on internships and field experience. The University's growing psychology and Business fields also stresses real world experience, along with the stable farming curriculum that lets future growers get hands-on with livestock and other farming tech. The professors are very accommodating and want to see their students succeed, but still pushs them to do the best they can with challenging projects that require good comprehension and execution of the lessons learned in class. Delval is a University for doers, the people that shall shape the world for the better."
Niche User,4,"Delaware Valley offers opportunities for you can succeed at school. The classes are small, giving that one on one attention with your professor."
Freshman,4,"Always something going on that you can go to. Professors are hit and miss, but most are willing to help. The food is cafeteria food it's not a 5 star restaurant."
Freshman,4,The professors really care about your success and give you resources to help you learn and understand.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the hands on learning about DelVal,  but I wish they would have more classes specific to Conservation Majors."
Sophomore,4,"Delaware Valley University is  and amazing school.  It’s full of great professors cooperative staff and students, plus an all-around amazing comfort being there"
Senior,4,"Great teachers that really care about your future. Small intimate campus. Farm life makes things fun and interesting. BUT kind of boring, and PARKING SUCKS. Very good school for animal and plant sciences or sports/ business / criminal justice. Art and med student prospects should look elsewhere!"
Senior,4,"I really do like DelVal. There's a great campus atmosphere, and I am learning so much about my area of interest!"
Junior,4,"DelVal provides really unique opportunities to take interesting and worthwhile classes, and has professors who are very passionate about their fields. The school is very focused on agriculture, wildlife studies, and other aspects of animal science. This is a campus where, due to low class size, your achievements will be recognized and professors offer many different ways to help you if you are struggling. Overall, I have had a very positive experience at this schoola and would definitely recoommend it to others"
Sophomore,4,I feel very at home here because it is a small university.  I did have to move off campus due to there is not enough adequate housing avalable here.  Classes are of a smaller size which is good for me due to my add.  Professors seem friendly enough for college.
Freshman,4,"Delval is a great school with great faculty! It has this great ""family"" atmosphere and all the teachers are very accessible and laid back. All the faculty are very easy to connect with and it's easy to build lasting relationships with them and get the connections we need to succeed in our individual careers."
Junior,4,So far so good. Some bumps in the road. Parking is awful. But the class sizes are perfect. The kids and professors I have met are great.
Junior,4,"Overall it is an amazing school. Great professors willing to help you, unique hands on experience, and a gorgeous campus."
Senior,4,"Lovely, small campus. Dorms for the most part are good, but some do show their age. Overall it is very easy to feel at home there, and everyone is kind."
Junior,4,It's nice going to a school where most students are getting similar degrees (Ag or Animals). Courses are geared in those directions and it's easy to find other students with similar interests.
Senior,4,I love the small campus community making it easy to reach out to others. I dislike the amount of facility to teach classes.
Freshman,4,"So far, in my two semesters here at Delaware Valley University, I've been welcomed into a dedicated community of welcoming souls. I've grown in mind, heart, and soul. I've found not only a university, but a home away from home. I'm better off now than I've ever been before."
Freshman,4,"Delval gives a lot of hands on experience that will be handy in your future career. You have many opportunities to create a larger network and they work with you to obtain internships, or career experience that will make a positive difference when applying for a job after graduation"
Sophomore,4,The small class sizes are great and allow you to create a true connection between the other students as well as the professors.  They offer a lot of hands on experience and there are always more opportunities for you to get more involved especially with work relating to your major.  Only downsides is parking can sometimes be tricky and the food isn't always the best.  But there's plenty of places in Doylestown or that are near by on 611 that provide plenty of other options.
Freshman,4,"I love the friendly faculty on campus. They do an excellent job making you feel like you are at home. The class sizes are nice if you prefer a High School style learning environment. The athletic events are a huge hit if you are a sports fan. So much to do around campus! The only down fall about this school is the food. It has its good and bad days. Overall, a great school!"
College Junior,4,I don't think it's a problem at this school.
College Junior,4,"I love and dislike my school equally. My professors are the absolute best. They are very knowledgeable in their field and are very excited to teach. They are just this endless well of resources and have so much experience to share. They get me excited to learn and make me look forward to their classes, no matter how tough the material is. They are not my problem at all. My problem is with the school itself. When I came on the tour, my selling point was that it was a small school with a small student to teacher ratio. That was a lie. They said it would be like 18 to 1 and it's definitely not. I can see my teachers get upset on the first day with how many students they have crammed in a room. It's more like 40+ to 1. My one class now has 68 students crammed into a class meant to hold 30. That also limits the one on one personal interaction. It's quite upsetting and stressful. The parking situation is a joke. If you don't get to school by 7:30am, you will not find ANY parking. You might be lucky to get one like 15 minutes away. They also take in more students than they have living quarters for. Last semester, they had to place students in a hotel. Instead of working on the problem, they keep allowing more and more students in every year. If I was not halfway into my degree and if this were not one of the only animal science schools around, I would transfer out. I am very unhappy with how this school handles things and how they treat their employees, our professors. It's just always about money."
College Sophomore,4,"Such a large portion of professors here are so wonderful it's shocking! It's because of them, I love DelVal so much and love my classes."
College Sophomore,4,"The value of our degree is strong. Many of us are going into a competitive field so it can be difficult to find a job, but our on campus career center is very helpful and will always do what they can to help."
College Sophomore,4,"I have always felt safe while walking around on campus no matter what time of day it is. Except for one time in my nine months of attending DelVal I felt a little unsafe but in the end nothing bad happened to me. In general nothing bad happens on campus, but like any college, something always does happen."
College Sophomore,4,"All the dorms/bedrooms are nice. Depending on what hall you reside in the, the bathrooms can be a bit of a disappointment, but not completely unmanageable."
College Junior,4,"I am a part of our coed fraternity on campus. I love our Greek life; we are pretty great and there are no rivalries between different fraternities and sororities. There is some tension between the Greek life and administration, though other students have no problems."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love my school and if I could do it all over I would not change a thing. The faculty that I have had the honor of working with are passionate about what they teach and about teaching it to students. I have had a great number of opportunities and halfway through my degree I already feel confident in what I have learned and about learning more in the future. There is work that they need to do. The facilities really need to be updated, and I have heard some unfavorable storied about professors who are not as passionate, kind, or approachable as mine have been. While I have met and worked with a great many hard-working and dedicated students, there is a noticeable amount of those that choose to live by the saying ""D's get degrees"" and only aim for just enough to get through, without much care for learning."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy I choose DelVal however there are some disappointments I have had in my first year. For one the cafe food is disgusting for the most part. We pay a lot of money each year and it is a particularly small school so there is no reason to not provide adequate meals. I do greatly appreciate all the staff on campus. They work with students to help them succeed and accomplish their dreams.
College Freshman,4,I love my courses and professors are pretty good.
College Freshman,4,The allows ways to make good connections.
College Freshman,4,The sororitys and fraternitys do great things on campus and there are little parties related to them.
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is easy to go with along with easily available.
College Freshman,4,Most of the professors are friendly and outgoing while a select few are temperamental and get into arguments easily.
College Senior,4,"Overall, I love DelVal and hope to return one day as a professor."
College Senior,4,"Lots of drama, but overall I love it. Great school for me. Teachers really listen and actually some have implemented some of my ideas!"
College Senior,4,"Teachers know their stuff but you really sense the drama of administration. Students kind of have a voice, but not really."
Recent Alumnus,4,Most professors will help you.  Curriculum is good.  Registration process has some bugs but they are working on making this better.
College Freshman,4,This institute is well know for their agriculture education to their students and I believe that this will help me land a job anywhere!
College Freshman,4,I love Del Val and don't regret picking it as my home away from home!
College Freshman,4,Everyone is a family and most professors are okay with class missed as long as work is made up.
College Freshman,4,Super close to home and friendly atmosphere
College Sophomore,4,"Delaware Valley University is great because of all the experiences the students get while being on campus. Delaware Valley has many clubs and organizations that any student could join. I am planning on joining their 4-H club, FFA club, and hopefully become a sister of Sigma Alpha. Delaware Valley is known for their A-day where the public is welcomed into our campus to see all of the progress students have made over the year. During A-day all clubs and organizations are allowed to have tents to support their club and raise money. Another great experience that I got to be apart of was their Glow Rage dance. If you like loud music and paint then this was the dance to go to.  Our college allows students to interact with the animals on campus due to it being an agricultural college. There is so much more that I got to experience over my first semester at Delaware Valley University but there simply is not enough room."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone I have come into contact with was very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"As a commuter, I have sampled the food on orientation and during a transfer visit. It was very good."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the dorms are in great condition and they just built a new dorm on campus. The dorms are doubles, triples, quads, and even 6 person suites. Everyone relatively knows each other on their floor and we do activities together in the lounge almost every week."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of different places to go with all types of food. It s pretty good.
College Freshman,4,"Campus is not too strict, but the administration does not let you get away with dumb things. If they think there is a problem they will fix it."
College Freshman,4,It is great but I wish you could receive more money each year if you qualified for it.
College Freshman,4,"I would rather live on campus than off campus at least through my sophomore year because it's just so easy to live on campus. The campus is not very big so you can take a short walk to nearly everything. The rooms are not crazy small and can accommodate 2 people okay. I became friends very quickly with many people on my floor. If you don't have a car on campus, you may seem trapped at times because there is a limited number of things in walking distance."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are really willing to help you if you are willing to put in the work to do well in their class.
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms are not a bad size, depending on which hall you live in. I spent my freshman year in Ulman, which is the oldest existing residence hall and is strictly freshman. I absolutely loved it there, my hall mates were awesome and we always had a good time. Ulman ultimately had one of the nicest  lounges, but all the bathrooms were pretty outdated. Not only were the bathrooms outdated, but a couple of years prior the basement flooded so there is nothing down there; due to that fact Ulman does not have its own laundry and you have to go to the other halls to do your laundry (work and segal were the closest). Location wise it was probably the best because it is on the ""north"" side of campus which is by all the class buildings so the farthest you had to walk was maybe five minutes."
College Junior,4,The security is very friendly and does not make you feel threatened when they are just walking around. They know what their job is and when they need to do something they will.
Senior,2,I came here because it was supposed to be a wonderful school with a tons of hands on experience. I wish I had chosen a different school. Dorms are small and out of date and if you want air conditioning forget about it. Communal bathrooms.  The good thing about this campus is that doylestown is close and is amazing. The campus itself is not taken care of properly as far as any of the horticulture and maintenance aspects unless it is done by the students themselves.   Dining hall is ok nothing great and very limited options. Student life is alright the campus itself is very disconnected and without much energy.  The higher ups at the school do not know how to properly handle this campus nor do they care.  Class sizes are small and that is nice you get a lot of one on one experience but I got the same or greater level of teaching at my community college.   The pricing for this school is outrageous for what they provide you and for what education you get.
College Freshman,2,I am paying the same amount to live in the smallest oldest dorm on campus as some of the students living in new roomier dorms.
College Senior,2,"But good for studying and not too noisy, except in Goldman"
College Senior,2,Needs more diverse students in order to grow and get more students and programs
College Senior,2,Very little space and ResLife is very disorganized and hypocritical
College Senior,2,Disjointed between Greeks and AGR takes over everything and are very entitled. I am in AGR and I am trying to change that
College Freshman,2,I believe that there should be more lighting along with video cameras set up at the barn. I have thought this but most recently my friend got assaulted and think this should happen even more.
College Freshman,2,The room are too small and easily overcrowded. There is not enough space to fit the two and sometimes three people plus all their things into the dorm rooms. The cost is probably about average and the convenience of living on campus is definitely a plus. Everything is within easy walking distance from most dorm buildings. The worst part about living on campus is the food. It would be much better if a meal plan was optional instead of mandatory. We pay way too much money for really crappy food.
College Freshman,2,"There are two pizza places within walking distance of the college that don't deliver.  They are missing out on a lot of money, if you ask me.  Any other restaurants are at least a mile and a half away, and freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus.  They also do not deliver.  We can choose between the dining hall and Domino's Pizza unless we want to walk over a mile into town next to highways."
College Junior,2,"There is limited choice, and quality for what we pay."
College Junior,2,"There is transportation right into Doylestown and you can walk to the bars. They are pretty cool, but can be expensive. Drinking seems to be a popular past time. Parties can be found at people's apartments and houses off campus because it's pretty strict rules on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty much everyone here is a heterosexual right wing conservative with the particular biases that come along with that stereotype, which can be frustrating."
College Sophomore,2,"The pub food is pretty good, the dining hall food is decent at best. For the amount of money that students spend on a meal plan, it is ridiculous that our food is such low quality, and that the dining hall and pub hours are so ridiculous. Really, is it so ridiculous to ask that the dining hall be kept open until 7:00 on the weekends, and that it open before 11:00 on Sundays? And that the pub be open for more than just late night on the weekends as well."
College Freshman,2,I don't go to the parties but I hear all the time about how bad they are compared to other schools. Our school does try to plan activities on campus for us but they aren't all that fun except the dances sometimes. The homecoming blacklight dance and the halloween dance were fun but the futuristic dance definitely was not.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a serious parking issue at DVC. It is $80 for both semesters so it is not outrageous, but it still sucks. Security is assholes about parking and just about everything. "
College Junior,2,"There are a few lookers, but nothing too exciting."
College Freshman,2,"I received grants and scholarships but the cost is high, especially staying on campus so covering all of the cost was still a hassle."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are 3 main lots for parking (with one completed since I graduated and a few more scattered spaces), but the two largest are situated at opposite ends of the campus (with D lot being a good quarter mile walk through a wooded path to reach the campus proper).  This walk is pretty unpleasant if it is cold, raining/snowing or dark.  I wouldn't say the walk is unsafe, but the distance is undesirable.  The two more convenient lots are relatively small (good luck finding parking in the Centennial lot) and only convenient if you live on that side of campus (in the case of the admissions lot)."
College Freshman,2,There's basically the football guys and the ag boys and that's it.
College Freshman,2,The downtown area is nice but there is never anything going on.
Alum,1,"I graduated many years ago with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Ornamental Horticulture and it was the biggest mistake of my life. The professors were not favorable to the female students. Some of the professors refused to teach because they felt the students should already know the subject. Some of the programs were so out dated in equipment, samples and material and in teaching methods. The school is definitely overpriced, you don’t get what you paid. The majority of the student body was racist. The living conditions made life extremely stressful. The Environmental Design class required so many time consuming projects that student grades suffered in other classes. By the time I graduated from this misery I couldn’t find a good job only jobs as a laborer or gopher. The only good thing this degree did for me was landing a good career in other fields not related to horticulture. My advise is take your money elsewhere."
Junior,1,"Everything needs to change. They spend money on irrelevant things, the dorms are not good, it's not very diverse. There aren't many opportunities for people who are not agriculture majors. The food is pathetic, it's not very welcoming, and student athletes are treated unfair and in a way discriminated against. The classrooms are average, the parties aren't good. There is really one group on campus that really does anything for the students and its the black student union ironically."
College Senior,1,But I like it that way and makes it more safe
College Freshman,1,The food is hardly edible and easily makes people get sick.
College Sophomore,1,"Practically everyone goes home on the weekends, and most of the off campus parties get busted within 15 minutes. The dances are generally fun, but the DJ's at the past few haven't been great."
College Sophomore,1,"only sports team parties, people get drunk and can't handle it"
College Sophomore,1,"Because DelVal is SO small, Greek life is even smaller. I believe there are 3 sororities, 2 fraternities, and one co-ed fraternity."
College Sophomore,1,they stop people from getting into  a major they wanted by putting people in a program that will not help them at all.
College Sophomore,1,mostly white people and they get all the scholarships. most of the blacks up to $1200 dollars for year and we have to go for loans most of the time because we are charged so much
College Junior,1,"The night life is really non-existent. Unless you are a football-playing bro, or a PEK jerk you can't really do much. There are a few bars, but it doesn't help the under-21 crowd. The best option is Philadelphia but then even the SEPTA trains stop running early so you are trapped in Philly. Transportation is hard to find."
College Freshman,1,"There is no variety and the food we do have, sucks."
College Freshman,1,"There are areas where you can eat off campus, but they are mostly expensive places."
College Senior,1,"I mean, it's food....but its not exactly edible all the times.....there are only two options on campus that aren't always open.  Something needs to be done"
College Freshman,1,"Very weird. For example it's november, and it was 63 degres today! Yesterday it was 30! It rains all the time, and the weather is very inconsistant."
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman on campus you have to park in D-lot, which is a good 10 minuete walk from most classrooms, and dorms. It also costs $80 for a years pass, which you can only get if you have a job off campus, have a ailment in which you need your car, or have some other extenuating circumstance. Even if you live 5+ hours away, you are still not allowed a car. As a upperclassmen it gets much better."
College Freshman,1,"Even though this is a small school, there is next to no community atmosphere. Not even in the dorms, which are small, and lonely. There are next to no student activities going on during the weekends. Most students go home on the weekends, so students left behind get very bored. The town is not a college oriented town, the shops are expensive, and not worth the drive. Administration does not pay attention to, or help out, the students at all. Although campus life is awful the teachers and classes are actually amazing. The teachers really get to know their students, and they know their material."
College Sophomore,1,"Del Val Really Prepares You for Your Dreams – I go to Delaware Valley College and I am a Conservation and Wildlife Management major. This was what I was planning to do ever since I could be in school. The teachers will amaze you with their knowledge and you will be shocked with how much you can learn in so little time. My schedule consists of at least 17 credits because of how much I am obsessed in applying myself. Even though I do not have one, there are hundreds of other students who have on campus jobs that keep them busy aside from their workload. Along with all of these great characteristics, Del Val also has a huge variety of scholarships available. The only thing that I do not like with my dream school is the parking. Either you get there early enough to get one or you are walking all the way across campus."
College Freshman,1,"Dont Get Caught, Be Responsible – The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted!"
College Junior,1,Worst College Experience Ever – i think the title sums all of that up.  Too many cops not enough fun bars.  House parties are also awful.
College Sophomore,1,"there is no nightlife here, everyone goes home on the weekends"

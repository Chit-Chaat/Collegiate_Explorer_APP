Freshman,5,I joined the bridge program during the summer and I can honestly say I'm so happy I got to work so well with my teachers and mentors when it came down to my work. I can't wait to start college.

Alum,5,Overall Livingstone College is amazing because they give students who come from underprivileged backgrounds a chance at getting an education they may not have wanted for themselves until they began attending the school.
Senior,5,"I took a couple of summer classes online and was able to focus more mainly because my professors remained engaged. COVID-19 really shifted an entire learning atmosphere, which caused individuals to adapt quickly to their learning environment. Overall, everything that was needed in order to result in my success in my classes was provided, from notes, to study guides, to powerpoints to assessments and submissions."
Freshman,5,I haven’t taken any online classes but I can say livingstone is a very good school I love there program and I love everything about the school I would  highly recommend Living stone college
Sophomore,5,"Being that we started online class in such a small window i had to adjust to all the zoom meetings, all the assignments that had to be done, and studying so i can pass all my finals."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at livingstone was pretty cool, i made new friends and i was getting used to living on my own being that my parents live all the way in florida"
Alum,5,"Attending Livingstone College is rarely by choice but by chance. Many of my peers who are enrolled in our institution are granted the opportunity to have their education paid via academic or athletic scholarship, attended the Summer Bridge program, are a legacy of Blue Bear pride, or simply are here as the last option. All various reasons are not by choice but by chance. Livingstone chooses you!"
Freshman,5,I love everything about Livingstone. Starting with the staff and students. I participate in campus ministries and choir and man I really love it
Junior,5,"I have grown a lot academically. Coming into Livingstone in 2015, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my career after college. Being exposed to the different cultures of an HBCU and the different teaching techniques have shown that there is life after Livingstone."
Freshman,5,I like that Livingstone College offer students a second chance. They are open to help and build up any student who comes to Livingstone.
Freshman,5,I loved how welcoming the college was when i first arrived. There were so many smiling faces and I couldn't deny the fact that it almost felt like I was home with my family again. I got very acquainted with many and even though I haven't started college yet I'm very excited and looking forward to getting there and having a new experience with new people.
Sophomore,5,What I like about Livingstone College is everyone is family even though it is a small campus you just feel like family but i would like to see change is have more activities to do
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Livingstone College has been great ! The teachers are wonderful , they are very encouraging . The success center is a great resource to use in all areas."
Junior,5,Livingstone has been a good school for me considering I work so much better in a smaller class room setting.
Sophomore,5,It’s great school it’s has it flaws but I love it . This school teaches you more than academics but also life lessons which will get you a long way in life an I am very honored to be able to attend.
Sophomore,5,My overall experience with Livingstone has been an amazing experience. Everyday your greater with smiles and faces of not only peers who seek nothing but brighter futures but also by the professes and staff to bring the best out of you.
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at Livingstone College in pursuit of a Bachelors of Art degree in Mathematics. As my third year here, I have grown to love my HBCU. During my freshman year I was in such a hurry to transfer because I only went to class and then right to my room. I wasn’t getting the college experience by doing that. I had to adapt to the atmosphere and the culture here at Livingstone. So,I started by getting involved into extracurricular activities around campus and becoming socially involved with my class. College is truly what you make it therefore I decided to change my ways by stepping outside my comfort zone before I decided to transfer."
Senior,5,"I been going to Livingstone college for 4 years since 2014 I enrolled right after I graduated from Central High School. I choose this College because it has good opportunities for me. I love the professors, the dorm rooms, and what I love best is that every professor loves to help their students they don't want anyone to fail. I love the athlete coaches, the campus stay clean. The people here are so polite and well manner like myself, it's comfortable here. The campus us very secured very safe. My freshman year I started off slow but with the help of the professors and others I caught up and got back on track now I'm a senior this year and ready to graduate in December 2018.  I met some really nice students here, everyone is willing to help everybody, we study together, we practice together I mean you really feel welcome here."
Senior,5,Livingston is a well known community. Never had any problems with it and never had any complains about this environment. The education is really nice for I.T people and engineering I love this community.
Freshman,5,It’s a good and private helping college and it’s small. I recommend people to go there because it’s easy to get through and my experience there was okay not a lot of incidents just be careful what you do where you go and who you hang out with at the end of the day
Freshman,5,Livingstone College is an absolute great HBCU. I love it here. The environment here is great and also students. The classrooms are small and teachers are great here also. My experience so far here has been awesome and I will love to continue going to Livingstone. It's a small college but you will know your way around very quickly.
Junior,5,Livingstone College is a small private school. The class rooms are small and more personal. I love it that way! It gives me a chance for more help when needed. The professors will actually know you by your name and care for your success. There are great advisers that will help you get internships and jobs after college. The environment that Livingstone has is a small home/family feel.
Senior,5,"Livingstone College has been a great experience.  The staff is very involved with each student and makes sure you are getting what you need to be successful and graduate.  They also have a Night and Weekend College for those who need to work and go to school or if your a transfer.  Livingston's campus is very clean, well maintained,  and great to sit out in on beautiful days. Livingstone College has been a great HBCU experience!!"
Senior,5,"First, my experience at Livingstone  college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft as a result of my time in school, which I am truly thankful for. For example, the Writing Center at my school has taught me many writing tips and rules that I was unaware even existed, and would still be unaware of had it not been a part of my experience. Because of this, I realized I still had a lot to learn despite what I thought; but this allows me to improve my skills more as I continue to attend school and also gives me more confidence in my area. And as a result, I know one day this valuable experience will help me in my search for another one-a rewarding career. One that i would love to see a change here would have to be the cafe food and the service."
Junior,5,"Livingstone college is an awswome school its all about what you make it. If you like being in a small environment then this is the school for you. it's in a small town with not a lot of things to do. the best thing is that classes are fairly easy if you pay attention. They have a great college, Family Orientated ,Great academics also Great Teachers. Livingstone is all about a second chance in bettering your life.The ability to help young people further their education is bye far one of the best ability to take advantage on. I love my school LC.!"

College Senior,5,"Our basketball team won the CIAA Tournament two years in a row and was the runner up this year by 10pts. Our football has gotten better I can't wait to see what they do this upcoming season. Our Cheerleaders are pretty good as well but the band dancers are better in my opinion. Our band is one of the best in the country. Our track team, volleyball, and softball team is really good as well. The students always come out and support no matter what."
College Junior,5,I love living at the Livingstone College Hotel??
College Junior,5,Committing yourself into a sorority or faternity is the best college experience ever. You are having fun and giving back at the same time

College Sophomore,5,"My overall courses where difficult at first ,but o got introduced to the success center where you can get help with anything .The professor that I've had went out of his or her way to make sure I was going to pass the course"
College Sophomore,5,Livingstone always have a career day where we meet people in our fields and where we can possibly gain internships or meet mentors
College Sophomore,5,Our Greek life is very supportive of the Salisbury community
College Sophomore,5,"Our Basket ball ,tennis,golf ,track and football our all CIAA campions"
College Sophomore,5,"The athletics are really great at my school. Me being a part of the cheerleading team as people know us as the LC LaLas, we get a variety of support. People love us and they come to the football games, and basketball games and show us lots of love when we perform. During or after a performance, people come to and tell us how feat of a job we've done and how they can't wait to see us perform again."
College Sophomore,5,"I Love My HBCU , Livingstone might come off as dangerous and risky ,but Livingstone is magnificent. From the staff to the students everyone is like a big family . I also applude Livingstone  success center because they success center offers and extremely larger amount of help .Im glad I attend Livingstone college it's making me become a better adult"
College Freshman,5,"My school is the best because, they give students like me a second chance to be something in life. Graduating from high school my GPA was very low and i couldn't get accepted any where. Livingstone college gave me the chance to try to conquer my dreams and aspirations."
College Freshman,5,"I Love it. Its a hbcu. Its small, class are good size."

Sophomore,4,I liked how free everyone was there wasn’t anybody judging each other it was a care free campus. I would like to see more diversity and more activities on campus.
Senior,4,"My experience at Livingstone College was very unique and warming. As small as the city of Salisbury is, there is always a sense of family and unity. Livingstone College is what you make it and comes with unlimited learning experiences. You learn to appreciate the little things in life while witnessing the focus of black history, legacy, education, and success with various caring people."
Freshman,4,I like how it’s a little town but it’s a college campus I like how everyone knows each other and how everyone can get along with each other
Junior,4,I did have a de online classes due to the pandemic. Most of the classes I had were outlined with the event that were due until the semester was over. I had many Zoom meetings where teachers would make points about things that we read about.
Junior,4,just need a little more funding. when no other school let me in Livingstone College was there for me. Some people may look down on HBCU'S but this one is here to stay.
Sophomore,4,"So far everything has been pretty ok due to this being my second year. I like that it's a black community and how everyone interacts with one another. The money part is my biggest issue, my tuition is sky high I make good grades and my GPA is a 3.2 right now. I wish the school would award those with good grades scholarship's to help for school."
Sophomore,4,Livingstone College is a very interesting place. It has nice house in or outside the campus. The teachers and fellow students are all very good people. It has great food and activities. And even though it is a small town area there is a lot to see.
Niche User,4,I am an incoming transfer student attending Livingstone College for the fall 2019 semester. I plan to study social work and get involved in clubs.
Freshman,4,"High school freshman, entering Livingstone College fall of 2019. I am excited to have been accepted to Livingstone college. It's located in a small town in North Carolina. I will be relocating from Houston Texas to attend this college.  I will be studying criminal justice and I feel confident that Livingstone College will help me obtain my career path."
Freshman,4,Overall I am very pleased with my experience with Livingstone College.  Since becoming a student here I have improved my GPA drastically from a 2.4 to a 3.1.  I am very proud of my achievements here at Livingstone College.....
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Livingstone college is that it is a very small college, There is not a lot of students its a very small environment unlike many other colleges."
Sophomore,4,I love my HBCU!  it's a great experience going to a historical black college. It's different from most traditional colleges. Attending Livingstone for 2 years it's been great with what the school offer while there. I wish that the school gain more organization and a better system when it comes to students paper work.
Sophomore,4,Livingstone College is truly what you make it. You get the advantages when you apply yourself accordingly. I would like to see the school challenge incoming students academically more.
Junior,4,Livingstone College is a college where you have a chance to change your life. they have many ways to help you such as free tutoring and long office hours. The school is a small school so that means more one on one time with professors.
Freshman,4,"Second chances are a gift, not a hand-out. Livingstone College is the ultimate place to receive a second chance.Livingstone College is an important place that is leading me into a bright and successful future. My college experience at Livingstone College has led me to self-discovery, self-improvement and personal growth. My major is Education, and I have been taking courses that are designed for my major. My future career goal is to be an elementary school teacher.Here at Livingstone, they provide the students with the resources to be successful. The Reading and Writing Center helps students write and revise their papers. When I have writers block I go there and receive help. The classroom sizes are scant which allows the teacher to know the students. I enjoy having that because I can receive one on one help."
Niche User,4,"I will be attending Livingstone in the fall. I look forward to campus life and the course work. I plan on living on campus, joining clubs, and focus on school work."
Freshman,4,"I like that it is a smaller college with smaller classroom size. Therefore, more time with professor if needed. I feel that more activities, restaurant s are needed on campus."
Junior,4,Honestly when I first came I didn’t like it here. But then I came to realize it is what you make it. I got more involved in school. Got my name around in organizations. Now I’m actually somewhat sad I only have a ahead left after this. But I’m glad because Livingstone gave me my second chance for college and I’m grateful as ever.
Junior,4,I have had a great experience at Livingstone. All the staff are GREAT and helpful. I feel they go over and beyond to make sure their students are well taken care of
Freshman,4,"Very community based college,  lots of heritage and history. Small college allows me to know my administration/professors and not become a number. I'm going to enjoy the next four years."
Senior,4,"Livingstone College is a great school to attend. You actually get to have that one on one time with your professor. At most school you don't get that. I also liked the fact that you can easily network and get to know people outside of the school. Even though it was not a huge institution I still got alot out of it.  Also, something I would like to see change is the internet connection and the food they serve but besides that everything is great."
Junior,4,My experience at Livingstone College has been something I extremely appreciate. I learned to live with no regrets. My freshmen and sophomore year has taught me that procrastination is not a good idea. I feel like throughout the last two years I have matured very much on the behalf of Livingstone College. The staff is very nice and helpful when needed and I'm glad I picked this HBCU.
Junior,4,I personally was not overall thrilled about Livingstone but over the past couple years that I have been there I have made some really Good friends and had really nice Professors that want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"As a current student attending Livingstone College, I would like to see a greater return on my investment. Being a student here is not easy, the locals don't like the students and the surrounding area is very dangerous. But I am a student that will graduate from this institution. This HBCU was founded on the backs of born slaves freed seeking higher education and I'd be dishonoring my people if I wasn't taking advantage of every possible opportunity I can. The school isn't the best of the best but at least I've been given a chance to change my life and be the best I can be."
Sophomore,4,"Going to school at Livingstone is all that bad. It's really what you make your experience to be. I'm currently a sophomore and I honestly enjoy it. Lots of people and there's scarcely any drama. Everyone open to new opportunities. It really hard to fail any classes. The Success Center is always open for anyone to get help on work. Tutors are available for anyone struggling in any subject. Being at my HBCU brightens my day. I enjoy the activities, parties, administration, sports and definitely the modeling troupes on campus. The bond that I have with my mentor and his assistant is extremely strong and they open doors for me as well as other who keep up their appearance and grades on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Being at Livingstone for 6 weeks over the summer of 2015 and then being here as a freshman for the 2015-16 school year a lot has changed. I realized your experience is really based on your participation. The best part of being here is being able to see the differences in my classmates and seeing how much we've matured in one year. I like that on campus I can find help for anything even if its just for quarters to do laundry or if I'm struggling in a subject. Livingstone gives every student the opportunity to exceed greatness. On campus recently, there has been a lot of remodeling. The thing I wanted to change on campus was the pavilion. Now they have re-paved it and painted our Blue Bear onto it and paw prints in each corner. in a few weeks there will be benches and tables. Id also like to have more food opportunities. We have a Papa John's but its barely open. "
College Senior,4,Very nice people.  Greek life I'd bid on our campus.  Everyone roots for them.  They are very helpful  and carring people.
College Senior,4,My HBCU is an amazing institution who provides higher learning and second Chances to a lot of people. I am truly blessed to have found such a great HBCU.
College Senior,4,"Our Fraternities and Sororities includes everyone in everything they do. Like when it's hot out they do big cookouts with food and music it's always a lot of fun. When it's around homecoming you get to help them paint their plots, they hold fun activities and includes everyone. We have no Greek houses on or by campus. Some people don't really care about Greek life while others are really into it."
College Senior,4,We don't really have a lot of crazy things happening on campus. Once one crazy thing goes off the campus will be put on lockdown
College Senior,4,Livingstone College is a great school.
College Junior,4,Having a mind of your own & saying no when offered drugs or liquor is what will keep you above the influence
College Junior,4,I love going to Livingstone college! It is a nice size Historical Black college. The teachers put all there effort into making sure that the students are on task.
College Freshman,4,"The career center is great, for any time of help the success center is there. There is no reason you should be failing a class,because you have tutors in the success center for every class and subject. To know about few jobs and  internships that you will like to seek or learn more about the success center will tell you about it."
College Freshman,4,"I lived in Goler and for the most part it was OK. Every week or 2 we will have hall meetings, which was mostly about the bathrooms being filthy and etc... There was a lobby downstairs which was straight for the most part, they even have a room where to get your hair and nails done. They have a snack machine, but no drink machine.The best dorms for the females are Goler (all female dorm) and honors (co-ed, a 3.0 or higher GPA). The best dorm for the boys are Dancy. The hotel is usually for the culinary and hospitality students; the only thing about the hotel is the shuttle schedule."
College Freshman,4,"The Greeks sort of made Livingstone at lot more interesting and fun this year. They plan parties, cookout, had fun probates, and have fun activities for the students.They do not have any Greek housing, but they do have they own plots. Greeks aspires non- Greeks to be like them, because a lot of students look up to them and want to follow they footsteps. The Greeks  made Livingstone, besides the athletic teams."
College Freshman,4,our school is great they get along with everyone
College Freshman,4,"The schools Greek life at my school is huge thing. The Greeks give the school such a great name. It gives the school something else to brag about. They have a lot of activities the non Greeks can get into like cookouts, and especially the parties, their known for their parties out of everything. Currently there Is no Greek housing."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at my college at first was very up setting because I expected way more from the school as far as activities since it was suppose to make us want to stay and get comfortable with ur new surrounding. It got better when homecoming came around because of the none stop activities the school had planned. I believe what makes my school unique is our spirit and the fact that we support all our organizations and students no matter what. I would choose my school again only because it was some place that taught me to appreciate the small things like even being able to get into college.
College Freshman,4,well I'm in the Band so I would say that the sports at Livingstone College really opens the school a lot more.the fan support is very great we have a lot of fans that support are Varsity Sports and team players. if I could I will play too but I'm in the Band. are team players practice very hard we are the best in the ciaa because of hard dedication and teamwork of course.
College Senior,4,Professors are pretty good at what they do (most of them)
College Freshman,4,The student have a great career at Livingstone if they do what they are supposed to do and you will get what you came to school for a degree
College Freshman,4,how you react to livingstone all depends on who you are with and if you get involved the people who arent involved in anything dont like it here and want to leave
College Junior,4,some Greeks gives are basically examples others are only there for parties and to show off
College Junior,4,The athletics department is the main spirit of the school!
College Sophomore,4,"The student career services at the school are great. The individuals that work in that department make sure they find internships for you that are in your field of study. They make sure they find the right jobs, or when finding internships they make sure you get all the hours you need for graduation as well."
College Sophomore,4,Livingstone does offer good dorm rooms to those students with good gps however the regular dorm rooms are alright to.
College Sophomore,4,"It's great to live on campus . You are surrounded by all of your friends, and everything is right there and convenient when you need it to be. The dorms are good it's just the cleanliness for some of the dorms but other than that it's great."
College Senior,4,It's a school that's works with you in every way
Recent Alumnus,4,This school is what you make it if you want to be successful you will be.
College Freshman,4,I would choose my school again just to start over my college career. I would work harder on my major and practice on the notes I would take and keep up with my grades
College Freshman,4,"My school are strict on females entering the malls dorm, they are also strict on lock down"
College Freshman,4,The party scene are great. Security officers are always on site.
College Freshman,4,"The cafe always make multiple food options for the students to eat from. ""Fried Chicken Wednesday"" is the most packed day of the week"
College Freshman,4,The social atmosphere is amazing and the cost is a less on the expensive side for those who can not get enough financial aid. The dorms are well put and the clean. Janitors make for the dorms are clean after a days work.
College Freshman,4,Its another option to eat at
College Freshman,4,It is good to live on campus because you can just get up and go to class don't have to worry about getting on the buses in the morning
College Freshman,4,"The Greek students are very cool and down to earth, they don't treat any non-greeks differently."
College Junior,4,"I held a internship with cancer research. That opportunity gave me great success and learning how work in group activities, learning at a fast pace, and obtaining knowledge that will one day be beneficial to society and my self"
College Freshman,4,Took Forever But I Got It
Senior,2,"What I like about Livingstone College is that it’s a major difference from my last school. I am near my graduation date and my professors in my department absolutely care about my progress as a student. Not to mention, it’s always easy to find work on campus. The faculty and staff here are friendly. What I would love to see change is the organization of the school. Things are pretty out of order here. Also, a lot of us, as students, struggle financially. Livingstone really needs to stop trying to take even more money from us than what they already receive from us."
College Senior,2,"People can't have a good time without fighting,,"
College Junior,2,Barely any parties or clubs near by
College Freshman,2,"this will be my first year at Livingstone college and i be honest i don't like it as much as others do because of how they operate stuff. they are most of the time not organizes and late with everything they do. Some people here are nice kind of but, most of them are rude and disrespectful i cant stand going to school here. I prefer going to Johnson C. Smith University because i  experiences and witness how they operate things on there campus and it is impressive."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive much financial aid as i intended to . Since I am from Washington, attending a school that is 5-6 hours away, Washington DC did not distribute a lot of money. The school i attend also did not give me any money towards my tuition."
College Freshman,2,"I hate going through the financial aid process! I still didn't receive my money and i have an OUTSTANDING balance, almost $10'000 !"
College Freshman,2,"There is really no availability, and you have  to pay extremely too much just to live off of campus!"
College Sophomore,2,Don't really do anything around campus unless its founder's day or homecoming
College Sophomore,2,You normally have to pay more on your deposit just to move off campus
College Sophomore,2,Its normally not organized and you have to sit for hours just to get called up.
College Junior,2,People don't really take pride in Livingstone
College Sophomore,2,You eat it to survive
College Sophomore,2,"It is not easy to get an apartment off campus because most times, you need a job and a car or some sort of transportation."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a big option for parking. The student parking lot is not big enough for all the students to park in but the off campus parking is even smaller.
College Junior,2,Unless you have transportation you will be stuck
College Junior,2,There is no outside club life unless traveling to a different city.
College Freshman,2,"The City is very small, its racist and it has the most unsolved murders in the state of North Carolina, you can't get any worst than that"
College Freshman,2,The dorms are terrible they look like jail cells and our newest dorms look like an old motel 6.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not that bad but the apartments could be furnished better, walls could be painted, bathrooms need work. And also actually make sure that all the stoves work that's kinda the whole point of moving off campus."
College Sophomore,2,Some are very sweet and kind when others tend to judge and look for drama
College Junior,2,The living conditions at school could be a lot better for the amount of money we pay in tuition. The dorms could be a lot cleaner and their shouldn't be any reason why we run out of food in the cafeteria. Also this parent killed a roach under our table while we were eating that's terrible. Overall the campus looks nice on the outside and the classrooms are clean so i guess that's what matters the most because we are coming to get an education.
College Junior,2,The financial aid process is a little slow but I guess its ok.
College Junior,2,"Not always available (Student Driver), and the distance traveled is a one way to Walmart and back. Maybe to other locations but Walmart is the main attraction of where the student usually want to go to"
College Junior,2,"The dining options on campus are not the best, but it is edible. The meals distributed gets very routine. There is not much ""spark"" in cafeteria. You will always know what is being served before you arrive to eat. I honestly do not think it is worth what I pay, however I will give the College some credit of including new dishes and desserts."
College Freshman,2,The weather is unpredictable. The weather did not  affect my campus experience much.I gave the weather a grade C because one day it could be really hot and the next day it may be cold.
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough computers for students to use. It gets crowded in the labs. the printers tend to not work at times and the computers are slow.
College Junior,2,Its best to have your own computer while at Livingstone College. the labs get crowded in there is very limited space. The computers can be very it's best to go in the morning when you have a chance.
College Junior,2,Transportation for the parties are not successful for the students who do t have cars
Recent Alumnus,2,Livingstone is a christian based school. Any nightlife is created by the students as far as parties.
College Freshman,2,"The freshman dorms at Livingstone College aren't too bad, I just feel as though we are not getting what we are paying for, meaning the tuition is too expensive for us students to not have an more updated residence."
College Sophomore,2,We only have 1 shuttle bus and it comes every once in a while
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes they work sometimes they done...if u have your own it's better
College Senior,2,"There aren't really a lot of options. We have a party every blue moon. We have to make our own fun to have fun. We have fun doing it, but it would be nice if someone plans a spot and the music and the fun for us."
College Senior,2,"There aren't really enough ways to get from point A to point B, ESPECIALLY if you are an underclassmen. The shuttle doesn't run regularly, and when it does, there isn't enough room for everyone who needs to go places. The only time the shuttle is of good use, is for parties off campus. We could eally improve on transportation!"
College Sophomore,2,The school offers transportation but it is unpredictable to know when the school runs the shuttle for us every once in a while.Cause the school would select someone with license to drive the shuttle back and fourth to where we need to go in the city.Every now and then you most likely have to ask around or have your our transportation because Livingstone College transportation service is poor.
Recent Alumnus,2,Access to Alot – Living on campus is ok. Some dorms are not a good fit for people because the way they mess it up.
College Sophomore,2,As far as I know of they're really isn't many scholarships because so many people try so hard to get them and they're isn't that many to go around
College Sophomore,2,It depends on where you are on campus because we have really old buildings so the bathrooms are not as clean as normal. Our newer buildings have nicer bathrooms.
College Sophomore,2,The weather is rediculous. You never know when it is going to rain or when it is goin to be sunny or etc. Some days are really nice. Then other days are cloudy and depressing.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much to Do – Livingstone College is located in Salisbury, North Carolina. I have not really heard about many attractions or activities that take place in this area. The safety is somewhat questionable seeing that a few students have been robbed and had things stolen. I will say that the most positive activities that take place on this campus are those that pertain to athletics in which most people participate."
Freshman,1,Not worth the money.... Dirty Dorm rooms. Cafeteria meals are terrible.. Safety is an issue on Campus there seems to be no supervision especially during breaks.
Freshman,1,It was horrible and not safe at all I felt like i was sleeping in a prison and the food made me sick. I thought i would have a great first year college experience but it was a lie. I  had stressed more when I was there than when I was home. The food was even worse.
College Senior,1,"Our dorm rooms are extremely  terrible.  I pay over 24,000 to go here and I feel like I live in a dump."
College Sophomore,1,School is hard because the Tution is so much
College Sophomore,1,All their money for scholarships comes from the church which the students singlehandedly sponser
College Freshman,1,"I am currently having a problem with my financial aid at Livingstone. I am all the way from Washington DC and they didn't give me a lot of money for school. My mom is a single parent with two kids, a 18 years old and a 9month year old baby. We don't really don't have the money but we are really trying to get the balance paid off. I am applying to as many scholarships as I can but I have yet to get one I just hope and pray I get this scholarship"
College Freshman,1,Its honestly the worst because we barely have parties unless its homecoming week.
College Freshman,1,Everything is so far away from campus. You need a car on campus !!!!
College Sophomore,1,There's barely any parties on LC campus. There is normally nothing to do unless you're an athlete or in a troop
College Sophomore,1,The campus police are not very compromising. It effects the students in a way that you can't come to them if you need to.
College Sophomore,1,"There's not much in Salisbury, most of the attractions are downtown from the school. They have gangs surrounded the school. A lot of students don't have cars so they have to ride the shuttle if its not too full or either they walk. Walking by yourself is very dangerous. Local residents aren't friendly instead they look down on college students, which often sometimes robbed."
College Freshman,1,there is nothing but trouble at night
College Freshman,1,The school is not clean
College Junior,1,Its a private school so things go fast
College Freshman,1,Almost everyone on campus smokes or drinks on and off campus. The access to the drugs is way to easy everyone is trying to make money selling drugs at school.
College Freshman,1,The security and gang violence around the school is so bad the upperclassmen warn you not to walk off campus without being in a group. Also for the security they are so bad that there was a murder right in front of thier station and they couldn't identify the shooters.
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible, they served the same thing every day if not every week. I ate in the cafe maybe twice last semester."
College Junior,1,The shuttle bus at Livingstone College is not effective. Some days it comes and others days it don't.
College Sophomore,1,It's a struggle cause there's not a lot to do in the area. You have to go out of town.
College Junior,1,Maybe 5 out of total population is other than African American
College Junior,1,"The police force can be pretty strict. First-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted!"
College Freshman,1,"I give the food a D because, the food in the cafe on campus is not all that great in my opinion. There is not alot of variety and they serve the same foods all the time. There are good restaurants off campus."
College Junior,1,There are random check if they here there is drugs but other then that they don't look for it
College Junior,1,The boys dorms r not good at all but there boy. The other r ok u may find that u have no chair or things that match but hey its a place to sleep.
College Junior,1,Salisbury transportation is limited. You rarely see the bus or the shuttle. People are nice enough to give and offer rides though.
College Sophomore,1,"To Much Goes on – Every where you go there is either drinking or doing drugs. I mean most people don't do drugs but some people do them and when you have people that does it, they will not be hard to find."
College Junior,1,"We are very diverse, we have a lot of gay and lesbians, very few whites, hispanics, and we have nothing but african americans."
College Junior,1,We have constant use of Drugs and Drinking on the campus especially out in the open and in the dorms. Livingstone College is known for drug bust and drinking.
College Sophomore,1,i havent heard anythig about a scholarship and they dont help u look for any when your struggling
College Sophomore,1,Very poor there are not many for people who dont have 3.0 and above
College Freshman,1,if you are a football dont get your hopes up for having a good season because the football program isnt all that great. all the others sports are very good but limited
College Freshman,1,Guys Are Very Thugish – If you have a thing for guys who like to pretend to all gansta then Livingstone is the place to be.
College Freshman,1,"Locals can just walk onto campus without any problem, and sometimes start fights with the students. I sometimes don't feel safe events like that occur. There's NOTHING to do just because it's such a small town. 75% of the students leave this school on the weekend to got to Charlotte and I don't blame them."
College Sophomore,1,"the night life at the clubs or anything else at this school are very low compared to other good colleges this college excels in robbing, theft, and not having enough girls at the party"
College Sophomore,1,"the facilities are on the run down side, they usually tend to be dirty, out of date and most definetely out of whatever they need in the area like toilet paper and etc"
College Sophomore,1,"Livingstone college is The worst school when it comes to protection, security, or anything that has to do with academics. the teachers barely show up to class, you can go the whole course then find out that none of the stuff you went over had nothing to do with the class so basically this is the worst school ever"
College Junior,1,Permit Cost – we have to pay 35 dollars for a parking ticket which is fair but now the school is towing college students cars because we are only allowed to park in one parking lot but thats the furthers lot from the classrooms and dorms. they will give you a ticket which is not right because its already expensive to attdent this college. freshmans can not have a car
College Freshman,1,Need to Grow up – The students here act like high school students. Very childish. Some just looks like they just some to school just to come. They both in some guys and girls complain about the work the teachers give. Some just dont care. They want to argue and fight all the time over nothing. I dint think this is how college supose to be. I really want to transfer bad.U see the same groups of students hanging toghther.they wear anything to class. short skirts shorts ect. its horrible here
College Freshman,1,"The Students Committment – Our football team doesn't really show any committment to the program and the organization of the matter for as knowing when the tryouts or things of that nature are unknown. Like at this moment I have yet to see the basketball coach and I would really like to tryout for the team as a walk on, but I don't know when are workouts or anything so I'm just hoping I haven't missed anything."
College Freshman,1,The Atmosphere – The most the people here do is talk about each other. If you were to walk and make eye contact with someone and try to speak the students just walk right by you. There are some cases where the students talk back to you.

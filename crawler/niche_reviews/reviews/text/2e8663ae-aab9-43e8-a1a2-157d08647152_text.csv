Sophomore,5,"Really top of the notch art school. Everyone here definitely was the best at their school or in their city and it's very competitive, but not in a toxic way because nobody's really overcompensating for lack of talent. A lot of students here already have careers comparable to professionals or at least post-graduates; some have exhibited at national or international events, working at very elite companies, and a few even run businesses already. The food is also amazing? Culinary students from nearby work there and like... having access to a sushi/soup/salad/sandwich/grille bar and a wood-fired pizza oven makes coping with the long hard hours a little less harsh. Not a lot to do in Providence so you really have no choice but to focus on work. Don't come here if you aren't 100% serious about art and dedicated to it or you'll struggle, but if you live and breathe art you'll fit right in and find the pace and workload inspiring."
Sophomore,5,"Rhode Island School of Design is very good for design majors. As a person studying Fine Arts, I felt that we were not as fully supported and funded compared to the design/architecture department. Though there aren't as many students majoring in fine arts disciplines, proper funding would have been helpful. A positive to the school was being able to take a few classes from Brown University, though it is very difficult to schedule the classes as RISD studios are so long."
Niche User,5,"I am apart of the Project Open Door program that helps high school students with art school prep, I love it and I've learned so much!"
Freshman,5,"RISD has an extremely busy schedule, mostly during your first (foundation) year. It's very challenging, but very possible if you're committed. Just don't expect to be goofing around too much or getting a lot of free time. With good time management you'll have fun and enough time to pursue things outside of school, but it's not a given. The attendance policy is extremely strict, so don't plan on being able to skip class, even for medical reasons. Speaking of medical reasons, Health Services is pretty bad. Overall though, if art is the thing for you, this is the place to be, and you will learn a lot."
Alum,5,"Top of class. Unique experience in a small college town. This school is comparable to going to Ivy League for academics, but for visual art. Highly recommend it. Excellent in many ways. I just wish NYC was a bit closer for weekends."
Niche User,5,The partnership with Brown is extraordinary and the campus is beautiful. I love an art college that balances visual and performing arts with academics!
Alum,5,"Excellent environment to grow artistically. Programs are rigorous and quite demanding on your time and skill levels. School is more for students who are brainy and critical thinkers so if you are just trying to build technical skills, this school is not for you. You'll run into best of the best many times over so it challenges you to be better! Campus life is so much fun and quite unique."
Sophomore,5,"RISD is an art school; your college experience here will not be like in the movies. The professors will saddle you with what feels like to much work, but it will be satisfying and enriching work, plus you'll be miserable with all of your friends. Dorms and dining are excellent, which they should be, considering the price tag. I'm a transfer student, and from the stories I've heard, the freshman foundation year is much more taxing than the six week summer foundations program required for most transfer students."
Niche User,5,"I attended RISD for a six-week pre-college program. In all honesty, it was one of the best six weeks of my life."
Sophomore,5,"The Rhode Island School of Design manifests a utopian ideal full of opportunity and innovation, I could not imagine a better place to study."
College Senior,5,"Many parties on weekends, some themed.  Just don't get too caught up in the party scene."
College Senior,5,"Great art classes, actually the best anywhere.  Extremely challenging academic classes, brilliant professors.  Registration process is stressful, classes fill up quickly, especially during Wintersession."
College Sophomore,5,RISD has a great alumni network and its reputation leaves me confident I will be able to get a job when I graduate.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school because it's a place where everyone is 100% dedicated to what they're doing.
College Junior,5,Professors are very open to student concepts and helpful.
College Junior,5,I feel a degree from RISD in the arts/design world is the best.
College Junior,5,"RISD is extremely open-minded and free thinking.  Students are encouraged to be accepting of everyone, and  encourages new ways of thinking and viewing the world. Students are encouraged to explore their art medium, as well as others.  RISD encourages students to problem solve and ""think out of the box."""
College Freshman,5,"I have had fantastic professors who pushed me to improve my skills. The city is great, and there is a lot of activity going on as there are several universities located in the area. The friends I have made are fantastic as well; they come from all over the world, and have given me lots of new insights and perspectives. Since it is an art school, it isn't exactly the classic ""college experience"" -- there have been many late nights working on projects in the studio, although this is where I've bonded the most with other classmates who were staying up with me. The cafeteria food is tasty most of the time as well, although there are plenty of other dining options too. Overall, I am very satisfied with my college experience, and hope it will only improve as the years unfold."
College Junior,5,"It was my dream school. I'm learning a lot, meeting awesome people, friends, professors. It's been great."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, the experience completely depends on how you decide to see your experience. Yes, the work load is massive and you will be sleep-deprived, but I promise it will all be worth it. If it's not, you're not at the right school for you. The foundation year is very necessary to expand your definition of art and creativity of your concepts. Parties are alright depending on which ones you find yourself in. I would without-a-doubt choose RISD if I could do it all over again."
College Freshman,5,"Education is the most important factor in student's life. I always try to fully enjoy the education whenever and wherever I go. Also, fortunately, I entered the college I always wished and dreamed, so my happiness in education would increase more."
College Sophomore,5,Financial Aid is generous and the process is easy to understand.  They always return calls if you have questions.
College Sophomore,5,"As far as culture and arts, Providence is one of the best cities. There are many museums, galleries and art shows available. Providence is a college town, so students are welcomed."
College Sophomore,5,The dining hall is newly remodeled and looks great. The food is excellent and visually appealing.
College Senior,5,Continuing Education and Certificate Programs are easy to sign up for and require no application
College Senior,5,"Fast paced and results oriented for people looking for valuable skills, fast."
College Senior,5,Lots of choices in Providence. Something for everyone
College Senior,5,The administration is helpful and nice. Always willing to help
College Sophomore,5,"A great freshman ""hill house"" is Pardon Miller....very close to the Met (the cafeteria).  The social atmosphere is good, as most houses and dorms are closeby, and close to classrooms and workrooms. Housing process is a bit stressful, but that seems to be the case on all college campuses."
College Sophomore,5,RISD promotes diversity of various things mentioned above; RISD often hold events for students with these diversities.
College Sophomore,5,Providence is a great little city and is known to be a food town.
College Sophomore,5,"We have great facilities, although they may not be the newest and most up to date but I am very grateful to have access to them."
College Sophomore,5,I love the resources that I have access to at RISD; they give you a lot of freedom to explore the fields that you have interest in.
College Sophomore,5,I love the environment and how close we are to Brown. There are many local events such as Waterfire that are always fun to attend.
College Sophomore,5,I have not started my major yet but during Freshman year at RISD I tell myself how lucky and fortunate I am to be at such a resourceful and competitive environment. We are ranked the number one design school in the world so I have confidence that I will prosper educationally at RISD.
College Freshman,5,"Great liberal arts curriculum.  The professors are challenging, knowledgeable and interesting."
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of amazing restaurants and arts/cultural venues.  This includes bookstores, performing arts centers, music venues, museums and an assortment of interesting/artsy shops."
College Sophomore,5,You can ride the bus free for RISD students or catch the shuttle bus which is also free.
College Sophomore,5,The housing at 15 west is the best and I love being able to be their and make new friends. 
College Sophomore,5,"The best choice I made so far, the school will push you to become great at your profession and everything is well organized and planned out well. The teachers want you to succeed and you will have a bad critique. So you have to be tuff but also take in the advice from your teacher and your colleagues and you will grow a lot. I know I did, and it's only been my first semester."
College Sophomore,5,"I haven't gone to any clubs, but the nightlife is really what you make it."
College Sophomore,5,"They are so good and so tuff at the same time. The work never goes away, but if you have a strong work ethic and like to be pushed really hard, you should apply to this school."
College Sophomore,5,"They have a lot of Majors, so it depends on what your going for. Freshmen's get to do projects that relates to the majors here so by the end of their freshmen year, they'll know what major to take. All the majors are tuff, but the easiest will be Illustration."
College Sophomore,5,"Most people are very friendly on the streets. I feel so comfortable living in Providence, there's a lot of things to do. Since you'll be a RISD student, there wouldn't be enough time but the weekends I seen a lot of people go to Boston or Newyork during the weekend."
College Sophomore,5,"It was easy, nothing hard about it. :)"
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is welcoming of who you are and your sexual orientation. A lot of people come from different parts of the world, but as long as you have talent; the people will like you here no matter of your color, creed, or religion."

College Junior,5,"RISD is the top art school in the country. The professors are top rate, the classes are incredible and the other students are a gift to work alongside. Popular majors include architecture, graphic design, and illustration."
College Junior,5,There is a light scene on the campus. Students are too busy to take part in  such activities.
College Junior,5,The campus atmosphere is a busy one. Students don't have much time to go to local activities but cultural events on campus and programming offer many opportunities.
College Junior,5,They gave out more money this year then they actually should have which shows me that they really try their hardest to make their school affordable to everyone.
College Junior,5,"The financial aid process can be daunting, but I recommend getting started on it early. Apply for FASFA as soon as it becomes available. Meet with the folks at your school who are in the financial aid department or who are counselors who can assist you with financial decisions. Talk about loans and grants frankly. Also helpful is making top tier grades to ensure that you gain valuable scholarships along the way. This helps defray the cost of school enormously. My best advice is to advocate strongly at all times and to ask questions."
College Junior,5,"Providence is the perfect college town, there are plenty of places to get good food, and unlimited student bus access throughout the state of RI transports us to beaches, shopping centers, and the Zoo in Bristol (not like i have time for those things, that is) Providence is not so exciting that it distracts from my work, so I can focus on my studies. The Brown University Library and Providence Atheneum are wonderful if you are looking for a quiet place to work."
Sophomore,4,"I think all schools are struggling with online learning, but I do have most of my studio classes in person when necessary so really this semester is not super different from normal except the unnecessary in-person liberals are just now online."
Sophomore,4,The amount of growth I've seen in myself and my work as an artist is amazing. At RISD they really work you to the bone and it shows results. On the less amazing side is their lack of diversity and aid financially.
Sophomore,4,"I love RISD! Very good art and design school. It has given me tools to enter the professional world that have helped me succeed in my classes. Very welcoming environment, students and faculty."
Sophomore,4,"It was a good experience overall. The professors manage to accommodate all of the content in a reasonable way given the extreme circumstances. Overall not the best scenario or way of receiving my education, but it worked as fluently as it possibly could have."
Freshman,4,The first semester is hard if you are not mentally prepared. It's a lot of work but being surrounded by fellow peers is good. My only fault with the school is that my advisor is a first-year professor so I am at a disadvantage with advice and resources.
Alum,4,A rigorous and challenging college experience. I made friendships and professional connections that will last a lifetime.
Freshman,4,"Our school is currently under renovation in multiple departments/dorms. However, this does require a lot of investments and limitations in the use of the school facilities."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the faculty and their attentiveness to our needs. However, students continue to pay to print their work and written essays. Rhode Island School of Design is an excellent school but it should not cost 66k to attend."
Senior,4,"I think RISD gives you a very good technical foundation for the major you decide. I appreciate how rigorous the experience is and how they've taught me to think about my work. However, I think there should be more consideration and care for students inner emotional lives which can often be looked over by the institution."
Freshman,4,"Even though I am an incoming freshman, the prestigious record this school has is enough for any aspiring creative to want to go there. I had already met so many other students with the same passions as me that I am excited to make connections with. The only downside is it is extremely expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Everything is a little disorganized and eccentric but I suppose that's to be expected from a school for and by artists.  There are over 7 separate websites you need to know about but once you do they're nicely separated, the campus is spread out all over the city so its got a lot of walking around a hill but it does have beautiful old buildings and outside shops and events aren't far, classes are long but we need that for time to make the art. So, its not for everyone but I guess it's pretty good."
Graduate Student,4,"My department is disorganized and inefficient. Professors run late to class, they don't always have a clear course plan for the semester, the week, or the day. Having expressed complaints to department heads nothing changed. It is a terribly run department and it is a shame I am paying so much to attend this program for a master's degree."
Junior,4,"I have found that one's experience of RISD is highly dependent upon what department you are entering. Despite it being referred to generally as a visual arts college, there is an incredible about of difference in the artistic disciplines taught and therefore it is only natural that some are excelling and some are struggling. I highly suggest any prospective students seriously consider exactly what disciplines they are interested in and do research on those particular departments a RISD. Also, the freshman year experience, though marketed as the same experience for all incoming students is incredibly different depending on the professors you get."
Freshman,4,"As a Freshman at RISD, my perspective of RISD as a whole is limited. However, from what I've experienced, it's been overwhelmingly positive. The professors here are all skilled in a different areas, which makes Foundation year a very broad and interdisciplinary year. Indeed, students who want to focus on only one area of study find it tedious, but I found it very eye-opening. After all, I got the chance to work with mediums from paint to wood, which I've never touched. One truly exemplary part of RISD is the dining: they're very open to all types of eaters, and are open to change. If the food doesn't cover a wide enough spectrum, then there are methods of contacting the MET in order to change that. The MET staff are very kind and friendly, always open to conversation."
Freshman,4,Everyone is very kind to one another. The school provides many things to help students through the academic year.
Niche User,4,"RISD is known by many around the world as one of the top visual arts colleges. Its academics and studio arts professors are incredibly intelligent and skilled people. They carry the RISD name with pride and deliver a great educational experience to the students.
With it being an internationally famous school, there is a great level of diversity among students. The Asian community is large at RISD, but there are a number of students from all over the world.
The courses at RISD are rigorous, particularly in Freshman year. Student stress level is very high, and many students fail to take proper care of their health such as sleeping and eating adequately. 
For a very driven individual who can handle a large workload and has the proper support to keep on top of self care, RISD can be an incredibly rewarding school experience."
Senior,4,"At RISD you are surrounded my talented, driven artists. Select your professors well, otherwise you may not learn anything. Art schools in general are pretty self-driven. You can either simply finish the assignments, or really put your heart into them to learn the most. RISD focuses more expanding your imagination and thinking of the impossible than refining and improving any technical skills."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing school, great departments, teachers and students. There are so many people who want to watch and help you succeed as an artist which really creates a wonderful environment for growth and stimulation of ideas."
College Junior,4,School help you to get job/internship when you actually go to the meetings for it.
College Junior,4,Overall very nice but registration process for everything (class & housing) is bad.
College Junior,4,no campus crime. safe in campus.
College Junior,4,Professors are overall engaging and they care about student's success. Also they are very brilliant and passionate about what they are teaching. However classes fill up so quickly that the registration process become very frustrating.
College Senior,4,"Many house parties from mid-week to the weekend.  Pretty open invitation to anyone. Great clubs/ bars within walking distance....East Side, Downcity, Fed Hill."
College Sophomore,4,My school is unique because it challenges its students more than most design schools and pushes you to think about art and design in new ways.
College Sophomore,4,"Despite everyone who says that the arts are unemployable, lots of grads get their dream jobs."
College Sophomore,4,This is a wonderful school with a wonderful community.
College Sophomore,4,The experience at RISD is like no other. It is amazing to be surrounded by so many talented and creative people. Who also are very driven and pursue what they are interested in.
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is clean and close to class buildings.  There are plenty of dormitories and houses in the area of the Met (cafeteria), library and studios.   Public safety responds to emergencies or calls very quickly, as their office is situated near the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"It's not a bad part of the city, so I hardly ever feel unsafe. That said, I almost never feel unsafe no matter what so it could be me. I think campus is pretty safe, though."
College Senior,4,"Overall, its safe. Occasionally, Providence feels unsafe."
College Junior,4,I like my school academically but I am not as happy socially.
College Freshman,4,Risd's The Met is one of the best food catering halls around. That said.. eating there everyday for three meals does get tiresome and you will eventually become bored of the food and of the taste. Make the best of what you have.
College Sophomore,4,"It's great, but not overwhelming. House parties are the best."
College Junior,4,Theres a ton of options and cheap great places to eat
College Junior,4,Most of the 'trouble' happened in the dorms so it really depends if you get a horrible RA or a Great one.
College Junior,4,Its got a lot of options and usually everything is open pretty late.
College Junior,4,Most dorms are air-conditioned and all different types of living situations are available. most rooms are fairly big and have good lighting.
College Freshman,4,The process is pretty average. Only wished that off-campus housing was open to Sophomores.
College Freshman,4,If you're aware what's going on around you and you're being respectful you shouldn't have a problem.
College Freshman,4,A huge advantage is that you can ask the cooks to make something to your liking.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great. There is definitely a lot of advantages like convenience in relation to classes and dining, friends are always near by, and there is a good amount of freedom."
College Freshman,4,"Parties are generally limited to non-existent for freshman. However, for sophmores and above, parties can be regularly found."
College Freshman,4,"Providence as a city has great food. However, there are not many open spots late at night."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't have much free time, but when I do, I like going to India Point and walking up and down Wickenden Street. Federal Hill is nice too, and so is Thayer Street."
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity is omnipresent at RISD, you will have friends from all around the globe."
College Sophomore,4,There two main dining halls and a few small cafes where you can get sandwiches.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of diversity at RISD, in terms of nationality, interests and style."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of restaurants on Thayer street, where most students go."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though Providence is a city like any other city with crimes, you will feel safe at RISD."
College Sophomore,4,I have not done an internship yet but I feel like it is very easy to get one with the help of the career center.
College Sophomore,4,"The first year is very intense, you will pull all-nighters but it's worth it and you still have free time."
College Sophomore,4,"Even if Providence is a tiny city, it has a lot of charm and feels like home to me."
College Sophomore,4,For Industrial Design the facilities are good and teachers are professionals in their field.
College Sophomore,4,"Even if the workload is at first scary, you will be able to manage your time as you go."
College Sophomore,4,RISD has every year career fairs and has a helpful career center.
College Sophomore,4,The number of student in classes are reasonable which allows good participation and better understanding.
College Sophomore,4,It is very important to have a good portfolio. Make sure the two take-home tests are well rendered.
College Sophomore,4,We are an art school and we do not have that many sports teams. Most teams are unofficial although we do participate in races and competitions. We have a great gym with new equipments and facilities that all students have access to.
College Freshman,4,"Many clubs downcity to choose from. RISD, Brown and JWU all provide transportation."
College Junior,4,The workload is quite a lot. Expect to work hard when you get into the school. RISD cares about student internship/job opportunities. 
Freshman,2,"The school is obviously well funded and well-staffed, but the students are severely overworked, especially the freshmen. Students are expected to attend 8-10 hour classes three times a week, with two-hour liberal classes, alongside a one hour lecture. This naturally makes all those angsty teenagers more grouchy and stressed out. It doesn't help that Providence is so small and it almost suffocates anyone in it; there's no way to ""escape"" RISD because the city revolves around the two anchor schools (Brown and RISD). The student body is also so small; gossip spreads around fast.
The academics, however, are stellar. Professors may be harsh, but they certainly do teach. Although I will say, a lot of the students don't quite have the ""skill"" for an ""elite"" art school like RISD, particularly the international students. Unfortunately, RISD seems to accept plenty of people who are extremely rich and able to fund the school fully, and not enough people who genuinely are talented."
Alum,2,"Great school, if you're rich. That's the size of it.

Don't get  me wrong -- the facilities, dorms, and city are all great. What I found most valuable was working with and learning from my peers. 

I graduated in 2013 and I have a whopping $173,000 in debt. 

At this price, they should have ONLY the best, most invested faculty, financial planning courses, and RIGOROUS one on one career coaching -- basically, for $200k +, they should hand you a career on a silver platter. I am lucky enough to have found a job in my field (Industrial Design) right out of school. I started at 40k, and I now make 75k. I also have to work a second bartending job and do freelance work to make the payments. 

I have no regrets, but would warn anyone that without rich parents or a full or half priced ride from the school (extremely low chances), you will be limiting yourself to a life of financial burden and worry. Not worth it."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics isn't focused on by students or faculty. They are just for people who want to play them for fun.
College Junior,2,"It's an art school.  Sports are not very important.  There's a cycling team, a basketball team, etc....  Students go to the games but it's not a big part of campus life."
College Freshman,2,"There is a fair amount of diversity in terms of sexual orientation, but there are probably like 80 students of color in total. Most people are wealthy, white, and liberal. There is definitely a diversity problem, but luckily not too much overt racism."
College Freshman,2,"RISD is an art school so I don't even consider this inadequacy to be a complaint. Especially because RISD students are allowed to use any of Brown's facilities and to join any of its teams, which are more than adequate."
College Senior,2,I don't know of any sports teams
College Freshman,2,"Athletics exist at RISD but are not an integral part of the school. For example, the basketball team practices once a week."
College Senior,2,There aren't really scholarships available for continuing education students- and they are needed!
College Sophomore,2,International student do no get any financial aid or scholarship.
College Sophomore,2,SO COLD!!!! Bring a everything to keep you warm.
College Junior,2,"MOst parking on campus is permit only. To be lucky enough to nab a free spot you must be up early in the morning. Rhode Island is particularly gifted at ticketing so fines are frequent for those who dare to test. Generally speaking there is no need for a car while on campus, but should you need anything in the neighboring area a car is a must as the mass transit is more attune to a zombie take-over."
College Freshman,2,"it's pretty cold most of the year, there was also a lot of ice this winter.  Also, college hill, a main road at RISD, does not make icy conditions fun."
College Junior,2,"There are no varsity sports at RISD. We have our own gym which is not very substantial. We do however, have access to all the sports facilities at Brown University which includes a gym and a heated pool. There are also free Yoga classes which some students go for. All in all though athletics are not very big in RISD."
College Sophomore,2,The majority of the parking is metered and you can't leave your car overnight.
College Student,2,"Never Do a Rain Dance. You will be carrying 50 lbs of supplies with you most places. Plus hat ever masterpiece you spent all night on in the work room. And the school is on a mt. everest like hill. This ""hill"" is hell in the rain. your work gets wet, you get wet,your supplies weigh you down so everything gets wetter. god forbid it is winter and that rain freezes. if this happens you are better off scootching down on your butt all the way to class, melting the ice with your own tears."
College Freshman,2,"Well It Is the Northeast – It is cold throughout most of the school year causing it to snow. Once the weather turns nice, everyone hangs out outside."
College Sophomore,2,"A Joke, but a Really Funny One. Nobody at RISD really has time for a full fledged division type of athletic system. They are for the most part treated as inter-murals. Teams often play other top tier art schools in the northeast such as MassArt, Pratt Institute, Cooper Union and SVA. These games usually involve heavy but humorous taunting as RISD loves to basque in their position as the definitive #1 art school in the country. The unofficial mascot (official to students) is Scrotie the giant penis, a large and anatomically detailed penis crafted by apparel and industrial design students. He is seen as a reminder that RISD takes athletics pretty lightly."
College Junior,2,"Received Very Little Help – Although tuition is 35,000+ room and board, the school offered very little financial aid and is known to provide a very small amount of scholarships.  I suggest looking online for scholarships/loans/grants to fund your education at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"Often Unpredictable – New England is known for its unpredictable weather and you can go to class on a bright sunny day then at the end of class have to lug a portfolio through 4 inches of snow that is still coming down hard. Personally, I enjoy such diverse weather, but many can find it off-putting."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at RISD
College Junior,1,"If you are a city person, and you cannot live without enjoying your city life, do not come to Providence. "
College Sophomore,1,Uncountable amount of people smoking marijuana here. You can smell it anywhere and everywhere in the city at random points in time. Your roommate will smoke. Your dorm mate will smoke. Your suite mate will smoke. So just be aware to notify the proper people so you do not get in trouble. It's a very sticky situation because people look down upon those who don't drink and do drugs.
College Sophomore,1,"This is a tough school to be at. If you're a happy person try to stay happy. The atmosphere here is very depressing, most kids here are equally self-conscious and narcissistic while being self-righteous. Just be careful. It's a great school but remember it is the north east. It does get dark at 4:30 in the winter. Everyone around you is pessimistic. Try to find a good group of happy people and stick to them."
College Sophomore,1,"The facilities, especially public safety, health services, and the ""wellness"" center for counseling are atrocious. The ""wellness center"" should not be visited under any circumstances, there is only one counselor with no medical training, or MD or NP license. He is an asshole and does not deserve his position. This peon is not there to help you if you need it. The dean, on the other hand, is a pathological liar - do not get involved with these people ever (good student or not).

Health Services are slightly better, but not by much. Regular health services at least are nice people, but not very helpful if you're actually sick or something's wrong. But with the courseload just try not to get sick. 

Public safety is ok I guess, but after what was done to me I am terrified - if this is how this school treats it's better students. 

Also, just a general piece of advice with Providence: most of the pipes in the buildings are old, so the water in the area has a lead problem - get a Britta filter for your dorm, buy gallon water from CVS, or use the campus water filters instead of drinking tap water. When walking back home or to studio at night, group up always, Providence seems like a much safer place than it is. 

I just don't feel safe at a school run by people like this. "
College Sophomore,1,"What athletics? Supposedly we have a basketball and cycling team, but you never hear anything about them."
College Sophomore,1,I am currently bankrupting my family. Financial aid is far too hard to get.
College Freshman,1,"If financial aid is very important in your college decision, then RISD is not the type of school you'll feel very happy about going to. Even though it has a very high reputation, RISD lacks the ability to help its students financially. Not a lot of money is given in scholarships, and not a lot of students get scholarships. It is incredible that a college with such a high reputation does not have enough funds to provide scholarships to talented students who they lose every year because they have to choose between a great education or $200,000's worth of student loans."
College Senior,1,This Question Is Not Helpful – Stick to caffeine else you should not go here. Drugs are just too much
College Senior,1,"RISD has a few informal sports teams. The school also has a very interesting Mascot. However, RISD students are allowed to participate in Brown University sports and recreational activities"

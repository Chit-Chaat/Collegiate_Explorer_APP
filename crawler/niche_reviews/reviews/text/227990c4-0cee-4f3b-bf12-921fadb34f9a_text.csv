Freshman,5,Unity college is extremely accommodating. I have had nothing but a good experience with everyone involved at the school.
Alum,5,"I loved the small classes and one on one time with my professors! You get out of Unity College what you put into it. If you put little effort into your education, then you will not get much out of it."
Senior,5,Unity College is a hands on learning college where I am studying Wildlife and Fisheries Management. The college has a very good teacher to student ratio and the teachers are very helpful. The biology teachers are also many of them field biologists themselves and are excellent at helping you learn field techniques and connecting them to the theories and calculations that you learn. Unity College is an excellent college and the staff there work for you.
Sophomore,5,Here at Unity I feel like I am at home. Except for the home cooked meals of course. The problem with Unity food is that they are trying to please the vegans and vegetarians while the meat eaters suffer.
Niche User,5,The students and staff are very kind and welcoming. I instantly felt at home when I stepped on campus.
Freshman,5,"Unity College is a very small school located in Maine. Small, but dedicated, the Unity staff makes a tremendous effort to give you the best education for your field that they possibly can. The campus food is some of the best in the nation. Unity is always finding new ways to give back to the environment. Unity focuses on their student's future careers."
Freshman,5,I love Unity College. The atmosphere is family like and you will end up close with your teachers. It's easy to make friends and everyone is friendly and knowledgeable.
Freshman,5,"Love this campus so much! It's so beautiful being set in the backwoods of Maine. Very quiet and serene. While not a lot of diversity, the students and staff come together with all sorts of awesome activities, which really helps since there isn't much to do in the surrounding area unless you eat, sleep, breathe the outdoorsy lifestyle."
Freshman,5,"I love coming to Unity because it was one of the one schools that offer my major (conservation law enforcement). The school is very eco-conscious, and all the teachers and students are on a first name basis! Unity is a small school, and that allows for more one on one with students and professors. Class sizes are really small so you're getting more of an education for your money. The only thing I would change is the fact that the administration was not honest about the crime rate on campus. Although its small (1 in a whole year) I was told there was none."
Freshman,5,"WhIle I have only attended Unity College for less than a semester, my overall experience here has been great so far. What I found as a student at Unity was that every single student matters. All the friendly staff and adventurous students will all give you a warm and welcoming experience. The professors learn you by name, the students treat each other with respect. It's already been an amazing experience to start college at Unity."
College Sophomore,5,"Curriculum is well thought out, course offerings are awesome and very diverse, and most professors are amazing and very helpful. Find myself being treated more like a person and a young professional rather than as a student which is great."
College Student,5,"Fields are nice,athletes are nice, sports are nice."
College Student,5,"Best college, best place,best people,best food, best professors."
College Sophomore,5,"A degree from this school is worth everything you put into it. Unity college is recognized by a many organizations and employers across the country and a degree from this school is often highly respected. Many students can begin in a career relevant job as soon as they graduate, and most students don't typically have issues with finding a relevant internship during their time at the college."
College Sophomore,5,"The residence halls are great, and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL. They do their best to make sure the halls are effecient, comfortable for the students, and the new halls are incredible."
College Sophomore,5,"Unity is full of colorful people, has numerous interesting courses to choose from, and is devoted to the standards set for its students and itself."
College Sophomore,5,"We are an environmental school where everyone cares for nature like me. Our curriculum is very rigorous and guided towards our major. The people are so kind and I wouldn't change my mind about going there for anything in the world! We go out camping on the weekends and track animals for our labs. I've already made lifelong friends and I can't imagine myself anywhere else but Maine. It's a community, not just a school."
College Freshman,5,"The administration at unity are all like minded individuals with similar goals, allowing Unity's infrastructure to move fluently."
College Freshman,5,The only school to provide my interesting major.
College Freshman,5,There has been no incidents of sexual abuse.
Alum,4,"I loved Unity College. When I was attending we not only read about topics, but physically put them into practice. I have had the opportunity to go bear denning, electrofishing, and learn how to age bear and deer by their teeth. There was a lot of hands on experience and the opportunity to work along side some very respectable and well known researchers in the state of Maine, including those directly involved with the Maine bear study. The classes captivate you and keep you interested. The small campus was great for making long lasting connections."
Freshman,4,"A unique school with a diverse cast of students and faculty. Although there are flaws some overpowering others, there are many positive features of the school. Being one of the leading environmental schools, Unity supports many diverse classes and majors within the field as well as many minors and electives that involve environmental thinking. That said, there are still plenty of course offerings as with many other Liberal Arts Schools."
Sophomore,4,"The community at Unity College is unlike any other school. I transferred here for my sophomore year, and immediately felt welcomed and at home."
Niche User,4,Has very good programs and programs focus on the student rather than the class. Classes aren't very big and sometimes classes go outside the classroom to learn.
Sophomore,4,I love the small town community feel that you get at Unity. The professors are amazing and really care about you and how you are doing in the classes.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I enjoy Unity College. The campus is small, and the populace feels like a family. The town of Unity is small, and has the basic shops that one needs; a grocery store, a few pizza shops, a cafe. The downside to the location is the fact that it is a good 40 minuet drive to any city. Some may appreciate the isolation.  The professors see you as a person rather then a number, one of the benefits of going to a small college.  I personally do not know of the party scene, so I am not a good judge on that field of school life. The reason why it is not a higher overall score is because of the lack of diversity, and the local areas options. Both are not deal breaker's for me personally."
College Freshman,4,"The experience at Unity is one of a kind. It takes a special kind of person to fall in love with Unity which is why its such a small school, but the kids that make it in Unity are in the best of the best for their fields."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is fairly diverse in race, culture, background, political beliefs, religion, and sexuality. Our campus culture is fairly rich and there is a very low tolerance towards unaccepting people"
College Sophomore,4,well unity is in basically the backcountry. everyone is nice.
College Sophomore,4,the college does a really good job on helping you get a job
College Sophomore,4,"some of the resident halls are old and have their problems.Westview is the worst of them, its drafty, old and uncomfortable. Cianchette is alright. 2 new dorm buildings were just built, suit style, fancy and supposedly energy efficient."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall this is an amazing college. the campus life is quiet but it can be as fun as you make it. the food service is average but i have seen improvements since i started attending. everyone is kind and respectful. its a small college but its cozy. academics are fairly difficult, sometimes you get a teacher who has never taught before or you'll get someone that doesn't teach to your learning methods. the career resource center is a great place and will help you get a job if you go and ask for help. the college is currently going through a million dollars expansion and i just hope they dont increase the student body size  much. this is the perfect size for this type of college"
College Sophomore,4,"Our Public Safety officers are effective, efficient, and helpful. They respond quickly to issues and work hard to assist and resolve them. As far as health goes our Health Center is amazing. They are very helpful and have great resources that they utilize when they need assistance on something. They work hard to help keep our student body healthy and educated."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors and courses offered here are, for the most part, amazing. Professors are friendly, approachable, and very willing to help. The required courses are very relevant and exciting and some majors offer choices in required classes you can take (i.e. I am a Parks and Forest Resources major and I can choose to be on the Visitor Resources track and take those required classes or I can be on the Resource Management track and take those required classes)."
College Sophomore,4,"Most on-campus housing is great. The buildings are in great condition and the maintenance and janitorial staff do an amazing job to keep the facilities clean and functioning. There are two predominantly freshman dorms, both of which are fairly typical for freshman housing. One building, Wood Hall, is a freshman dorm that is probably one of the better freshman housing facilities as far as noise levels go, however many students struggle with terrible internet connection because it is a concrete building. The more typically upper class men housing is very nice however. There are two dorms that have suite style rooms with private bathrooms and showers and house 4-5 students in each suite. There are also housing options through the school that are classified as ""off-campus"" and those are also very nice and are located at one corner of the campus. All of the housing is in close proximity to other campus facility. It actually only takes about five minutes to walk across the entirety of our campus."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a small, tight-knit community. Professors, advisers, and school staff are supportive, knowledgeable, and very willing to help you. On occasion there can be difficulty with some school systems such as wi-fi and some online school systems, however I truly believe that these things are heavily outweighed by the good in this school. You have amazing opportunities to build your knowledge and and gain experience in your chose career field. There is also an incredible sense of community and support."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of job and internship possibilities for each career and the teachers and advisers work with you to find one that best fits what you are looking for.
College Freshman,4,The professors really wanted you to succeed and they worked with you.  Classes are interesting and the teachers try to make them fun.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is friendly and down to Earth.  The school is small so the classes are small and it is a little easier to meet everyone and you know everyone.  They offer a number of clubs and activities that I do not believe other schools offer and it is nice to be able to do these different events.
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of sports to choose from, including a couple of unusual ones, like woodsmen. It has one of the best teams in the state!"
College Freshman,4,Small community makes you feel safe and trusting
College Junior,4,"The strictness is enforced by Public Safety, mostly drunken people wandering and vandalizing campus and making sure they are not causing any problems at dances. Sometimes they will give you parking violations, but usually only when they need to remove snow from the parking lots. Unless you really do something awful and outrageous, Public Safety doesn't typically notice."
College Junior,4,"Recently there was a new chef hired for the Student Center. The old chef was not fired, but was instead moved to the Cafeteria where the quality of food has gone up because he has free reign over what and how is going to be cooked."
College Junior,4,"The newest buildings are great, but have less social interactions. The older buildings are less spacious with thinner walls, but have a wonderful social air about them."
College Freshman,4,"While most people view living on campus as a bad thing, the community at Unity college makes living on campus extremely enjoyable. All dorms are also in very close proximity to academic buildings and other important resources."
College Sophomore,4,They re helpful with what they can.
College Freshman,4,"The work is tough, the curriculum I wish was more hands on (being a freshman I don't want to bother with general ed but I have to in order to get hands on work) facilities and program are fine. Internship and job opportunities are found through the career resource center."
College Freshman,4,I'm not involved that much so I don't have a lot to say about it.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletes take up a large portion of the campus, but that's because we are tiny and mostly outdoorsy athletic people"
College Freshman,4,Big variety and good quality
College Freshman,4,Unity College enforces the non use of drugs.
College Junior,4,nice fast Internet service is one reason I live on campus.
College Junior,4,no complaints.  everyone is very helpful and truly care about your success as a student and paying customer.
College Junior,4,campus facilities are improving every year.
College Junior,4,I got the scholarships I needed and could afford to come to this great school!  Unity College has been great so far.
College Junior,4,"A few options, they are all very good quality."
College Junior,4,"A college this size that has a health center - it is amazing, and the staff is always helpful."
College Sophomore,4,If Unity is the right school for you then the things around it should match with your interests well.
College Sophomore,4,Very woodsy and outdoorsy overall.
College Sophomore,4,"Basically anywhere you live off campus you will have a great deal, but housing close enough to walk to school is difficult to find."
College Senior,4,"The major is great and the people running it are even better. However, there is no assistance to get you placed into the required internship you need to graduate. The only assistance available is helping you improve your resume and cover letter."
College Sophomore,4,alcohol is very visiable and most of the kids drink
College Freshman,4,"Clean and Nice Dorms, clean bathrooms, Great computer labs and library, decent academic rooms, and plenty of activities to do."
College Junior,4,We have public safety to take care of most crime
College Junior,4,Being able to have hands on experience with animals
College Sophomore,4,"During the winter, we usually get around six to eight feet of snow. People here in Maine are typically used to driving in snowy and icy conditions, so it doesn't affect daily commutes all that much."
College Sophomore,4,The majority of off-campus housing sits on the college's lake. The availability of these housing units are very easy to come by and are reasonably priced. The added view of the lake is a great addition to the quality of our off-campus housing selection and I hope to secure one for myself next year as a Junior.
College Freshman,4,They're always there when needed and are great at breaking up fights if necessary.
College Sophomore,4,"With a small school, there is always a way to be a part of the campus community in some way. This opens a range of opportunity for community service and campus leadership. Our school also promotes a very hands-on learning style, which can require getting experience outside of campus borders. I have made many good personal connections with people inside and outside of the college community.
Small and close-knit is one of the qualities which makes my school unique. I have not been to any other school in which students address professors on a first-name basis; professors put so much effort into helping students professionally and academically, creating a humble environment for students to grow."
College Senior,4,"There's a bit of a mix of people here. This school is dubbed as a ""hippy"" school but there's a little bit of everyone."
College Senior,4,"I was able to get into my program without any issues. However, I came in as a ""transfer"" student, so I already had a lot of the required classes needed for this program."
College Freshman,4,Town is quiet and close to the school. Gives a good feeling of community.
College Freshman,4,The academic programs at Unity are very good. The professors are very helpful. The financial aid office has been helpful with the money process.
College Freshman,4,"I do have my own labtop, so that makes all work convenient. The WiFi is high speed, so that helps as well. The library and labs are good to work in."
College Freshman,4,"This college is the number one college in the United States when it comes to outdoor education. Since Marine Biology is my major, I knew that this college would get me on the right track to becoming a marine biologist and getting my Doctorate's degree on the subject. The professors are very down-to-earth and very helpful. The workload is not overbearing but there is a good amount of classwork and homework that comes with each class. We have the option to use a tutor when studying to help us with a subject, which is very nice when you need a little grade boost in a class. Overall, Unity College is a great tight-knit community that strives to become a completely self-sustainable college and create great opportunities for all students along the way."
College Freshman,4,"The town of Unity is very small but has a strong sense of community. In the fall there is the MOFGA CommonGround Fair, the people at UHOP are always very welcoming to college students, and the Performing Arts Center is always showing something new. If you are interested in a more lively area, the town of Waterville is about 20 minutes away with a Walmart, Friendly's, and plenty other stores and Bangor which is about 45 minutes away has a mall and plenty of stores. There is always something to do, you just have to keep your eyes open."
College Sophomore,4,"the food most days is very good and they also have a little student cafe in the student center with more homemade food. Unity trys to use as much local food as possible and it is usually really good, but sometimes its like high school. they have a lot of cook to order stuff with is yummy and they always have a fresh salad bar."
College Sophomore,4,"Besides the Wildlife – Unity is a small to that I could definitely get use to. I don't have to worry some pointing a gun at me becaue a Unity College, everyone looks out for one another. If you are willing to roam around at night there are students that will go with you. If you are alone, public safety was always a phone call away, leaving you to only worry about the wildlife."
College Sophomore,4,"On campus parking is that bad. Each parking lot, whether it was near the dorms or classes, are relatively big, making parking fair amongst all students and staff."
College Sophomore,4,"Food Grown Fresh – Unity is a relativelysmall town with a local food store and pizza place. It is convient if you don't have a car and looking to get off campus for a while. However, most of the food is grown fresh and with in the area. Food that can't be obtained in Maine, is shipped from all over the New England area, making minds rest, knowing that our food traveled with less food miles."
College Freshman,2,"Only one bar and it's in a pizza place, but still some good wholesome fun to be had haha"
College Junior,2,There's only three restaurants cost to campus
College Sophomore,2,"Sports attendance is usually very low, except for a few diehard fans that will go to almost every game. The sports that are offered include hockey, basketball, soccer, lacrosse club, and woodsman team. We have been trying to get a baseball, softball, and football team started, but no progress has been made."
College Freshman,2,Unless its a break there isn't really any transportation available to bus stops and things.
College Freshman,2,"There are only two restaurants within a ten mile radius of the school. Both of which are pizza joints. There is not much variety, but they do have student discounts."
Recent Alumnus,2,"the university is not giving by a,b,c,d,e,or by f they give if we complete they give us c that mean competent if we are not they give us not competent ."
College Sophomore,2,It is difficult to get an internship for our majors and you have to pay the school in order to receive credit for graduation
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't really many races on Unity College Campus. As far as religion most are either, atheist or catholic. and most students are heterosexual."
College Sophomore,2,We only have one restaurant near by off campus and it gets old.
College Freshman,2,"Average to lower. When people get together its a blast and a half. Everyone is always very social and inviting to get togethers. Unfortunately, these get togethers are few and far between each other and will probably get worse as the winter comes"
College Freshman,2,"Dining on campus is not the best. The Wymans Commons cafeteria provides meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays and brunch and dinner on weekends. The food there is either a hit or a miss; certain items are delicious and others I just can't eat. But there are a lot of options so you are bound to find something that you like. There is also the student center where you can purchase better food or get a meal exchange if you missed a meal in the cafeteria. As for off campus dining, the most popular place is UHOP-Unity House of Pizza. They have a very large menu with super low prices and the food is delicious."
College Senior,2,"Most scholarships are directed towards Maine residents, high-school applicants or for those who have suffered from disabilities, all of which I do not qualify for. We need more scholarships for people who are currently attending Unity College but are having money issues."
College Sophomore,2,"You May Be Blind, but They See – The security and admnistration is quite strict when it comes drinking, drug use, and damaging property. Unity doesn't allow underage drinking, but for those who are old enough to drink, they have a small pub inside the student activity center. However the students are limited to 5 drinks. Drugs, well, they're just not allowed. Any damages done to any property will be paid for by the student. If there is an event that no one is willing to speak up about, everyone goes down for it."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone around the campus is very nature happy. You will find a majority of hippies, geeks, and country people here. They can be very strange at times."
College Junior,2,"Not So Much – There are no clubs or bars in town, and the nearest dance club or movie theater is 40 minutes away. Off-campus students occasionally host parties, but nothing too extreme."
College Sophomore,2,"Dependent on what dorm you live in, you may have to walk a good distance to get to your assigned parking lot. The lots do not get plowed too well in the winter wich makes it hard to park. On occasion you will not be able to find a spot to park and have to park in a dirt parking lot on the far end of campus."
College Junior,2,"There is really only one place to park on campus for off campus students and its usually pretty close to being full. Its sometimes a big hassel and really annoying to find a spot. You get assigned a sticker for your car to tell you what lot you're allowed to park in. On campus students can only park in their dorm lot. You will get tickets if you park in the wrong lots. YOu don't need a car up here, you can easily find rides from friends."
College Freshman,2,The Foods Ok – There are only two places on campus to eat. You get tired of eating in the dining hall (but the food isn't all bad). I suggest not getting a meal plan or getting the smaller on.
Niche User,1,I would give negative stars. This online college will bamboozle you and screw you into enrolling you without your knowledge and then charge you without you ever signing or agreeing to anything.  BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL and go else where!!!!!!!
Freshman,1,"Unity is a sad excuse for a college. Located in the middle of nowhere you're surrounded by racists who think it's okay to set off fire alarms cooking deer meat. There is absolutely no diversity, 98% of the students are white. The dinning hall serves terrible and mislabeled foods at restricting times. The health center is about as useful as WebMD. They can't write prescriptions and aren't even open after 5pm during the week and are closed on weekends. I had to drive 45 minutes to the ER to treat a UTI. The allow guns on campus for hunters yet public safety doesn't carry and it'd take at least 25 minutes for first responders to show up to an emergency. They allow emotional support animals in several residence halls but they put salt down in the winter which is toxic to animals.  Everyone leaves on the weekends because staying on campus is depressing."
Niche User,1,"I took a Sustainability business class online.  The professor did not engage, and did not provide any of the deliverables.  I was promised three conferences and got none.  I had to badger the admin to get a sustainability badge that was promised, for my business website.  And I ""won"" a grant and it's been two months now and I keep getting ""Sorry for the delay"".  The professor allowed the use of .coms for references which are not valid.  I have a Masters in Health Care Admin, from a different college and I can say this class falls way below basic standards of excellence at the college level.  Bottom line, I took this class for the deliverables promised and so far, all I got was a badge from a substandard sustainability class.  Not worth the money."
Niche User,1,"I attended Unity for one semester before transferring. It’s a horrible place for people of color. I wasn’t even aware we had a diversity “department” until after i transferred. Any reports of racism are brushed under the rug. I did not feel safe at Unity. Hearing racist comments and jokes was an everyday thing for me. I liked all my professors but the academics are not at all challenging and I did not feel like I was getting the best possible education.  The food is poorly cooked and options for non-meat eaters are at a minimum. As a vegetarian, my main course was usually badly cooked tofu. The housing facilities are pretty decent thought and maintence does a great job at keeping them clean. Overall, I would suggest POC search for other schools. You won’t be properly represented at Unity and there are so many other places where you could really dip into your potential. Find a school where you will be uplifted and supported, not ignored."
Freshman,1,"Had one year here and half of my friends (and me) are transferring. Teachers claim to care about their students welfare and grades but typically dont. I expected a community feel but felt unsupported. Great friends here, but awful school."
College Sophomore,1,There isn't any here and for god reason. If you're looking for Greek life go somewhere else.
College Sophomore,1,there are too little parties
College Freshman,1,There is no greek system....
College Freshman,1,60% of the school is in two majors which get the brunt of all the funding and the other majors can sometime suffer because of this. But if you are conservation law enforcement or captive wildlife this is great for you
College Senior,1,"I have heard a lot of stories of crazy parties going on every day of the week. Also I have witnessed people smoking pot on campus and in the woods surrounding campus. I know public safety cannot be in all places at once but I  think there should be emails sent around stating that if you suspect someone of doing drugs call a hotline number as part of public safety. But then again, I work pretty closely with Public Safety and I would not suggest leaving something for them to deal with. If you want something done, do it yourself as far as public safety goes."
College Freshman,1,We Are Not Winners – We are not well known for our athletics. It is mostly just a good way to keep yourself busy. Even if you have never played before you can make the teams. I will give them credit they do practice and work hard.
College Sophomore,1,The whole school is pretty much white. Including myself the total count of native americans is just 2.

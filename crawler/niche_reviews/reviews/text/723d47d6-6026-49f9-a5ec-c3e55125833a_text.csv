Junior,5,"My time in Ohio Valley University has been a little short but so far the people around the institution and town are very polite to the new comers. Students and staff members make you feel comfortable around them and try to make it the best experience you ever had in a Cristian institution. Staff members really encourage you to join social clubs, activities, or even sports to try and meet new people who are complete strangers to you burn the sooner or later, they become so especial that they make an impact in your life. What I really like about Ohio Valley University is the drive and the desire to step up, learn, and believe. If there could be something I would change from Ohio Valley University Institution it would be just the classes since they run a little small and not many students can fit in a small classroom. I would really like to enjoy a class with a range of 25 plus students in order to interact and meet more students in class."
Sophomore,5,I think this is a really great school. Have had a great experience here. Great baseball team to play on. Would recommend to anyone to come here.
Freshman,5,I am loving this school.  I am blind and it is a small Christian school which is just what I was looking for when I applied.  Teacher's and staff are all so friendly.  It is compact so I do not have trouble getting around with my cane.
Freshman,5,"I live in Parkersburg, West Virginia so I know all about Vienna. It's a very good place to grow up or go to college because it's pretty safe around these parts. There's not too much to do here but it's just a good area to live in. I'm studying energy management and production engineering (EMPE) and so far I'm loving it and I just got straight a's for my first semester. Dr. Blair is the main professor for EMPE and he's one of the best people that you could ever meet. We have 4 social groups for students to join in; which are delta, kappa, sigma, and theta. Joining a group is a good way to make new friends, make memories, compete in sports against other social groups, and a good way to get community service hours. I'm also a thrower for OVU's track and field team and it's also been a lot of fun but challenging at the same time because this has been our first year. We have a lot of other sports for people to do here also."
College Sophomore,5,"I truly wouldn't pick another school to go to if I had the opportunity to go anywhere.  I feel that Ohio valley University is preparing me well for law school, and everyone is willing to go the extra mile to make sure you graduate on time."
College Sophomore,5,"My school's Greek Life is different than other schools in the sense that we don't have houses, and our clubs are co-ed.  That being said, my club is called Sigma, and I love it because everyone is a family, and we all spend lots of time together.  I've made some of my best friends because of Sigma, most of whom I wouldn't have met otherwise."
College Junior,5,"OVU is very diverse! There are all kinds of people here, which is what makes the campus so great! OVU has an amazing atmosphere. Everyone is accepted. "
College Junior,5,All of my classes have been great at OVU. They are challenging but not too much to handle. Each class is different in the sense that homework load is different and each curriculum is different. You never know what to expect from different classes. 
College Junior,5,OVU has some of the best professors I've ever had. They are always personable and always willing to help students! 
College Junior,5,"We have the best campus ever! I have attended two other colleges and OVU is the best! It's a small campus, making it easy to get around. The OVU campus has great buildings with many lounges, computer labs, and classrooms. "
College Junior,5,OVU is a great school. It's small and like a family. This is my first year here and I felt very welcome! The professors are great and very helpful! 
College Sophomore,5,The dorm to parking area is about twenty feet away. The dorm to school is also twenty feet.
College Freshman,5,There are four parking lots surrounding the campus
College Freshman,5,We have more majors than a small school would be expected
College Freshman,5,"Although I haven't started yet, I've been going to OVU for a few years now for various church things. I've met so many people that I already love, and I'm really excited to get there and start learning. There is so much to do around OVU and so many nice people who love and care about you, no matter what. I really cannot wait until I start there in a week and a half!"
College Freshman,5,"OVU's Strictness Policy – The campus is very strict, mostly because it's a Christian school. They have rules on drugs, alcohol, and sex (obviously), but also on things like attendance of chapel, and cerfew. When you want to go somewhere to stay the night/weekend (like, going home), you have to sign out with the college, and sign in when you get back. Students aren't allowed to sign out to houses or apartments of single students of the opposite sex for the night."
Freshman,4,"Ohio Valley University is a small college setting. There are approximately 500 students, therefor you are in a good learning environment. Some think it's too small but others believe it is just the right size."
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on your major, but finding jobs is relatively easy."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone here loves you and that's a nice environment.
College Sophomore,4,Ohio Valley University is helping me grow into the person God created me to be.
College Sophomore,4,There hasn't been any known criminal activity on campus since I have been there.
College Sophomore,4,"I really do love Ohio Valley University, especially the small class sizes. Teachers are incredibly helpful and truly do care about your success in and outside the classroom.  They help shape you into the person you want to become and ultimately the job you want to get after graduation."
College Junior,4,It is great except for the fact that we don't get much help from the school other than with living on south campus.
College Junior,4,"Could use student discounts, but is fine otherwise"
College Junior,4,"needs to be more strict on the drug usage (usually strict, but cases of certain students getting away with smoking weed in the dormitories and nobody saying anything about it), and needs to be stricter on the noise violations in the dormitories during certain times of day, but is fine otherwise"
College Junior,4,"Could use slight improving, but as good as it could be under circumstances"
College Junior,4,"The bathrooms could be taken care of a little more often (only done Monday-Friday, I feel it should also need tending to on the weekends as well), but other than that, I feel it was fantastic"
College Sophomore,4,There are many different options from fast food to sit down restaurants. There is a variety of pricing some places are open all night so getting food is never a problem.
College Sophomore,4,There are many adjunct teachers in my major and they are fantastic teachers. They have been in the work place so they are very well informed and able to teach very effectively. The curriculum is also very good.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorm rooms are very spacious and they are also very close to where classes are so it is very simple to get from your dorm to your class. They also provide much of what is needed such as a bed, desk, and dresser."
College Junior,4,Athletics are a big part of the students' college life. 
College Junior,4,Security is always on top of things. 
College Junior,4,I've never seen issues with safety at OVU. Campus Security are always available and their number is posted on almost every door. 
College Junior,4,I  do not eat on campus as I am a commuter but I have heard that the café is great and has many options. 
College Junior,4,"OVU is close to Grand Central Ave, which has tons of shops, restaurants, and other things to do. There is a huge mall for shopping and a movie theatre. There are plenty of things to do in Parkersburg. "
College Sophomore,4,"Alcohol and drug use on campus is not allowed. However, many students sneak around"
Alum,2,"I graduated from this school many years ago, and have regretted that decision everyday since I left.  I have no idea how this school keeps its doors open and the lights on, and it has no business continuing to tease future students with the hope of a rewarding college experience.  No one outside of the Church of Christ (which is thankfully dying its own slow death) has ever heard of it, and it has been an embarrassment to include on my resume for a long time.  I have since completed another degree to make up for the lost efforts spent at OVC.  This school relies heavily on local churches pushing their misdirected youth to it, along with a steady diet of wayward northeastern church camp kids that don't want to go all the way to Harding University in Arkansas (the C of C mecca if you will).  I am not surprised at OVU's recent probationary status, I would recommend to current students to get out while they can in hopes of landing somewhere legitimate."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't technically a health center on campus for medical or mental health, however, there are services avilable to the public."
College Sophomore,2,"To give OVU credit, they do try to find jobs for their students. But the area around OVU is dead job-wise. You need to go 100+ miles away to find a good job, even further if you want to work in a major city."
College Sophomore,2,"Very conservative Christian and therefore a toxic environment for a gay person. Professors are influenced heavily by the conservative Christian donors that the school relies on, so topics on homosexuality and evolution are biased. The school is incredibly close knit. It functions a lot like a small town in itself. People compare it a lot to a family, which is accurate if your family is over-controlling and bigoted. If you happen to be like everyone else there (Church of Christ christian, straight, conservative) or can at least keep quiet, then you're golden. If you don't fit in to this tight mold, you don't belong there."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a small, set schedule of food items, and most times, the food is rancid, and the silverware has buildup on it, making it unsanitary"
College Sophomore,2,I transferred from another school and I don't feel the psychology program is as advanced as that one. There isn't many options for psych majors they are more focused on education majors.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall at OVU is actually pretty gross!!! Most of the time there is nothing good to eat, and if there is it is all carbs.I feel like we should have more options other than burnt pizza or dried out french fries. Sometimes there are a few good things, but i get tired of having the same thing over and over again."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Enough – There isn't enough parking on campus.  The parking that we do have needs to be repaved.  During that day when the most people are on campus, it is very hard to find a spot."
Alum,1,N/A - the school did not offer online learning opportunities during the time that I was a student there.
Freshman,1,"I would not recommend this school to anyone. They treat you like kids, you have no freedom, and no privacy. The RA’s here are racist and they are open and okay with you knowing it. They keep dropping sports teams so who knows what team will be next. They dont care about what the students have to say about the school or what we want. The showers are cold, there are ants everywhere in the dorms. The school is just dirty. I myself and my friend have both caught pneumonia from our dorms. we arent allowed open dorms which is pathetic. We are adults. We should be able to go hangout with whoever we want. There is also no privacy and too many unnecessary rules. People have a key to your room so they could literally come in at any time.  I highly doubt I will be back next year."
Niche User,1,"During my time at OVU, I felt like I was pushed away as an outcast by both faculty/staff and students. I didn’t get the chance to learn the information for classes as well as I could have because it seemed as if every time I tried to ask a question about anything either to a teacher or other student, they gave a half answer, or didn’t answer at all, and acted like I was burdening them. 97% of the students are either stuck up athletes or international students who know very little English. The rules are strict and those who are in positions of authority pick and choose who they want to enforce the rules with. I got fined twice within a weeks time over stupid things that didn’t even make sense."
Freshman,1,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Here is my experience overall and why you shouldn't waste your time or money here:
1. The dining services is overpriced hospital food at best
2. Student Life is mediocre 
3. Dorm life is equivalent to living in a prison that fines you for anything
4. Everyone with power here is biased and will do anything to get you in trouble even if you did nothing 
5. The school is manly conservatives who are in turn unsupportive of LGBTQ
6. Smack dab in the middle of nowhere= nothing to do and nowhere to get around
7. The requirements are outrages (chapel everyday, minimum of 50 attendances)
8. Bible is a required class and the bibles aren't provided for you
9. Any type of fun is nowhere to be found here
10. For the amount you pay, you can get more out of a state school
11. The academics is high school level at best
12. Athletics scholarships are the only reason anyone is here
Overall a terrible terrible school and would not recommend to anyone"
College Sophomore,1,School spirit doesn't even exist. Either you play sports for a scholarship or you don't care about them at all.
College Freshman,1,The nightlife is pretty boring at OVU because we have a curfew if you are under the age of 21 or are an underclassman.  There is really not much to do around the school.
College Freshman,1,"don't consider ovu – this school is a joke, they act like they are so good because they are a christian university but in reality its the worst school i've ever seen or heard of. the classes don't teach you anything and the teachers don't seem qualified to teach. i had a writing class where we didn't even talk about writing the whole semester. he told us all of our assignments in the syllabus were due at the end of the semester and i asked for help several times and never got any answers i needed. also, the basketball players are favorited and don't ever get in trouble for anything such as failing drug tests. they still get to play no matter what. you can never get a hold of the dean who is supposed to be there to help you. nobody is ever in their office. the cafeteria has horrible food that hardly anybody likes. most of the time, i feel nauseous after eating in there. they fine you for everything they possibly can. such as having your door unlocked and being asleep for room checks. this school is not good and if you go here or plan to, good luck. i wish i would have never even considered this school. "
College Freshman,1,"There aren't many computers at Ohio Valley University, and with that said, more than half of them are not functional. The internet isn't reliable, is always slow, and is almost always down.  Printing is a hassle, as there aren't many public printers, and they're frequently out of ink or paper. A personal computer and printer is highly recommended."

Niche User,5,"Defiance College is a small private college that is very community based. The college works really well with their students and trying to help give them the best education the student wants for their major. With a 15:1 ratio you will be able to get all the help you will need if you are struggling with any of your school work. There are many things to do around campus and the students and facility are so welcoming to anyone on campus. There are many activities to do on campus such as attend sporting events, many activities during welcome week, and specials going on during the week at many different locations."
Niche User,5,I’m a 2020 softball commit and have been there many times and it gets better and better each time. The people and environment around the campus is the best I’ve seen.
Niche User,5,"Honestly when I visited, I felt like I was at home for a few reasons. Everyone was so welcoming to me, the students were kind, the food was exceptional, education was great, and it’s also a very small campus. If your looking for a small school I’d 100% recommended this one, and you’ll never be singled out because everyone knows everyone. Friendships can be easily developed at this college so all interested should go to defiance."
Freshman,5,"Great college. Awesome professors, nice people, easy to find everything. A small campus but still a great experience."
Senior,5,"My experience at Defiance College has overall been excellent. Defiance gave me an opportunity to move away from home and pursue a Bachelors degree. During my 4 years at Defiance College I have completed internships in my field of study to give me a better understanding for what comes next. I have also been a member of the Defiance College Softball team the last 4 years in which has taught me time management and has enhanced my leadership skills tremendously. There is nothing I would have changed throughout my time at Defiance College, it has prepared me for my future and brought me life long friendships."
Freshman,5,I love Defiance College. It was the best decision of my life to come here to continue my academic and athletic career.
Freshman,5,"Defiance College has made a positive impact on my College career. They are very friendly and care about you as an individual person. The professors take it upon themselves to help you succeed and learn the knowledge required for your career choice. Overall, a very welcoming and encouraging place to call home for the next 4 years."
College Junior,5,Its awesome. 91.2% of full-time undergraduates do not pay full tuition which is great for a private college
College Junior,5,Academic assistance is great. They are devoted to your success
College Junior,5,Our athletic Center is top notch!! I love it
College Junior,5,Everyone is open and always there to help
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly and accepting of different views and ethnicities.
College Freshman,5,We are respected because as  a pre-med student we have to juggle many things and we are know for our brains and organization. I also am in the service leaders group so I am very busy with community service as well. The workload as a pre-med student is very high. You have to make sure you are on top of your work because once you are behind you never get ahead. Everything you learn has to be remembered as well so studying is critical.
College Freshman,5,I do not live on campus but the strictness of the college is very high and the students are made to behave and act like adults.
College Freshman,5,Love the Coaches and professers
College Freshman,5,"The financial aid process is easy and quick. All you really need is the school name or code to locate the school on the form online and fill it out. Also, have your parents around to fill out any tax information. Other than that after the online form is filled out and submitted. Then within a 1-3 days an email will appear and tell you that what the results are and what loans, and monies you will qualify for."
College Freshman,5,Defiance College thrives on there sports teams especially since ohio is a big sport state. When a game comes up everyone including the community comes to show love for the coaches and players.
College Sophomore,5,There are a very diverse group at Defiance College. I think this shows the student population how everyone is different and we all believe in different things.
College Freshman,5,"Tons to Choose from – Tons of majors to choose from and more importantly, awesome guidance in deciding a major and planning each semester."
College Freshman,5,Awesome Teamwork – love the teamwork and the staff and administration support
Niche User,4,I felt that the campus was the perfect size. While to campus is relatively small it does not feel crowded. There are great resources for student to learn with such as a cadaver lab (which few schools have).
Sophomore,4,I love Defiance College. Everyone is like a big family and welcomes you. The professors have a lower student to professor ratio so if you need help it is easier to get the help you need. We have a lot of great on campus activities going on at all times. It is easy to stay involved. Even though the campus might not be the biggest it is a wonderful place to be. For anyone thinking about going I would recommend having an over night. Overall Defiance is a safe and friendly place.
Sophomore,4,I like the college and it's location to stores and restaurants I am a little disappointed in the sports
Sophomore,4,"the overall experience of defiance college the school is a great place to be but we are mainly sports school, so if you are not in to sports this is not the school for you."
Senior,4,I love that defiance college is a small school that offers a lot. Something that could change is the cost of tuition.
Freshman,4,"Defiance College is definitely a small environment. However this is what makes the school so unique. On campus living is compared to having one big family. Everyone is involved with one another as a support system. They just updated our food service, and add new classes every semester from things like Yoga to learning how to coach. The only thing about Defiance that could make it unlikable is the low diversity rate. Being an African American female it would make one feel more comfortable to not be approximately 1 of 20 African American females on campus."
College Senior,4,"Career center/services is very willing to help students when needed. There are also courses that students can take to prepare for graduate schools, internships, resumes, recommendation letters, etc."
College Senior,4,I have not been faced with any health or safety issues at Defiance College. The campus is relatively illuminated at night for students who take evening classes.
College Junior,4,Most students get jobs right out of college
College Junior,4,"Defiance College offers the students there every opportunity to succeed and it's up to the students to own their education. However, sometimes the student life department hinders the experience."
College Sophomore,4,"There is so much help from teachers and tudors.  Impossible to fail, too much help available"
College Sophomore,4,It is good for our level but need improvement. but coaches say improvement is on the way.
College Sophomore,4,there are so good internships the college or your professor can get yourself into.
College Junior,4,"In terms of alcohol violation code, there is zero tolerance for under age drinking on campus."
College Junior,4,Our athletic facilities are great and our teams get lots of support from students and the community no matter the sport!
College Junior,4,"I do not live off campus but based on reviews from my friends, the availability and convenience is great"
College Junior,4,The local attitude is warm and friendly
College Junior,4,The convenience is good as they are close to campus
College Freshman,4,We filled out the FAFSA form and received financial from my high school
College Freshman,4,"Being small, there are only so many places to go.  Getting from the dorm to class is virtually a few hundred feet away"
College Freshman,4,Its very easy to get registered into the programs but getting accepted and getting through the program is up to you because it has to do with your own abilities.
College Freshman,4,"My program is great and I love what I am going to be doing for the rest of my life. The workload is heavy , very heavy in fact, but it is worth it and I can't wait to go to medical school."
College Freshman,4,"The dining around campus is great. They have plenty of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options within walking distance from the college. The ethnic diversity could be a bit better but overall there is plenty to keep everything interesting."
College Freshman,4,I don't have a reason to dislike my school because I still have some friends from high school that go to this college as well.
College Freshman,4,"The professors make you do your work and are very strict on their cheating policies. The curriculum for my major, in particular, is very hard but relevant to my chosen career path. The professors make the material clear and do a great job of making themselves available for explanation and assistance."
College Freshman,4,My college has many great and accessible sports facilities that everyone that attends the college can use as long as they have their ID. The facilities are not only new but they are safe as well and the equipment is easily self understood.
College Freshman,4,"One very unique program that this college has is the Service Leaders program. I am apart of this group and they do a lot of great work in the community and even give students scholarships that see fit to be good leaders. Its a great program and shows us young people the importance of community service and ""paying it forward."""
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of computers to go around. The wireless internet though sometimes is unavailable.
College Sophomore,4,Our Greek life does a lot of great things for the community. There is only a couple Greek organizations and they don't pressure you at all if you feel uncomfortable with the idea. Really great people!
College Sophomore,4,"Teachers really do care and ask you how you are doing. Class sizes are perfect! DC really pushes its McMaster School for Advancing Humanity. You can travel to Belize, Cambodia and now Tanzania with projects you have developed to help make their worlds a better place."
College Sophomore,4,"In the education department, you will begin work in the field your freshman year. There are several other opportunities to get into the classroom through Federal Work Study programs and volunteer organizations."
College Sophomore,4,At Defiance College we are a really closely knit group of college students. DC is a small college so we get to know each other quickly!
College Sophomore,4,Everything can't be perfect all the time which is why i did not give it an A+. Overall the housing is great but the rooms are small for two people to live in.
College Freshman,4,We are right next to several restraunts/movies/mall
College Freshman,4,"Defiance College security ensures the campus is safe from crime and harmful acts in which students or staff could be harmed. I enjoy living on this particular campus because there is very low crime rate, and the community is very welcoming. Cameras in which that are put in place achieve the goal of making me feel even more secure."
College Freshman,4,The computer were rarely crowded. The only time it was used was when midterms or finals came around. Most people brought laptops but still used the computer.
College Freshman,4,It was easy and well processed to get. The time it took to get was great. The forms needed was given to me and processed when I finished.
College Junior,4,Small Classes – I believe that having a small class room gives the students a good opportunity to learn one on one. When the professor actually knows who you are it is a relief.
College Sophomore,4,Academics are a priority and staff is willing to help to ensure student success
College Sophomore,4,Good Selection – Good selection of housing and I am looking forward to my own place!
Senior,2,"Defiance College is very small in terms of both student and faculty population, as well as campus space. The college does not have much diversity to offer, is super expensive, and many professors are overly strict. The small number of faculty really limits students options in regard to course schedules. Most required courses are only offered either in the fall or spring, and typically there are only one or two options of what time it can be taken. Furthermore, there are not many elective courses offered in ones own major: Students often have to take courses that are irrelevant to their major in order to fill credit hour requirements."
College Sophomore,2,With the tiny rooms you might as well just pay the extra money to have a room to yourself.
College Sophomore,2,"Compared to my High School, the athletic facilities are poor. The school also feels like they should cut sports programs do to loss of funds elsewhere and it is pitiful."
College Junior,2,Security seems okay but personal experiences with sexual assault showed that the school is not as concerned as they seem.
College Sophomore,2,i usually go to a near by bigger college such as Ohio state
College Sophomore,2,Their really isn't anything to do off campus besides go to the movies.
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing is outrageously costly. The average college student going to school full time is unable to afford it so they all live on campus unless their parents live nearby. 
College Sophomore,2,"Fast food, sit down, sports bars... there is a little bit of everything if you are willing to go out!"
College Sophomore,2,There are several sports bars and other restaurants within a mile or two of campus. 
College Sophomore,2,Spring and fall is perfect in Northwest Ohio. Winters can cause slippery roads and there can be lots of snow sometimes!
College Freshman,2,"I am not racist at all, but there are quite a few black people that go here. Since it is a small school, I basically know everyone here and I feel like I see the same faces everyday.  I am not complaining, but it would be nice to have a little more diversity here."
College Senior,2,"Presentations and drug awareness programs are designed solely for freshmen, it would seem. Not to mention, there is little in place at the college to actually persuade people from stopping it. I have heard people loudly talk about doing drugs in public areas and authority figures do nothing. Most RA's tend to look the other way, as a matter of fact."
College Junior,2,"For the amount of students we have there is not enough parking. anyone is allowed to have a car but there isn't enough spaces available and they give you passes for free but if you don't have a pass or park in the wrong area then you have to pay a fee and it gets to be rediculus and expensive, we have been pushing for years to have it changed and i hope they do so soon!"
College Freshman,1,There really is no transportation because this school is located in a very small town and they don't really allow students to use the vans. We don't have a train station either. The holiday is the only time that the schools helps students to get to airports and helps them to schedule flights home as well.
College Freshman,1,"There are not much party and I am not one to party a lot though.  There are clubs and bars maybe 40 minutes away from here but it would not be fun if you are 18 to go to a bar.  Maybe a club.  House parties are not that exciting. Weekends are boring here, but once it gets nicer outside it will probably get a little better."
College Freshman,1,"Well there is not much to do in Defiance. Especially that is convenient for students to go if they do not have transportation. Students will turn to getting high, play ball, hang out, or smoke."
College Sophomore,1,Prof Do Not Really Explain Anything. If a student asks for help the professors will tell them the information is in the book to read it.
College Junior,1,"No Options Available – We have the cafe which is food provided by sudexo and its gross and repetetive, people have found bugs and other things that should not be found in food. Then we have the Hive which is like a fast food place and is extremely un-healthy, it's so hard to eat correctly!"
College Sophomore,1,"I Wouldn't Recommend It – Defiance is a school that takes a lot out of you mentally, the athletics are a joke along with its students. The campus is just like a high school and all the kids do is get completely drunk and sleep around. the amount of rapes per year is amazing! were already almost at 20 this year."
College Sophomore,1,"Sodexo, Not a Real Meal – The food here is way below par, a lot of the times its uneatable and makes many of the students sick. Its either still cold or way to burnt and the nutritional value is horrible! Our school buys the same food that is given out in prisons and expects us to be happy with sub par food."
College Sophomore,1,"Not So Hot Spot With This Wirless – There is only one computer lab that is open 24 hours, but each building does have a computer lab. We have one mac lab, but the catch is, the internet is horrible. You get booted from the wireless every 10 minutes or so, and it is VERY slow! also if you are doing a last minute print job, chances are the printer will be broken or out of ink, so bring your own! Also the labs are usually full because of mandatory study table for all athletes"
College Sophomore,1,"We had a large freshman class come to Defiance College this year and it has really taken a toll on our parking availability. Oftentimes, the parking lot that I am required to park in does not have any spaces left so I have to park in another location where I could potentially get a ticket. Also, we have an awful gravel parking lot that is an extreme inconvenience to park in."
College Freshman,1,The parties are boring here. We have to go to a different city just to go clubbing or to a bar.
College Freshman,1,Interesting Food? The food here is below average. They serve the same meals every week and some of the food be cold when you eat it. The cups still be a little dirty and some of the food tastes awful.

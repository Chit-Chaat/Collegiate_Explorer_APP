Freshman,5,"First I love the city where this university is located and the education is exceptional, they have everything related with design and architecture which I like and also the professors were very helpful in my process of application. I really recommend this university to all the students interested in these careers."
Niche User,5,They are quick and helpful in the admissions department. I am currently an applicant to the school. They offer a great deal to you as a student and alumni. I can not wait to be apart. This is a school that makes excellence a priority and that a school worth going to.
Graduate Student,5,Great choice for online masters program.  I did a lot of research on other schools and Boston Architectural College was the best choice for me.  Besides being NCAARB certified and having a great curriculum you get to go to Boston every semester.  Boston! One of the greatest cities in this great country.
College Freshman,5,Within my first semester I can say I learned more than I thought possible(in comparison to that of Framingham State). They work so hard in making sure that students learn the key points to becoming an architect.
College Student,5,You could find any race at this college.
College Student,5,The process to get financial help is easy.
College Student,5,The BAC has strict student rules.
College Student,5,At the BAC everything is clean.
College Sophomore,5,"Being directly in Boston is great!  We are so close to everything, it's really nice to just go somewhere or explore in between classes or while taking a break"
College Sophomore,5,We do not have any form of Greek life.
College Sophomore,5,A lot of the guys at my school are gay. but they are so much fun to hang out with
Graduate Student,4,"I have learned a lot while attending the school, although project are mostly based within the boston neighbourhoods. There is a lot of open discussion about projects outside the boston area. Good learning space"
Graduate Student,4,"It can be difficult to juggle work and school, and some of the professors are not always reachable, but I feel like my education here was quality and I am learning a lot."
Graduate Student,4,"For me, the name of the game is becoming a registered architect. BAC is the fast track to that goal. I am getting practice hours while getting my accredited degree. I am also eligible to take my Registration Exams during school, where most schools you need the accredited degree before you are eligible.

The staff and faculty are responsive, dedicated and engaging. All of the resources are catered towards architecture, unlike other places where your tuition funds other departments."
Sophomore,4,It's a great school for architecture and design.  It is very focused on architecture and not as much for interior architecture.  The school itself is small and there aren't enough computers for all the students to use.  There aren't any sports teams which is kind of a downfall.  It would be nice to have faster running computers as well.
College Freshman,4,The securities are the best.
College Junior,4,"Can't complain, would recommend if it is a choice."
College Junior,4,Its great and mostly what I wanted. Can't complain.
College Sophomore,4,Students who do the work will def. Find work in their career
College Sophomore,4,It seems to work good
College Junior,4,The BAC is located right on Newbury Street so Boston is your personal cafeteria.  There are many options to choose from with a variety of price ranges.  As long as you avoid Newbury Street and explore the side streets you will never break the bank to hard and will normally leave happy.
College Junior,4,The guards at the school are normally quite nice.  They always greet you when you come in and ask you about your day.  In addition if you need anything or have a question about something they will quickly help you.
College Sophomore,4,Generally no matter when you are at school you are bound to bump into someone you know which adds to the sociability of the school.  In relation to academic programs friends in other programs can at time become nonexistent since the schedules of class are generally set up differently.
College Sophomore,4,"We have many choices of dining especially since we are on Newbury Street, the only downfall is Boston can be very pricy when it comes to food."
College Sophomore,4,Every computer lab is equipped with pretty much any software you would ever desire to use in the design profession.  Though during midterms it can be quite hard to find a computer to use.  The only main issue is the fact that in order to use the wifi on either your phone or laptop every time you want to use it you have to re-log into the network as opposed to just automatically syncing.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers seem to all know there subjects quite well and each have something to contribute to your education.  The work load isn't too bad all though sometimes studio can be a bit much.  Also the fact that most classes are conflicting in scheduling with studio makes it rather hard to quicken your education and shorten the 7 years.
College Sophomore,4,There is a t-station and bus stop just a block away from the school.
College Sophomore,4,"It has been a good experience. My school is unique in its work/school program
"
College Student,4,The BAC has multiple campus locations that are all located close together in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Each campus building has a security guard by the front door and it is in a fairly safe neighborhood.
College Student,4,Building Lock Down – The safety at Boston Architectural is extremely reliable. Upon entering the building they are visible and you must walk by them to get where your going. The guards are friendly and seem to take all steps to insure the safety of all the students as well as faculty. I've yet to experience any threatening crimes or come across anything presenting harm towards me or anyone else. Overall at Boston Architectural College the building is locked down!
College Student,4,"Building Dreams – Boston Architectural is full of life and beauty. It's located with in the downtown area, borderline fenway home of the Red Sox. Shopping is available all through the Newbury St area. There are many sites to be seen, makes going to school worth every moment."
College Sophomore,2,"My school's financial aid department is a nightmare.  They've made constant mistakes in the past, most recently the beginning of last semester I had to wait almost three months after my starting date to receive the money I was being given.  In addition it seems I'm running into the same problem now, I've still not received anything.  The best tip is no matter what they say keep calling them and seek answers."
College Sophomore,2,"Boston is a college town. Due to that apartments are very expensive, low quality, and the ones that are near the school are impossible for a student to afford. Roomates are a necessity, not only to help pay for the apartment but to stay safe when walking around town by the use of the ""buddy system"". Boston has a high crime rate, there are areas that are safer than others, but overall, especially for a woman, it is not wise to walk alone."
College Freshman,2,The concurrent program at the BAC works better in theory than in practice. The faculty does not explain well how the practice credits count down really works and the students will only find out that these practice credits have nothing to do with REAL practice hours for the architecture license  (example: IDP hours) when they are already in too deep into the program.
Graduate Student,1,"You won't get passed as the years they said because the course is very intensive and they want you to earn not just credit, but also hours and skills. Except you have extra support from your family then it's really hard to achieve their goal. You need more time to graduate and the school won't give you many support. They just keep asking you for a lot of stuff and not helping that much. Except you've tons of energy to spend otherwise don't choose this school."
College Freshman,1,We don't have athletics at our school
College Student,1,"It's literally actually the worst. This school couldn't design a shoebox if they tried. Firing their president, closing buildings is just the beginning of this train wreck."
College Freshman,1,"Parking in Boston is in general very difficult. Due to the location of the BAC it is a really tough task to find parking in a timely manner. However, for the ones willing to spend a lot of money, there are always the parking garage across from school."

Freshman,5,Very welcoming and helpful. I like the atmosphere the teachers are good. The diversity is ok. I enjoy going here.
Sophomore,5,The best semester I've had since attending college! All my professors were so understanding and helped me with assignments when I had questions or struggled. I took on 6 courses this semester and finished with a 3.67!
Sophomore,5,"I attended Santa Fe College for a year and unfortunately had to move back home, but my time there and experience was great. Not only do they offer tons of choices for degree, but they also provide plenty of guidance, help, and aids to help you figure out what path is the right one for you to take. They also are a great way to get your foot in the door if you are planning to transfer into the University of Florida after you finish your first two years of school. I highly recommend attending this college."
Sophomore,5,"I took two classes online during my time at Santa Fe and I really enjoyed them. Online directions for assignments were made very clear and easy by the professors, they responded back to emails and questions in a timely manner, and the learning experience was great. I didn't feel like I was teaching myself through the course."
Graduate Student,5,I loved Santa Fe college! The campus was great. Most of the professors I had were engaging and helpful. I felt I got my moneys worth.
Alum,5,"Santa Fe College is a wonderful college in Gainesville, Florida that offers dual enrollment, small class sizes, and a means to get a really good education for a much more affordable price than traditional state universities."
Alum,5,"My experience with online learning through Santa Fe College is mainly through hybrid classes which consisted of in-person classes and online-based assignments combined. That being said, all of my experiences with this type of learning through this college have been positive, fairly easy to navigate, and accessible."
Niche User,5,"I took three classes online at Santa Fe and for the most part, they were extremely convenient. For exams, students have the option of using proctored testing tools (proctorU/lockdown browser) or going to the school testing center. Online classes mostly rely on students being able to hold themselves accountable, and the same is true at Santa Fe. This being said, each of my professors were quick to respond whenever I had a question or comment on any of our material. My only complaint would be about professors reusing old syllabus material and expecting it to align with the new semester. I'm not saying this is a quality strictly referencing Santa Fe professors, but it is something I have noticed before."
Freshman,5,"Santa Fe College maintains a very clean and open campus. Their on campus library is a great resource when you need tutoring and a place to study and have access to internet. For the most part, the professors are all competent."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Santa Fe College has been amazing. All of my professors have been very good at teaching and making sure you understand the concepts. It has a bunch of opportunities to get out there and meet people, and has tutoring for all subjects."
Sophomore,5,I had a great experience online and on campus! The teachers were all really great and the students fun to work with.
Niche User,5,I will be attending in the Fall but on my visit I felt welcomed and that this was where I was meant to be. I can not wait to go to the school and start my new chapter in my life.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Fe College has a beautiful campus. There are many areas for tutoring, studying, and activities. The professors are wonderful."
Junior,5,Overall I feel like Santa Fe College is a great school with many different opportunities and they help you as best as they can to transfer to the school of your choice and try to get you on the right track into getting into the program that you want to study.
Sophomore,5,"Best Community College in the country. Active student organizations, very involved and passionate professors, and a safe environment in a beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,Great School.  New here but everything has been super easy to find and figure out. I really feel like I can excel here and become what I want.  after I get my associates I plan on going to their law enforcement academy
Sophomore,5,I like Santa Fe College. It is a good place to start your career path. The campus is huge and clean and the staf always friendly and the professor too
Sophomore,5,"It's simple if you put in the time and effort, and you care. Your professors will do everything in their power to help you achieve your goals."
Sophomore,5,Santa Fe College is a very beautiful college. Its big but not too big and all the staff are so friendly and caring and strive for our success.
Niche User,5,Santa fe community college is a great representation of Gainesville fl. This town and how seriously we take academics I would like to see more get togethers of the students since there aren't any dorms but we should still be able to join one another outside of school. Great teachers overall and online gets treated just as equal as campus students.
Freshman,5,I love being s student at Santa Fe College. The registration process was easy and convenient. The teachers and professors really care about my academic progress.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Fe is an excellent college that gives everyone an equal opportunity to do their best. On top of being a few miles from one of the top ten universities, Santa Fe offers Associate Programs, guaranteed to get you accepted to the University of Florida. It is very inexpensive and offers a number of scholarships to help those attending college. I would only like to see a change in parking and an update in the class buildings. Being able to offer more bathroom stalls, on top of larger classes, would allow more people to partake and take the classes that work better for them. A change, or increase in parking, closer to campus, also allows people commuting to have less of a chance of being late to class. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Santa Fe and highly recommend it to other people."
Freshman,5,"The first thing I noticed about this school was the amount of resources available for students. This made me feel confident if I ever needed any kind of help in ANY class. I am also a chemistry major and this school is the only community college I have noticed that has classes all the way from intro to chemistry - chemistry 2. They also provide calculus 1 - calculus 3. This makes it to where harder majors can spend more time in smaller classes soaking up as much information without having to be in a huge class that is harder to concentrate in. Also, if you're having a rough time mentally, they provide FREE counseling and they counselors are amazing. This school seems very well put together and I honestly have no complains."
Freshman,5,"So far I have been attending sf college as a freshman and it is excellent. The food choice is great they have a variety of foods that I would assume everyone would like. The resources are great and I consistently use the learning commons for moral support on my essays. I like that there is always someone you can count on tutor wise. There should be no reason to fail. My advisors are also very supportive and make sure that I have all the right pre requisites, classes and courses for my intended university that I want to attend. Most of the professor's I've met so far have been pretty good and would rather have a personal connection than to contemplate via email. Soon enough we all get tired but thank goodness there are plenty of clubs and the rec room is also a good way to relieve stress. They also have many scholarship that help pay for your college tuition such as ambassadors, cap scholars and many other programs. I would recommend this school to anyone I'm grateful to be here."
Junior,5,"Santa Fe College is a great school and I trying to finish my AA now to continue with my bachelors. The campus is really easy to remember and every teacher or employee are really nice. There is of course hard classes, but the teacher are always there to help you understand."
Niche User,5,I've heard alot of good thing's about Santa Fe College! I am planning to start classes I hope by this summer June 2020.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Fe College is a great experience for every student because all the classes are small and allow us to have more connections with our professor. Also, the library and the tutors are really helpful in case we need some help outside the class room."
Niche User,5,"It's a beautiful school, many nice people there, a lot of resources, we can use the University of Florida campus for help too. There are no dorms here, but there's an apartment complex across the street. There's always cops around which makes me feel safe. Campus isn't too dark at night either"
Junior,5,"My experience with Santa Fe College is great. It's not a big school which means the classes are not pact with students. I love this because your able to meet more with your professor. Santa Fe challenge their students, it helps because they prepare you for the future and if you plan on transferring to UF  they want you to go in strong."
Niche User,5,I love this school and i have always thank them for the opportunity they gave me. They are very diverse and are culturally active and always have new activities and things to stimulate your mind beyond working in the class room.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the close knit community that is present at Santa Fe, they also have many opportunities for extra curricular activities and volunteer opportunities. They give students every chance possible to succeed academically."
Freshman,5,"I love Sante Fe. Community college personality with high level academia. Easy accessible. Professors are intelligent, friendly, and care about their students well-being."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at Santa Fe and it's great. The school is close to home which is great for saving gas. The campus is a little spread out so you're definitely gonna get your steps in but it's not bad. The food here is great and the varieties or vending machines if I don't have time for a whole meal. I'm close with my teachers. They want to see me and my classmates succeed. They have a great athletic program and everyone has an opportunity to try-out. The housing is really nice, really up to price but may not be for you is you don't have a job and you're paying for college by yourself with financial aid. I'm really enjoying my first year here at Santa Fe."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is absolutely wonderful. Professsors help the most they can. Students have each other's back. The campus has different resourcces to help you study.
Freshman,5,I'm very new to Santa Fe but so far my experience has been great. The college seems to be very organized and helpful with students. They make sure to engage students in a way that will make them successful not only in college but in life after college.
Sophomore,5,"Great teachers, outdoors, activities every week with hundreds of clubs, excellent advisors and staff. Even though the buildings are not organized alphabetically, you can find your classroom easily because everything has  a sign telling you where to go. Big parking but because there are a lot of students, in the morning its impossible to find a spot."
Freshman,5,"Santa Fe College is a beautiful and small college that focuses on the goals of the students. All of the professors are open to questions and are a very helpful resource. Many students are full-time and have nothing but good things to say about the school and staff. When I walk around the school, I do have the feeling that I am in a very safe environment and I feel free to express myself for who I am. If anyone were to come to me about attending Santa Fe College, I would highly recommend attending because everything there is absolutely amazing."
Niche User,5,"Santa Fe College is an amazing school. I took my dual enrollment courses there and I loved it. At the Davis Center, there are so many helpful advisers who really want to see us succeed as students. Mrs. Shelley personally looks after all of the students and genuinely cares about how we are doing. I have had some really great professors and excellent courses. The Davis Center also keeps free math and writing tutors in the lobby to help any students with classwork. I have really enjoyed being a Santa Fe student."
Junior,5,"Personally, What I like most is the safe and supportive environment the college has created and maintained. Furthermore, any and all teachers I've so far had the pleasure of meeting were understanding and overall pleasant to work with. The college also has a food court a gym and a store on campus."
Sophomore,5,Santa Fe College is the. perfect college for those who aren't sure of what major they want or are uneasy in interacting with strangers. They make you feel comfortable while also. pushing you to do your best.
Niche User,5,I like Santa Fe. I wish they had better food options though. Santa Fe has improved their campus over the years.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school because it gives you all the resources needed to succeed without the expense of a University. It is smaller and quiet and it is the perfect place to go to learn, get an AA or Bachelor's, and start your career in the real world!"
Freshman,5,"I haven't started my time at Santa Fe College yet. My first impression is that it is an amazing school. The campus is nice and small, so everything is within walking distance. The staff I have met so far are very nice and are eager to help you in any way they can. The staff always have a smile on their faces and never give you any attitude when you talk to them. I look forward to starting my time there and getting to know the community better. I look forward to seeing if the teachers are just as enthusiastic as everyone I have met so far."
Freshman,5,"Santa Fe Honors is a place in where to get started if you want to transfer to another University later on , the campus is really big and is always clean , in diversity I would say that there is because you will find someone from every race at Santa Fe , so far I truly feel as the teachers truly care and are always listening"
Graduate Student,5,Enjoy the nursing program. The professors are very friendly and helpful. The students I’ve met are now some of my best friends.
Freshman,5,I like how available the staff is and how they are always available.   I also how open the campus was with programs and activities. The organization was consistent as well as respectable the people were great the college was clean. It was a great experience overall.
Sophomore,5,The campus is very beautiful and everyone is nice and welcoming. classes are small so there's more of a learning connection when it comes to lessons.

Sophomore,5,"I love the professors, the campus, and the education provided. As long as you're active in school then you'll succeed. There are a lot of opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Santa Fe is a great college. If you are not sure what do you want to do after high school, if you are not sure that college is really for you, Santa Fe is a great place to start to see if you would like to continue your education. It has great diversity. The professors are really nice and helpful. There are even part-time jobs on campus. I was really scared after I graduated from high school because I am not from here and nobody from my family went to college here in America. But I decided to take a shot at it. And I love the College. The environment is so peaceful. The college has events every week for students to enjoy. Santa Fe College is a community where all students feel comfortable and safe. The food is great here. The college always posts new information on the website for students to follow. There are also so many volunteer opportunities through student life. There is always someone to help you there.  Overall, I love Santa Fe College."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I love Santa Fe College. The professors at the school are very professional and I love the fact that the advisors are actually there to help you succeed. The resources they have available are incredible. I honestly couldn’t have chose a better school to continue my education! Nothing major needs to be changed, although there could be some better restaurants."
Alum,5,"Santa Fe College has been an absolutely amazing college for me to attend! I moved here in 2010 and took classes for a couple years and then decided to take a break. I just ended up getting my AA in 2018 and let me tell you that Santa Fe College made my experience there so memorable. I received a ""Finish At The Top"" medal, one that is rewarded to students like myself who took time off from school and came back and graduated. The campus is beautiful and quaint, with classes sizes of 30 or less. There are multiple campuses in surrounding counties, so anyone who is fortunate enough to be able to go here should definitely take advantage of the opportunity!"
Freshman,5,Santa Fe College is very versatile and has allowed me to take classes online while I work full time. My  teachers are readily available and keep my progress updated.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the atmosphere of this college. It's very friendly and welcoming. The staff is very helpful and kind to the students. Most of my professors are very sweet and want their students to pass the class.
Freshman,5,"I like the student unity and spirit of Santa Fe. The school can get overshadowed by UF next door but nonetheless, you feel apart of a family. The staff are extremely helpful and seem genuine. From a personal standpoint, the professors are hit or miss."
Junior,5,Great experience! College professors are always there to help you find out any information! I have attended Santa Fe for a year it has been great so far no complaints.
Alum,5,"Santa Fe College is such a wonderful place to start your college experience. They have small class sizes, great professors, lots of classes to choose from, and a nice campus. I was there for 2 years and enjoyed every moment there. I got the chance to study abroad while there and never had a bad experience with anything. I would highly recommend starting your college here. They also have really good AS programs."
Freshman,5,"Santa Fe is small and comfortable and really feels like a good in-between step from high school to a university! The campus is lively and easy to navigate, and my only real issue is with the lack of parking!"
Freshman,5,Santa Fe College has a lot of good programs of study. The have online classes for people who can't make it to the campus for classes. They have more then one campus location. The staff is friendly and the website is easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,"This School is amazing. Santa fe makes it unbelievably easy for first year college students to transition from a dependent life style to an independent lifestyle. Perfect college transition, the classes are intimate and tge professors are profoundly astonishing. Attending Santa fe is breathtakingly underwhelming."
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Santa Fe for almost two years now and I have really enjoyed my experience there. I feel like it is a perfect place to start out instead of going to a big university. I have had a great academic team to help me be successful. I have had some issues with professors, but I wouldn't blame that on the school."
Sophomore,4,"I have been completing online classes ever since I started with Santa Fe two summers ago. I enjoyed taking online classes with Santa Fe, but I have struggled with some classes. I think with Santa Fe online classes really depend on the professor to make it a great class. I would recommend doing a lot of research about the class and the professor before taking an online class with them."
Freshman,4,It works very well. Teachers that were not used to the system adjusted smoothly. I will continue to use online schooling until I graduate.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy classroom sizing and even my experience with online this semester was a breeze. Looking into professors before deciding helps alot. Overall I like the atmosphere the campus provides. I enjoy driving a hour away to attend school here. I could not imagine going to school anywhere else!
Freshman,4,My online experience was fair. Most of my professors used zoom to teach and assignments were sent in online. The level of help and dedication for the students remained the same as an in-person class.
Freshman,4,Santa Fe College has good teachers that make time for the students. They help make sure everyone understands the material. The campus is a good size.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes with Santa Fe were actually a better experience than in class, it was very organized and laid out nicely for every online class I have taken. Canvas is the platform they use."
Graduate Student,4,"I enrolled in 3 online classes and they were well organized. The classes still had structure and instructions were easy to follow. I took Music of the World, ENC1102, and ASL. I would feel comfortable taking more online classes at Santa Fe."
Alum,4,Great atmosphere and teachers who care. Diverse environment that's inclusive and welcoming. All advisors are willing to help whenever they can.
Alum,4,"Students use canvas for their classes anyways, so having classes online through canvas was really simple. Teachers are there to help and are very lenient with online work."
Freshman,4,"Online learning done right! Santa Fe has trouble free, easy classes tailored to the students needs and time. Learning made easy, with a wonderful staff, and professors to overachieve expectations by far."
Freshman,4,"The short time I’ve had has been great! Incredible programs, opportunities, and room to flourish. Santa Fe is a College meant for growth at whatever pace you may choose. It is an overall affordable, and smart decision when looking for Colleges in Florida to choose from."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful but it's easy to get lost. Most people are very friendly and the professors are always very good I've never had a bad experience with anyone here. If you don't mind small class sizes and having to wait a long time to get help then this is the campus for you.
Niche User,4,"While attending Santa Fe, I took three online classes and one traditional class. I went to Santa Fe's testing center for each of my exams and have no complaints, they made all of their expectations clear and were extremely helpful. One difficulty of mine was finding the correct person to speak with about some of my questions. I was sent from one person to another, being told that they were the correct person for my question. Besides my inability to guess the correct advisor the first time, Santa Fe was a great school."
Freshman,4,"When the classes are meant to be online, the professors usually know what they are doing and I am able to learn the material. However, due to recent events with COVID and transitioning to online courses, there are professors who are lacking in the knowledge of how to use the online system."
Sophomore,4,All of my online classes at Santa Fe College have been very accommodating. They try to make learning online easier for you and help you out when you need it.
Alum,4,A great place to start your education at a fraction of big public and private universities. Santa Fe prepared me to transfer to some of the best schools in the country.
Junior,4,"Santa Fe has been a great college experience so far. I have taken classes on campus and now I have been taking classes online mostly. The teachers are all pretty much helpful, experienced and easily accessible."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Fe College is a small college, but that comes with some advantages. The small class sizes provide an increased connection between the professor and student. However, there are limited classes in certain degrees, and this college definitely caters towards the arts rather than sciences."
Senior,4,"My experience at Santa Fe has been good overall, the only problem I have come across was some professors are very bias and don't grade fairly. Luckily for me I have been lucky with a majority of my professors."
Alum,4,"Santa Fe is a wonderful college and offers many different majors to meet growing needs in the community.  I was very pleased with the professors as well as the town and would encourage students to consider Santa Fe.  Even though it is only a few miles from the University of Florida which is a great school, Santa Fe offers smaller class sizes, a much smaller campus and it is easier to get help one on one with your teachers."
Junior,4,Way better than the competing colleges around. Four year is a plus. Very affordable when compared to the university. Good quality for pay. Financial aid is extremely helpful and has funded most of my schooling! Teachers are always available and seem to want to help you succeed. So glad I chose Santa Fe as my college after leaving two prior schools.
Niche User,4,"The administration has no clue what is going on most of the time, but the courses are cheap, accessible, and easy."
Freshman,4,They are very helpful when it comes to needing help on something. They are truly caring individuals. The professors want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,I'm currently attending Santa Fe before transferring to UF and I really enjoy having low class sizes and being able to freely make my schedule however I choose.
Sophomore,4,Many professors are genuinely concerned with your education and will do their best to help you. Small class sizes are super beneficial.
Sophomore,4,Santa Fe College does a great at touring and having professors that are above par. Clubs at Santa Fe are semi-active. It is very hard to find things that support your passion without varying off completely when it is not effective. I do love my campus a lot. Security on campus is amazing.
Sophomore,4,"Santa fe college is a very good college, whose professors are invested in helping their students grow and succeed, the campus has a very fun climate, and the college is very diverse."
Junior,4,So when ever my sister  would take me to her school. I really like walking around campus seeing the some artwork that is on the wall. And my sister  tells me there is a lot a good programs  in campus.   So the future job that I want Is to become a pediatric physical therapist. And would like to help kids  with there needs.
Sophomore,4,"Great school! I love it there. The professors are, for the most part, very helpful and tends to care. The info you learn actually sticks."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Santa Fe College has been absolutely exceptional. The staff, including counselors and professors, have been supportive and helpful throughout my college journey so far. Santa Fe College is an accepting environment for people of all places and various beliefs, making it comfortable for the students and faculty. Santa Fe College has a sizeable campus with areas in almost every building for studies and socialization. Overall, Santa Fe College has helpful resources, supportive faculty, and a welcoming environment for students and others."
Sophomore,4,The Classes are decently sized and the professors are always available. The campus is always clean and having activities. There are several programs and clubs to keep you active and engaged.
Freshman,4,"I like that it's actually very diverse and I also like the professors that I've taken, all have been useful and wonderful to be a student for."
Junior,4,"I love how much diversity there is at Santa Fe College. Meeting new people and hearing about different cultures/backgrounds is so interesting to me. Also, there are so many student organizations to get involved in! Having amazing professors that really care about your experience makes Santa Fe College a great place for creativity, research, and learning!"
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed the teachers and staff of Santa Fe College. They all were very professional and many knew how to teach their class material in a way that was engaging to the students. I also spent time working with the College police department as a work study. It was my first really experience law enforcement and it I am happy to report that the officers who protect that campus are the most well suited for the job. I would say my only critique is that many of their Bachelors' programs don't accept many credits from their corresponding A.S. programs. I feel that more should be done to make it so their is a smoother transition for students to transition from a two year degree track to an undergraduate major.
Freshman,4,Santa Fe is has a very friendly environment and so far my class schedules are very convenient. The teachers are great as well.
Senior,4,"Very nice campus and decent amenities for a community college.  Offer help with adjusting to college life and students wanting to transfer to UF.  Always have groups set up on campus to introduce students to clubs, apartments in area and other campus amenities. And they give away free food, t-shirts, cups/mugs, etc!"
Freshman,4,"Santa Fe college is a really nice experience. Everything about it so far is really pleasing: The atmosphere is nice ,with a very cultural and diverse campus filled with a bunch activities to do. The classes are great with very nice professors that want to see you succeed."
Freshman,4,The community is so diverse and everyone around is so nice! It is is easy to make friends and communicate with people. The professors are good at their jobs and most offer extra help. Since the classes are smaller it is easier to ask questions and have one on ones. There are free tutoring centers as well. I recommend Santa Fe college!
Freshman,4,"I find the campus easy to mange, the administration is very helpful, and all the professors I have I great and always there to help!"
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and how much outdoor feels it have. The food is great and the academics they have is also very good.
Freshman,4,The counselor are great and they help you with everything you need. Before you start your program you can see all the prerequisites and contact counselor for any question that you may have
Freshman,4,"Nice campus, easy to apply. Good safety programs. Easy to navigate and find information when needed."
Niche User,4,"I live really close to Santa Fe College, which makes getting an education more affordable and convenient."
Freshman,4,"I was a dual enrollment student (a high school student taking college classes), i loved the fact that i was able to express our opinions in class and leave more educated than when i came. The math tutors are excellent people they helped me pass college algebra, my favorite was Luke."
Freshman,4,Love the professors and degree options. Flexible class times and good sizes. Campus is well maintained and is secure. Lots of diversity and different cultures.
Niche User,4,Santa Fe is an amazing school to dual enroll at! The supportive teachers and counselors are wonderful at guiding and preparing you for your future endeavors! The teachers truly passionate about their work and take every opportunity to help you. The school will hopefully keep expanding on the majors they offer for the bachelor degree.
Freshman,4,"Santa Fe is a great college, the campus is beautiful and there are multiple campuses around Alachua and Bradford county. I have not any bad experiences here, and everybody is so eager help and advise the students to be the best they can be."
Junior,4,"Most the professors I have had so far are extremely helpful and caring. The campus is nice and clean, and has a lot of study space for students. My only complain would be sometimes administrators can be hard to talk with and rush your time."
Freshman,4,Santa Fe is a great College that helps you adapt to a college style education and college life. The education is great and the academic assistance given to first time students alleviates most of the stress when first going to college.
Junior,4,Santa Fe College is a pretty nice campus.  They have a lot of green efforts to use renewable energy and have a lot of diverse programs of study.
Niche User,4,"At the beginning of this school year, I started a dual enrollment course here. I can safely say that my experience with the college has been a positive one. This is mainly due to how helpful the professors were, and the campuses welcoming environment. These things allowed for me to excel in my course, along with learning new studying techniques. I am happy to say that after my high school graduation I intend on becoming a full time student there and will earn my A.A. degree there. Santa Fe is a great place to start your college education at, and I'm excited for it to help me more in the future."
Alum,4,Santa Fe College has been the best experience of my life. The college is always warm and welcoming. I wouldn't trade my experience here for the world. Anything you want to pursue Santa Fe can help you with. Also their counselors are fantastic. I honestly love this campus so much. Santa Fe College will always hold a place in my heart.
Sophomore,4,I love it here! I love the teachers. They're always nice and really helpful. And the campus grounds are beautiful!
Junior,4,"Santa Fe is a great campus with a lot of different majors available. The only thing they need to fix, is the ability to retake a class is you got a C or D. Currently, you are unable to retake a class unless you fail or withdraw."
Freshman,4,"Santa Fe has been a wonderful experience overall! I love all my professors and the campus environment is always so friendly and welcoming. My first semester for me personally was a little tough with family issues arising that semester and adjusting to the new city. But, my last few months have been great knowing I have professors who actually care if I succeed."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Santa Fe and I feel that the advisors and professors really took the time to help me get my AA as efficiently as I could. I was able to expand my knowledge through interesting classes and as a current junior at the University of Florida, I feel well-equipped with the tools that I received. The education offered at Santa Fe is just as sufficient as UF, and I think by making the most of your time there accompanied with a willingness to learn, a person can be incredibly successful."
Junior,4,Santa Fe is a great college to start out at. They have a variety of programs and degrees to choose from. The small class size makes learning more involved which is a plus compared to the University of Florida that has a hundred plus students in their classrooms. It is conveniently located by the interstate for those who do not live locally. My only complaint would be the lack in variety of food options within our cafeteria.
Sophomore,4,Santa Fe is a very good school and a second chance if you are trying to transfer. The teachers are normally very good and tend to go the extra mile to help you succeed. The small class size is wonderful for engagement with the material.
Sophomore,4,SF really is a wonderful stepping stone for those who would like to transfer to UF. They offer many programs that directly link with the university and offer many of the same majors. The small class sizes mean every student actually gets to meet their professors and ask questions in an interactive setting. The campus is beautiful and extremely clean and easy to navigate. The surrounding area is also full of students so making friends is a breeze.
Sophomore,2,The only reason they make classes so hard is because the normal is to transfer to UF. They don't really offer a sense of community you look for in college.
Sophomore,2,I was attacked on campus and although they help get the person who did it off campus not a lot was down to help me afterwards.
Junior,2,"The professors are more concerned about themselves than helping their students. Often the professors were telling stories during class and then rushed through the actual material. When you needed help, getting an email back took days which ended up being no help to the student. The tests were based on material that was not all taught to the students."
Sophomore,2,"The nursing program regrettably has become more of a money maker for the college now that it's an an accelerated program, as opposed to how it used to be. A lot of the good professors have left the program because of the way they now do things, you may be one of the lucky ones who gets pushed through, but you may not?  I'd look elsewhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are some positives about the school, but they were outweighed by poor attitudes and active attempts to undermine student success by non-teaching support staff and administration. These incompetents working in support feel entitled to disrupt the student's career at the drop of a hat. The professors are often fairly good but overworked. The assistants hired to assist the professors don't always help them. There are a lot of online courses taking the place of teachers, and in some of those, third parties are involved. You can run into classes where no care is put into planning the work load for the students. It is a crapshoot how things will go for you. It is nonetheless possible to get a good education if you can sidestep the obstacles. Not everyone manages to do that. The bookstore also has been known to interfere in allowing someone to graduate on time if you were a day or two late turning in a rental book and can't afford the exorbitant penalty fee, until you can manage it."
College Senior,2,"I have been a student at Santa Fe for two years. Over the past two years I have not seen or heard about employers recruiting on campus. There are some job postings from time to time on the various bulletin boards on campus however,  the advertisement and information for internship opportunities are lacking."
College Sophomore,2,I have personally not seen any type of job/internship prospects on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I made a huge mistake by joining Santa Fe's Dual Enrollment program. I was very unprepared for what was ahead of me. Working two jobs and trying to run track, my grades suffered. My GPA dropped down to 1.8. I'm no longer qualified for financial aid and can only afford to take one class per semester in order to bring my GPA back up. I'm in desperate need of a scholarship or any kind of financial help."
College Freshman,2,Some of the professors don't explain themselves clearly during the lectures and often times there is a very limited space on classes that get full quickly
College Freshman,2,Im just the type of person that needs a teacher in front of them. Online classes tend to be confusing and deadlines tend to get mixed up
College Sophomore,2,"Taking an online course depends on everyone's preference, but on my case, it didn't went so well but I did learn a lot in class on campus. I had a lot of free time on my hands and I tend to forget that I have an online class. The professor likes to grade harshly and very mininum feedback as well."
College Senior,2,Not associated or involved. What I read though is that it is terribly unorganized and fights always break out.
College Junior,2,My personal learning style isn't good for online classes.
College Freshman,2,"I find myself frustrated on a regular basis now that I have moved onto my core classes for my major.  I find my professors and classes to be very inconsistent, often struggling because of my professor rather than the material."
College Freshman,2,I feel that the classroom experience is completely reliant on who the professor is; and many professors feel they can overstep administration in regards to what they teach vs they should be teaching.
College Freshman,2,The wireless is incredibly slow and I often find myself unable to use it.
College Freshman,2,The wifi around campus is always hard to come by since it seems to always be down. Then multiple times while being in the library the printing has been down as well.
College Junior,2,"The one thing that annoys me is the wireless connection at Santa Fe. The signal goes out periodically and has a hard time uploading/downloading files and loading videos. The computers on campus that use ethernet are fast but still not what I would like. The printers and scanners are easy to use though, and very useful!"
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a respiratory care major, and to get in the program is rediculous with the limited amount of seats they have and the requirements."
College Sophomore,2,classes are not always available
Recent Alumnus,2,"My education is very important to me, Santa Fe overall to me needs better advisers in the financial aide office, I feel as though they did not try to help me after a lot was not satisfied and needed funds for school."
College Sophomore,2,The first year when you're a freshman they go out of their way to help you but as soon as you're no longer a freshman they don't care and won't help you. A friend of mine had to skip his second fall semester because financial aid had screwed up. One out of four is still bad.
College Senior,2,"There is always something going on, on campus. The student body is very friendly. Most of the time the age difference I your class may vary because of people who quit and came back to college."
College Senior,2,"I have not graduated,  and therefore I am not familiar with the post graduate services at Santa Fe College. I can speak to the effort the school puts into getting its transfer students into the University of Florida. There is a very knowledgeable advising staff to help with transition."
College Senior,2,"I am not good at taking online classes. They have no incentive for me. I took a history class and the professor really tried to work with me, but I'm a tactile and visual learner"
College Freshman,2,"The wireless network appears available all over campus, but its functionality is a different story. School computers that are plugged in directly have a decent connection speed, however. I wouldn't recommend trying to turn in a paper online unless school computers were available."
College Freshman,2,I think that the tution is fair. The financial aid office is not the most helpful. It is hard to get someone on the phone and when you go there the tellers only give you generic answers and make you feel like you are wasting their time. I also wish that they would offer to help you find alternatives if your financial aid request is denied.
College Senior,2,"Tuition is reasonable, that is why they received a C-, if it was based solely on financial aid they would have received a ""F"" grade.  I have been dealing with financial aid, different person every time and different answers each time.  I was told I was getting financial aid all along and then today I was told I am not and have fees I have to pay.  Very bad experience."
College Junior,2,"The education at Santa Fe was worth the money. Financial aid was a process and has given me some trouble with receiving financial this past year. Some tips for getting financial aid that i would suggest is applying early for it, making sure you go talk to a financial aid advisor, and not to wait till the last minute to do so."
College Senior,2,The education involved is worth it but the financial aid office seems to have a staff that doesn't suit the needs of the students.
College Sophomore,2,"Its gonna be difficult at first since Santa fe is known for their nursing/medical program, but if you really buckle down you can make it through all of your classes and it definitely gets you better prepared for your next set of classes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Out of State Hassles – Tuition is an acceptable amount for being out of state. I feel like it's worth it to get where I want to be. Although I've had to figure out the procedures for tuition and changing my residency myself, I found plenty of resources and help for myself."
College Junior,2,Never Enough – There are alot of students so there is not always a computer available when you need it. Printing costs are a little annoying simply because there are actual students who print stuff for classes. We shouldn't have to pay for that too since we are spending a fortune on classes and books.
College Freshman,2,There's not a lot of alumni network or career center based areas. Its a state college so not as advanced.
College Senior,2,"Bring Paper, Be Prepared, Free Gym – As far as resources go, the school has some highs and lows.
Printing requires the paying student to bring paper and limits there pages to 20, which was manageable when the printer could print both sides. One of them is usually down which requires walking to another building in Florida heat and praying it will work there. Don't procrastinate.
The library and student center do their jobs, I spend 40 hours a week between classes and clinic to check out any campus activities. The college looks very ""80's"" in architecture, if that really matters.
Free gym."
College Junior,2,"Managerial Accounting – For me online classes were very smilar to on campus courses. The professors had videos, audio lectures, additional help sections, discussion boards, and were available for chat sessions to allow for a good learning experience. The same materials available for on campus students are available for the online students as well. The course was very well orchestrated."
College Senior,2,"Computer Labs – The computer labs are okay. The one in the health science department has inconsiderate employees and the printer has been broken for three moths now. Everywhere else you must pay to print. Out tuition is going up every year and we still pay for printing. Instructors will rarely hand out paper assignents or instructions. The Internet is either down or very slow. They've been ""fixing"" it since August of 2010."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My Tuition – I would expect a little more money from the college, because I don't only have school to pay for, I have to live and eat and put gas in my car to make it to school. Jobs are hard to come by. Need more financial aid"
College Senior,2,Turn in Forms Directly to the Office – The financial aid office at my school is frustrating. One time I mailed them the required form and they didn't recieve it. Then I faxed it and they still said they did not recieve it. From now on I just hand them my documents directly.
College Sophomore,2,i my field i know there will always be a job avaliable even at the school i graduate from.
Works Here,1,"they smell, the bathroom is gross. i cant handle the stench outside. Are you kidding me? I pay 8,000 a year to go to the smelly ol school. I'll be damned!"
Freshman,1,As an African American student I️ feel judged and looked down on because of my color. Most of the staff are not very helpful or friendly to African American students. I️ was being mistreated by one of the teachers and once I️ reported it they told me to “suck it up and deal with it”. I️ would not recommend!
College Sophomore,1,"I had a hard navigating it and it was not up by the time the first day of class, so I dropped it."
College Junior,1,Online classes sound easy and convenient but are the total opposite. Professors do not engage in conversations and there is no interaction with other students. You are assigned a reading and you teach yourself . Registering for the classes is extremely easy but the rest of the course is a nightmare. Would not recommend this to anyone.
College Freshman,1,"I find the online courses and online grading programs to be incredibly frustrating.  I have often found my grade suffering due to computer errors, inability to connect to the program, and issues with contacting professors."
College Junior,1,"Tuition is fine, it is expected from a college. But as I said earlier, financial aid SUCKS! they are slow, charge way to much money and cancel your aid right before it is due, so I had to pay out of pocket. The student aids are obnoxious and bossy, and all of the clerks that i have dealt with, have thick accents. Books are horribly expensive too if your financial aid fails you. I hate the financial aid process so much it is sickening."
College Senior,1,The wireless network is super slow and drops a lot
College Sophomore,1,um staff does not like to help students with anything. they do not care if the students need help or not . i was shooed me when i tried to get help and info on classes. i do not think they r worth my time but i need an education so i will go to school and find my own way of help and info from now on.
College Sophomore,1,peer to peer interaction was good but the professor to student wasnt worth a crap.
College Freshman,1,"I felt like I had to jump through an impossible amount of hoops just to get my financial aid -- and as an out-of-state student, it was extra-frustrating. When it came time for me to finally receive my aid, I found out that many of the classes required for my degree were not being taken into consideration with my aid because of a technicality. It was ridiculous and it took me entirely too long for me to receive my funds.
But, I did receive my funds eventually, and I guess that's nothing to sneeze at."
Recent Alumnus,1,The administration here has been extremely difficult. I've been lied to and had people change their stories on me more than once. I've dealt with rude advisors and administrators who were supposed to be helping me sort things out and look at my options. I felt like they had no faith in my ability and discredited me before they even knew me or my situation.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid area of Santa Fe was not of much help to me. They did not provide me with much information at all. It was as if they just wanted me out of the office as fast as possible.
College Sophomore,1,Post-Grad Services – The quality of the career center was not good when I went there. The person I talked to made me feel even more uncertain about what I would be doing with my future and what career path I wanted to take. I left feeling more confused about what I was going to do with my life.
College Freshman,1,"Insufficient Attention to Labs – On the corresponding campus named ARCHER CAMPUS students recieved a locked in grade afffecting final gpa""s due to a virus in the archer campus computer lab no make up days were given by the enc 1101 which also turned out to be the english adminisrtator for main campus and uf you cant talk to that guy about a problem im the enc dept who can ya''"
Recent Alumnus,1,Lunch Lines – We have a limited 50 min. lunch period. Its complicating to wait in line for 30 min then have only 20 min to hurry and finish your meal and still have time to socialize with friends
College Junior,1,I don't feel satisfied with the amount of help that anyone at my school has given me in lieu of my financial aid. I wasn't even made aware of any financial aid opportunities until it was way too late. The line is always ridiculously long at the financial aid office and the staff act like they're too busy/important to deal with you. It's just a generally negative experience. I've turned to rely completely on internet sources to find my financial aid.
College Senior,1,"Santa Fe – Once again, professors suck!!  They do offer a decent variety of classes and registration isn't too bad."
College Senior,1,Santa Fe – Professors suck and most are very unprofessional.  It is almost impossible to talk to anyone in any of the offices without being put on hold for an hour.  No way I would recommend this school to anyone.  Can't wait to get outta this hole.

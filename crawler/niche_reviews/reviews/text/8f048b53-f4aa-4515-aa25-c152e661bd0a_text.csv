Junior,5,I like the teachers how they engage with the students.  many teachers tend to give some time to the students and actually help with anything they might need help with.
Junior,5,yes I have been taking online courses since my sophomore year in college. I haven't really found any issues except that sometimes it can get over whelming when being in small spaces if not able to access big spacey quite places. I have also been dealing with my computer breaking down as time passes.
Senior,5,I have loved attending National Louis University. I attend as a full time online student and their classes are almost always straight forward and easy. The few classes I've had issues with I've been able to e-mail and get transferred out of the class with little to no issue. The teachers have always been involved and fairly quick to answer e-mails.
Senior,5,Taking online classes is all I take at NLU. The classes are broken into 10 week 'modules' that are easy to follow and navigate. The Professors are always available during their office hours to offer support and are quick to answer e-mails. Grading the course work can take a bit of time but otherwise it's been great.
Senior,5,Online classes provided the perfect opportunity to work full time as well as attend school full time.
Sophomore,5,The online classes are great to have. You are able to do your work when it fits in your schedule. Search online for things within the campus is easy to.
Freshman,5,National luis university is the greatest college because they helped me how to enroll and I really feel so much good About it and i Really like their staff member
Freshman,5,I really like this college Because they helped me to enroll and I really feel so good about it I really like it
Junior,5,Communication is great! I can always expect to get my problems solved on the same day. The class room sizes are perfect size. I am able to get one on one help with my professors if I need it. I am a online student & they really do make the class work flexible for full time workers or parents.
Junior,5,All of my classes are based online. My professors did a great at making sure I had the tools that I need to fully understand the material I was learning. My professors also provided amazing feedback & guidance for different assignments throughout the semester.
Alum,5,Online learning was just as great as in class learning. We engaged with our peers through discussion boards and our cohort really got to know one another. We were such a close group and we all helped each other succeed.
Alum,5,I did a 3+1 program with COD and NLU and it was a great experience. I learned a lot and didn't have to travel to the NLU campus the professors came to COD and  we got discounted pricing. The staff and professors were great and very focused on us succeeding and learning.
Sophomore,5,my online experience was amazing and it was very flexible with my work schedule. The teachers are available for you with good office hours. They make online classes very easy to follow and flow with. If you have any problems while taking online classes they offer to help in every way. I would recommend online classes for any working parent that don't have the time to attend on campus classes.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at National Louis University has been fantastic. From the advisers  to the teachers on down to the student support center. I have had the experience of going to class on site and online and they both were wonderful experiences. The teachers really work with you and they are very patience with you. If you have a crisis they are so willing to help you and make sure you are okay. When you are having trouble in the classes the teacher will recommend tutors for you and if you need a tutor even their schedules are pretty flexible. The advisers help one another and support you even when they are not your assigned adviser. I would recommend National Louis to any and everyone, it is an awesome university."
Freshman,5,Classes online were good. Teachers were making sure that students were doing good in classes and will ask them questions if needed help.
Junior,5,Being able to get my degree online is so helpful when I have a full time job. Being able to take my classes whenever I am free and wherever I am.
Junior,5,"My experience so far at this school is very excellent. I have many professors and my academic coach that helps me and motivates me to do better. I highly recommend this school to my friends who are interested in staying close to home, and want to be at a school that's small, and the classes and not overwhelming, and you have classes with those who have the same major as you."
Senior,5,"I am a new transfer student here at National Louis University. I am extremely pleased with how accommodating the counselors, advisors, and teachers have been. Financing school has been difficult for me. Even though I am independent and have been for years, the government still looks at my parents who do not support me. So they limit my funds and leave me to pay more than I can handle. However the financial advisors here have been very understanding and have helped me to the best of their ability. School is scary but it is even more scary when you cannot afford it."
Junior,5,I love how classes are available. There is a variety on them. I can choose from online to even on campus. This helps me a lot because I work full-time so I have a lot to choose from.
Freshman,5,Meeting the people at Kendall is great. I love how friendly the students and staff are. I feel really welcomed and loved at Kendall.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at National Louis University was more than I expected. Everyone is willing to help with whatever you need. More importantly, the staff is very friendly and genuinely kind. Something I would change about National Louis is their policy with debts. I feel like students should have more time to pay their tuition fees and have more opportunities."
Senior,5,I have been pleasantly surprised on how thorough and knowledgeable all of the people are that work there. I have had many questions and they have been so helpful. The online teachers are also very much available for us as well!!
Junior,5,Kendall College gave me the hands on experience and skills that’s needed to succeed in the Hospitality field today. Small classrooms and hands on courses. Love it!
Freshman,5,National Louis university has been the best opportunity for me and I realized that this school gave me a purpose to fulfill my dreams and make them come true and I love everything about my school .
Junior,5,"I love NLU.  The advisors, professors, library learning support and technical support are so helpful.  I could graduate in one year if only I can get enough financial aid."
Freshman,5,"I am a pretty shy student so I prefer that classes are small, and that's the case with NLU. So I am getting that connection with my professors. I also like the schedule for classes here. Every week I am done with only one day on campus which leaves me with other four days where I can work freely. I also like that I got a laptop from the university and this is helping me a lot with my studies and all the homework. I actually take two classes online and the laptop was much needed for these courses. So,overall I really like National Louis University."
Junior,5,I am a transfer student at National Louis University in Chicago and my experience here has been GREAT! The professors here are very dedicated to helping you achieve your goals. They are very understanding and knowledgeable about what they are teaching their students.
Senior,5,I like that National Louis University gives me the opportunity to take my courses online. This gives me a chance to work full-time and also go to school full-time online to pursue my Bachelors Degree in Business Management. I am looking forward to graduating in February and to start looking into receiving my Master's Degree in Accounting in the future. I have had a great experience with my professors and am excited about my future after National Louis University.
Niche User,5,I like how the classroom sizes are smaller and how they are going to expand the campus. The tuition is also very affordable!
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Kendall has been splendid! I've had accommodations with most of my classes throughout my time at Kendall College and it helps me a lot, keeps me under a lot of stress, and I'm able to turn in assignments efficiently. The teachers have been very kind helping me throughout this process so I'm especially grateful for each and every one. I wouldn't change anything about Kendall as it's a perfectly fine school."
Freshman,5,"Ive been getting a good understanding of how everything is going to go, and Ive been in contact with my success coaches and been well informed.Any questions that I had was answered and I feel like my college experience is already off to a good start."
Freshman,5,I love how they have success coaches that check on you and make sure everything is going ok. I was given helpful tips to help me be successful.
Niche User,5,"Because I am a new college freshman- it is really hard to find the perfect college and fit for a senior graduate that has to desperately make a change in life.  To me, NLU was the one. I knew in myself that I waned to move out and begin my pathway but for now, I was just not ready. It was too soon and ?I was not ready to be home sick. Thankfully, I can do NLU at the campus in Wheeling that is about 30 minutes away and the last two years I can move to Chicago and begin my adventure. Nevertheless, NLU is such a heart-warming, welcoming, friendly school that brings such a positive enviornment, which I truly love. Something I would change about them would be to not be so quiet. NLU is such a great school an they don't spread the word as much."
Freshman,5,What I liked about National Louis University is that it was small and you get to learn better. What I would like to change is the diversity.
Graduate Student,5,Enrollment specialist was quite informative with the educational leadership graduate program. Provided all of the information that was needed and answered any and every question. Extremely helpful and understanding.
Junior,5,"My 3 year experience so far has been great. Stressful, but not terrible. One thing that I would really love is dorms or student apartments near the school. That would be very convenient for people who live an 1hr+ away from the school in public transportation, like me. It would also give students the feel of living on your own after college, so you have that experience as well."
Freshman,5,I am an online student and love this school. I have learned so much in the last two semesters.  Thank you for taking the time out to work with me. I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for me.
Graduate Student,5,More Scholarships offered especially to Alumni.  I attended National Louis 20 years ago and I had to use loans and grants.  I am a graduate student now and I need a little help with my education.  So I believe more access to scholarships and full ride scholarships would afford more students attend National Louis university.
Graduate Student,5,One thing that differentiate National Louis University from others in my experience was willing to be there for students.
Freshman,5,National Louis University is a good college but needs improvement in student life and campus safety and food.
Senior,5,I love the level of motivation and support that the staff insures. The concentration on individuals is like no other. I have had moments that I felt like I wanted to quit and I was pushes in the best way by the support staff.
Sophomore,5,I’m actually at the Chicago campus! It’s a very friendly- oriented yet professional. This is my dream school. Everyone has such a drive to learn and earn their bachelors. I have feel right at home!
Sophomore,5,"National Louis university is a very accommodating university! I firmly believe this institution definitely shows appreciation and importance to every individual attending. Class sizes  are a minimal of 15 students which allows the instructor to interact with students and get to personally know them as well. It definitely makes an individual feel at home because being that it is a small class size- you meet all classmates and become comfortable with each other. Moreover, National Louis university is very diverse. It’s an amazing experience to meet new people and as you build friendships- you learn about each other other cultures! I wouldn’t change anything from this university, I believe they operate very well!"
Senior,5,"I recently transferred to National Louis University for my fourth year of college and I really love everything so far. The professors are very nice and helpful, the work is mostly online and convenient. The financial aid office is very helpful and my academic advisor is always available to answer any questions I have. The environment is very open and students have been very nice as well."
Freshman,5,The chefs and professors are wonderful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The campus food is amazing because they are made by the culinary students. Everything on campus is fun and the coffee is AMAZING. Every university needs cheap and great coffee. All the students are nice and approachable and it's all due to the atmosphere.
Junior,5,"A very good college, excellent early childhood education program, very diverse and the professors are excellent in building a  supportive professor/student relationships to make sure the student succeeds in their academic growth."
Sophomore,5,"I'm taking online courses so some of these items dont apply to me.  Thus far, my experience has been great.   Looking forward to more courses.  It is very difficult to work full time and go to school.  NLU has been good to me.  They keep me focuses and motivated.  I needed someone to push me and they did.  I'm very happy to be continuing my education after so many years.   It is time to look towards the future."
Junior,5,The communication is great and the environment is friendly. I always received follow up emails and they worked with me very well on getting me back enrolled. I do like that they offer online classes that gives me an opportunity to finish school without the commuting.
Niche User,5,"Great University!I'm a student here and absolutely love it. Highly recommend checking this institution out. Very affordable, flexible, professional and supportive undergraduate experience. I will definitely be coming back for my masters at NLU."
Sophomore,5,National Louis University is a great school!  I am an undergraduate student and even though I am still unsure what to major in the coaches and staff are great and give me a lot of support to choose the right career.
Sophomore,5,Great experience! From the minute you enroll and speak with an Advisor up to all communication with Fin Aid department. The instructors are amazing. Really make you feel comfortable and help you understand the material easily.
Niche User,5,I haven't been there but I would love to attend this college and study for culinary arts and pastry chef.
Junior,5,I love this school. They offer so many opportunities here and networking and meeting new people is great. It's a very diverse school so it's great to learn with people from all around the world.
Graduate Student,5,"I loved getting my education at NLU. I loved it so much that I’m going back to get my masters! The professors, advisors and other staff members are great."
Freshman,5,"National Louis Universty is such an amazing school. I love all the support I get from the staff. I really like the fact that we are provided with student success coaches, to help guide you on the right path. I love the environment of the school, the professors are amazing. So much support in every aspect at NLU!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience here has been great there are great people, education, and a few clubs here that would make anyone happy and excited to become a part of Kendall."
Freshman,5,"It's my first year at the PACE program at NLU. I love it! It is the greatest experience I have ever had. Everyone is great, I have learned so much not only educational but about myself."
Junior,5,Kendall is an awesome college for early childhood education degree and gives you the right classes and experience to learn the material for your degree. The online courses for first-timers can take some time getting use to but once you taken a course online it's a simple process.
Niche User,5,I'm going to be a student in National Louis but i really like how good the school looks I think that they will help me out and get a wonderful job in the future to help my mom out
Junior,5,"I love being able to get my degree on-line while working full time. I wouldn't change anything. From Financial Aid to the professors, everything is great!"
Senior,4,I like the campus facilities and dedicated teachers and staff. Nothing is set in stone and the staff will work one on one with you to ensure you have everything you need for your degree plan.
Sophomore,4,The staff is very helpful. I transferred to this school two semester ago. I love it here. The school cares about me and my education.
Junior,4,"Transportation wise is good, and I got to stay home with my parents while attending school. Taking the basic class and focus on the ones that lead to our career in the 3rd and 4th year. I would change some of the professors who don't make us feel less about our learning skills."
Senior,4,"I really don't like fully online classes, the course was blended until the COVID 19 situation came upon on. I feel like that I'm more focused and connected in the classroom, as I am a kinesthetic and visual learner. I learn my best when I'm surrounded with a professor and classmates who can voice their feedback and I can look at their gestures and body language. In addition, the classroom provides a different atmosphere. Being at home, you may be distracted by family and noise from the outside."
Senior,4,"My overall experience with national Louis University has been good despite what's happening now in the world. I get informed emails about what's going on in the various departments. The NLU family keeps me updated where or who I can see if I'm having emotional or social problems. I really like the connection of the university. The financial aid department works with you if you cannot pay your tuition bill, they let you know about alternative measures that you can take, whether it be in the form of scholarships or a payment plan."
Freshman,4,My experience so far in National Louis University has been a good experience. There’s good programs for students to be in and to get to know each other.
Works Here,4,"National Louis University is a very well organized school & is a good place to start your academic career. The college life always has things for you to do when you finish your work. They even have a gaming den fit with pool tables, board games, & video games."
Junior,4,"School is nice, the campus is beautiful and the location is amazing. The inside of the school is clean and even though the school isn't huge, everything is there. The students are friendly and the professors have a lot of knowledge that they love sharing with us. Professors are also very human. Kind and understanding people that put their whole hart into educating us."
Freshman,4,my experience at kendall college was good. I met really good friends and I met some good chefs also. I liked how my chefs gave me good feed back and I liked how they helped me in class to become a better future chef.
Junior,4,"I have had a wonderful and life altering experience attending National Louis University. I am thankful for how far I have come in life and into my career while attending National Louis University. I am very grateful for the lessons that I have learned I am also grateful for the instructors and staff who all were patient, understanding and determined to help me reach my goals. Last but not least, I am grateful for my peers who I have met along this journey, we were each others encouragement and I appreciative for that.
However, if there was any change that I wished for it would be for the school/NLU offer more financial support, such as, scholarships, grants and perhaps more flexible and affordable payment plans that will allow cash paying students the opportunity to finish school and earn their degree."
Sophomore,4,It's a great university. There is help provided in every step of the way from enrollment specialist to career advisors. Overall a great university.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've only been here for two years but the content I've learned so far has been helpful. Instructors are willing to assist with anyone who has trouble in the coursework. The coursework is average and easy to understand. just complete your homework on time and you won't have trouble on any assignments. There are a lot of resources to use if you are having trouble understanding the work. The only problem I have is there are no official athletics at this school. This could be due to no gym in the school."
Freshman,4,"So far so great! I am at Kendall for their Culinary Arts Program. Let me just tell you the Chef professors are no joke. They have all been in the industry for a bery long time. Their experiences all range from private chefs to, restaurant owners, head chef's, executive chef. Owning their own catering companies. Experienced every level of hospitality or kitchen work imaginable. 

They know what they're talking about and hopefully you can connect with one of them, and they can support you academically. i.e. Reference, Internship, Job opportunity."
Freshman,4,"My experience with Nlu is really nice so far. The work is not boring or too difficult, and if I have the problem my professors are always willing to help."
Junior,4,The enrolling process was very positive as my enrollment advisor was helpful and extremely attentive. I have also had great experiences with all of my professors thus far.
Sophomore,4,Kendall is a great school for people that want to study culinary or Baking and Pastry. You get hands on experience.
Senior,4,Kendall College is an excellent place to enhance your culinary or baking & pastry skills. Its a great place to learn new things and use what they give you to find out what path you want to choose.
Junior,4,"I have had a wonderful experience thus far. The teachers are very understanding and mindful that you work full time and other commitments. They treat you as an adult and respect your time. As long as you put in the effort in your coursework, you’ll be fine."
Freshman,4,"I love the two days a week for National Louis. It is helpful for people who have others things to do during the week such as support a family, work and or take care of loved ones. The Professional Harrison Program is also amazing with the price being so cheap with all the added support from your counselour. One thing I would like to see change is the school spirit."
Junior,4,"The faculty and staff are extremely helpful in getting/staying on track towards your degree. As someone who has delayed my college degree, I had a great deal of angst in moving forward, but everyone, including my fellow students, have really helped lessen my anxiety!"
Senior,4,"The experience at NLU is wonderful. The faculty and staff are pleasant and want each student to succeed in obtaining their first college degree.  The staff and faculty at NLU are individuals that want each student to obtain their degree at the same time have a favorable experience at NLU. Overall, it was the best out-state, online, once a week class experience a person can ask for in a higher learning experience."
Graduate Student,4,Working toward a MAT in History....they let me tranafer 9 credit hours from NEIU. I began in September 2016 and will be finished in June 2017. The people at NLU run higher education like a true business and minimize the beaurocratic nonsense that abounds many Public Universities.
Junior,4,Hands down best college I have attended.  I feel my instructors value my time and are supportive.  The pace of the online classes works well.  I think the cost is appropriate for my education.  
College Senior,4,I feel safe and am not aware of any sexual assault issues on our campus.
College Senior,4,My professors are professionals in the field and are great resources for us to be published and receive employment after graduation.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Theres a good amount of professors who are outstanding, and there are some outliers who are burnt out or just shouldn't be teaching."
Recent Alumnus,4,"In general, Kendall College isn't known. But when it comes to hospitality institutions, Kendall is well known. Job prospects in my field are immense and I do not see myself struggling to find a job upon graduation."
Recent Alumnus,4,The online courses I have taken at Kendall have been very well run and regimented making it easy to schedule when to get assignments done.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I struggled to choose a rating for this one. There are some professors that are absolutely incredible at what they do. But, on the flip-side there are some professors who are clearly burnt out and that do not take the time to respond to e-mails making students feel un-important."
Recent Alumnus,4,Kendall College is nothing like any other school I have been to in a good way. Staff is approachable and treats the students as if they are adults rather than subordinates. The school is very hands on which is necessary for this field. The advising department needs an entire overhaul. They are not held accountable and have messed up on many student's plans of study.
Recent Alumnus,4,The classes easy to navigate through and the content is very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,I love this school! Best online curriculum and easy to manage classes.
College Junior,4,"I'm currently taking two classes for the Spring Quarter. My classes have been engaging and fun. The information being covered is relevant and useful in my current work and will allow me to venture out in my career. So far, so good!"
College Senior,4,I choose this school because I wasn't left with many options after my previous school was closed. So far the advisors and enrollment specialist are very helpful and knowledgable
College Sophomore,4,The faculty and staff try their hardest to make sure students have a job.  They created NLU hire and provide positions at multiple campuses.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are perfect for me-small and intimate.
College Freshman,4,They always have career fairs going on to help students find jobs after graduation.
College Freshman,4,"The school tries very hard to keep the school safe.  This is a public building with many businesses.  NLU has 2-6 floors.  Before you can access any of the floors, you have to stop at the second floor where security is.  If you don't have a student ID, they will not allow you access to any other floors.  Even when security is not there, you have to use a student ID to access floors 3-6."
College Freshman,4,"As a special needs student, this school is perfect for me.  It is small and offers students with disabilities a chance to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,My job field has many job offers and it is predicted to grow in the future.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy having an entirely online program. Perfect for professionals.
College Sophomore,4,"Very attentive advisers, great online program! Highly recommend."
College Freshman,4,"they offer lots of off site job offerings, they constantly have employers walking around and also set up booths for them when they are searching for new employees."
College Freshman,4,"the curriculum is the same as any other baking and pastry program, though its also a little more through as well as more time to work. the kitchens are stocked well and have enough room so that everyone has their own work space and free space to work."
College Freshman,4,"The school here is challenging but rewarding. ive only attended a week and already love it. the cafeteria here serves food cooked by the students, the staff here is helpful as well as truthful about the process of admissions and other things. the teachers are amazing and are very much qualified. the school also has their own recycling system and have ways to make sure your stay here is great and healthy. would not recommend any other school accept this one for your culinary needs"
College Senior,4,Things are going well after the first two terms. I like NLU overall.
College Junior,4,"I only take online classes, so I can't review the athletics at National Louis"
College Junior,4,Good help getting a job.
Recent Alumnus,4,National Louis University is a great school for a business degree. They have a well known track record that is proven that their teachings work. This school has been in the education business for over 125 years.
College Junior,4,"I love NLU, 

It is a very good school that is leading the way for technology, in order for it to make it more convenient for students."
College Freshman,4,they offer you after graduating they give you and internship at major restaurants in the city and you will work there to work there for a job opportunity
College Sophomore,4,"The realtionships between the chefs and students are great, they really have the heart to teach everybody."
College Sophomore,4,we are all really accepting towards each other and care for each other.
College Sophomore,4,"Its very easy for culinary students to get a job, there are restaurants every where"
College Freshman,4,I'v learend so much in my classes already and the layout of them makes my program even shorter. I'm getting an associates in less than 2 years! That's amazing.
College Freshman,4,I love the student body at my school because it is so diverse. We have a lot of international students study with us and that is awesome. I've gotten to know so many different people and learn about a ton of different cultures.
College Sophomore,4,Great selection of restaurants nearby.
College Senior,4,The work load isn't bad at all.
College Senior,4,Online classes I prefer because they are more calm and I can do things at my own speed.
College Senior,4,They are very helpful and friendly.
College Sophomore,2,I do not know of any.
College Sophomore,2,Our classes are at  a certain time and we have to change our work hours and our personal lives so that we can go to a class a 5 am or leave class at 11:30pm.
College Sophomore,2,when it comes to the general education its horrible but anything culinary related classes they are great.
College Junior,2,"I had a personal bad experience, I don't know if this is wide-spread or if the situation has improved.  The issue I experienced was related to the administration trying to ""clear out"" the IEP students either by letting the IEP expire or encouraging students to transfer or letting students drop out."
College Sophomore,2,Feel like I always get turned away with short answers.
College Junior,2,"My school is extremely expensive, for only a two year program. This is the only fault my school has."
College Senior,2,"Just because their was an ""man"" in the lab who didn't belong. But made it past security to the 4th Fl"
College Sophomore,2,I do recieve help and they walk you through the process. The only thing is that I have not recieved any financial aid.
College Senior,2,The resources on campus are minimal since it is a small campus in the first place.  There is a small gym and lockers for students to put their things.  There is a small student life center that plans small student outings and run the coffee bar on campus.  The library is generally a good resource for information about your industry and it also has a tutoring center for students.  The resources on campus are there but it isn't much of anything.
College Senior,2,My experience with financial aid has not been pleasant. There has not been any assistance in finding scholarships.
College Senior,2,"Kendall iss great but the instructors have to be really interested in helping you do well. I have had many instructors that were Interested and really took personal interest in their students.Others who were not as interested werenot available like they proclaimed to be.  And the kendall late policy stinks , for you get 0 for work you spenthours and you could not even get in because of technology break downs that is the downfall of internet courses."
College Junior,2,"Needs Help – The money is definitly worth it but trying to figure out all of my financial aid was all too confusing, and they are very on top of things but not at explaining how it works or what one is which. Also when I get the money that I did get, I still do not have that and it would be really helpful right now."
College Junior,2,"Verify Everything – Be sure to read through everything yourself carefully & rely only on what you read, not on what you are told. Other students have been the best source of information on financial aid -- figuring out why someone was denied & how to overcome any issues."
College Student,2,"Commuter School – There are apartments nearby, but not within walking distance.  There is no housing on or off campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is not a good idea to drive downtown to attend National Louis. You probably will not find parking and if you do, you will pay too much money. You can take public transportation (Metra or the Red Line) to National Louis."
Recent Alumnus,2,"School Spirit – Took class in downtown Chicago once a week, and hardly knew what was going on at National Louis."
College Sophomore,2,"Not an Option – Being a small Campus, there are not very many places to go after class. It is a commuter school so there are no clubs like other campuses have."
Graduate Student,1,The university promises things they cannot deliver. I would not recommend this university for a Masters. They do not stand up for their students.
Niche User,1,This college is done. Bankrupt. Students are being transferred to NLU even though some of their programs don't have the same accreditation.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The advising program has been nothing but a pain to work with. They have not been helpful in amy way, in fact they have been detrimental to me graduating in a timely manner."
College Senior,1,i have been told that i had to pay 500 dollars to transfer credits for one class. I was charged 500 extra
College Senior,1,online classes were more then a joke they were  a waste of money and time
College Senior,1,not help .... no one cares
College Senior,1,bad .. i feel as if some professors lack the credibility to teach certain classes
College Senior,1,"Tuition is always rising.  FInancial aid helps you get your award letter in line but they don't talk about scholarship or grant opportunites.  If you need extra aid they automatically suggest an alternative loan or a private student loan through a bank.  I know my education is important and Kendall is providing me an extremely important service.  However, it doesn't seem like they care if I'm struggling to pay them or not.  Some days it seems like they just care about the money and that's all."
College Senior,1,Limited Class Schedule and Strict Requirements – Classes are offered only some months out of the year and only some days out of the week. Teachers do not understand that we have to work and I had to sacrifice work to be able to fit the school in.
College Sophomore,1,"Since I came from another school, I could only qualify for student aid for two years. Unfortunately I haven't attended in over a year because I can't afford it. I wish there were more options available."
College Senior,1,Poor Safety – I have evening classes and I have been a bit concerned about my safety. The parking lot is a few feet away from the building but there is no cameras and it is isolated.

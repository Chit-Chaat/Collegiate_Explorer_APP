Junior,5,Lipscomb is a place where faculty and staff actually care about you. I feel valued and safe at this school.
Alum,5,"I graduated from Lipscomb in May 2019. My professors and classmates guided and supported me onto great successes, such as publishing one of my essays in an academic journal. Even more importantly, my Lipscomb community walked with me during my hardest season of life as I battled a major depression. I had professors who cared about my growth as a student, my well-being as a person, and my contribution to our world. Those mentor relationships even extended beyond my graduation. As a student at Lipscomb, I participated in countless experiences throughout Nashville, from practicums in metro public schools, to service opportunities with Nashville nonprofits, to city events such as the free Live on the Green outdoor concert series and Shakespeare in the Park. I went on hikes at parks; ate at famous restaurants like The Loveless Cafe and Hattie B’s; and discovered my favorite corners of the city (mostly coffee shops I studied at with friends). I’m forever grateful for attending Lipscomb."
Junior,5,My experience with Lipscomb has been great. The course work challenges your mind and the staff is great.
Freshman,5,"I have fallen in love with the atmosphere and curriculum offered at Lipscomb University. Everyone who was on the quest team was very down to earth and welcoming. I was nervous at first because I was moving from my home state to attend Lipscomb. The Nashville area always has something to offer as entertainment, which is a plus. The professors that work at Lipscomb genuinely care for students that pass through their class. After attending Lipscomb for only a semester I feel like I have learned a lot from the classes I attended. Everyone on campus offers smiling faces and helps any lost visitors."
Sophomore,5,I love the people and environment. It had a good program for the major that I wanted to study and the professors always want the best for you.
Sophomore,5,"I really love the environment of Lipscomb University. Everybody is so friendly and welcoming. The teachers are very knowledgeable in the fields that they teach and are very personable. The faculty in general have a genuine desire to develop personal relationships with the students. Along with the faculty wanting to get to know you, they also want to see you succeed. The campus is well kept and one of the safest campuses in the state. The location of the university is also amazing. You are really close to downtown Nashville and there is always something to do on campus or in that downtown area. One night you could be going to a NFL or NHL game, going to a concert, or you decide to just stay on campus and take part in something going on there. Overall choosing to attend Lipscomb University was the right decision and has opened doors for me that I never could have imagined not only academically but socially and spiritually as well."
Junior,5,It is an amazing school with great professors and faculty that are more than willing to help you succeed in life.
Sophomore,5,Lipscomb is a great place with a friendly environment in which you feel right at home when you walk on campus. It has friendly staff and many ways to get involved on campus. I enjoy my time here and the friendships it has brought me.
Niche User,5,Applying for Lipscomb. Have enjoyed my interactions every time I visit campus. It is a beautiful campus with great students. The students are always so welcoming when we visit.

Niche User,5,"I had a college visit here, and everyone was so warm and welcoming! You can really feel God on this campus!"
Junior,5,Lipscomb is great overall university and its professors truly care about students and their academic success along with their spiritual wellbeing.
Alum,5,I loved Lipscomb University! It helped me grow into the person that I am today. I met a lot of amazing people and had close personal relationships with my professors. My studies at Lipscomb set me up to be successful in pursuing my Masters degree at Princeton Seminary.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Lipscomb! It has been the biggest blessing for me. All of my professors are amazing, the community at Lipscomb is like none other and not to mention it is in one of the coolest spots ever... Nashville!! I would highly recommend Lipscomb to anyone as it has been the perfect decision for my college years."
Graduate Student,5,"I have just recently been accepted to Lipscomb University however, I am looking forward to attending the university in August."
Junior,5,"Lipscomb University is an all around, excellent experience. The campus is beautiful, with always something to do, and the spiritual/christian experience is one of a kind."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community that the college gives the students. I may only be a freshman but the college has a great atmosphere for students and parents to visit. We have activities for any on to do. Many outside families and people can come to campus to eat. Dorm life is amazing. Student life is always doing something so campus has something to do. The area around the college has things to do. It's a great area and professors are extremely friendly. Professors will invite you to their house for a cookout with their family, that's a normal thing for the college. I wouldn't change a thing about this college and would recommend. 10/10"
Freshman,5,"Lipscomb has been amazing in all aspects for me. From the first time that I stepped on campus as a prospective student, they made me feel welcomed and the environment felt like home. All of the staff members were very engaging and answered any questions or concerns that I had. The campus is very well kept up and is in one of the safest areas of Nashville. I chose Lipscomb University because of not only the strong and rigorous academics but the faith and community aspect. They make an effort to know you and not let your name just be a number on the roster. This campus is focused on building relationships that are life-giving and beneficial for both parties. Walking around campus, you are bound to see someone you know or meet a new friend."
Freshman,5,"I believe Lipscomb is an excellent school, the community incredibly diverse and spiritually united. The faculty is always available for any need no matter if the problem is about school or life. All the buildings are well organized and there are multiple events happening on campus every day. I believe the campus life is very well balanced because there is always time to study and rest, but there is always an opportunity to socialize."
Freshman,5,"Overall I love Lipscomb University! I have toured twice now and have committed as a Civil Engineering major. The facilities are gorgeous, there's so many ways to get involved, the faculty and students are incredible kind and overall the atmosphere is very welcoming!"
Freshman,5,"I'd really like to give 4.5 stars, but my personal experience has been good enough to give 5. Lipscomb offers a wide variety of educational opportunities, both in and outside of classes. From detailed STEM-related degrees to every type of Fine Arts focus I could think of, Lipscomb provides a largely diversified community of students who can strive in their education and, whilst it is a religious university, are free to express themselves despite any personal beliefs."
Senior,5,"I love the college their and i am going there for next year for sure, i haven't decided yet. But i will like going their soon or later."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Lipscomb has been so wonderful. The professors are so kind and help, the campus is beautiful, and it is a great environment. I am so happy that I came to Lipscomb because I know it is really preparing me for the future."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly, and the professors are actually interested in you as a person. The campus is flat and fairly small, which is a major plusz being in the heart of Nashville, there’s always something to go do too."
Junior,5,"Lipscomb is where you can really connect to people from all over. The environment is very friendly and God associated into every class. They are true believers, but never force their beliefs onto you. People from all religions are able to enjoy their time here and get a fair learning experience."
Freshman,5,"most amazing experience of my life. sooo much community and others with similar values!!! dont know what i'd do or where i'd be w/o Lippy! HORNS UP
so many areas on campus to plug in and get involved. the faculty truly cares about their students and not just educating them, but their development as sons and daughters of the King. Nashville is wonderful too, because there are so many great and unique opportunities offered in the city."
Niche User,5,I went to Lipscomb Summer Scholars over the summer and it was one of the best experiences I've had. It was part of my deciding factors.
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about Lipscomb University is the family environment. The first time I visited campus everyone, from the faculty to the students, was so nice and welcoming. They really made me feel like I belong here. Now that I am attending Lipscomb, nothing has changed. i meet new people all the time and everyone is so kind. Another thing that drew me to this university was the opportunities here. Being so close to downtown Nashville there are so many opportunities, from jobs to internships. The last thing that drew me here was the college of business. Lipscomb university currently has the number one business program in Tennessee. Going into business, the opportunities offered here were just too good to turn down"
Senior,5,"I remember the first day that I stepped foot on campus to take a tour, and I immediately knew that I did not want to go anywhere else. The culture was amazing. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. I did not bother scheduling additional tours with other colleges."
Sophomore,5,"The student life here is nothing like anything else I have ever scene. Ever since I started attending this university, I have felt nothing but love and care from my peers."
Graduate Student,5,Lipscomb is a beautiful campus and is a friendly environment. The mental health counseling masters program has been excellent. The professors take time to get to know you and really care about your success. There are so many things to do here in Nashville on your free time.
Sophomore,5,It was a wonderful college experience i loved the campus feel and everything. not only did i like the way i was accepted but it felt like home
Junior,5,I love Lipscomb University!  The education is excellent and the small class sizes really allow me to get the extra help when needed and I feel that the teachers are fully committed to their students' success.  The campus is great and has everything needed in a mid-size area.  I'm a graphic design major and their art program is one of the best!  Can't wait to go back this fall!
Junior,5,"Lipscomb University is a great school in Nashville, Tennessee located five minutes from downtown. Although the school is Church of Christ centered, it is  a diverse college and is home to multiple religions and cultures within the student body."
Freshman,5,"The environment is welcoming and the people are so friendly! At Lipscomb, you will feel like you're home. You will make many friendships that last a lifetime. I chose Lipscomb so I wouldn't be peer pressured into doing things that go against my morals. Lipscomb has always been my dream college and I'm so glad to be apart of the family. Go Bisons!"
Sophomore,5,"Lipscomb has changed my life. I have been extremely involved on campus and feel welcomed like I never have before. The staff is great, the campus is safe, the student body is generally very fun and kind. The schooling is also very very good, however it is a bit expensive so try to get scholarship money."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the small class sizes as well as the small campus. It's easy to get around, however, parking sucks. They need to stop building so many parking lots and build some garages. Until then, good luck finding a spot."
Sophomore,5,I love Lipscomb University. The advisors are prompt in their responses. I love how Lipscomb integrates faith and the belief in God in many of the courses.
Junior,5,"I started Lipscomb University in the Spring of 2017. I have been to three other schools, and I have yet to experience to a school like Lipscomb. The staff, faculty, and other students are all so friendly and helpful. Everyone makes a true effort to help you succeed. The courses are challenging and educational, the campus is small but very beautiful."
Freshman,5,I am a rising freshman at Lipscomb but I love the school. From the experiences I have already had so far I can tell this is going to be a great experience for me.
Sophomore,5,"I am so in love with Lipscomb. It has transformed me into a person that is so much better than who I was when I first came. Everyone is so friendly there, and I know I have made connections that will last me my entire life."
Junior,5,Lipscomb University is a great college. The professors are awesome and you can tell how much they truly care about your well-being. The connections I have made will help me create job opportunities after college.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Lipscomb University! It has small class sizes so that the professors are able to know your name and have a relationship with their students. All of the professors will go the extra mile in order to make concepts clearer. The student life is also great! The sense of community that you get at Lipscomb is something that I was searching for and definitely found. Lipscomb is a great school with a high emphasis on making sure that the students understand and learn the concepts in order to thrive in every day life during and after college.
Senior,5,"Responsive, caring, knowledgeable professors; strong academics; extremely safe campus; Christian role models; Flexible and professional"
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Lipscomb; it is unlike any other university I have visited or heard about. It is a safe family environment that develops the student professionally, academically, socially, and spiritually. It has positively impacted my life in many ways and will continue to impact me for years to come, even after I graduate."
College Freshman,5,The value of a degree at this school is great. Leaving from this school is a  guaranteed job in the work force.
College Freshman,5,The professors know what they want and need. I love the fact that they love what they're doing and they treat each of us with so much respect and care
College Freshman,5,I believe here at Lipscomb we take health and safety seriously and we don't want any harm to be caused on campus
College Freshman,5,I respect the life of this campus because they enforce rules to protect each and every one of us on campus. Amazing place to go
College Freshman,5,Greek life here seems to be a great social club here at Lipscomb. They're so engagaing t makes me consider joining the Greek life
College Freshman,5,I love the athletic program because everyone is genuinely nice and stick to the Christian faith school behavior
College Freshman,5,I enjoy this campus and professor so much!
Recent Alumnus,5,"I start this Fall, but just from my interview and walking the campus I am pretty sure my time at Lipscomb is going to be great."
College Freshman,5,"I was greek in undergrad at Lipscomb. Although the clubs on campus are nationally known, they still are one of the best things to be a part of. It is a good way to make connections, to get involved and to give back to the community."
College Freshman,5,"I chose to continue my education at Lipscomb University to help maintain my faith and due to the family environment that they promote. I don't have to worry about people stealing my stuff or locking my door when I use to live on campus. I feel very safe there and the face that it is a Christian school where you get to talk about your faith openly is a plus. The teacher to student ratio is great, too. All of my undergraduate teachers knew me by first and last name and I still have a good relationship with my chemistry teachers."
College Junior,5,I feel so safe on campus. I think Lipscomb was rated the #1 safest school in Middle Tennessee :)
College Junior,5,I feel very at-home with the Lipscomb community. My faith and relationships have grown so much just in the one semester that I've attended so far.
College Freshman,5,It's the best because all of the faculty and staff are friendly and will help you in whatever way they can to help you succeed.
College Freshman,5,The campus feels very safe and secure. Crime is not an issue and personal safety does not feel threatened.
College Freshman,5,PEOPLE WANT LIPSCOMB GRADS. I WILL DEFINITELY GET A JOB AFTER GRADUATION.
College Freshman,5,I LOVE THE PROFESSORS. THEY GET TO KNOW YOU!!
Alum,4,"Due to coronavirus, Lipscomb had to transfer to completely online teaching, and I believe they did the best job they could have done in the circumstances. The professors were understanding as everyone was adjusting, the online coursework was fair and still covered the material, and the examinations were performed using proctor programs."
Alum,4,"Lipscomb was my home for four years, and I loved being a part of it, but there were sometimes problems with students that the administration could have handled better."
Freshman,4,"After the COVID outbreak and online classes started, I did a lot better. Being off campus helped me a lot and my professors worked hard to make sure I stayed focus on my courses."
Freshman,4,"Lipscomb has made itself stand out among other college choices because of its tight knit community and great opportunities. The staff makes me feel like internships will be possible, and that a career right after college is within my reach."
Alum,4,"I took a few courses online because that was the only way to fulfill certain requirements. The classes weren't too bad. They all followed the same format: finish the readings, write a paper, write a discussion post, take a final. That's it. The online bible classes can vary wildly so pick your professor wisely."
Alum,4,"I've always had very mixed feelings about Lipscomb. I grew a lot in my faith and found a relationship with God during my time here. The professors, particularly in the Theology department, are amazing. I learned and grew a lot in Bible classes and mission trips. However, I have different opinions of administration, particularly towards finances and rule enforcement. They use money in a typical, big-business, greedy manner. I find such misappropriation hypocritical for a Christian institution. As far as rule enforcement, I was never made aware of their strict rules before the first day of class. It's impossible to control what people do in their free time off campus. Title IX enforcement is a joke. The school is putting sexual assault cases under new management, but these cases were previously dealt with in quite a victim shaming, misogynistic manner. Administration has its hypocrisies, but the learning environment itself is something I would never trade for anything in the world."
Junior,4,Online learning is acceptable/ok. Not as good as live learning but it works. It’s just not the same.
Senior,4,"This was my first semester at Lipscomb and overall it has been really good for me. I am a Hospitality Management major and this is a new program. It has been the most well designed program that I have ever taken part in. Not only are we taking business, management, and hospitality classes, we are required to do a PAID practicum (similar to an internship) on campus each semester to get experience in many aspects of hospitality. 
If you are a religious person, you will absolutely love this school. If you are not a religious person, like me, you probably won't enjoy the requirements of attending chapel, but I guarantee it is worth it. You can sit in the back and get other work done and it only lasts about 30 minutes twice per week if you are a full-time student. It really is not as bad as it may seem. 
Though it is on the more expensive side, there are many scholarships and grants available. Just talk to the financial aid office."
Freshman,4,Lipscomb has a very welcoming and educational environment! The faculty and staff is very caring about all of the students!
Freshman,4,"I love the community at Lipscomb. I have found many people that I am able to relate to. However, the way they hand out financial aid is not as good as it should be."
Niche User,4,It has a really pretty campus. The food was decent but could be better.  The dorms are pretty small and the bathrooms are the same. The campus is super clean and has nice places to study
Freshman,4,"I like Lipscomb a lot. The classes are normally very challenging, and the professors try to make you think outside the box."
Sophomore,4,"I like how Lipscomb gives you a Christian atmosphere, but how it's also in a big city so there's plenty of outreach and fun things to do."
Freshman,4,Wonderful university! Professors actually care about students and will go out of the way to help you succeed.
Freshman,4,"Lipscomb is a beautiful school. It has a basis of faith, which for Christians is a great bonus. The professors do everything they can to help you succeed, as well as find your calling. It will be hard to find a class where the professor does not want to help you grow and see you flourish. The college is expensive; but they do offer ample scholarship to those who apply."
Freshman,4,"Lipscomb University is a really good school. The professors care about the students and wants the best for each and every one of them. The diversity is not that great, but they are working to ensure that the diverse student population excells. People on campus are friendly and you're able to build relationships with the staff on campus since you see them almost every day."
Sophomore,4,"Because it's located in Nashville, the area is green and green galore. Lipscomb is a small campus making it easier to see your friends. Also you don't have to walk as far to go from class to class."
Senior,4,"The school is a small, tight-knit community in the middle of Nashville. I am a senior and have loved all four years there. It is not without its faults but the faculty truly care about you and want to help you succeed. The classes are generally small which allows for great relationships with professors."
Freshman,4,"Challenging academics as well as a strong Christian environment, but you won't feel left out if you aren't a Christian. Teachers care about how well their students do, more so than that of many other schools. "
Freshman,4,I like the people and the Christian environment but I do not like their priorities of building new residence halls and sacrificing parking spaces 
Niche User,4,"Lipscomb is a great University where people can not only receive a great education, but they can grow in their faith. Nashville is a great city and there are always fun activities to do there. "
Recent Alumnus,4,I have only heard great things
College Freshman,4,"Lipscomb has some of the most well trained security personnel that I have ever encountered on any college campus. They can be frustrating at times since they are always driving on campus and give parking tickets, but it makes me feel safe and that is something I am thankful for at Lipscomb."
College Freshman,4,"We are a division 1 school located in the heart of music city and two other division one colleges. Even though we don't have a college football team, the student body is very involved in going to the numerous sports games that Lipscomb athletics offer. It gives the students a nice little break rather than being stuck in the library studying all night."
College Freshman,4,"Attending this university has already opened many doors for me and introduced me to some wonderful people that I hope I will remain close with for the rest of my life. The reason that I do not regret choosing Lipscomb University is because had I chose to attend a different school, I probably would not have met great friends to encourage me to finally get the help I need from the counseling center (which is free, so that's another bonus about my college). I was able to receive the help I needed from Lipscomb something that I was unable to do in high school and who knew if I would have bonded as well with a therapist at another college as I did with my therapist as I did with the one I have at Lipscomb. 

I grew up in a very sheltered environment and what makes Lipscomb great is that it has a very family oriented loving feeling on campus. The majority of the people that I have met are really loving and sincere. They're really opening and you instantly get that feeling of having a home away from home."
College Junior,4,"Only one semester into attending this school, and I already received an internship. My degree is in music, and being in Nashville, I feel that it will be fairly easy getting a job in my area of study after graduation."
College Junior,4,"My experience with classes and professors has been great. I did have one professor who I felt wasn't the most effective in teaching the class, but overall, I enjoyed this past semester. My classes were intriguing, and I felt that all my professors truly cared about me as a person, not just how well I did as a student."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I haven't used the athletic facilities very often, but they seem great!"
College Freshman,4,"Our teams try their best, and the student body shows a lot of support for our fellow athletes."
College Freshman,4,"There is a strong emphasis on preparing you for the next step.  For example, helping you build a resume and experience that will help make you more competitive for gaining access into a good medical school."
College Freshman,4,"The class size is great, I really like the smaller classes with a better teacher to student ratio.  I also like the way the teachers take more of an interest in their students and know their students by name. I also like the higher values that are encouraged in student behavior and student activities.  It takes away a lot of the distractions found on other campuses. Overall, the feeling on campus is like a small community where you are an active part, not just a number passing through."
College Freshman,4,The teacher - student relationship is very unique.  Teachers and staff seem to take a genuine interest in the success of their students.  It is so much better being known for who I am rather than just as a number.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe and this entire week Lipscomb is talking about stopping sexual assault. It is a big deal and we want it to stop.
College Freshman,4,Students are really involved in supporting our schools sports teams. I see so many people watching the soccer games and softball/baseball games. I get tweets daily about how our school is doing in sports.
College Freshman,4,"Could be better, needs some more renovation around the girls' dorms, but other than that, campus housing is pretty decent."
College Freshman,4,"Could always use improvement but overall, I feel very safe here."
College Freshman,4,The students and the employers are really nice and seem to know what they are doing.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty safe but open campus.
College Sophomore,4,The health and safetly on campus is great. Securtiy is more than welcome to walk you to your dorm or car if you feel uneasy.
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus. The social atmosphere is perfect. I can choose to be with others, or I can decide to be alone. Also, it all depends on what dorm you decide to live in. However, all the dorms are clean and have pretty good amenities."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics is a decent part of the school. The basketball games are well attended.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the overall college atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"Security officers are ever-present on campus.  I generally feel pretty safe walking to any of my classes, even at night."
College Freshman,4,I have not looked into the career services much on campus.  But I do know that they do a lot of work in helping students find internships and planning what their next post-college steps will be.
College Freshman,4,Professors are extremely personable.  Most of them seem to really care about their students and are always willing to work with them on anything they need.  Most are easy to contact and work to really engage in the students' lives.
College Freshman,4,"Our school has a lot of fan support and team spirit!  Basketball is probably the biggest sport on campus, and it is always encouraged that students attend.  Our facilities are also top notch."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my school!  The community here is really great, and it's a good environment for me to be in.  Sometimes I wish my classes were a little more challenging, though."
College Freshman,4,The apathetically department always reaches out to promote team spirit.
College Freshman,4,I'm learning a about it.
College Freshman,4,i always feel safe here
College Freshman,4,i think the value of a degree from this school is great
College Freshman,4,I've loved it so far..
College Freshman,4,very prevalent in campus life
College Junior,4,we have a really diverse variety of classes and majors and people are very helpful
College Junior,4,i really want this degree
College Junior,4,i wouldn’t want to be anywhere else
College Freshman,4,I haven't joined a sorority but I am part of a Greek club and I haven't enjoyed meeting new people.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are average sizes and very clean, but they need to be updated. They have great lobbies with couches and tables for the students to hang out. There are kitchens that can be rented to cook meals or something sweet."
College Freshman,4,"The teams don't always win, but the support seen by the students is amazing. There are always people in the student section cheering the teams on no matter the sport. The environment and excitment of the student section is unbelievable."
College Freshman,4,The workload is easy to manage and courses vary greatly in difficulty.
Freshman,2,"Lipscomb has a lot of potential but just didn’t work for me. The programs are great but it is not worth the money. 30,000 in scholarships and I was still paying 14,000 to live in a dorm that had a broken ac for 2 months. It might not be so bad if you live off campus. Freshman are REQUIRED to pay for a $2500+ meal plan. Required!! I probably used $300 of it my whole year because I couldn’t sit through the mediocre meals in the cafeteria. Don’t live on campus if you want ANY freedom as a freshman. You’ll get charged a $25 fine for not “checking out” over the weekend. RA’s will tell you that you aren’t allowed to go to parties. I never wanted to go to a party but it sucks pretty bad when you want ice cream at 1 am but you risk getting kicked out for it! I’m transferring to a different university now but I’m pretty upset I wasted the time and money there. Again, programs/campus life is great but it is not for everyone."
Graduate Student,2,"Unprofessional, staff are rude and unable to assist international students.  Lipscomb staffs are trained to prevent diversity in their campus by not assisting foreign and fail to recruit non-white."
Graduate Student,2,"Christian and private are its perks. Parking  is absolutely terrible. Security overwrite parking tickets, even though they know there are no spaces to park. School is very small, as there are too many students accepted into this college. Food has limited options and is expensive. The college, itself, is too expensive for both undergraduate and graduate professions. It's not worth the hype or money."
College Freshman,2,"The only reason I liked living on campus was so I didn't have to spend 45 minutes driving around to try to find a parking spot. I enjoyed the late night ping pong sessions with newly made friends and playing video games with my roommates. Living in a dorm was terrible and super crowded. I can understand that it is needed for the college experience, but I don't understand why Lipscomb forces students to stay on campus to keep certain scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,I understand trying to have social groups and all but the whole process is just redundant and the groups are very discriminative.
College Senior,2,Depends on your definition of party.
College Freshman,2,It stinks that the Caff closes so early and the fast food is only until 9pm- We get hungry and want snacks late at night!
College Freshman,2,There is nothing ever happening unless you are pre med.
College Freshman,2,"Lipscomb is so stingy with their money. I know people who are paying less to go to Vandy and their tuition is more  expensive. The tuition increases every year but the scholarships don't. And if you move off campus, they take away your scholarships. They milk you for your money every way possible."
College Sophomore,2,"You have open dorm once every two weeks for TWO hours. Opposite sex must leave ID at the front door, and the door must stay open if you have a visitor in your room. The rules say no drinking on OR off campus. This school is very strict if you get caught doing something, so the key is to be smart about your decisions."
College Sophomore,2,"Food isn't very good, but it could be a lot worse."
College Student,2,There's not many parties but when there is they're good parties.
College Senior,2,Feel like they can offer more help.
College Sophomore,2,They definitely need more spots.  Normally for people that live on campus it is not much of an issue because we already have our spot before people come to school the next morning.
College Sophomore,2,It is extremely difficult to find parking during the week during the day.
College Sophomore,2,It's horrible finding parking spots. You have to come early to find a spot.
College Sophomore,2,Lipscomb has plenty of regulations
College Sophomore,2,Not everyone in the financial aid department wants to help the students.
College Junior,2,"Because the school is tied so closely to the Church of Christ, there is not much diversity in anything other than ethnicity."
College Sophomore,2,There are barely any parking spots on campus after 8 am.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the time it makes everyone sick.
College Sophomore,2,Not a great process and very confusing.
College Freshman,2,This university is extremely strict considering it's a christian based school. 
College Freshman,2,being a minority at lipscomb is tough just because it's hard to find people who relate to you. 
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty strict, especially on freshman. There is a curfew as well as somewhat of a dress code. However, after freshman year I really don't have any complaints besides no co-ed dorms or visitation to speak of."
College Freshman,2,There's just a few restaurants available in walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is really difficult sometimes, but they are working on building a new parking garage."
College Junior,2,"Not too many scholarships available, and the financial aid office has me pulling my hair out."
College Junior,2,"Mediocre. meal plans have changed every year and have only gotten worse money-wise. Wish we had a full flex-option for those of us that don't want to eat upstairs. Decent food choices downstairs, though I wish there were more (or at least more healthy options). Upstairs in the cafeteria, it's a coin flip-sometimes it's really good, others it's horrible. All in all I do not enjoy the meals upstairs majority of the time."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nobody really cares a whole lot about the sports events unless they're giving out free stuff.  However, I will give the athletic department credit for trying to improve this.  They recently created a new position on their staff pretty much solely to come up with ideas to bring students to games.  Also, we did just recently get a new men's head basketball coach in an effort to create a winning team again which will draw more fans.  Not many of the athletes are very well respected though among the student body.  They're known for partying, getting in trouble, and then getting away with doing things which the average student would be kicked out for."
College Senior,2,"Lipscomb is very strict. They enforce the no undergrad drinking policy pretty intensly. They will often do random room checks and go in depth looking in fridges and closets, etc. There is barely any visitation for opposite genders."
College Student,2,A percent of students are afraid to step out of their bubble and meet new people.
College Freshman,2,"There are places very close to campus, but most are very expensive. Most of the apartments close to campus are owned by retired couples."
College Junior,2,parking is horrible here... the university is always having seminars here so all the student parking is taken up by the guests attending the seminars.
College Junior,2,"Parking is the longest running joke in the Lipscomb community. There's rarely spots in a lot of places because they are continuously renovating and building and closing places off, but even when things aren't roped off there's still little parking. Commuter students have to park really far away now and get shuttled here. If you have to leave in the middle of a school day and come back, good luck finding a spot without driving around for twenty minutes or so or literally stalking someone leaving."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is good if you live on campus, but for commuters, it can be hard to find spots sometimes. But they're working on it!"
College Sophomore,2,"Under the Radar. Nashville night-life is FANTASTIC. Lipscomb students really know how to throw down. However, drinking is not tolerated by the administration. Every thing done must be on the down low."
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes They Are Too Involved – I attend a Church of Christ University, so I understand that their are going to be more safety policies and rules than state schools. However, the involvement can get excessive with things that should be optional if it abides with the law. No alcohol, smoking, or homosexuality seems a bit unfair and over the line."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Enough Convenient Spaces – There is always competition for close parking spots, and it seems as though the space is not utilized well by the builders."
College Freshman,2,Strict but Good – The consequences definitely keep you in line to not slack off. There is no reason why you shouldn't study since they don't allow much of anything on campus. I liked it for that honestly...
Graduate Student,1,"Staff make it hard to access academic information, If you were to schedule a phone call from their staff, they'll call you and immediately disconnect the call. They never answer the phone. All communication is via email and no one is ever on campus to assist. Poor communication and poor overall university to invest in."
College Sophomore,1,"I live in fanning hall 3rd floor and didn't have heat for the entire months of January and February when we had two big snow storms, they kept putting off repairs until it warmed up and by then of course I didnt need heat. Then, Johnson has a new add on but the old building is disgusting, cold, moldy , and old. How can you add on to it and NOT renovate the rest to match."
College Freshman,1,I hope you have a netflix subscription.
College Freshman,1,There is no diversity at this school.
College Freshman,1,I wouldn't wish for my worst enemy to come here. Our retention rate is terrible.
College Freshman,1,The people here are the same. There's no originality!
College Freshman,1,"The sports here suck, especially basketball."
College Freshman,1,THEY ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST!
College Freshman,1,There is never anything going on on campus because of the ridiculously strict rules!
College Freshman,1,They treat everyone like children instead of grown adults which is not fair and it is not real life.
College Freshman,1,The food is really bad.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid office is so rude. Campus security is just waiting to give you a parking ticket. Teachers are nice and caring. Administration in general other than the teachers are just annoying and rude.
College Freshman,1,There is never actually anything to do on campus. The only way you know what's going on is if you know the right people and they aren't willing to invite people outside of their friend group. The party scene is pretty much non-existent.
College Sophomore,1,"We have ""social clubs"" instead of fraternities and sororties. They are ver annoying."
College Senior,1,THe parking is awful - there aren't enough spaces
College Freshman,1,"There is always something going on at Lipscomb, or in the surrounding area. When this happens, it can cause a lack of car spaces. It has caused people to become late for class and chapel. It can be very hard and a tragic experience for those that are on time, almost on time, or completely running late!"
College Freshman,1,"Few people go to the games, unless we play Belmont, one of our rivals. Even fewer people care if we win. Lipscomb does not have football, but only basketball which would be okay if students were engaged. Lipscomb is missing a huge opportunity to unite students through attending atheltic games. There are attempts to get students involved but they have repeatedly failed."
College Junior,1,"One of the worst Nursing schools in the country. The faculty have no idea what they are doing. Grading system is a joke! School guidline 76 to pass classes / nursing handbook 75. nothing this school does matches up. No one has the slightest clue of what they are doing. In my opinion kinder-garndners could run that school better. The nursing admin can not get anything on the same page. Classes scheduled when you are supposed to be at clinicals. Professors running around with no clue what to do. I would understand if this was the first year nursing was offered, but it isn't. They broke away from Vanderbilt and went down hill. In my opinion don't waste your $30k and go to a school that really knows what they are doing. The faculty all stick together and the professors do not respond to emails of any kind. no help. you might as well teach yourself through a online class or late fees at the library. It's nothing more than an excuse when they want more money and another year for you to attend school. Good luck getting anywhere at this school for nursing!!

College Sophomore,1,"There Is Not Enough Awareness Raised – It is too difficult to find out what scholarships are available. I am always looking for financial aid, but it seems as though they are underground."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol, drug, or any other ""non-Christian"" material is enough to get you potentially kicked out. There are no on-campus parties, but low-key things take place off campus if you know the right people. One particular head resident has been known to call students into her office even upon just hearing rumors of them partying, drinking, clubbing, or hooking up. No tolerence, but also no room to make your own decisions or mistakes. Plus, freshman have weekday curfew of 12AM and weekend curfew of 1AM, and even after freshman year, students must walk through front doors to essentially be ""checked"" by 24-hr on-duty desk clerk."

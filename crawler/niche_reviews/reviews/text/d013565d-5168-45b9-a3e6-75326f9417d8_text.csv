Sophomore,5,"What I like about Franklin college is that they're so welcoming. Once you get there, its like you're family. More importantly they'll help you instead of just throwing you in fire in hopes of finding a way to put it out."
Sophomore,5,"I didn't take online classes, but my friend who was a transfer stated that taking online classes was easy. Professors were on time, and was once again welcoming. Us students weren't here to waste there time and neither were they."
Freshman,5,Our professors were so understanding during the remote learning transition. I feel like I received the same education I would’ve received in a classroom. Not only did our professor check on us academically but we got weekly phone calls to check on our mental health.
Freshman,5,I had a great first year at Franklin. It was definitely an experience but I got to meet awesome people and professors that are dedicated to seeing students succeed. I’m glad we have such a close knit community.

Freshman,5,It has amazing job opportunities with professors who are wanting you to learn the most out of each time they meet with you. Very close to downtown Indianapolis with lots of internships and jobs that Franklin College is connected with.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman first attending Franklin College, it has met my expectations and then some. When I first went to Franklin for a football camp, I knew that day that's where I wanted to go. I did go to other colleges, to explore other options I had available to me but the atmosphere at Franklin wasn't like any other. It feels like I am surrounded by family, the student to professor ratio is perfect for me. I enjoy being on the football team, meeting others and just having the family atmosphere. Choosing Franklin was the best decision I made and I'm enjoying every moment of college life."
Sophomore,5,"I love my college. Transferring to Franklin college was one of the best decisions I have made. The campus is beautiful and the professors are great. The classes are organized well and in depth. I learned so much more material in the intro biology course at this school than my previous one. You really get what you put into college, and Franklin college offers so many opportunities. There are multiple living options as well. There is a variety of healthy food choices in the cafeteria. There are plenty of activities to keep you occupied on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Franklin College has been a welcoming and vibrant environment that has provided me with countless opportunities to grow mentally, academically, and socially. I have transformed into a better person than I ever could have imagined."
Junior,5,"I came to Franklin because I wanted to have a relationship with my professors, and I have not been disappointed. Not only do they want to push you to be your best self, but they genuinely care about your well-being as well as your future. It's a relationship you just can't get at a bigger university. <3"
Freshman,5,"Well, it was really frustrating because I had a week to apply to this college. I wasn't expecting to, I applied in other places, but this college was going to help me financially. I had a week, I had my application fee waived and I rushed my SAT's. My counselor was on point, she would reply back to me really fast and she helped me get my paperwork in as soon as possible. I was already stressed about college in general, but Franklin College made it fast and easy."
Niche User,5,Love the community and family feeling at Franklin.  Everyone is equal and helps one another to a common goal of school.
Junior,5,"I'm a junior and I still absolutely adore this campus, the faculty, and the students. The best environment to learn and grow as a student is a place in which a campus acts like a community, and that's exactly what Franklin does. Professors work around the clock to see that students succeed in ever aspect of their lives, and that they will have success beyond graduation. Our small community makes for big opportunity to try new things and discover what it is that YOU love."
Junior,5,"Franklin College is a great school to pursue your education and career goals through. Franklin College has opened many doors for me that I would not have been able to do on my own. Not only has the school and its faculty & staff pushed me to my limits, they have mentored me along the way. At the rate that I am going, I will achieve great things here at Franklin College. I highly recommend seeking out Franklin College and the opportunities that they have to offer."
Alum,5,The professors are extremely helpful and compassionate. The education is high quality and the sense of community is strong.
Senior,5,Franklin College has a very tight knit community.  You get to know your classmates very well and your professors.  Professors care about you and want you to succeed.  There's numerous academically vigorous courses that challenge you and push you to be a better person.
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed my experience with the visit at Franklin College. I met up with many of students and athletes and everyone is very friendly. It might be small, but I only see positives from that. It is a very ""together"" and nice community. I would say if you want to go to a small college, definitely look into Franklin."
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman at Franklin College. The staff, coaches and professors have been really helpful with registration, getting classes, financial aid and learning about the school. Everyone is really friendly and I can wait to get started!"
Sophomore,5,"I have really liked the school so far! As a sophomore, I've joined a sorority, Student Congress, and I am a resident assistant. It is very easy to get involved on campus. 

Academics are so big here. The professors know you by name. They also care about you, not just your grades, but what's going on personally."

Sophomore,5,Franklin is a great small college. There is a very big community sense here and everyone is always willing to help one another.
Junior,5,"I love Franklin College because they've given me the opportunities to be successful and excel in my career field. They helped me choose that career field by offering me an internship at a hospital where I realized that I want to pursue being a physician's assistant rather than a doctor. The community of Franklin is one big family, and I've made friendships that will last a lifetime. We're also in a unique spot being in a small town but only 30 minutes from Indianapolis. If I could go back and do it all again, I would choose Franklin every time!"
College Junior,5,there is a ton of opportunity on campus to network for jobs
College Junior,5,nothing happens here in comparison to bigger schools
College Junior,5,"the whole school is basically athletes, which helps with everyone on campus knowing each other"
College Junior,5,I love my college and I'm glad I'm here.  I'm on first name bases with some of my professors and I feel that they want what is best for me.
College Junior,5,I always feel safe on campus.  We have security 24/7 even when the school is closed and they are willing to walk with you across campus if you ever feel unsafe.
College Senior,5,With our 60 plus organizations and a variety of varsity sports there is something for everyone in our small community campus. The faculty and staff make Franklin welcoming and personable and the students take their education and soar. We may be a small school but our students have big goals and dreams and they are have a success story to tell.
College Sophomore,5,They do a good job of keeping everyone safe and not letting people do crazy things
College Sophomore,5,I love is! The professors are awesome and get to know you one on one so you can feel comfortable going to them for help. Some also stay in contact and are there to help even if you are not in their classes.
College Sophomore,5,Many people who come back after they graduate say that Franklin was the reason for their job and that Franklin helped them find the position they are in. Franklin has many opportunities for internships.

College Junior,5,The atmosphere of going to an athletic event or participating in one is amazing.
College Junior,5,Franklin College is the ideal school for many students. They want you to succeed here.
College Sophomore,5,"Kirk Bixler is a very, very good resource to go to when in need of a job or internship. He sends countless emails that have numerous opportunities for students to get a job off and on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"So far, I have had really good experiences with my professors. They all want and care that I succeed."
College Sophomore,5,Security on Franklin's campus is supreme. 24hr on duty security that are willing to escort someone who does not feel 100% safe. I feel very safe.
College Sophomore,5,"Being a member of Greek Life, I have to say that it was one of the best decisions I have made in college."
College Sophomore,5,I love my school because it feels like home. The small community makes me feel comfortable.
College Freshman,5,"Internships are offered a lot at FC, which rocks."
College Freshman,5,FC is in a good location with safety.

College Sophomore,5,"There isn't a place I can think of where I would feel safer than on the Franklin College campus.  At the beginning of my freshman year I signed up to receive emergency alert texts which would include, sexual assault incidents, robberies, or any kind of suspicious behavior, and I have yet to receive any texts a full year later.  There were many times I would stay at the library or in the student center until late at night studying, and I never felt nervous or unsafe walking back to my dorm by myself.  The campus has a wonderful support staff in the counseling center that make students feel very comfortable and secure if they have been involved in any sort of incident."
College Junior,5,Great people with awesome philanthropies. Very inclusive!
College Freshman,5,I really feel safe on campus. There are security guards that roam the campus at night and they always have cameras around to keep an eye on things.
College Freshman,5,When I first arrived on campus I just felt right at home and everyone knows each other because it's small enough and you can actually have one-on-one with the professors which is a very good thing because it creates bonds and is very helpful with academics.
College Freshman,5,"The courses at Franklin offer numerous ways to tie in the Franklin College mission and values. The mission is to lead responsively, think independently, and serve with integrity. The values are life-long pursuit of learning, respect, responsibility, faith and honesty. The professors push you to learn more than the topic at hand and how it relates to other courses. The classes are relatively small and the professors care about the students."
College Freshman,5,"The value of a degree from Franklin College is great. A liberal arts degree shows that you are a well-rounded individual, and know a little about a lot of things and a lot about your major. At a non- liberal arts school, you do not have that quality of knowing more than your major."
College Senior,5,"I love Franklin College because within the large family that we are on this campus, I belong to multiple sub-families.  I have my Student Ambassadors, my golf team, my roommates, my sorority sisters, my Intervarsity family, and so many little groups that somehow all mesh together.  When I first visited the college, I noticed how incredibly welcoming everyone was and knew that my friendly nature would fit in perfectly.  Another distinct"
College Junior,5,"Before leaving for college, I was terrified. I was moving 2 hours away from home to a school where I did not know a single person. But the moment I stepped onto campus, I knew I was home. I never experienced the freshman phase of missing home because Franklin College quickly became my new comfort zone. From the people who quickly took me under their wings and became my best friends, to my professors who encourage me in all aspects of my college experience, to the staff I work with who always know how to make me smile, FC knows exactly how to make students feel welcomed and involved."
College Sophomore,5,"I have overwhelmingly enjoyed my experience at Franklin College so far. The unique thing about Franklin is that we truly are a family and a community. I never thought I would find my ""home away from home,"" but I did at Franklin. Everyone is so friendly and kind, and the location is also perfect. Franklin is a small town, but Indianapolis is only 30 minutes away and Greenwood is only 15-20 minutes away, so I always have the opportunity to go into the city if I wish. Franklin is also a very small school, which can be very beneficial. Class size is small, which allows professors to truly get to know you as a person, and not just a number. They invest in your education and want the very best for you. Because I am a Biology major, I wanted to make sure the science department at the schools I was looking at was top-notch and I definitely found that at Franklin. Our professors are extremely intelligent and well-known outside of Franklin so they have plenty of networking connections to help us get internships, job shadowing, and create professional relationships with people in our desired careers. Additionally, Franklin's small size allows students to get involved on campus in student organizations, which helps us to grow as individuals and as leaders on campus, while also have tons of fun along the way. Some of my favorite events on campus include Grizzly Grand Prix which is our big festival in the spring that includes a carnival type event and a bike race. We also have lots of fun in the fall because of football games! Lots of people in the community even come out for our games because they're so exciting. Looking back, if I had the chance to do it all over, I would still choose Franklin College because I have found my home here. I could not imagine being anywhere else because Franklin fulfills all requirements that I want in a college in educational, social, and spiritual aspects."
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about Franklin from the people who attend and work here to the opportunities it has given me.
College Sophomore,5,I love it.  The ability to get involved and play college sports is what I was looking for and found.
Sophomore,4,Due to COVID-19 we had to transfer to online classes during our second semester of 2019. I felt as though Franklin college handled the situation very well and our professors did a good job helping us transfer to online.
Sophomore,4,I love Franklin College. It is definitely the right fit if you love a small campus and class sizes. The professors are extremely dedicated and want to help you succeed.
Freshman,4,I'm a Franklin College freshmen and I am also a student-athlete on the track team! My experience at Franklin so far has positive and happy! I have met plenty of new friends and love all my professors! I get the help I need in out and of the classroom and also get to have plenty of fun!
Junior,4,"Franklin College is small campus with amazing professors who are there specifically to teach.  All professors who I have encountered care deeply about their students and make sure to have time during their day to meet with students.  As an able-bodied woman, I have no trouble getting around campus, but there are issues with accessibility for people with disabilities ranging from uneven and cracked sidewalks to unreliable elevators."
Sophomore,4,"Franklin College as a whole is a school that gives students amazing opportunities and return on investment after graduation. This is a private school of less than 2,000 students, so it does struggle in some aspects. But the most important part is, they are constantly working to improve the school! Last year there were many complaints regarding the food, so this year they upgraded and are getting a new company. They also just built a new science building in order to give the students the best education possible. Living in Franklin my whole life, I knew how extraordinary it was already. I just wish all of my peers had the same chance to get to know the campus like me! And becoming a journalism major might have been the best decision I've ever made in regards to college. The professors here are unmatched and stay completely dedicated to giving you the best education possible."
Senior,4,"Franklin has amazing professors and programs, but has little to no interest in improving the school’s technology."
Freshman,4,"I love that the school is very close knit and that it is such a small school! Also, I love that my professors are always there to help you if you are ever stuck on anything. All of the professors are very nice and teach you all lot about life."
Freshman,4,I love how Franklin College is such a small school so I can have a personal relationship with my Professors.
Sophomore,4,Franklin College has a great campus.   I enjoy the small class size and professors that are helpful.   I am happy with my experience so far at Franklin College.
Sophomore,4,Franklin College is an amazing small school with big opportunities. It is extremely easy to be involved academically and with extracurriculars. The professors are always available to help you with any problem - personal or school related.
Freshman,4,I love being a student at Franklin College! The professors and staff are always willing to take the extra step to make sure you get to information and help that you need to be successful.
Freshman,4,It was overall a good experience so far. The things that I would change is better quality of the food and a better surrounding area to do stuff off of campus.
Freshman,4,"I  love the friendly environment! I would love to see more diversity than what's there. I love the team spirits! The dedication to preserving the community feeling! I also love the choices for the sports that you choose to do! I am in Cross Country and I love the feeling of being on a team! They never fail to make someone, like me, feel like they are on a team!"
College Junior,4,"overall this is a great school, and would love others to come here"
College Junior,4,"socially, Greek life helps you meet a lot of people on campus and gives you something to do on the weekend."
College Junior,4,"great place to go, feels like home because of the small school atmosphere"
College Junior,4,Professors are always encouraging us to go on internships and help us get internships as well.
College Junior,4,Having a single is amazing and it costs the same as having a roommate
College Junior,4,It's about half and half people in Greek life versus people who are not.  Everyone is still friendly either way and there is no judgment.
College Junior,4,Franklin has great school spirit.
College Junior,4,"Since Franklin College is small, we have a tight-nit community.  You get to know everyone, including your professors, extremely well!"
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus and know that we have many resources if anything were to happen to us.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics is a big part of campus. Tailgating at school is a big part of getting involved on campus.
College Freshman,4,The professors work one on one with everyone.
College Freshman,4,FC is known for their greek life and service.
College Freshman,4,FC is a small school with many internships.
College Sophomore,4,"There are administrators constantly working and being proactive at recruiting for jobs, internships, scholarships and more for each and every student. My advisor in particular sends several emails out every day for internships and part-time job opportunities in town for college students."
College Sophomore,4,"Franklin College and the student council as well as the SAC are very proactive about informing students about health and safety. Due to the small size of the campus, not a lot goes on without the whole campus being notified immediately. There are call bozes set up around campus and 24 hour easy acces security."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoyed where I was placed in random housing last year in the basement of Elsey hall and hopefully will be staying there again this coming year. Everything is super close to get to because of the size of the campus and residents and security is easy to find and access. Sharing a bathroom with 12 other girls is intimidating at first but it is not as bad as it seems.
College Sophomore,4,Franklin College well maintains and takes care of the athletics at our college.
College Sophomore,4,"Franklin College is such a great hands on school. All of the professors work with you one on one to try and help you benefit from the education there and receive the biggest bang for your buck, essentially. I couldn't imagine another college that helps students as much as Franklin College helps their students."
College Sophomore,4,"Internship and job prospects are very high when graduating from Franklin College.  It is actually a requirement for every student to complete an internship before they are able to graduate.  Franklin College has many connections and nearly 100% of graduates find jobs after graduating.  The school has a built-in opportunity for an internship and jobs through winter term in January, where students have an entire month to complete an internship.  An internship fair takes place in the student center every fall and there is a job fair every spring, which gives students the opportunity to talk to and give their resumes to potential employers."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall I had a wonderful experience with my classes and professors.  My classes challenged me and lead me to choose the career path of psychology.  Franklin College requires students to take a variety of exploratory classes to encourage them to find their true calling, which I think benefits every single student.  My classes were rigorous and challenging but were generally always fair.  The class sizes ranged from about 5-25 which is a perfect fit for me, because each student gets the individual attention they need to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Franklin College and will be a sophomore in the fall.  It is a very small school with only 1,200 students in total, and I absolutely love the small community.  Each and every professor truly has a passion for their subject and are always willing and available to help their students.  I never thought it would be possible to achieve near a 4.0 with a difficult college schedule, but I was able to achieve a 3.94 GPA while taking 18 credit hours and participating in Best Buddies and Franklin College Dance Marathon.  Students are very positive and supportive of each other and the campus provides a wonderful community atmosphere."
College Student,4,There are some pretty nice places and some average places.
College Student,4,"The facilities aren't huge because it's a small school, but definitely adequate and usually very nice and well kept."
College Student,4,Franklin college has a nice small community feel. There are pros and cons to being small. I prefer the small feel where you can know everyone over a huge campus where you could literally meet new people every day!
College Freshman,4,I have heard that Franklin College alumni are very involved and successful.
College Student,4,"The committee takes the safety of the students very seriously, and I feel safer knowing that the take the concerns of the student's into account when considering possible renovations."
College Student,4,Scholarships are greatly encouraged and their are many opportunities to advance your academic career.
College Student,4,Scholarships are greatly encouraged and their are many opportunities to advance your academic career.
College Student,4,"Going to college early at my dream college was the best decision I've ever made. Not only did it give me a head start on my 14 year degree, it reassured me that the college I chose was the one I wanted to attend."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe walking when it is dark
College Freshman,4,I love run cross country and track.But Spurlock could use so works.
College Freshman,4,"As a newly member of Greek life I can say that I enjoy the fraternity I joined and that Greek life at FC has makes a big impact in campus life. Some fraternities have their bad reputations, but overall it's a nice thing that Greeks and Non-Greeks respect."
College Freshman,4,"No matter what activity or sport it may be, there will always be a large number of the students on campus supporting the teams and cheering them on. The activities and sports themselves have great, cooperative teams and members."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus, even at night. Being in such a residential neighborhood gives Franklin a hometown feel and I don't ever feel in danger."
College Sophomore,4,The professors all really care about the topics they teach as well as their students. They want their students to succeed and are willing to go above and beyond to help.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is HUGE at Franklin College, almost half of our student population is involved in greek life. I myself am in a sorority and I feel it helps me in so many different ways and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love Franklin College because so many of the professors really care about their students. They will remember you for the rest of your time there, and are always willing to put down whatever they're doing and help you. The school feels like its own little world and it's a very supportive community."
College Freshman,4,The security on campus is great. The officers are always out to help anyone. If you feel unsafe you can call them and they will walk you to where ever you need to go. They are all about the safety of the students. Crime is not a big deal at Franklin. it just doesn't occur as often as other places.
College Freshman,4,There are many places to live at Franklin. The only thing that really sketches me out is the showers. They are gross and cramped. You learn to deal with it though. The people on my floor always are up for a conversation and we all like each other.
College Freshman,4,The athletics at Franklin College are great for the athletes. I do not think that many students care about the athletic aspect of Franklin. Only the athletes in each particular sport care. Education is the main priority.
College Freshman,4,"Franklin is unique because it is a closely knit community that gets the students involved. With it being a liberal arts school, students graduate as well-rounded individuals."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at Franklin College has been life changing.  I have found opportunities here I never thought I would have.  I have grown as a leader and a person.  My liberal arts education has challenged and molded me into a better human being.  The exposure we receive to the real world really makes the Franklin experience one of a kind.  I visited no other school, applied nowhere else.  Franklin was it for me.  The campus and the people sold me the second I walked on campus.  Everyone here genuinely cares about you.  The professors, staff, and students know your name.  Walking down Dame Mall (the main stretch of campus) is like a family gathering.  People you had class with once aren't just faces, they are names and usually friends.  Franklin's atmosphere speaks for itself.  I encourage anyone to come visit FC, it is truly a special place."
College Senior,4,"Franklin College has allowed to have valuable experiences both in and out of the classroom. Here I have become not only a marketable graduate student and employer, but I have also become a leader and innovator. The small classes give me one-on-one attention from my professors who know that I am more than just a number. The location of Franklin is ideal because it has the small town feel but is also close to larger communities such as Indianapolis. Franklin College has truly been my home away from home for the past 4 years."
College Freshman,4,I have not personally lived off campus but I live in the area and its is a good area.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of variety and it tastes good.
College Freshman,4,The college trusts its students and it is a relaxed environment.
College Freshman,4,The food is pretty good and the cookies are the best. There is the same thing everyday. I wish I had more options.
Junior,2,"Franklin College provides many opportunities for students to be involved within the community and the school. However, the school is run by very WASPy folks. The tuition is high, and the money is rarely spent satisfying the students."
College Freshman,2,The only parties are held off-campus and are usually shut down by 1 or 2 am
College Freshman,2,Franklin is not a party school. Even unregistered parties are boring.
College Freshman,2,"I have a passion for diversity, but the ODI program, BSU, and FC Pride alliance do not receive the recognition that they deserve."
College Freshman,2,The games are rarely publicized and have a very little fan section.
College Senior,2,"My friend and I tried to find off-campus housing in Franklin our last year there and had a lot of trouble. We couldn't find a lot of options with the time limit we needed (9 months). We had trouble contacting a few places. Some we just couldn't afford. Some didn't look like we'd like to live there for nine months. We ended up finding a place in Greenwood and commuting. I know that some people were able to find off-campus housing, but there didn't seem like a lot of options for college students."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly I can hardly afford this school. Franklin's finical aid is weak at best. I have called and left 3 messages alone today and have yet to be contacted. The school does not seem to understand that I am from a family with a single income and two students in college. This is the school of my choice, I love my school and could not imagine going anywhere else. With that said, the finical aid system needs work and I cannot continue to go to this school without more finical aid. The lack of finical aid they have awarded me has created on large finical burden for my family to meet."
College Sophomore,2,My only highlight is the close proximity to classes on the small campus. The rooms are small and outdated as well as being very expensive.
College Sophomore,2,Indiana weather is Indiana weather.
College Sophomore,2,It's what you would expect from a small town.
College Junior,2,I do not think Franklin has a very strict policy when it comes to drug and alcohol consumption and I think problems associating underage drinking and drug use have worsened in the past few years
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol use is very prominent on Franklin's campus. People seem to have the mindset that it is the only way to have fun in Franklin, and it happens every weekend. It is also popular to drink on ""Tipsy Tuesdays."" It is very easy to access alcohol as a minor, and there are many people who encourage minors to drink. If a student does not choose to drink, however, other students do not heavily pressure them to do so. Everyone is understanding of the decision. It is not difficult to be a sober student, even though alcohol is used a ton."
College Sophomore,2,"Not much variety in the ethinicity here. I think this is due to the fact that it is in Franklin, which i shighly populated with mostly white people, and because it's so small other ethnicities do not know much about it."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much – Franklin is a small town with little for students to do. Thankfully, Indianapolis is close by, but then you have to deal with lots of traffic. Everyone pretty much stays on campus or goes home on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Professors Are Awesome – The professors are fantastic at Franklin, but the students don't seem to fit in. Franklin students seem to be a little backwards in their thinking, while the professors are extremely progressive."
College Freshman,2,Fast Food – The only off-campus dining is fast food. Everybody goes to Steak and Shake. If you want your parents to take you out for a nicer dinner you have to drive a half-an-hour north to find a decent restaurant.
College Freshman,2,"Late Night Hunger – Most students on campus tend to stay up till at least midnight and usually crave a late night fast food run. Unfortunately, steak and shake and taco bell are the only options. McDonalds, Rally's, Applebees, Chilis, and every other restraunt aside from the the two previously mentioned are closed by 11:30pm."
College Freshman,1,Sexual assault is only taken seriously by the counseling center and the students. I am embarrassed by the school's policies and approach to sexual assault. It is disgusting.
College Junior,1,"Some meals are okay, but for the most part it is not the best at all. The workers are either really nice or unpleasant. There are not many options and not much fresh foods. What is ""fresh"" is covered with preservatives that don't settle well. There are many options that are offered in the town."
College Sophomore,1,I can't find a major that's interesting or that I would be able to get a job in. I'm looking to transfer.
College Sophomore,1,Very few scholarships apply to anything but tuition. I received one of the most prestigious scholarships and I can't use it because my tuition is already covered through tuition remission.
College Sophomore,1,"The lack of diversity on this campus can sometimes be frustrating. Not just for the minority students but also for non-minority students. Without any real diversity on this campus, other students will have little to no experience in dealing with individuals from different cultures, religions, races and ethnic backgrounds. FC prepares their students for a lot of things but diversity in the workplace or just life in general isn't one of them. Even the faculty/staff lacks diversity."
College Freshman,1,The majority of the students at Franklin College are white Christians who have lived in Indiana their entire lives. The majority of students also share the same socio-economic status.

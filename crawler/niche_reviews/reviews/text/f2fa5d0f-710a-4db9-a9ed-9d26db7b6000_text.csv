Freshman,5,I have no online classes this semester. My classes are more spaced out so that they can all remain in person.
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my time at CNU. The architecture I beautiful, the faculty and professors are so helpful and fellow students are very friendly. There were always so many activities to participate in from movie night on the Great Lawn to Glow runs and more! I can only hope that LU is as great when I get earn Master’s degree!"
Alum,5,CNU did not offer online courses when I attended. However we did have one day of online class during a hurricane when our professors posted lectures on Scholar.
Freshman,5,It was a great experience. They are constantly trying to make sure students are truly understanding. They are very organized especially in a situation like this.
Freshman,5,CNU has a beautiful campus. It has staff that truly cares for students. There are so many opportunities at this college.
Junior,5,I love this school. It has awesome students and teachers. The only critique would be their CHECS. CHECS at times is very unnecessary and hurts the environment and culture at the school.
Junior,5,"Despite COVID-19, the professors were still able to make our virtual classroom have the same learning experience as the normal (face-to-face) classroom would have."
Junior,5,"Several things I love about Christopher Newport University are the beautiful campus itself, the food, the many fields that are available, the hospitality of President Trible, the staff, the students, the whole Newport News area, etc., the amount of services, its motto ""Students Come First"", the fact that the school is surrounded by many convenient stores and facilities, etc."
Freshman,5,"I personally was satisfied with the online learning experience at CNU. Since most of what I had to do in my classes was online anyway or could be easily taught online, it wasn't as difficult of a transition for me.My teachers did a really good job at making sure we had a sufficient amount of resources to ensure our understanding of the topics. I personally liked my classes where we met on Zoom or Google Meets at the designated class time because we could interact like we did normally in class."
Freshman,5,"I love my school. As an out of state student, I was worried about meeting new people in an area I'm not familiar with, but I felt a home as soon as I got to campus. I feel like there is a place for everyone on campus if you look for it. I didn't find it too hard to adjust to campus life because the first week incoming freshman are on campus, we have Welcome Week and that made me feel more comfortable with my peers and introduced me to the community that I was about to be a part of. I made so great friends and all the teacher I had and staff I met were so awesome and welcoming. When they said they had a door holding tradition at CNU, they meant it. All the people I met were so friendly , and to top it all off the campus is beautiful. Sometimes I just want to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Overall, I had a great first year and I felt like I really made the right choice going to CNU, and I am looking forward to going back as soon as possible."
Senior,5,"Being a Music Major, I am not present in a majority of the main campus at school. But the love and support that just the athletic bands alone receive during football and basketball games is something I have never experienced before. Some of my favorite memories will be celebrating a Captain's Football victory and singing the Alma Mater with the football team from the stands. The sense of family truly echoes across our university loud enough for anyone to hear. To feel that sense of pride in being a Captain is something everyone at Christopher Newport University can relate to, no matter what year or major you are. Not to mention, CNU is one of the most breathtaking college campuses I have ever seen, it is a privilege to attend such a fine vibrant university. There are clubs and different activities on campus so that everyone can find their niche group of people who have similar hobbies/passions! They have everything from light saber club to a cinema club, with everything in between!"
Junior,5,"I like the culture of the school and the drive by all those involved to be best we can be.  There is a strong emphasis on living up to your full potential and exploring all the things you're interested in. Classes are very interesting and if I a particular professor is being detrimental to your education, teacher surveys are taken highly into  account when determining their permanent status at CNU."
Freshman,5,The people and opportunities at Christopher Newport University are amazing. Professors and administrators care about each student. You are not just a number when you are a student at Christopher Newport University.
Sophomore,5,"I love CNU! My sister graduated from CNU in 2019 and she also loved CNU! This school is very welcoming to everyone. Faculty, staff, and students are all friendly and helpful."
Alum,5,I thoroughly enjoyed earning a social work degree at Christopher Newport University. The small-school atmosphere made learning enjoyable.
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at Christopher Newport University! It provided many opportunities for me to get involved on campus and in the surrounding community. I made life long friends and obtained a great education! One thing that I would like to see changed is the housing and class registration system. Though I got lucky and did not struggle, some of my friends had a difficult time signing up for the classes they needed."
Sophomore,5,I love everything about Christopher Newport University! The atmosphere is very welcoming and I never get tired of the beauty of the waters around us. It also just feels like home and you meet the most incredible people here.
Niche User,5,I have visited the school many times and plan to attend the school for the next four years. I am extremely excited to start the next chapter of my life at CNU. The campus is beautiful and just screams high level learning.
Sophomore,5,Christopher Newport University is a beautiful and safe campus.  The students and professors work together and it like a community in itself.  It provides a high quality education to students along with teaching the core values of life.
Junior,5,"Such a fun-sized campus with great student-teacher relationships! The small size of the campus makes involvement easy, the commute to class short and sweet, and the transition to freshman year much less stressful than larger schools. It feels like a family, and I’m so happy to have spent an amazing three years there (and counting)!"
Freshman,5,I am a freshman and an out of state student attending Christopher Newport University. My experience has been a positive one.  The students and staff are there with open arms to help with any questions or concerns you may have.
Freshman,5,"I currently attend CNU and I am loving it. The academics are strong and my programs keep me busy, but I still manage to spend time with friends or attend one of the numerous fun events put on by the campus activities board. It has its pros and cons, like every college, but I'm very glad I picked CNU."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school, it is the perfect balance of serious academics and fun social life! Not to mention it is absolutely gorgeous. The greek life here is fantastic and has an organization for everyone and really helps people get involved on campus!"
Freshman,5,"Christopher Newport University provides an excellent academic foundation to all of its students. CNU gives everyone a well rounded education leading into the workforce, that many schools are lacking now. You get to know your professors due to the small class sizes, and it’s amazing! This is great for people who need letter of recommendation leading into graduate programs. It is a very underrated school that is on the rise to becoming prestigious. I would highly recommend applying!"
Junior,5,"Great education, great professors, and great environment. CNU offers its students many opportunities for growth and developing character."
Freshman,5,I think this is a very fun and amazing place to be at.  I would not like to be at any other college.  I would like to see nothing change at all.
Junior,5,"Christopher Newport University is a diverse community that focuses on its students to achieve not only in academics, but in a full lifestyle."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Christopher Newport University. I'm a rising junior and a member of Greek life on campus as well as a part of the CNU varsity Women's Soccer team. There is always something to be involved in on campus no matter what you're interested in; involvement is the key! The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, truly making CNU a home away from home. The only thing I would like to see changed is more parking for students!"
Niche User,5,It's  a wonderful university where students have a great experience in growth and learning. I would change nothing to this university.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE everything about the campus (minus parking)! The environment is truly storybook. It is so welcoming, easy-going, and productive. I made the right choice"
Sophomore,5,Christopher Newport University is an excellent school both in and out of the classroom. It offers an open and welcoming atmosphere perfect for studying and forming long lasting meaningful relationships.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is well kept, people are very friendly, lots to do in the surrounding area, and the focus is well maintained on student success."
Sophomore,5,I am so grateful to call CNU my home for the next five years while working towards my masters. The faculty is amazing and everyone is so kind on campus. It really feels like home. The teachers truly care about each and every student's well being  both in the classroom and at home.
Niche User,5,"Christopher Newport University is nestled in Newport News, Virginia.  It is a modern and beautiful campus.  The dorms are modern and nice, the professors work with you in order for all to succeed, and the food is good!"
Junior,5,I live nearby in the neighborhood so I have grown up walking the campus.  It has literally grown with me.  I couldn’t think of a better place to get my undergraduate degree!
Freshman,5,"The school helps incoming students to adjust very well. The school provides excellent staff, dining, counseling services, and the professors are amazing."
Freshman,5,"Christopher Newport is the friendliest campus I have ever been on.  The professors have been so polite and understanding, which has helped me do the best that I possibly can.  Although I am a freshman, Christopher Newport University has already improved my reading, writing, and speaking abilities."
Sophomore,5,I haven't been here long but I already am in love with my school. From day 1 I felt welcome and cared about; I wasn't just a number. The entire staff from admissions to professors to our President cares about our success. There are so many different resources available to help us succeed.
Niche User,5,"I honestly loved every aspect about Christopher Newport University, especially the homeliness and cleanliness of the campus. The feeling that overwhelmed me as soon as I stepped on campus was a sure factor it was the place for me. I have no overall complaints about this university."
Niche User,5,"This University has very good programs in every field. It is a perfect size, about 5000 students, and an organized campus. Everyone that I have met at CNU, both students and faculty, is lovely, and I am always greeted with a smile."
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere and how everyone looks after one another. If I leave my bag on the lawn, I know that no one will even think about taking it. I love how all of my professors work with me to help me pass my classes."
Niche User,5,It is a beautiful campus that I have heard so many great things about. I am very interested in applying for next year. A recent graduate of my high school currently attends and highly enjoys it.
Freshman,5,The campus is a clean and safe environment. All students and staff are friendly and supportive. Academics is rigorous and plentiful of clubs and organizations to participate or volunteer in.
Freshman,5,"When applying to colleges, Christopher Newport University was originally my safety school, so I never truly considered it to be an option for my future. I never researched the school; the only detail I knew about it was that it is near the beach and is small in size. However, once I was accepted into the university, I decided to look into the values and set up of the college. When I visited the school in the spring, I fell in love with the campus, people and environment as a whole. The most prominent reason I decided to attend Christopher Newport University was because of the university's policy of living a life of significance. Being here only a month, I have seen this incorporated in classes and everyday life. There is always an activity to do or a class to take, but I would appreciate more communication and marketing of events. Overall, there are many things to do and accomplish, and CNU promotes all of it."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at CNU and felt like I got a great education here. The professors are wonderful, dorms are great, buildings are immaculate. I wouldn't trade my experience at CNU for anything."
Sophomore,5,"Words cannot begin to describe how much pride I have every time I say I am a Christopher Newport Captain. CNU was my first pick university and each and everyday I take a moment to reflect on how thankful I am to be at such a well-respected university where the facility, staff, and students take pride in their work and challenge themselves everyday to be the best they can be. I take the values CNU expresses, service, character, and integrity, to heart"
Senior,5,"Christopher Newport University is one of the best small, public school experiences a student can hope for. The campus is alive with Greek life, academics, and community interest groups. Everyone is very polite and holds doors for strangers in a traditional, kind southern fashion. Overall, a wonderful school full of wonderful people."
Freshman,5,"What I liked about Christopher Newport University was when I first arrived on campus I felt like I belonged. The one thing that I would change about Christopher Newport would be, honesty I don’t know."
Junior,5,"Christopher Newport is honestly a fantastic university if you are going there to focus on sports and academics. The facilities, as well as the faculty, are unmatched compared to others nearby schools. However, the downfalls of the school include its diversity. The majority of all minorities going to that school are going there as a student-athlete, and the party scene could be more desirable, but due to the schools moderate size it limits how much of a party school it can be."
Freshman,5,"Great campus, good food, caring professors and overall great school. Near the beach, dorms are spacious and nice, and campus is small and a very tight-nit community."
Senior,5,CNU is a great school. I absolutely love how small it is because I learn a lot better and I am able to form relationships with my professors.
Sophomore,5,"I have had the best experience during my first year at Christopher Newport. The professors genuinely care for your well-being and work to built relationships with you in and out of the classroom. Professors are more than willing to help you outside of class time. It is a very diverse campus where people of all ethnicities and political backgrounds coexist happily. Additionally, the housing at Christopher Newport is superb. Though you are required to live on campus for three years, you never share a bathroom with more than four other people. Furthermore, by your third year, you are provided a room and bathroom to yourself."
Junior,5,"CNU is a beautiful and friendly campus. I absolutely have loved my time spent here! It is a small school which allows you to make friends quickly as well as get to know your professors personally so that you are known by name, not a number."
Freshman,5,"CNU is incredibly diverse and all around welcoming to any and everyone. There are multiple ways to get involved and everyone makes you feel at home on campus, from staff to students."
Freshman,5,One of the cutest campuses ever! Everything is very organized/easy to find plus the buildings are fairly new. All of the faculty is helpful and willing to go out of their way to assist students and visitors alike!
Niche User,5,The campus and dorms are absolutely beautiful and the student body is very welcoming and fun to be around. I completely understand why so many of my friends love it there.
Freshman,5,"I came in to CNU expecting to transfer but I absolutely love it! Amazing professors, incredibly nice students, so many clubs and amazing organizations! such a beautiful campus!"
Graduate Student,5,I love how small the classes are. I have a personal connection with all of my professors. I also love how beautiful the campus is. My friends and I love to hang out on the Great Lawn.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone on campus is very friendly and the teachers do their best to make sure their students are able to make the most out of their education. Because it's a small campus, students and staff often become familiar with each other which helps to make the atmosphere much more friendly and comfortable, and almost like a small family. Whenever there was an issue I ran or someone I knew ran into with others on campus, the staff was quick to help us and try to find solutions suitable for all involved parties, and they never hesitated when someone felt like they were in danger. All in all I've felt very comfortable here and I don't regret my decision in choosing this school one bit."
Niche User,5,"What I like about CNU is the campus environment and the people who are friendly. My peers, advisors, professors, and faculty members were willing to help out whenever I need it. CNU has special lunch meetings for transfer students like me to meet and greet with each other  and also learn how to become more engaged on campus activities. They also have interesting clubs and sports such as Quidditch and Star Wars Knights of the Force club."
Sophomore,4,"I like how it is a smaller school, so the community is smaller and closer together. It is also easier to keep up with new friends. It is easy to make new friends, and orientation is a great part of that. The education can be pretty rigorous, so good. They also make you take classes outside of your major, which can be annoying, but widens your horizons and may show you something you actually like more."
Freshman,4,"I love the Christopher Newport community. It is super welcoming, and very beautiful. I wish they would improve their costs and financial aid."
Freshman,4,Christopher Newport University is a welcoming community full of aspiring leaders and productive minds.
Freshman,4,"I did not take any classes online while attending Christopher Newport University, but I'd imagine it would still be a good learning experience."
Alum,4,I absolutely love CNU! CNU is a good school with great professors who prepare students for the workforce and graduate school.
Junior,4,"CNU provides a quality education that opens many doors for opportunity while promoting a safe and compassionate learning environment. The school teaches students many life skills and encourages professionalism across campus. The only downside to this school is its lack of diversity, however, its newly formed diversity team is working hard to allow for more diversity and inclusion across campus."
Junior,4,The professors were excellent and worked very well with me and my internet struggles. Obviously this isn't the ideal way to learn however with the circumstance they did and excellent job.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the small classes, which allowed for relationships with professors. I love the small campus size as well as how easy it is to get involved."
Senior,4,"CNU was my dream school and I was so excited to start my education here. While the Disney-esque fantasy that admissions touts is not the reality, life at CNU is pretty great, especially compared with other campuses.  

Academics are amazing- all of my professors were supportive and encouraging. Our unique Honor Code allows for trust throughout the campus community. One can leave their belongings in the library for hours and return to find everything still there.  

There is a thick layer of malfeasance underneath CNU's golden-roofed buildings. Diversity is not encouraged and BIPOC and non-Christian students are not always warmly welcomed. The Title IX office, responsible for investigating acts of discrimination, has ruled in a rapist's favor far too many times than I can detail here. In this sense, CNU is more concerned with avoiding lawsuits rather than protecting victims of sexual violence.

CNU is a great place to learn. Just don't expect any help from the school if you are harmed."
Freshman,4,Christopher Newport University is a very nice college with excellent academic opportunities and incredible housing.
Freshman,4,I have not done online learning with CNU as of yet due to the fact that I am an incoming freshman who hasn't taken online courses at the college.
Alum,4,"I would say that taking online classes during the Co-Void crisis showcased how passionate and caring professors at CNU are . They are very compassionate and understanding of life situations hindering one's ability in the classroom. As long as you communicate with your professors , they are very understanding and willing to help you achieve your goals."
Alum,4,My experience at Christopher Newport University was overall a good experience . I really enjoy the campus being small because everyone is there for each other and the classes are smaller which allows you to talk to your professors more . The professors and faculty want to see you succeed and they will put the work in if you come to them. One downfall I would recommend is more diversity being an African American and having more activities for students.
Sophomore,4,"I love Christopher Newport University and I'm glad I chose to transfer there. The only downside is the limited parking. The students are extremely nice and willing to help when asked. Professors are also willing to help, and they want their students to succeed."
Niche User,4,It is a great college with a campus that is small but fits everything that a college needs. The food there is great plus there athletic is good as well. Overall the school is very good and I'd recommend that anyone go there.
Senior,4,"Christopher Newport University  provides top living conditions for students, rigorous academics, and has a plethora of extra-curricular activities. More than half of the athletic teams are conference-winning teams. The faculty at CNU truly care about the success of their students, which can be seen through weekly office hours and a Caring Captains program in which the professors check in on any student that has not attended class in over a week or seems distant during class time.
 
Given that no university is perfect, CNU could improve by reconsidering the delegation of scholarships based on needs rather than first-come-first-serve and should also consider factors such as race and socio-economic level. This would also benefit the university by allowing for a more diverse student population. The university is currently a predominantly white campus within a community that is not. The Newport News area has a much more diverse population with a heavier demographic of African Americans."
Senior,4,"I absolutely love CNU. I have met so many incredible individuals here and this university has taught me a lot. The campus isn't too big or too small. The campus is small enough where you will get to be familiar with a lot of individuals on campus but also big enough where you aren't going to know everyone who goes to school here. However, there are some issues that need to be brought up. It is required for CNU students to live on campus for 3 years, which isn't a problem. However, there is a overpopulation in the amount of students being accepted. This is the result of promises of newer residence halls that have yet been created. I love my school but I know there is so much more potential here."
Freshman,4,"If you are looking for a place that will challenge you intellectually, make you think critically, and really put in the work for your degree, CNU is a great place for you. I do feel like the education I am getting here is worth my time and money, even though it is an expensive school."
Junior,4,"Great (honestly really good) dorms, meh food. Professors are usually very helpful and good at engaging students in the course material. The campus looks amazing and is fairly new. If you want a smaller, more intimate college experience at an in-state cost, you should seriously consider CNU. There is definitely a large Greek Life presence but many people (including myself) aren't in Greek Life. There are many clubs on campus and it isn't too difficult to start your own if you want! The campus is pretty safe as well."
Freshman,4,I absolutely love CNU! The campus is beautiful. The residence halls are new and clean.  My classes and professors are engaging.  It's a wonderful place to study.
Freshman,4,"close to home, friendly, good food and dorms, clean, not much to do in the surrounding area, no local transportation via school, decent sports teams."
Junior,4,"I have really loved my experience here at CNU so far! My favorite part has been the academic sector. The professors have been amazing, really seeming to care about students and being willing/able to explain material in ways that are effective. They are completely willing to work with you in whatever areas you may be struggling, and want to see you exceed here. The campus itself is a beautiful place, and the classrooms/labs are up to date, making class time really pleasant. The only thing CNU lacks is more support for commuter students, of which I am one, but it seems that my fellow classmates really enjoy living on campus. Overall, I would highly recommend coming to CNU, and will thoroughly miss it here once I graduate!"
Niche User,4,I just had my interview and I loved my interviewer. We bonded personally in ways that even if they matched our interests it might not have lined up. She made me feel welcome and that I had a great shot at getting in. She was reassuring and promised that I would feel a part of the campus life. It is now one of my top schools.
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and I love the people there. I would like to see more scholarships available for those out-of-state.
Junior,4,"Christopher Newport University has a beautiful campus and knowledgeable  professors! Due to their smaller class sizes, my professors can actually learn my name while developing real relationships. CNU also has a great support system in place for their students. I honestly can't see myself anywhere else and do not regret choosing to come here!"
Niche User,4,"This University is absolutely breath taking. Beautiful building, everyone is friendly, and it has everything a college student needs. This is a very tight knit campus and the people running it really do care about every single one of its students. I learned all of this from just one visit."
Alum,4,"CNU is a small school which means you get to know your professors very well. There has been a lot of construction lately, which has led to many new dorm buildings, library, and dining hall. This has resulted in more available apartment style dorms, study rooms, and space in the dining halls so you don't have to worry about taking your meals to go all the time. The campus is also small and only takes about a 7 minute walk from one end to the other, so you're always able to get places on time. The dorm buildings are all relatively new, with the exception of two older buildings. The upper classroom dorms are apartment style with separate bedrooms and bathrooms for each student with a shared kitchen between 3-5 students in the apartment."
Junior,4,"Cnu makes the students feel like a family and that they are always welcome to talk whether with the staff or the professors. It is a place that could be considered home and when you're a captain, captains hold doors for others. There is a large number of clubs that can be found on campus that is used to create a sense of community and a place where you can truly be yourselves. It is great given the relationships that you build with the professors even after you have already finished their course."
Sophomore,4,"I found out about CNU the summer before my senior year started. I had already planned out where I was going to go to school but decided I'd give it a chance anyway. I went for a tour and the moment I stepped onto campus, I immediately fell in love with the beauty of it. Everything looked new and the grass was very green. Loved everything the tour guides had to say about the school. Fast forward to now, I've finished my first year and still love the school as much as I did then. I've been challenged a good amount academically and have made friends with people I didn't think I would."
Junior,4,"Christopher Newport University is a unique institution.   From the small class sizes to the luscious green grass and numerous columns that surround you when you enter in, it is a breathtaking site.  Not only does the campus look good, but students here feel good as well.  Small class sizes allow professors to actually know the names of all their students and provides for time for which one-on-ones can be had.  There are so many good things at this university."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the people that I had the opportunity of meeting. Luckily my roommate and I quickly became best friends and got along well. We were able to meet people easily and everyone is friendly.
Sophomore,4,The campus environment is like none other! The students and staff genuinly care about your sucess and are here for you every step of the way. They have invested in state of the art facilities that make the learning environment that much better.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve been able to get involved with many of the faculty on campus due to the small class sizes, and really get to know my professors and peers."
Junior,4,"At CNU I've started two clubs, joined a sorority, and found myself going to a school-related conference every other weekend. At CNU your professors know your name, I've gotten emails when I didn't perform as well as expected on a test. In one of my classes we got to go out to dinner with a professor twice in others we got to go to local conferences. With CNU you get in what you put out, if you want to be involved and make friends the opportunity is there. I find myself as a campus where I feel safe walking across campus at 3am after a few drink, and whenever I go to the dining hall there is at least one person I know. CNU is a small school but it comes with opportunities that can't be taken advantage of at larger universities"
Sophomore,4,"CNU has very good academics and helps the student body to feel at home with lots of events and activities on campus to help the student get involved. There are beautiful buildings all over the university's campus, giving the area a good name as it is known for housing the gorgeous campus. There is a major lack of diversity on campus, however it is a new university that is still working on gaining more diversity."
Niche User,4,"I have visited here and the campus is a very comforting environment, the people are very welcoming and I could definitely see myself going to school here."
Junior,4,"This university has provided me with  wonderful opportunities for research and volunteer work. Most faculty members are highly invested in their students and take great care in preparing them for the future. The dorms are great, food is fantastic, and the campus is gorgeous. There are a few too many required courses (part of the liberal learning core) such as dance/theater, etc that tend to lower student GPAs and take time away from priority coursework. Other than that academics are great."
Sophomore,4,"Christopher Newport is a small school that the students either love or dislike, there's not much of an in between. I am one of the students who loves it. I live an ocean away from home so the small campus and community environment is exactly what I needed. The teachers and administration is involved, the facilities are top tier, students are great, and the campus itself is gorgeous. Some people don't love cnu because there aren't tons of people, so if you didn't meet the perfect group of friends like I did, you may have to work a little harder on your social life. Frats throw parties every weekend and tailgate season is a blast. If you are tired of the frat scene I found older friends with houses who have kickbacks that are just as if not more fun."
Junior,4,"I have loved my time at CNU. I like the small class sizes and personable professors. The small campus size is perfect for not having to walk miles to class like some larger universities. Overall, it is a very good college."
Sophomore,4,"The environment is great on campus and many facilities are available for the children to use. Some of the dorms are kind of grimy, but it's bearable. Some very extreme opinions are present at this school, but you just have to find your group. The president is a great man and very easy to talk to. Overall, a great experience."
Senior,4,"The professors here will really push you to your academic limits. Academics are very intense here. CNU has a great campus, dorms, and academic facilities. There are tons of clubs and organizations to join. Over half the student body is in Greek Life, so it's a big deal here. Academic diversity is lacking, as well as student diversity. Many students are from the same area in Virginia. The party scene sucks, unless you are in greek life. Safety is really good; I've never felt unsafe on campus."
Freshman,4,"Tuition is kind of high, but it's a great school.  Professors are helpful in every way, the other students are so kind.  The campus itself is beautiful, and there's always something to do on campus."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at CNU was amazing! The outside scenery is beautiful. The grass, flowers, buildings, equipment, etc is very well up kept. The University President is extremely friendly and proactive within the community, which gives a very welcoming feeling. The dorms are very nice compared to other colleges surrounding the peninsula. The student to teacher ratio really helps students become comfortable with asking questions in a formal setting and learn more hands on."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely stunning, the classes truly are small and it is easy to have personal relationships with professors and faculty members. Almost every faculty member is passionate about their job and will do anything to invest in their students either academically or by supporting their other endeavors. Campus is very safe and there are a multitude of opportunities for extracurricular involvement and community service. The residence halls are relatively new and dorms are much larger and nicer than what other public universities offer. Only downside is that available scholarships are small compared to other universities and it is rather expensive for a public school, and most scholarships only apply if the student lives on-campus."
Sophomore,4,"The campus itself is beautiful and an incredible place to live. The education is hit or miss, like most schools. I have had great professors, okay professors, and angry and unhelpful professors. I have been able to find out things that I love, and pursue them here on campus, which has been amazing! I enjoy spending my time in the theater department as well as working on shows. The campus is tight knit and a great place to be. It has its ups and downs, but I am glad I chose to attend this university."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at CNU and I love it here. Its not much of a party scene, but theres plenty of things to do on campus and the surrounding area. The food is amazing here especially on theme meal nights. The professors are nice and understanding here and really make an effort to get to know the students. Safety is not an issue here on campus I always feel safe walking around on campus no matter what time it is."
Alum,4,"Campus is absolutely gorgeous! The buildings are all very pretty and plenty of green space provided. It is a small school so its not for everyone. They are pretty strict on the rules, as it is a dry campus. Cafeteria food is not the worst Ive had but not the best either."
Freshman,4,The professors and administrators here at CNU will do everything they can to help you out and the people at CNU generally care about you and your success at this University
Sophomore,4,"CNU is a great school. It has a beautiful campus, and amazing professors. I have yet to have a professor I didn't like. My only complaint is all the construction. We are a rapidly expanding school and our campus is struggling to keep up. Other than that, I love it here."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I enjoy being a student at Christopher Newport. The professors are very good and teach in a way that makes you understand. The campus is lovely and allows you to reach your class in time even if you do wake up late. The only annoyance is the strictness of the rules."
Sophomore,4,"CNU is great school, the campus is  beautiful and it gives you a sense of being at home. All of the students are really nice and polite and everyone is welcoming. As a student athlete, the combination of the two is a challenge but it will definitely prepare you for major hardships later in life. The campus is also very diverse which is great because you meet so many different people from all over. It has been a great experience so far and I cannot wait to spend my last two years of college here."
Senior,4,Christopher Newport University offers a diverse place to be unique. It allows and inspired you to grow as a person and help the community grow. It offers a wide selection of opportunities to branch out of your comfort zone and discover new cultures.
Niche User,4,"Christopher Newport was amazing to visit, the environment was so pure and the people there were very nice."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and everyone on campus is extremely friendly. The professor are invested in helping students succeed in their classes.
Freshman,4,I thoroughly enjoy my college and most of its facets. I would like to see more funding for the arts.
Freshman,4,"Christopher Newport University was a school I was hesitant to attend, but have been enjoying the experience thus far. The staff is truly there to help you and are of the highest educators I have seen. The students are friendly, but as a small school it can be easy to get caught up in certain cliques. Overall I recommend this university."
Junior,4,"Cnu has been everything I hoped and more! I am home here and the facilities, faculty and classes are all amazing."
Freshman,4,My experience so far at Christopher Newport University has been wonderful. I have made friends with common interests thanks to the university's use of learning communities. I have been able to get involved on campus in my first year here and I look forward to continuing my education and involvements in the coming years.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Christopher Newport University, I love and hate this school. The academics at this school are great and the campus is beautiful, but this school isn't diverse at all. Being a minority at this school is sometimes hard because you get the racist comments that nobody thinks are racist. The professors and workers are very nice and understanding, but some of the students are rude."
Freshman,4,"The academics are great and the school is beautiful! There is a lack of things to do off campus due to the location but that's not a big deal. The food that they have is good, but there aren't many options for people with dietary restrictions."
Junior,2,The online learning experience due to COVID-19 was not good. I believe it is due to the learning curve since a lot of the professors at CNU aren't used to teaching online.
Senior,2,"Lots of rich, privileged  white kids. Little diversity. Little slack is given for students who dont pay out of pocket. Housing is supposed to be the best in the country yet they run out of housing two hours into housing day and have to randomly place students over the summer. Overadmitted students so class sizes are getting bigger.  Money is spent on dumb things like ice sculptures instead of better housing or parking

If you dont get involved in greek life, then youre an outcast. But if you try to do greek life, then you are ridiculed into the last remaining sorority you virtually sell your soul to."
Junior,2,"CNU puts on a beautiful front. But then you discover they are overcrowded, constantly under construction, tuition constantly rising, full of entitled students that are as fake as the administration. Everyone fears graduating late because classes are capped at ridiculous sizes so they can brag about the small class sizes. The school only does things to benefit their bank account, they don't care about the students."
College Junior,2,There is a lot of sexual assault on campus
College Senior,2,We do not have all the NPHC orgs
College Senior,2,"There's not much of a ""party"" scene as far as I know. There's no good local bars or clubs for those of legal age and public transportation is terrible."
College Senior,2,"I have no clue where the good parties are. I imagine that fraternities and sororities have their get-togethers, but being a dry campus, they would have to go elsewhere for those sort of festivities."
College Freshman,2,Basically everyone is white and there's this vague Christian vibe to the school but if you aren't religious you're probably in the majority.
College Sophomore,2,Not much support to athletics as CNU is a Division III school.
College Student,2,RA never enforced quiet hours.
College Junior,2,Its bad . Can't hardly get the room you want even as an upperclassman
College Junior,2,Not many to choose from
College Junior,2,people go to parties here to get trashed. no mature social life here at all (social drinking parties). the guys at the parties just use the girls who go there for their own benefit.
College Junior,2,Not really a fan of any of the nightlife here. People go to parties to get trashed. definitely not any mature social life here
College Freshman,2,"Coming from Northern Virginia I expected more diversity. There's a decent amount of African American students but other than that it's pretty white. Religiously VERY homogenous. I grew up Catholic being friends with Muslim kids, Jewish kids, some Hindu kids, and Protestants. There are literally no girls in hijabis and I'm not sure if our campus even has a muslim group. Here just being Catholic makes me feel kinda different(NOT persecuted, just different) basically everyone is Protestant, usually baptist. This is pretty obvious because one of the most popular things to be involved in is contemporary religious worship groups like Cru, Thrive, InterVarsity etc. Not a bad thing, just something to get used to"
College Freshman,2,"The amount of restrictions that administration puts on students is approaching ridiculous. There is very little personal freedom in the rules, and everything is done so the school can look good on paper with good numbers"
College Junior,2,"Aesthetically, it's incredible. However, campus life is nonexistent, and there is never anything to do. CNU prides itself on it's library, however it is basically a whole lot of nothing. There isn't very much study space in the library, nowhere near enough computers, the hours of operation are awful, and there aren't enough books. I had to do a research paper on a relatively common religion (Sikhism), and the library had 3 books on Sikhism - and one was essentially a copy of another. If CNU really wants to be a revered institution, it needs to get it's act together."
College Junior,2,"It's very boring, has no campus life, underfunded academics, bland/boring food. Everything about CNU is underwhelming."
College Junior,2,"The buildings and campus itself are very nice, but that is there the positives end. The administration is strict and very domineering over student freedom, the campus life is empty and boring, the academics are decent but still need work, the dining hall food is repetitive and boring. CNU needs vast improvement."
College Junior,2,"The school is practically unheard of, employers won't care about a degree from CNU, there is no alumni network."
College Junior,2,"There is very little diversity. Mostly white Christians from Northern Virginia, Richmond, or VA beach. Coming from a diverse high school, I definitely wish there was more diversity. It's very bland."
College Junior,2,"It's awful, their priorities are completely twisted. All the admin cares about is stopping drinking and building new, attractive buildings and making the campus look nice. They spend very little time and effort improving the academic programs or giving the students things to do on campus."
College Junior,2,"Boring, gross, and dangerous are three great ways to describe Newport News. You need a car to get anywhere, but the city itself is boring and lacks life. Sure, there's the Patrick Henry Mall, but that gets extremely repetitive. If you want to have a good off-campus experience, I suggest either going up to Williamsburg or down to VA beach. Newport News is not a fun place."
College Sophomore,2,they have a bad housing system
College Junior,2,Greek life pretty much is non existent and there are very few organizations
College Junior,2,Parking decals cost way too much and parking is very far away
College Junior,2,Extremely strict when it comes to drinking and parking
College Student,2,There's a reason it's such a dry campus
College Sophomore,2,"It is not a very diverse campus by any means. Very high majority of white people, including myself. For religion, it is a Christian campus and most of the students are Christian that go there. For sexual orientation, I feel the campus would be accepting but I do not believe that their is are too many that chose CNU that are not heterosexual. "
College Freshman,2,"Night life is almost non existent. I have been to a party or two and they were okay, nothing to rave about."
College Senior,2,"CNU keeps accepting more students each year and keeps depleting parking areas for building.  The campus offers ample parking for on-campus students but not for commuters.  Commuter parking is far and very limited.  If you park off campus in local businesses' parking, you risk getting fined and/or towed."
College Senior,2,CNU does not offer very many transportation options.  There are Zip cars only.  The city of Newport News provides the HRT buses and taxis.  Students must primarily rely on themselves for any sort of transport.  Most of everything that a student would need though is within walking distance.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is a big issue on campus. Depending on where you live, it can take you 10 minutes to get from your car to your dorm. The cost is also a bit much."
College Junior,2,Not a lot of diversity but everyone is welcome.  No discrimination of any sorts.
College Junior,2,Parts of Newport News aren't entirely safe but others are.
College Junior,2,No public trans. but most students have cars.
College Junior,2,"When it rains, it pours."
College Junior,2,It is not overwhelming but available.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot to choose from at CNU.
College Junior,2,"It's still a rather small school so I know a lot of other students. There are not many international students on campus, and there isn't a large percentage of different races on campus, but I would consider the White/Caucasian race to be the largest percentage."
College Junior,2,"Parking permits are often expensive and there are definitely not enough spaces to park all of the cars here. Often drivers will have to park somewhere all the way across campus because of the lack of spots. While it is not necessary to have a car on campus, it is definitely convenient sometimes although the campus police are very quick to ticket cars for any reason."
College Senior,2,"Being a CS major, I love most everything about the program. However, for the first 3 years of my college career, we were located in the most run-down building on campus. Also, some of the professors are difficult to understand or difficult to work with."
College Sophomore,2,"You are required to live on campus for a minimum of three years. If you apply to get off it is very difficult and you have to have a legit excuse such as allergies, diseases, etc."
College Freshman,2,"I do SEE people that aren't white, but we are still overwhelmingly caucasian.  Lots of sexual diversity, though.  And there are liberals on campus, but the university itself is very conservative."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few options right off campus. You can find more variety if you have a car off campus and are willing to look. A lot of chains. Right across campus there is Panera, Subway, a suchi place, a sports bar, and Moes. There is also Plaza Azteca just down the road which is super yummy!"
College Freshman,2,Received little aid and they lost my papers twice. Keep up with your financial aid officer and have multiple copies of forms ready.
College Freshman,2,Most people are white Christians with a good amount of money.
College Senior,2,"There is some diversity on campus-- religious, cultural, and ethnic-- but holistically, CNU is a homogenous group of students. Many come from the same area of the country, and have similar religious beliefs."
College Senior,2,"I have had horrid experiences with parking. I remember having to actually sit in the parking lot and wait for students to come out to their cars in order to get a spot... like musical chairs with parking. The parking garage is a safe spot because it has so many empty spaces, but it's a little bit of a walk to class from there."
College Sophomore,2,"They have campus vans that clubs can rent out and zip cars you can rent for longer distance stuff but that's pretty much it. Then again, CNU is a small school and you can pretty much walk anywhere on campus in 10 minutes."
College Junior,2,I mean there's scholarships available and stuff I don't think the financial aid department at school does all they can to have that stuff easily assessable to you though.
College Sophomore,2,"If You Don't Screw up, You're Fine – As long as you follow basic rules and don't screw up, you'll be fine, BUT if you are caught their system isn't the best. This is something Student Counsel is working on."
Recent Alumnus,2,Slow and Ineffient – The scholarships the university offers are limited to a very small demographic and the financial aid office is hard to get information from. Once you get ahold of someone though they are usually willing to sit down for a few minutes and walk through information with you....if you can get them to that point that is
College Sophomore,2,"Guys Are Decent – At CNU most of the guys are involved in some sort of sport, so they are very athletic, but I think we all know that a great body has to be accompanied by a great face, so just because they are athletic does not mean they are that great looking. You have to work hard to find a hot guy at CNU"
College Sophomore,2,It's a Beautiful Campus – CNU is a growing and upcoming college that is great if you are not exactly sure what you want to do. It is located in a nice area and the buildings and lawn work is great. However CNU is a liberal learning college which means you have to explore all subject beyond gen-eds. If you know exactly what you want to do though some classes seem like a waste of time. The teachers are great though!
College Freshman,2,"Not Good – The parking on campus is stressful!  Since freshmen are allowed to have cars, it makes for less spots available for other students.  Also, they have a weird color coding system for parking decals and its very expensive to obtain a parking pass."
College Junior,2,"Some things about this school are great, for instance, they have a stellar comm department, and some really great and interesting teachers.  However, they try to force you to live on campus, the new policy in upcoming years, from what I've heard, is that they're going to make people live on campus all four years, before it was three years, and before that, two.  In order to enforce this policy, though, they didn't exactly build enough dorms.... The registration process for this school is a bit annoying, because you HAVE to have a pin #, which means that you have to have a meeting with your adviser, you don't have a choice in the matter.  The apartments are great (if you can get one)."
College Freshman,2,Guys on Campus – They like to longboard but a lot of them are just rude and dont hold the doors for girls.
College Freshman,2,"Just Not for Me – CNU isn't a bad school. The academics are wonderful and the school is growing quickly. Personally, I don't like the location, or the lack of diversity. I also don't like that there is no transportation provided by the school for students without cars."
College Senior,2,"There is next to no night-life off campus and unless you have transportation, even what is available is inaccessible. You are better off staying on campus."
Junior,1,"This school looks very beautiful but as Jr on my third year here I have a new perspective. Professor here that we’re good get fired because Ethelred to cheap to ten year them.Now replaced with brand new professors, kids about straight out of grad school or this elder woman who’s class has just been thrown for a grade. Students will now receive credit and not a grade since more than half of the student population in here class was failing ( mind you these are all biology A students in premed) Economics here has a rep for bad professors which never fully speak English making it difficult to learn. So my suggestion is to ditch this school, make something of yourself at another small school or honestly there is more professor to choose from at a large school and wayyy more opportunities as an undergraduate.Happy college hunting."
Sophomore,1,"Don't be blinded by CNU's pretty campus when visiting. They're cheaper options when it comes to getting a college education. This school is very overpriced for a mediocre education. If you're looking for the ""College Experience"" do so else where. The party scene is very much dead. Most students leave CNU during the weekends to visit friends at other colleges and not the other way around. The housing situation is also a complete mess. CNU is overcrowding their housing because they'd rather take your money than guarantee you have a place to live. Also good luck finding any parking (except on the weekends when everyone leaves). Newport News itself is a total pit with nothing to do, as well as being extremely unsafe. CNU culture is also completely brainwashed. Everyone here is just a mindless drone to the almighty Paul Trible. If you want to go to a school that very much controls a large part of your schedule and dictates your life choices, then by all means go to CNU."
Freshman,1,"I found myself sold by the beautiful campus and seemingly friendly environment. I left after one semester and don’t have a single regret. The classes were a joke, majority of students judgemental, rude, and clique-y, the food horrific, and the staff indifferent to student needs. I really tried my best to make friends but found myself quite lonely with many students being shallow and transparent. Diversity was nonexistent. It is hard to be independent here. Choices are constantly made for you and you are treated like middle schoolers rather than adults. Was placed in a 3 person dorm meant for 2, professors cancelled class constantly, very dull with few activities, unsafe, the overall atmosphere was terribly depressing. In a BSN program now saving thousands of dollars and couldn’t be happier to have left."
Junior,1,"CNU has a beautiful campus and a lot of the professors are more than willing to help you achieve your goals. With CNU being such a small school the professors usually know you personally. With that being said, CNU does not provide a great experience if you are a minority. As an African American I have come to realize there is not very much diversity or push for inclusion on this campus. I have been harassed and have even had issues with professors being racists toward me and friends of mine, going so far as to write ""black"" next to a student's name on the attendance sheet. In another instance a professor alluded to the fact that minorities score lower on entrance exams and if schools wanted more diversity they should lower test score requirements. It is not the ideal school if you are a minority. CNU has made many strides in the cosmetics of the school but definitely has a long way to go in this department."
Niche User,1,"I studied at Christopher Newport University for one semester and hated it. The classes were super easy and not challenging whatsoever. Also, the school was not very diverse at all; in fact most of the students there were very racist. The food was never fully cooked at the dining halls which resulted in food poisoning and I had to resort to eating off campus. I will admit, the campus is nice and the facilities (gym and student union building) were very cool and where I spent most of my time. I could not stay there and came home almost every weekend (Dry campus so all parties were far away). They offered club sports but the people there were very cliquey and said that I could not join. I would sum the school up as a place where everyone you hated in high school ended up. Also, the area around this school is very boring aside from the beach. There is not much to do and it is very unsafe at night."
Freshman,1,"Christopher Newport University as it seems in the beginning may seem as it is a wonderful school to live and study in. However my experience was terrible especially when I just first arrive as a freshman. This school does not put you in the classes that you will need to be able to get your major in time for the 4 years which puts you a bit behind in classes if you are not put in them. The professors here do not help you a lot in trying to succeed in the class. Overall, CNU is not the school that they say they are the best in."
Niche User,1,"I transfered from CNU for multiple reasons; the students, the  environment, the location and the lack of ambition. The students seemed to focus more on their social life, rather than their academic standing. If you're looking for a small school that has a ""party school"" atmosphere this would be a great place for you. The school is also comprised of mostly Virginians. If you are from out of state like I was, you may feel a like an outsider. Although I personally did not have a good experience, I will say I had some of the most inspiring professors at CNU. Most of them seemed to really care for their students."
College Junior,1,I had a terrible experience in my old sorority. 0/10 would not recommend going Greek.
College Freshman,1,Most of the kids on my hall are drunk 5 days out of 7. It makes it hard to focus on school work when everyone around you is drinking or doing drugs. I feel left out if I don't go to parties. The RA's are supposed to be very strict about underage drinking but the kids in my dorm are drunk around the RA's all the time and they never do anything.
College Freshman,1,No one respects your schedule. People are loud all the time. It's pretty clean most of the time but there is always a funky smell.
College Freshman,1,CNU puts so much money into its appearance but lacks tremendously when it comes to students needs and concerns.
College Freshman,1,"Students are required to live on campus for 3 years, and all 4 years if they want to keep a scholarship. I extremely dislike the policy and disagree with its implementation"
College Sophomore,1,"Very little diversity at CNU. However there are also very little students at CNU. Most however are middle class, christian, white people. Not all, but the majority of them are. "
College Junior,1,CNUPD is a joke. The health center charges $15 per visit and gives about as much insight as webMD and then suggests to go see a real doctor.
College Junior,1,"In this past semester I missed least 4 classes due to not being able to find parking.  Due to construction there is not enough parking for the number of students.  I would always give myself 30 minutes to a spot and after 45 minutes I would give up.  

This being said the school has a lot of areas where parking can and probably will be added and this should drastically improve in the next year."
College Junior,1,There is very little diversity on Christopher Newport's campus.
College Freshman,1,School is predominately white but there are more black people here than you would think.
College Freshman,1,No transportation options for students . Newport News runs busses but I've never seen one come to campus.
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do, and when there are parties they get busted like 5 minutes after they start."
College Freshman,1,Cost so much and students have to park far away from the dorms.

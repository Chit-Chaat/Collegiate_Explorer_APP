Freshman,5,I love the passion that they have for their culture. It's very welcoming and treats everyone like family.
Alum,5,Lane College is a great school. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Biology in April of 2017 from there. This school provides hands on help from professors and tutors. They have great food and dorm rooms for you to be to stay on campus while receiving a excellent education.
Freshman,5,Lane College is a great college to attend if you want to succeed in academics. Their sports teams are average but they’re working hard to achieve excellence at their craft. Lane is a small HBCU Christian school out of Jackson Tn and is also very diverse I can’t wait until move in day for freshman.
Sophomore,5,I Like That They Let The Students Be Their Self And I Would Like To See The Food In The Cafe Change And I Would Also Like To See The Dorms Get Better Than They Are
Junior,5,"Academics: Depends on your professor. Some are hard, others are a walk in the park. Just attend class

Cafe: Not so good, you mostly eat the same things each week, but its cheap. Around 1k a semester  

Housing: It's decent. Had to deal with mold issues, but they are currently fixing those issues. Dirt cheap as well. around 2k a semester. There's also visitation. Normally from 4pm til 11pm. 

Library: Typically open from 8am til 10pm. 

Parties: Events are okay..nothing too big of a deal

Sports: The school lack spirit, except for homecoming. Everyone is turned up then. 

Band: A growing program. Come be apart of the Quiet Storm Marching Band. Everyone treats you like family. 

Overall, It's a good school. I believe if you have a 3.0 plus straight out of high school you will receive a presidential scholarship of 5,000 per semester. College life here is what you make it. If you're lame..your experience will be lame.

 Everyone greets you. 

..and oh. FREE WIFI lol"
Sophomore,5,Lane college is a great four year college. It is not a very big college but it is a college that feel like home. The people here are friendly and respectful. The professors actually try to make sure you learn in their classrooms. The newer dorms on campus are pretty nice size. Their also clean and stable places to live in. I do wish they would expand the campus and get an on campus restaurant.
Freshman,5,I love how small classes are & we can learn more & understand. We can always ask questions & maybe get one on one time (if needed) I don't like how the older dorms are maybe it's the brick walls.
Freshman,5,"Lane College is a great school. They make sure that you know your lesson. The teachers pushes you to the next level, not only academically but spiritually. Lane college is also a Christian school."
Freshman,5,This is my first year at laney and I love it. The people around are very nice and the teachers are really here to help and not just get payed.
College Freshman,5,"The students areas motivated as they come. The students, faculty, and parents are very supportive in ever sport or event. There is alot of team work in every even, also."
Recent Alumnus,5,The academics are very wonderful and the popular study areas are somewhat the hang out spot but in a good way that's lets you know that we study and get out work done.
Recent Alumnus,5,My school has the best staff and I would encourage my peers to choose my school to attend they would be more then just numbers they would be there name.
Recent Alumnus,5,I think that we as a school are school spirted when it comes to our athletes and the teams that we have and deal with.
College Junior,5,I loved the community college I went to and I am now transferring to a new school that I am sure I will love.
College Sophomore,5,"The food is always prepared fresh, and the food is more than edible. They prepare the food with love and care. No'one never has an attitude, and they're always courteous."
College Sophomore,5,"We need strictness. Without anyone to be strict, everything would be terrible."
College Junior,5,the professors are top notch. we are like family and it kills them to see you fail.
College Junior,5,the diversity on campus is vast. there are just as many lgbt students as heterosexual students.
College Sophomore,5,"My school has some of the best professors especially in my major, Dr. Bede Anyanwu of Criminal Justice is an awesome teacher."
College Student,5,I really don't know much about the life oat Lane but i'm sure that their aren't many students doing drugs.
Senior,4,My online experience was great I could not complain on this side. Lane has great ways to keeping you connected to the internet and the professors were able to stay in touch with me and make sure that I was on schedule. I learned that it’s my responsibility to make sure that I get more done when I meet you in the light I said how to take responsibility for that rather than blaming other people.
Junior,4,"Lane is a very small school , Lane college has small classrooms and the professors develop relationships with each of their students. Lane college saftey is not at its best potential , also Lane college housing isnt the best ."
Freshman,4,"I'm in my first year at Lane and so far my experience has been pretty good. Two of my three professors are wonderful, one of my professors is struggling to teach the class. The rest of the staff at Lane have been very helpful in dealing with the problem professor- which makes me feel confident that things are going to work out for the best."
Niche User,4,"Lane College makes you feel like you are home at times, plus if you live in Memphis your literally an hour away from home,(if not caught in the rush hour). Some may say it is just another high school, but to me it feels like a college that handles there business and what to their students succeed at all times. If you do not apply yourself everyday, then Lane is not for you and you are wasting your money and time as well."
Freshman,4,Being a college freshman and away from home the first time everyone here has made me feel welcome and safe
College Freshman,4,I would choose my school again because the staff is friendly and they do their jobs like experts. They treat you like family because they want you to succeed and they and they never quit on you even when you want to quit on yourself.
College Freshman,4,"Greeks are always going to be a big part of the campus, because they are everywhere and they are always involved.  The Greeks also make sure they grab the attention of all the students by hosting events at the school or small parties."
Recent Alumnus,4,The student career center is somewhat in the working to be better progress but it's getting there. The alumni is very helpful at all times and they are welling to help at all cost.
Recent Alumnus,4,The courses that i have taken at Lane was very interesting and very helpful with the career that I am going for. The class size was very good not to big and not to small everyone got to know each other it was great.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life as a huge impact on social life around campus. When the Greeks show up to the campus events, they most definitely show out. Non-Greeks view Greeks as regular students with a passion for their frats and sororities. I am not sure if Lane offer specific housing for Greeks or not. Majority, if not all, Greeks live off campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My high school Experience was great at Pike High School. Education was important to all the faculty and staff. The really tried to give us a well rounded education. We would have different companies come in and talk to us about all the possible job opportunities we could have. And the cool thing is that sometimes they would sponsor our extracurricular activities from clubs to sports. extracurricular Activities, They were amazing every night that we had a football of basketball game they would all be themed night for example during our home since our colors were red and white that's all students wore including myself. Also we had would have have during every game we would get free T-shirts before each game which i thought was amazing. And clubs We have over 100 different clubs that anybody could have joined they were very helpful they actually helped me further my networking skills.I joined the National Society of Black Engineers Which taught me the processes of learning the engineering process and connecting this to real world situations.My high school experience was a great experience."
College Sophomore,4,Everybody really gets along honestly. Everyone has everyone's back.
College Sophomore,4,"It was a hassle, but they do their best to make sure the process goes easy. Make sure they go over everything you need to know, to make sure you know every procedure"
College Sophomore,4,"I love staying on campus. Great atmosphere, and a variety of races blended as one."
College Sophomore,4,"Living off campus is great. No curfew to be back on campus, and no complaints or having to deal with another in your room. The prices vary from place to place, None are far away from school and they are close to any shopping area around."
College Junior,4,there is little to no security on campus. almost to the point where it is unsafe.
College Junior,4,"As far as sexual orientation and religion it's very diverse , but because I go to a Historical Black College majority of the school has one racial background. As far economic background , everyone comes from different walks of life so of course there is some diversity there."
College Sophomore,4,My Major gets allot of attention because of the amount of students that are interested in it. I love the competition to become one of the best come graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"Our computers are in great shape, you could definetly finish your work on time."
College Student,4,The students at Lane seems to get involved in sports. They seems to be one of the best in the world. They have so much support from their classmates/schoolmates. Their spirits gives them energy to go out and win championships and other awards. They have the best coaches.
Senior,2,waste of time going to lane wish i could go back in time and stop my self from going. foods nasty. campus life not safe
Sophomore,2,"I like that the work is easy, but the dorms and food sucks! I like that the work is easy, but the dorms and food sucks! I like that the work is easy, but the dorms and food sucks! I like that the work is easy, but the dorms and food sucks!"
College Sophomore,2,with the new face lift of the campus its getting better
College Junior,2,there isnt enough emphasis on sports at my school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Our school isn't like others. It is fair on the strictness, the only thing the students don't like is that there is NO VISITATION."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is very open and it isn't really in a good neighborhood, therefore we have to be very careful especially at night and watch our surroundings."
College Sophomore,2,The city is okay but there isn't much there compared to the big city where i'm from.
College Sophomore,2,I think we should have more activities and hangout/study areas for the students. The campus should be expanded
College Freshman,2,I really don't go off-campus to go eat at other places. I trust my school food so I decide to eat there.
College Junior,2,"I sometimes feel unsafe on Lane College's campus. The campus is to open and it's not gated, anyone can walk on the campus and pretend that they go to our school. Lane College is a small HBCU school, and it's a church related school, however safety is a issue, because of how open our school is."
College Freshman,2,coming from the west coast everything in the south for me was a lot cheaper. The only thing about my campus and trying to get off campus dinning is you would need transportation. Most eateries are a little far.
College Freshman,2,The greek life is mostly here for parties until someone speak upon them not putting their heads in their books. Its always kind of seem like our other frats and sororitys hate one anothers guts for unknown reason.
College Sophomore,2,"they can not have probates on campus, they can not have many events. They can not step on campus. they could not show the love they have for the campus because one small little thing could get them suspended"
College Sophomore,2,New Dorms Vs Old Dorms – the reason I gave lane college a C- because our new dorms are good condition for boys and girls. but the old dorms not so good some times the hot waters goes out. But dont get me wrong they put new beds and dressers in the dorms but rhe bathroom need to be remodel
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much to do in the city although its is an old town. Would be considered to college town because of the three colleges that are in the city but as far as events and attractions are very limited. The night life of the city is its saving grace.
College Freshman,2,"The transportation here at Lane College only includes carpooling, your own vechile, or the bus, or walking. There are not alot of options where to go anyways besides carpooling and the bus are the most often used."
College Freshman,2,"Pot Luck – Food is food to a college student wheather it's free or you have to pay. Yet here at Lane College you have the Cafteria which is open Monday-Sunday and it varies the time. Also we have a new snack bar which is open until 11:30 p.m. it allows students to mingle, study, watch television, and eat some realy good food for a small portion. 
To begin with the cafteria food is just pot luck to me which means you can a hamburger, pizza, fries, subs, or even something they actually cook up. Well do not get me wrong, but on speical holidays such as Valentine's Day the school organized a candle light dinner and played romantic songs as well as served chocolate covered strawberries it was so nice! On regular days the cafe is food that should be eaten only if your hungry (I'm just saying not to be funny). However the caferteria food is sometimes good, but not always.
Since the snack bar opened it has been a success! Students, staff, and faculty come here to eat or enjoy the conversations with other peers. The menu varies such as the prices, but it is good to have something else avaiable to us the students when we get hungry when we are studying."
Freshman,1,"The Football Coaches are FRAUDS!!!! I'm speaking from a parent perspective.  They give false hopes and lie to these kids.  I have never seen an organization operate so poorly.  Why have me relocate my son from Miami, Fl  to Jackson, TN for the summer and not explain in its entirety that he really was there for a try-out.  Then to be told a few days before fall begins that he has been released, ""because he don't fit the program"".  That's BS!  When the real reason is that you have promised"
College Junior,1,i have yet to see ant such resources at my school.
College Freshman,1,Lane college doesn't have any diversity it it predominately African-Americans there. I rated this because they need more diversity there.
College Freshman,1,Lane college student life is horrible.there is absolutely nothing to do on campus. There is nowhere to go either.
College Freshman,1,The classes are too easy and do not challenge you. The students are not active in the school. The staff does not treat you as young adults. There are no on campus activities so when we attend parties smoking and drinking we get scolded.
College Freshman,1,"The police force can be a little strict exspecially when it comes to curfew, use of drugs, alcohol and carrying weapons on campus. It's pretty serious if you get caught breaking the rules, so my best advice is to everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious or rude about the situation."
College Freshman,1,either to expensive or the buses don't meet up
College Freshman,1,"always sick, friend work in the cafe and has told me that its always old food being used."
College Freshman,1,very few are willing to help and its a lot who i do not trust
College Freshman,1,"RA's are crinimals and security are only there for a pay check.  The campus is to open and not safe. Everyone in Jackson from kids, to Drunks, to bums, to gang bagers can just walk onto our campus and hang out."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible.. They messed up my Financial aid meaning now I have to pay 3,000 dollars out of pocket because they absent minded forgot to add housing to my cost. This is crazy because I don't have that kind of money."
College Junior,1,"I Rather Stay Inside – The guys and girls do not have taste in dressing. There aren't many guys that  try to look presentable nor speak well. There isn't many sociable people, limited of ideas and expanding campus life. Being at Lane the diversity is pretty good."
College Freshman,1,"Leaving Off Campus When You Have a Class in 15 Mins. A student should never leave off campus for anyting unless it is an emergency. It is for you safety and others. Students if you know that your class starts in a few, then don't leave off campus! Most professors do not allow late students. So therefore you will miss out on a important class you paid for and gave away free money. So students stay on campus if it's not an emergency."
College Sophomore,1,we dont have any at all  well we did but they didnt run all night so thatys why nobody stays off campus far for the college housing
College Sophomore,1,What Safety??? and Health – I love my school dearly but we need a big wieght room with better equipment because we had wieghts fall on the football foot and head before. and the safety we need police on campus once awhile instead the local people who live in Jacskon that arent cops.
College Junior,1,"Academics SUCK – The academics are around high school level and some are middle school. DON'T go to Lane if you are a serious student. The teachers let students do whatever the want, there is no discipline. The students do and sell drugs all over campus, and the amount of violence is rediculous. Chapel is required, even if you live off campus. If you want a real education, don't go to Lane College."
College Sophomore,1,The dorms at Lane College are good but the social life isn't the best.
College Freshman,1,"Campus Cleanliness – there are so amny people on campus that smokes marijuana, cigarettes, and black and milds and it makes the campus look very ugly when they just throw things any and every where. then they break bottles any where on campus."
College Freshman,1,Priviledges and Safety – I came to Lane College not only because it is a small historically black college but to get an education an to enjoy my first college experience. Lane College barely gives students opportunities and there is alot of violence that also goes on around the campus. Too many students have gotten hurt this semester because of these incidents that has not been tooken care of which worries alot od students and scares them to even want to go to class or even leave their dorms becuase they dont know when they will lose their life just by leaving their dorms. Then we cant have visitation either.
College Freshman,1,"In the small town of Jackson,TN there is nothing but bumbs and theives. Not many malls or resturants to choose from. Not much of a atmosphere to me."

Junior,5,"This a great experience that I have had in this beautiful place. Everything is very enjoyable, the classes, professors, food, and the experience to serve everyone in the community. But the most satisfactory is to share time with God in the tabernacle."
College Senior,5,"St. John Vianney College Seminary lives up to its motto of ""excellence in priestly formation."" As someone looking for a solid, Catholic education, foundation, and formation, I must say that I am very satisfied with my experience. The staff and professors make every effort to ensure that each student is provided for. Academics are suitably rigorous and the philosophical education is solid. I'd recommend this school to any Florida resident looking for an education in philosophy with particular attention to its interrelationship with Catholicism."
Junior,4,"St. John Vianney is a great place for men who are thinking about entering the Roman Catholic Priesthood, as well as for lay people who would like to experience a Philosophy education within the tradition of Roman Catholic colleges and priesthood."

Junior,5,"Overall my experience has been amazing in every aspect. From academics all the way to socializing, I feel that UF has given me the experience that I wanted."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy this University overall for the most part.  The professors are good however, sometimes there instructions for assignments can be unrealistic given the rubics."
Freshman,5,"Great! The staff always replies to emails in a timely manner, most professors are very good at their jobs, students are all very nice."
Niche User,5,I plan on going to UF in 2022 but from what I know it is any excellent school with great people and I can't wait to go in 2022. GO GATORS!!!
Junior,5,"The business school was always online, and I am a quick learner, so the transition has not been difficult for me"
Junior,5,"amazing, I originally wanted to go out of state, but after just 2 weeks at the University of Florida, I knew I made the right decision to attend. The people I've met are people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life"
Freshman,5,So far my experience at UF has been very good! Campus is beautiful and my professors are really good!
Freshman,5,"UF has great academics and Gainesville is a great place for college students. You have thousands of opportunities at UF and if you ever need help, it is available to you."
Senior,5,"My own college (College of Human Health and Performance) has approached the online format extremely well during the COVID-19 pandemic. I can not speak on behalf of other colleges at this university, because each one is handling this differently. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the online format and commend my professors for their quick and seamless adaptation to this new way of teaching."
Freshman,5,"All of my classes are online, and they are all good and easy to take.  The zoom can be sort of frustrating at times, but it works most of the time."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love UF!  Everyone is extremely nice and all the staff, faculty, and professors are extremely kind and want you to succeed."
Senior,5,Very great atmosphere in the swamp!  With many off campus and on campus living. Classes are challenging but very rewarding.
Senior,5,I took online classes due to the interruption of COVID. The professors were very understanding and willing to work with the students.
Alum,5,"Online classes are great. It's the same lectures the in-class students receive. Their online platform is easy to use, very user friendly. You can tell a lot of thought was applied when the platform was invented."
Alum,5,Great atmosphere. Accommodations are very adequate. Lots to do and the city is investing in the area to make it more modern and chic.
Niche User,5,I visited it and it was a very beautiful environment and I felt surrounded by very educated people. It makes me realize how much more I wanted to get accepted so that I could thrive even more and develop as the years go on in this school. I think I will grow in a positive manner.
Niche User,5,Online has been difficult for many students but I believe you had to adjust your schedules to get used to it.
Junior,5,"I'm entering my third year at the University of Florida and have had an amazing experience thus far. All my classes have been highly engaging and truly make me feel as though I'm learning rather than just going through the motions. The professors have always been helpful and open to questions and concerns. Many have definitely taken a personal interest in seeing their students succeed. UF provides an amazing environment for students to socialize and to find their place with a wide array of student organizations to join. As well as plenty of events for students to attend including sporting events, concerts, guest speakers, and more!"
Junior,5,"Truthfully, online learning is my least favorite way to take a class. However, UF online has provided the best online learning environment I've ever been in. The professors always make an effort to encourage active participation throughout the course, and they are always open to questions/concerns with quick and effective responses. Although some online courses I've taken in the past have come with low-energy lectures and a slew of busywork, UF courses are quite the opposite. The courses are all structured to be highly engaging and assignments have always correlated to the course material and foster comprehension, rather than just assigning work for the sake of having work."
Alum,5,"The University of Florida is a great school! The campus in Gainesville is huge, like a city in itself! UF is home to Shands,  a top medical center, as well as one of the best sports program in the nation, the Florida Gators. One of the best universities in the country!"

Sophomore,5,"My classes this Spring were already online, but the exams got moved to online and I did struggle using ProctorU every single time whereas using Honorlock was extremely easy. However, my professors were very understanding and many of them extended due dates for us to accommodate."
Graduate Student,5,I didn’t take many online classes but I found the ones I did easy. The online set up was well done. I would take more online classes here.
Junior,5,"Online learning has been maintained well through the crisis, and professors have been extremely understanding students' individual needs and problems in these hard times."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved the welcoming atmosphere and the culture surrounding the school. There are many helpful resources available which were initially hard to find due to the size of the school, but as I have done more research I have become more familiar with the opportunities the school provides."
Niche User,5,"I only took classes online during quarantine, and the online aspect of the school was handled extremely well."
Niche User,5,I love the University of Florida. It has been my dream school since I was in middle school. I love the atmosphere and most professors are incredible and willing to help you in any way possible. I would not change anything.
Junior,5,The online learning system is inclusive and is regularly maintenance by the UF IT department. The UF help desks saves any issues you may be having if any at all. Professors try their best to connect and engage with all students and encourage collaborating with other students.
Junior,5,"I am just transferring in from community college, however I've been involved in campus life for the last two years. I've found myself involved in various UF clubs and connected to many kind professors who will teach me in this upcoming fall. The campus is rife with opportunity in the STEM fields and there is always an organization, event, or college to wanting to involve their students in academics and social movements."
Alum,5,I transfer into UF but it didn’t take away too much of my college experience. There’s endless extracurricular activities and events to take part of so I felt I was never bored.
Senior,5,University of Florida has provided me with ample opportunities for success in both personal and professional affairs. I have loved every second of my experience here.
Senior,5,"I have taken five online courses, and they have been very engaging and well thought-out by the professors. Online material is reasonable in both quality and quantity."
Junior,5,Online classes are very accommodating and is helpful in allowing you to adjust for remote learning while still allowing you to learn just as much as you would in a traditional setting.
Freshman,5,"Though it is not the experience most people are looking for, the University of Florida has awesome professors that acclimate to an online setting with such ease. Definitely recommend it for anyone that is not into face-to-face learning."
Freshman,5,"The University of Florida is one of the most cultural and academically diverse colleges, not only in the state of Florida but in the entire country. You can be a leader or a pioneer in anything there. Not to mention you gain real-world experience and amazing networks."
Senior,5,Most teachers were still very active and engaging with their students and tried to make the best of this situation so we were still able to receive the education we come here for.
Senior,5,My school is amazing. The staff is great and they help provide so many opportunities for their students in order to get real world experience.
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently enrolled for Fall 2020 so I have not yet to officially attended classes. However, the entire process including admissions, financial aid, and registration, has been incredibly smooth. All staff and faculty have been very helpful throughout the entire process."
Graduate Student,5,UF has been amazing thus far. My professors have been very helpful and supportive. All the other faculty and staff I have interacted with have been so kind despite the hard times that COVID-19 has brought along.
Freshman,5,"Both my dad and sister attended the University of Florida. I am about to begin my chapter with this university in August; however, from past experiences I already know my college life will be amazing. The campus is beautiful, the people are amazing, and the overall atmosphere is thrilling."
Senior,5,"I took one class online, it was super straightforward! The professors were super helpful in replying to emails."
Senior,5,I love how helpful students are and that there are so many opportunities to advance in any career path.
Junior,5,I love this university! I've grown so much over the past two years and would not be who I am today without UF. Go gators!
Senior,5,"I have taken several classes online, especially here as of late. The professors do their best to accommodate the students and provide as many resources as feasibly possible. The fact the class is online has no impact on the ability to learn the material to the fullest. The classes are design to optimize the situation."
Senior,5,"The University of Florida is located in Gainesville, Florida. The campus is relatively closed off to the rest of the city, so living on campus is almost like having your own little haven. The programs, majors, and opportunities are endless, you can literally be anything and pursue anything that you want. It's hard to summarize the experience in just a few words, but the environment it definitely one you want to take your time taking in. There are tons of resources near by and the city is constantly evolving. The only thing I would love to see is a program put in place to aid the homeless population in the city."
Junior,5,I love the University of Florida. Everyone is so inclusive and when I got there it really felt like home.
Junior,5,"I love the classes online, the professors make it easier for the students but allowing them to meet online or in person. And right now even with corona virus professors are making the adjustments very easy."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing. This school has changed my life in so many ways. Being Jewish, I have been able to connect with my culture more than ever before which has been an amazing experience. I love love the culture of all the students and the diversity throughout the campus."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing. This school has changed my life in so many ways. Being Jewish, I have been able to connect with my culture more than ever before which has been an amazing experience. I love love the culture of all the students and the diversity throughout the campus."
Senior,5,The University of Florida did a terrific job of transitioning from in-person classes to online due to the pandemic. It was a sudden change because of how important it was for the university to keep its students safe. Online classes at the University of Florida are well rounded and easy to attend and understand.
Senior,5,"My university provides a diverse, safe, and welcoming environment for all its students. I admire the atmosphere the University of Florida provided me with being transfer student and stepping into unknown territory. Faculty and staff members are excited and happy to have students come in and learn. They are enthusiastic about their jobs and are passionate when they teach. This provides me with an amazing experience because I learn through their passion and also admire their enthusiasm to be able to use that as I study and learn my material."
Freshman,5,Such a welcoming environment. I've met so many intelligent students and professors. Really a blessing to be here.
Junior,5,"It's a great school. If there's one thing everyone in the small town of Gainesville shares, is the love and pride they have being a Florida Gator. Go Gators!"
Sophomore,5,"UF is an awesome school with awesome academics and a lot of resources that can help out any students in need, including free tutoring and mental health services. The classes tend to be rigorous but there is a fun party scene that can help students relax if they want, and everything in and around campus tends to be pretty safe, even at night. One thing I don't like is that UF tends to have ""weed-out classes"" that are made unnecessarily hard for no reason and a lot of people fail them and it really hurts their GPA."
Junior,5,I've taken a lot of online classes at UF and found them to be very manageable. The transition to online classes during the pandemic was remarkably smooth and I appreciated the way professors were considerate during that time.
Freshman,5,So far I really love the school. The faculty that I have spoke with over the phone have been extremely helpful.
Junior,5,"An amazing campus and gives the full experience of what college life is. I highly recommend this college due to the high quality of the courses, study area availability, and the school overall."
Graduate Student,5,The variety of opportunities that I have experienced at the University of Florida has been amazing and really helped me grow as a future practitioner. The course work was also challenging and allowed me to figure out my best study habits. There is nothing I would change.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the community at UF. Everyone on campus, is always so welcoming and friendly. A change I like see happen is some of the buildings, such as some of the older dorms being renovated."
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Florida with all of my heart. I bleed blue and orange and cannot imagine my fall weekends without being in the swamp and my spring weekends without being at the baseball field. The professors are amazing and they really care about the students. I am a student at the business school, and I can personally attest to the amazing Warrington College of Business and the influential professors and TA's that are associated with this program. I am so glad I chose to be a gator!"
Junior,4,The online experience was transformed to be as close to in person classes as it could be through the use of zoom. I feel that I still get the help that I need just through online interaction instead of in person.
Sophomore,4,"Being in the college of journalism, I love my school! I have so many opportunities and a lot of help. The only downside is that sometimes I feel like university cares more about money than its actual students. During coronavirus, graduations where put online. Even though it was a smart decision (even if they could have spaced students out in the stadium), the university allows 15,000 alumni and 2,000 students to go to a football game."
Junior,4,"This is my first year at UF and due to covid-19 I haven't been on campus. However I love my classes and my major. So far all the staff at UF are really great. They are nice and care about their students. Being that UF is prestigious there is quite a lot of work, but you can do it!"
Junior,4,"Overall the transition was very smooth. Personal time management is very challenging, but once you get into the routine your classes should be set. The only downsides are physical interaction, and group projects."
Sophomore,4,I would recommend this University. The campus has a high energy vibe and the students are motivated to learn and perform well.
Freshman,4,"Great! Some classes need a bit of work though, as the syllabi are kind of confusing, but overall not bad."
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus, the opportunities, and the support from faculty and staff.  There are many extracurricular activities to get involved with and boost your resume."
Sophomore,4,Most of the professors have been great with online classes.  UF has given us access to some great platforms for online learning.
Niche User,4,"I haven't taken any classes yet at UF, but I think that the online experience will be good  because I am accustomed to it in high school."
Freshman,4,My professors are doing a great job for the most part. I find the ones that have live meetings on Zoom easier to keep up with and the ones who don't I tend to get a little lost. But other than that it has been great:)
Senior,4,"When classes were in person, the student experience was something I really enjoyed. Students at the University of Florida form a very tight support group and alliance with each other. The classes are extremely at UF in order to hold up the reputation of #6 in public universities in the nation. There is not a big party atmosphere, but that is something I appreciate because I am very busy studying most of the time. The local restaurants and coffee shops are one of my favorite things about Gainesville!"
Freshman,4,"I am taking my first semester freshman classes online and at first, it was hard to manage, but once you make a schedule it’s pretty easy."
Freshman,4,"The online classes at UF feel much more structured than any classes I've taken online previously. All of the course content is laid out on the calendar from the start of the course with due dates for everything. There aren't as many lectures as I'd like for some of my courses, one of which is pretty much completely reading with some videos and discussions."
Freshman,4,"I was accepted into the UF PaCE program (Pathway to Campus Enrollment, basically online for the first two years then on campus for the next two). So far the online classes are better than any I've taken in high school or through dual enrollment lest semester (although those were last-minute due to the virus). So far it's challenging but not overwhelming. The process from application to classes starting has been fairly smooth, but there were a few mild bumps along the way. Overall it's been a good experience online so far."
Sophomore,4,"It depends on the teacher and the format of the class. Some will have synchronous lectures over Zoom, which may be subject to technology issues. However, other teachers pre-record their lectures."
Alum,4,"The buildings may be old, but the classes taught within were top class and a great place to build foundational knowledge. The professors were often funny and always enthusiastic about academic scholarship and wanting every student to succeed. I understood firsthand why UF is one of the top colleges in the state and hopefully, someday the United States."
Junior,4,I took a couple of classes online. The format was easy to follow and assignments had a due deadline. I didn’t see a difference in online and in person experience.
Junior,4,"I love the history behind the university. But as African American, I wish the school had more diversity."
Senior,4,"The University of Florida (UF) gives you an unbelievably good education at an affordable price. I believe that UF has some outstanding professors with interesting and credible backgrounds that make learning fun. In addition, UF is able to give most students opportunities within their career of choice before they even graduate. I love that there is a sense of community in the Gator Nation. UF could make some changes in terms of student diversity. I would love UF to be able to represent the different communities rather than just representing mostly white students. However, I am excited to see what changes come out of the new Diversity Action Plan to embrace more students. Additionally, I believe that more could be done in terms of safety. UF should work more to protect students from sexual assault and create a zero-tolerance policy for it. By doing so, I think UF would be able to further create a safe space for their students."
Sophomore,4,"Being at the University of Florida was pretty good this past year, and since I had already lived in Gainesville, it was a pretty easy transition. The professors were great and everyone was very friendly!"
Junior,4,"UF has been managing the COVID crisis well, considering all factors. However, rescheduling has created conflicts in many student's scheduling and course load for the upcoming semester, including my own. These issues are understandable though, as any change for the betterment of the whole will result in issues for some."
Sophomore,4,The professors were well prepared for switching to online classes in the wake of the pandemic. They provided all necessary resources for us to succeed.
Alum,4,For most of the online classes I took there weren’t many that I felt where they were too difficult. Sometimes you get the professor who does Weird things with there online Curriculum or the workload seems redundant but it never had a horrible experience .
Senior,4,"The University of Florida is a very prestigious school. It is a top 10 public university, meaning that school work is difficult. The city revolves around the school which I enjoy and there is a lot to do. We have a lot of bars and nature surrounding the campus. Ginnie springs and Paines Prairie are not too far and are great attractions. Our sports teams are amazing and sporting events are loads of fun. Nothing beats the swamp. All in all, it’s a great school filled with Students who exert lots of school pride and spirit  Go gators!"
Junior,4,"Before the pandemic hit most classes were taken in person and unless you were taking a major-specific course were in large assembly halls. In several circumstances professors and TAs are a bit difficult to contact, however, they are more than capable of assisting you in learning the material taught (especially in Physics and Calculus 3)."
Junior,4,Overall the University of Florida is a great college to attend when it comes to academics. The only concern is the allowance of students to push professors to loosen syllabus rules.
Junior,4,"The campus culture is well rounded, and can be a comfortable place for anyone. There's a huge variety of clubs, activities, and events, and you're likely to find something new to do each day. The campus is pretty, too, and makes it nice to have lunch outdoors or study outside some days. I've also never felt unsafe on campus, and there are lots of programs to help maintain that safety.

As for their education, I am a CS major, and have a mixed review. The courses I have taken and enjoyed, have been phenomenal. The teachers were easy to understand, invested, and had great curriculum. However, for the classes that haven't been as great, they were really really bad. For the CS program at UF, you have to be prepared to teach yourself a fair amount of material for any of the classes with subpar teachers."
Junior,4,Administrators are very helpful with amazing professors and campus life to help you be successful in your education and career path.
Senior,4,"Online classes were actually very helpful. Although there is some barrier of communication and relationship building that comes with online classes, most of my experience has been positive. I have found that professors are quick to respond and usually provide really helpful material for us to learn online."
Senior,4,"Overall my experience has been enjoyable. I feel safe, respected and have made great friends at this university. I have also been able to access amazing resources that have furthered my education and set me up for success post-graduation. My only complaint is that it can sometimes feel like advisors and academic help is harder than necessary. For the amount of money we pay as students, I think overall there could be more help getting students adjusted to being at such a large university."
Freshman,4,"The University of Florida is a good school, depending on how you make of your years here. The dorms were average, some were better than others. I cannot rate on the food, since I did not get a meal plan. The professors are either a hit or a miss, but there is not much you can do about that if only one professor teaches the course. Outside of campus, there are many restaurants to eat at and bars."
Junior,4,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I took several electives online, and I generally enjoyed those classes.  Although they covered diverse subjects, they were all organized clearly, and I had the ability to work through them at my own pace.

It was also easy for me to communicate with my professors, so if I had any questions, I could receive help pretty quickly."
Junior,4,"Pros - excellent research opportunities;  generally high quality academics;  lots of opportunities for extracurricular involvement (organizations, sports, honors societies, etc.);  beautiful campus;  typically students can band together as a community to solve issues;  for me personally, lots of access to an amazing veterinary school.

Cons - weed-out classes are common, especially in the sciences;  professors can either be amazing or terrible;  sometimes students' well beings are sacrificed in order to maintain academic rankings;  ""U Matter, We Care"" is not always the truth, unfortunately."
Freshman,4,I have taken online classes with UF and I thought the platform was amazing. The same college experience and academics at the comfort of wherever you are. It is a bit harder to keep in contact with. professors but most of the time it was not an issue for me.
Freshman,4,I will be attending UF this fall and I have heard so many good things about it. The school has such a good reputation and it is filled with so many clubs and activities to do. I feel I will do well here and be prepared for future job experience. I have heard that sometimes it is hard to get that to work with you financially but I have never had it myself.
Junior,4,Online classes are good and typically easier. Online classes give you more flexibility with your schedule.
Freshman,4,Taking all of my courses online as a freshman will definitely be interesting. I love the campus and I'm excited to be learning here.
Freshman,4,Professors teach really well online. I've taken a lot of interesting online classes. An awkward adjustment but making it work.
Senior,4,"Mostly very good! The online courses are easy to navigate and there is decent communication. I seem to get many emails.
I have had some problems online with HonorLock but that is about it."
Senior,4,"The University of Florida offers rigorous courses that truly make you work hard and require your best efforts. It is an inclusive community, spirited, green, and always striving to be better."
Alum,4,I took classes online and all of the professors were responsive and taught as if it was in person. Online classes are a great way to balance more rigorous in person classes.
Alum,4,The best 4-years of my life. Outstanding academics and great community. Attending a large state school gave me the ideal college experience.
Sophomore,4,"Classes already made for being taken online are fairly put together and have clear expectations and resources that you can take advantage of. Because of covid-19 classes that were not originally online and now are tend to be a little bit more disorganized, but overall my classes adapted fairly well thanks to systems UF put in place."
Junior,4,UF has so many opportunities available to students. There are numerous resources and an active network of students and staff. It is really up to the individual to take advantage of opportunities.
Freshman,4,"With the Coronavirus Pandemic, I have found the University of Florida's adaption to online learning in my transition into college satisfactory, although not perfect, with the wealth of information being sometimes difficult to sort through."
Freshman,4,"A top-tier academic experience. There is a very vibrant culture in Gainesville, especially surrounding the athletics. There is never a dull moment."
Freshman,4,"I ended up continuing all my spring semester courses online. Teachers were very motivated to teach and adptable. For classes that I had already taken online before the pandemic, the teachers had exceedingly high expectations and were less likely to compromise."
Alum,4,UF is a beautiful brick campus and has a lot of opportunities and clubs for any student. The education at UF definitely prepares you for real-world experiences. The professors care about their students and typically dedicate their time to make sure their students succeed.
Alum,4,I took a handful of classes online as a Finance major (most of the introductory courses are online or hybrid based). My experience with these course was typically watching recorded lectures and completing online assignments.
Sophomore,4,"With such a big campus, there are many opportunities for all students to explore their interests and try something new."
Sophomore,4,"I did take classes online. Many professors treated it the same as they would for a traditional class, but some saw it as an opportunity to make things more difficult."
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year at the University of Florida and it sure has been a time of learning and growth. I learned to be an independent individual, how to navigate my way on a ginormous campus, met new people from all over the world, and participated in courses and activities I had never thought to take part in before. Although I'm disappointed that my first year did not end the way I expected it to due to COVID-19, I believe I still got to experience the real excitement and thrill of freshman year and can't wait to return safely to campus."
Sophomore,4,"Before COVID-19 and the official move to all-courses online, I was already taking online classes and had taken online classes in the prior semester. I believe this equipped me to be more adaptable to new course-formats, thus allowing for better performance in the remainder of my classes. The beginning of online courses were rough because the situation was so unique and sudden for both the students and professors. And though I can not speak for all professor and student experiences, I can say for myself and my professors, we had an overall very successful and engaging class experience. I rarely felt at a loss in terms of receiving course instruction or communication with the professors and we were all quick to support each other in creating a quick and efficient method of finishing the semester strong. Though it was hard not having the professor there is person, they all tried their best to be available, which I greatly appreciate."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience with the University of Florida has been very convenient and helpful. I was able to continue learning in all of my classes because the online meetings were consistent, and my professors made class very interactive."
Junior,4,"I like that the student organizations at the University of Florida are very inclusive, and the campus environment encourages me to study."
Graduate Student,4,"I personally am not the biggest fan of online learning, but the professors did their best to make it interactive and informative."
Sophomore,4,Online learning has been an adjustment but the professors do make an effort to make everything easier.
Sophomore,4,The school offers a lot of opportunities for undergrads. The classes can be a little impersonal but most of the professors  do want you to succeed!
Sophomore,4,My overall online experience was pretty good. The lectures were recorded and uploaded for us to view whenever we were able to and professors and TAs were available to help either through email or virtual office hours. I was able to learn the material and get help in a timely manner.
Alum,4,"UF is an amazing school, consistently ranked a top 10 public university, with lots of options in educational experiences. However, it is a VERY large university, which can make it easy to get lost in the crowd and feel like you're adrift in a large sea. However, the sooner you make good connections and build a good support network (which is possible to do outside of the Greek scene!), the better your long term experience at UF will be."
Junior,2,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all my courses were forced online which is not ideal for certain majors. Since my major is in engineering my experience was quite daunting.
Alum,2,"It very much felt like you were just one number to them.  Never able to get the classes you need, advisors were understaffed and over worked so it was difficult to get access to help for advising, and there is a culture of ""superiority"" perpetuated at UF where you will hear students and faculty calling UF ""The Harvard of the South.""  Humility is attractive but you wont find any of that here."
Alum,2,Campus staff treat you like a number. In fact that’s all they see. The first thing they ask is your UFID not even your name. It’s appalling to see these educated people treat their students so inhumanly. They see us as money bags.
Alum,2,"I like the connections I made at the school, and I enjoyed the rigor but minority attrition is terrible."
Junior,2,They need more diversity and they need to do more to show that they care about their students well-being and academic success rather than focus on the football players
Alum,2,UF is very interested about approving their own ratings and does not care much about the students that attend.
College Freshman,2,"This is probably biased because I don't like Greek Life, but it's a huge part of campus life. You never go a day without seeing several people wearing their fraternity/sorority shirt, and their attitudes are generally cliquey and snobby. I live across from frat row and every night, there's a party. Literally every night, I hear music blaring from one of the frat houses. You have to wonder if they're actually getting anything done academically."
College Sophomore,2,I only give Greek Life a low rating because it is polarizing and manipulative. Students are strongly encouraged to join Greek Life not only for the opportunities they offer but mostly because there is a stigma around not being involved in Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,The dorms are run down and most don't have private bathrooms
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are getting off campus, extremely new, expensive and hard to get housing, the general housing options are fairly poor. The buildings are old and not renovated. The cleanliness is low and the buildings are dirty both on the outside and the inside. Where most colleges offer bathrooms inside the dorms, most of the dorms here have community style bathrooms. There are very few apartment-style or even split dorms available."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not exactly the best person to talk to about describing the Greek Life because I view it as frivolous and meaningless.  However, my attitude extends beyond that in pointing out that the fact that Greek Life is highly integrated into student government means that any policies passed have a pro Greek agenda."
College Senior,2,I have never had the urge to join the Greek community and I don't regret it.
College Senior,2,"While I love my social sciences and humanities professors at the University and their dedication towards helping students, the financial aid offices and advisors want nothing more than to make money off of students by finding ways to keep them at the University for as long as they can."
College Sophomore,2,the tier system for the greek life at our school is extremely harsh. I love being in a sorority but I hate the judgement I get from other greeks because I'm bottom tier.
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol is a BIG problem on campus. On any night, you can see a lot of drunk people at night in midtown (right next to campus). There were many times on a normal Monday or Tuesday night after studying at the library, I would go to Pita Pit and half the students there were drunk."
College Freshman,2,"The Greeks are some of the worst people you could ever get to meet, but they can throw a fairly good party sometimes."
College Freshman,2,"The floors are clean daily, I commend the cleaning crew as they do a great job, but with upwards of 100 students to one bathroom, things get disgusting fast"
College Freshman,2,"While the dorm I lived in was nice, it made life very very difficult."
College Freshman,2,All of our Greek life is all about parties and night life.
College Senior,2,"As a student registered with the Disability Resource Center, I experience the large number of hoops to receive accommodations and have them recognized by instructors. Not nearly enough is being done about predatory men!"
College Senior,2,I had a crowded housing situation and didn't really find a community outside of my roommates. Seemed hit or miss.
College Sophomore,2,The Greek life is very terrible because it does not affect the social atmosphere of the campus and all they do is throw parties involving alcohol.
College Junior,2,I was a part of Greek life because I thought it was the thing everyone did. It didn't workout for me.
College Freshman,2,It has gotten to the point where the safety and the police of the campus are made fun of; nothing ever seems to get done. This campus is more concerned about telling you how to deal with the assault then how to prevent it. It feels like a false care because they are more concerned with protecting certain individuals (such as athletic participants) than helping the many.
College Freshman,2,The professors make the classes unnecessarily hard and wouldn't have it any other way. You can study everyday and still fail the test and most of the students do. I also have learned nothing from my courses. I do enjoy the options of extracurricular activities that UF offers.
College Sophomore,2,I personally don't feel that there are enough parties around.
College Sophomore,2,The parties here are okay however there needs to be more and night life should be better.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of crime. Lots of robberies at gunpoint and the police have been able to do nothing about it so far.
College Freshman,2,"My rent for UF is ricidoulsly high. Their financial aid office is very unwelcoming and unsupportive. Because of expensive bills , I was not able to receive a meal plan and now I almost starve everyday. I was subjected to take student loans and my charges exceeded the payments made by both financial aid and student loan. My expected family contribution to my education is very slim to none."
College Sophomore,2,"I had an unlimited meal plan at the beginning of the semester, then switched to declining balance. The dining halls are gross, with low quality food."
College Senior,2,"I had a meal plan for my athletic scholarship and I rarely used it due to the bad quality of food that they serve in the dinning halls. I even had training table, which was in the back end of the dinning hall for athletes and I still feel like the food quality could be better."
College Sophomore,2,Honestly the school does not offer enough help for student financially. Besides financial aid students have to pay for everything on their own.
College Freshman,2,Hard to get appointment with counselors. Also they seem not interested in helping you. Asked about getting my transcripts transferred and never once was I asked why would I want to leave this school.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking is way to strict with far too high of a ticket price, there is next to no parking on campus even on the weekends for student activities. The police almost never notice drugs and drinking unless it is extremely obvious. UF is a tobacco free zone but people are smoking on campus all the time and never get caught, change something cause I'm tired of breathing in smoke."
College Sophomore,2,The only good thing is it's close to class. The people you live with are awful and you end up far too close to them. I moved off campus the year following my life in a dorm.
College Freshman,2,They assume that since your parents make money that they will pay for your entire college experience. I don't thinks its fair that my parents income effects the amount of aid I could receive.
College Freshman,2,"I never loved the parties associated with the majority of students my age at my school. After hearing much about fun times from my suitemates in the summer, I was excited to experience my first frat party. While there, despite the open space outside, it just felt overblown and crowded; everyone was already involved in their pre-made cliques, so it was hard to make conversation with new people. When it got to the stereotypical point of a poor sap trying to down a funnel and ultimately failing, spitting his beer all over a beautifully-dressed girl, I knew I had had enough. I bonded over this loathing for frat parties with two new friends I met at the school, and we spent most of our weekends downtown, checking out bands and shows. House parties (off campus) became more up our alley, as they usually involve a smaller amount of people, and there's a calmer feel to it, with people you can actually strike up a talk with. The same goes for tailgates, before a football game. They're fun with a small group of buddies. Frat parties are still very popular here, occurring a few times a week, along with that same fraternity/sorority group of people partying in midtown (in places most are to young to actually attend) or at clubs downtown. Police officers tend to stick around the midtown area on the weekends, but there isn't usually any serious conflict with them and the partiers."
College Freshman,2,Not very many healthy options.
College Sophomore,2,"My experience with campus housing was not a great one. I applied early for housing and ended up being put in an apartment-style room that I would have to move away from after the first semester. The building I was moved into next was also apartment style and was significantly more expensive as well as extremely far from classes; I did not have much choice in the matter. The cleaning of the bathrooms was done with a lick and a promise, almost literally and was never satisfactory. Neither of my RA's were ever around and there wasn't much of a sense of community in either building."
College Sophomore,2,Salem State University is unorganized
College Sophomore,2,"I paid more for getting half a room and access to a common bathroom, than I do now with my own bedroom and bathroom."
College Sophomore,2,It is extremely uncleanly carpeting and outdated furniture in the dorms. The price exceeds the quality.
College Freshman,2,UF does not give out many scholarships.
College Freshman,2,Having the meal plan was absolutely terrible. I thought the dining halls were disgusting.
College Sophomore,2,UF doesn't offer many scholarships or grants
College Senior,2,"Getting financial aid was very difficult because of all the documents needed and the lack of feedback from the financial aid office until the last minute.  Also, they won't send any emails or notifications or update the status of your financial aid on their website unless you call or visit the office to remind them to do so."
College Freshman,2,"I think the University of Florida student body puts too much emphasis on Greek life, entirely.  Yes, the people in these sororities/fraternities are the ones who throw most of the parties, but that doesn't mean it's all that easy to get into these parties (if you're non-Greek or don't know anyone at the parties).  I know that not all of the students who make up the Greek life population are snobby and cliquey and fake, but those things are what they're all assumed to be until one takes the time to find out otherwise."
College Freshman,2,Not many things to do in Gainesville outside of the college campus
College Freshman,2,Didnt get anything but bright futures
College Freshman,2,Didn't qualify for any financial aid and also didn't get any scholarships but that's probably expected because there's like 50k students.
College Senior,2,Lately we have had a lot of issues with safety on campus. On the plus side security has gotten stronger and there are a lot more police officers on campus and people that will walk with you to your car or dorm when it gets dark.
College Senior,2,I don't really attend parties but i have heard about and been invited to quite a few parties on the weekends.
College Sophomore,2,"There's simply not that much money to give out to students. I personally have Florida Pre-paid, so that takes care of a lot of my worries, but you have to look for extra money on your own if you're not really in ""need""."
College Freshman,2,It is extremely tough to receive grants or aid from the school itself. Your only option is FAFSA and outside scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"I'm still dealing with financial aid, the people working are not helpful at all and it seems like they just don't care sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"APPLY EARLY!!!!! I was undergoing family issues dealing with the death of my father and his estate and debt at the time of applying for colleges and when I went to apply for scholarships I was told that it was first come first serve and there were no more left even though I met more requirement that some of the students I met that had received the full ride scholarships. I am now drowning in student loans and doing everything I can to try to scrape together the money for school, housing, and food."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Besides the university, there's really nothing in Gainesville."
College Sophomore,2,"As such a prestigious school in this state, there is hardly any merit-aid like other schools. Applying for University scholarships is not discussed with students (found the directory on my own and have never heard anyone mention it) and a complicated process. I have received a need-based grant from the school for each semester I have attended so far though."
College Senior,2,to me it seems like a thing to just be popular instead I would love to see Greek life being used as a networking opportunity
College Sophomore,2,It is either incredibly hot or incredibly cold. Or rainy. But that's just Florida.
Niche User,1,"My daughter was ALWAYS taking on line classes..even without the pandemic.
It's not a good way to learn...especially the hard classes"
Niche User,1,I was so excited when my daughter was accepted at UF.  I couldn't be more disappointed.  She is a senior this year and during the past 3 years all but 5 of her classes were on line.  She had regular admission not Pace. She is in the business school when I called to speak about this I was told the major is so large that they have to do online.  Really? How about making it more selective? I feel like they have ruined her whole college experience.  My other daughter graduated from FSU and in four years she had maybe 2 online classes.  The poverty level in Gainesville is one of the highest in the nation and if you check the pedophile map in the surrounding area it would make you sick to your stomach.  Think twice before sending your child here.  Its such an impersonal experience.
Senior,1,Online learning is definitely not my preferred learning technique. I do not think most professors at any university are adjusting the way they should be in terms of workload and material presentation. UF is sadly no exception to this trend.
Freshman,1,"Overall, I liked the fact that UF had many resources available to students. The university prioritizes professional development and has a  career center dedicated to students. The center meets a wide variety of student needs, from resume help to professional attire services. The one thing I disliked about UF is the lack of diversity and campus culture in general. Most days, the campus is very dull and there is not much to do."
Freshman,1,You are just a number at UF. There is nothing to do in Gainsville it is so boring. The classes are huge and there is minimal interaction between the students and teachers.
Junior,1,"They randomly picked me for fafsa verification and took so long to process things and tell me what I needed to do for them that I still don’t have my financial aid and the semester is almost over. Absolutely horrific management. They told me I needed to get them a few specific documents and once presented with these, proceeded to tell me that surprise, they actually need several more. Given that I had to go through the irs to get most od them, it took a long time to get them, and if they had let me know from the start that that is what they needed, then a whole several month long fiasco in which I struggled to pay my bills because work study counts as the financial aid they couldn’t give me could have been avoided."
Sophomore,1,This is my son’s 4th semester as a botany major and he has not been able to register for a botany course yet. This is not a major research institution in botany.
Freshman,1,"The University of Florida may be worth the amount in-state students pay, but anything above that is a complete and total waste of money. Even full-time students have to take online classes, especially within the ""acclaimed"" business school. The surrounding area is a textbook college town, but it's heavy on Greek life. Basically, if you are a Floridian who's been told that UF is the best school you could ever go to because you have Florida pre-paid, but any out-of-state or international students should steer clear."
College Senior,1,"The people in it love it, but as someone who never had interest in joining, it continues to seem overrated at best and potentially dangerous/threatening at worst."
College Freshman,1,"greek housing is amazing and cheap

greeks are cliquish and dont make friends with anyone else

if youre not greek you hate the greek community"
College Junior,1,Many people who join fraternities or sororities look down upon those who do not. For some reason they believe they're better than everyone else. It's really sad to see.
College Freshman,1,cafeteria was dirty and had bugs
College Freshman,1,The Dorms were small dirty and  unsocial
College Sophomore,1,unorganized and all over the place
College Sophomore,1,"Only live in a dorm if you know who you're going to be living with. Their lottery system is terrible, they'll assign to someone who you're not compatible with."
College Sophomore,1,"Getting grants and scholarships is like winning the lottery, there is almost no way to guarantee help even if you are very intelligent, active, and in need. There is no compassion from the aid office."
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life here is great if you value Greek life. But unfortunately I think it's a perfect example of stratification among the students. Wealthier students can afford to be a part of and enjoy the benefits and amenities of Greek life. UF has a huge emphasis on it, and a lot of judgment is certainly passed from Greeks to non-Greeks. I've heard many Greeks say that they won't hang out or date someone who isn't a Greek regardless of any other positive qualities that person holds. I think the Greek system prides itself in excluding others equally as much as it prides itself in being a part of a community (by community I mean a Greek community, not the actual community as a whole). In fact, I think the Greek system here is delivered in a socially unhealthy and unacceptable way. I don't think that will ever change though as it is a part of the mentality many students and alumni hold here. I suppose I have a lot of resentment towards Greeks simply from personal experience and hearing other peoples' experiences (both Greek and non-Greek) about middle to upper tier sororities and fraternities. As someone who deals closely with both Greeks and alumni, I've learned during my stay here at UF that entitlement, privilege, judgment, and prejudice are unfortunately abundant in the Greek system. I have literally heard fraternity brothers discussing the dynamic of ""f**k[ing] the poor girls now, and wife-[ing] the sorority sluts later."" I can't quite say that I'm proud to be a Florida Gator beyond solely academics. To esteem the Greek system would be irresponsible of me. There are sororities and fraternities on campus that are conscientious and compassionate, but that is easily overwhelmed by the amount of Greeks who uphold the horrifying stereotypes of the upper class. Maybe I've simply been exposed to an unfortunate side of the Greek system. But the fact that that atmosphere even exists here is heartbreaking to say the least."
College Freshman,1,Very hard to receive financial aid or scholarships
College Freshman,1,"Scholarships and dealing with the financial aid office is pretty tedious, but manageable."
College Freshman,1,"I live in an economy triple. It is a room made for 2 people, and they stuck my initial roommate and I with an extra person. It ended up being fine because we all get along great, but it is extremely small. I live in Broward. Broward and Jennings are the most social dorms and are right next to classes. Rawlings is pretty social too. Murphree and Springs on the other hand are extremely far, and you have to take a bus or walk 20 minutes to get to class."
College Senior,1,The off campus housing in my opinion is some of the worst I have experienced. there needs to be cleaner well staffed places for students to live that are financially available as well. some of the better places are way to expensive.
College Student,1,"Some of the teachers are wonderful, however, I have had some classes that I could have excelled at, but instead barely passed due to the poor quality of education I received from the professor"
College Student,1,Haven't been able to get one yet for grad school.
College Junior,1,"I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Gainesville will be 34 degrees in the morning, 78 degrees in the afternoon, then start pouring rain in the early evening. It's the PITS!"
College Junior,1,The Greek life on our campus is terrible. It is ridiculous how some people in organizations treat non-Greeks.
College Junior,1,"I HATE PARKING. It is the bane of my existence. Literally, there is never anywhere close to park so you have to park 20 minutes away from where you live and you MIGHT get a spot there. UF needs to improve it's parking situation because it's literally ridiculous. "
College Freshman,1,It's awful. Don't bring a car unless you have to.
College Freshman,1,"I HATE the weather. I'm from Florida so I'm used to it, but I can only take so many years of unbearable humidity. A change in weather is one of the things I'm looking forward to most in transferring. Also, it rains excessively for 5 minutes at a time sometimes every other hour. Other times it never ceases."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on-campus is really bad. If you live off-campus and have a car, you'll have to take a bus bc you won't find a spot. Also, you're guaranteed a ticket, or towed, if you park w/o a correct pass."
College Junior,1,"Horrible. I doing worst than planned living on campus. It's expensive, staff members (Resident Assistants and Graduate Hall Directors) are mostly rude and talked bad about residents, and you are stuck on campus for the entire year and can't leave even you are on the verge of eviction."
College Junior,1,In short parking sucks. The price of a voucher is insane and it's temporary. Also there is not many parking spots to go with anyway.
College Senior,1,"There is a supposed ""strict"" honor code in place, and it is enforced strictly in some classes and contexts, but not others. Some online classes have webcam proctored exams, and some have no regulations at all. A major source of cheating are the groups of people I have seen in science classes who share all their materials, especially lab materials and old exams, with their friends after them."
College Senior,1,"A majority of students get scooters or motorcycles because otherwise you can't park on campus.  Most students take the bus, ride bikes, or walk.  You can only get a parking decal if you live on campus, and even then you have to park a mile away from your dorm."
College Junior,1,The parking on campus is terrible unless you have a scooter.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is almost impossible. Permits are only given out to those that live on campus and those that live off campus are forced to buy city parking permits which are costly and are limited and a far distance from classes.
College Junior,1,"I gave this grade because I am not part of Greek life. Yes, there are many frats and sororities and housing for almost all of them, but that really means that the Greeks dominate the school. They control Student Government each semester (which receives an annual $15 million budget that can be distributed to clubs at will) and the Senate. Former and current Greeks have written articles in the Independent Alligator about how they are forced to vote (and strongly pushed to vote for certain parties/candidates) by being required to produce an ""I Voted"" sticker on a communal board everyone in the frat/sorority house can see. Some non-Greeks probably feel indifferent towards them, but there are a group of us who don't view them too highly. As most of the students running for political bodies on campus are preparing for a career in politics, it's unnerving to think about how they will treat the government of a state or country."
College Senior,1,"To keep it short and sweet, you're probably better off just catching the bus. Otherwise, either buy a commuter decal and catch the bus from the commuter lot parking, or get to the Reitz parking garage at 8 am to find a spot. Another option is for you to have a friend sit in your car while you go to class because if you drive your car to campus in the middle of a regular weekday during Fall or Spring, the only available spots will be tow-away zones. so watch out! they WILL give you tickets!!"
College Sophomore,1,Dining off campus can be a pain. Just depending on where one decides to eat timing and comfort may become an issue. Not all resurants have the best service.
College Junior,1,I didn't receive a lot of financial aid even though I need it very much much thats not what it says on the FASFA. So now I have to go else where that will increase my loans by a lot and I wish I didn't need to do that.
College Senior,1,Scholarships are few and far between at UF. Government aid is the only help that's really available unless you're out of state.
College Sophomore,1,It's very difficult to find spaces on campus and parking decals are pretty expensive. I would recommend walking or taking a bus.
College Senior,1,"Parking is the worst at UF. It's pretty expensive (like $75 a semester) and the student parking spots are nowhere near any of the classes. Unless you live in a dorm, you can't park anywhere close to the middle of campus. If you do have a parking pass, good luck actually finding an available spot. And never park somewhere where you're not allowed to, parking enforcement will give you a $30 ticket. If there's 40 cars parked in the grass for a gymnastics meet, they will all get a ticket, unless it's a football game day, then there's free parking for all."
College Sophomore,1,"Since I was an out of state student with a 4.3 GPA and your typical extra curricular activities along with work experience, NHS and AP classes, I was surprised to have not received any scholarships or financial aid help. The college student debt crisis is terrible and even if you work hard and get what you need to be a stand out student you still get nothing.  Very sad."
College Junior,1,Florida weather is extremely unpredictable.  It sometimes rains while the sun is still shining!
College Sophomore,1,"Very expensive, not covered in the tuition, and are always filled up"
College Junior,1,"There is not a lot of parking on campus, especially for underclassmen.  There really is not much need for a car on campus for first year students living on campus.  For people who live off campus, it is much more convenient to take the bus onto campus during the day.  Parking at night is usually possible though, as parking lot restrictions are usually lifted."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in Florida can be either beautiful or annoying. You'd be surprised how cold it can get here. January-March are probably the coldest months, but don't rule out any cold fronts for the Fall semester. As for heat, it's Florida. There will always be a bit of humidity that makes things warmer. I have heard that summer here is awful. It's full of blistering heat and rainy afternoons full of thunderstorms. August is still pretty hot, but you get used to it. Bring an umbrella!"
College Sophomore,1,There is not even half as many parking spots as there are people on campus.   And its dangerous to drive on campus.
College Student,1,The weather is bipolar. Most days the weather changes from morning to afternoon so ill be fine one minute and miserable the next. Either overdressed or underdressed.
College Sophomore,1,"I was majoring in Art History. While all of my friends are talking about how challenging their classes are, I felt like I was in elementary school. Most of my classes had a survey class feel to them even if they were a higher level. The material was generally taught in ""memorize and repeat"" sort of way."
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, you get the worst parking.  You often have to park far away from your dorm and it is difficult to find a spot.  UFPD is very strict on parking tickets and if your car isn't moved by 7:30 am Monday morning, you're most likely going to find a ticket on it."
College Junior,1,"I went to the Gator Dining by Beaty Hall during my orientation, and liked it. However, I went to the Gator Dining on Stadium and Gale, and it was bad. The food was stale, and they had made way too much extra food. A lady that was making an omelet coughed into her glove, and then touched the omelet, without replacing the coughed-on glove. A chocolate cake dessert that was put out, had been sitting there so long, that it stuck to the plate when I turned it upside down. I don't recommend this facility at all. The variety of food was decent; it just didn't taste good. I personally find it cheaper to actually make your own food, and suggest it, but most people don't have the time for this. Since I don't have the money for meal plans, I make time for cooking."
College Freshman,1,"At UF, the parking is terrible, mostly because they give out a lot more parking passes than there are actual spots. Plus, a lot of the parking spaces are restricted to upperclassmen or faculty so the parking you will get as an underclassmen is usually very far away from your classes."
College Sophomore,1,"If you have less than 60 credits, you can forget about finding a spot. Decals are given out based on how many credits you have. If you live off-campus, don't even think about driving to class"
College Senior,1,Be very discreet in dorms and on campus. The police is strict in regards to underage drinking. Do not have open containers. You will get in trouble.
College Freshman,1,"I received almost no financial aid, even though I had amazing scores. I fouind that most of my friends are the same, and you must win an award like national merit to receive any money."
College Freshman,1,The University of Florida's financial aid office is very unhelpful and offers very little in the name of financial aid. Every time I have gone to the office they have done nothing to solve my problems.
College Junior,1,There is absolutely no way to get any parking at the University of Florida unless you get there at 7:30 in the morning.
College Sophomore,1,"UF is very skimpy on financial aid. I received the statewide Bright Futures Scolarship, which is a good bi of money. My grants averaged out to around $100-$200 a semester, and there's not much you can do with that even though every dollar counts."
College Senior,1,"UF parking decals go by how many credits/your classification at the school. If you were a freshman/sophomore, you got the worst places to park with your decal (and it cost $160 a year), and juniors and seniors get a little better ( but thats only if you're living on campus, and its still $160 a year). If you're off campus, you don't qualify for a decal unless its for the parking lot basically off campus and you still had to take the bus to your classes. I take the bus and don't even bother parking on campus. Not to mention they close practically ALL parking on gamedays, so you can pay someone who has a house off campus $30 to park there or just walk like 2 miles to the stadium."

Graduate Student,5,"Malone University is a school that combines a high academic standard with student friendly environment. I originally attended Malone back in 2017 for my bachelor's and loved my experience so much that I am going back to pursue my master's degree in nursing.  The reason I am going back is because I do not feel like just a nber at Malone.  Each student is treated like a valued person and the professors are completely invested in your success.  Benefits of attending Malone include a curriculum that is pretty straight forward, financial aid handles everything for you once you fill out your FAFSA, student advisors sign you up for every class so that you do not have to yourself, your books are mailed to you so that you do not have to go to a book store to pick them up and professors that get back to you in a timely manner. All of these collectively give the student a pleasant experience. I highly recommend this University."
Senior,5,We were online for quarantine and the professors were great about it. They were understanding with school work and ready to help. Their were weekly video calls. The professors really care about the students.
Senior,5,They have a great staff that genuinely cares about the students. I am a transfer student and the last university I was at I had a different advisor each semester for the five semesters I was their. At Malone my advisor actually knows my name and cares about me and knows about me. I highly recommend.
Alum,5,"I did not take online classes except during the COVID-19 outbreak, where all classes were moved online."
Alum,5,"Great community, good professors, friendly students, pretty campus. Very small and conservative, but there are students from a wide variety of backgrounds and many professors with starkly liberal views. 
Not much of a party scene, except for the off-campus housing. Many sports teams or friend groups will host parties at their houses near campus, but not everyone knows about the parties so they're never huge. Some students are against partying and drinking so it doesn't get talked about much on campus. 
The sports programs and coaches are phenomenal for a school Malone's size. Definitely competitive in the conference yet one of the smallest division 2 schools in Ohio.
Overall, great experience at Malone and would recommend to anyone interested in a liberal arts college!!"
Niche User,5,I loved Malone University because it was a small campus and you get to become close with your friends and classmates. There is much you can do when you are there and you become close and friends with a lot of people.
Niche User,5,I like the overall feel of Malone. The staff and students are friendly and welcoming. The campus is vast and spacious. The religious requirement seems like a bit too much since the students should spend as much time as they can preparing for classes and studying. They have a wonderful music department and are extremely nice.
Sophomore,5,"Malone University is an incredible place. The professors are all very kind and helpful, and the students are very friendly."
Sophomore,5,"Great small Christian school. The ratio of students to professors is 14:1 so it is a great school for one-on-one attention from professors, and it provides a better environment for learning. The food is excellent, and most everyone is kind and friendly."
Freshman,5,"Excellent school, amazing campus, and extremely friendly and welcoming staff. I am so glad to be attending this college for the next four years."
Freshman,5,"I love Malone University because of the deep personal relationships that I've been able to establish with other students, and with faculty and staff. It's like home after only a semester!"
Freshman,5,The staff is always willing to help and guide if a problem arises to get it resolved quick as possible. I love the dorm and amenities offered.
Graduate Student,5,Great school. Enjoy the online courses that are offered. The professors that I have had so far are very helpful
Alum,5,"Small town, close to home and easy transition to college for people from small towns or quiet areas. Small class sizes led to great individual interaction between the teachers and students."
Junior,5,Christian based. Greatly impacted my faith and gave me a chance to share my beliefs. Able to connect with others and the teachers were always willing to help you.
Sophomore,5,This is a great university to earn a collage degree. I love every thing about it. The staff is always very helpful. The students are very friendly to help show the way.
Alum,5,"My experience at Malone University was fantastic! I majored in Bible/Theology and I really enjoyed all of my professors. I learned so much while I was there and I was sad to leave. Malone is a special place. If I had to pick one thing to change, I would say the requirement of 20 SFOs (Spiritual Formation Opportunities) that each full time student is required to meet each semester. The result of not meeting requirement is a $35 fine per SFO not attended, and I've just never agreed with that policy or thought it was helpful in any way."
Sophomore,5,"I decided to attend Malone all the way from Southern California and, while a crazy decision, I would not have chosen any other school. I love the community and the freedom to be able to grow in my faith here. Also, professors make themselves available to you if you need any help at all, which is great!"
Niche User,5,I went to Malone University for a worship camp one summer and my experience was amazing. Everyone was so nice and the feeling you get when you walk on campus is so inviting. While I was there I  got just a glimpse of Malone life and from what saw I would love to go there. But one thing that really stuck out to me that it was a christian collage with science majors which is out of this world because Christian university's that have those types of majors are few and far between.
Niche User,5,"This College seems like a really great school and I can't wait to get there!!! The food is great, the community there makes it feel like home, and the students and staff are very friends and welcoming to newcomers. If you don´t know what you´re doing, ask somebody!! Everybody is more than willing to help you figure it out!!"
Alum,5,Malone is a great place to discover you faith and grow your relationship with Christ. I love that the professors can openly talk about their faith and pray for you. Malone is a good place to build relationship with friends. You get a good educations and are taught to integrate your faith in your career
Sophomore,5,"Malone University is a safe place to attend school and live in the dorms. I like a small school experience, because the professors have time to meet with me if I need assistance. It’s a great college experience playing softball for a coach that cares about me as a student and player."
Graduate Student,5,"Malone offers a unique experience for undergraduate students, as well as, graduate students. Whether you are 18 or 75, you will feel like you are where you are supposed to be. The Christian environment makes Malone a warm and welcoming place to further your education!!"
Niche User,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful. I spent a week there this summer and automatically fell in love with everything about it. I met two of the professors and they were super nice. The food there is also pretty good. Its way better than high school food in Kentucky. I plan on going there next fall and I am hoping me and my new friend I made there well get a room together again.
Freshman,5,I love the sense of community Malone has. Everyone is so friendly and has a story to share. There is so much laughter and love her and it is all to continue Christ's kingdom in each of our own unique ways.
College Sophomore,5,"My professors are very helpful and involved in my academic success. The courses are extremely diverse, educational and interesting."
College Junior,5,I enjoy my classes and listening to most of my professors.  They make me feel welcomed and they seem to be very approachable.  I feel as if they are top professionals in their fields and that I am receiving a good strong education.  I appreciate their values and the examples that they are for me inside and out of the classroom.  I believe they are good role models for us and I feel as if I could speak with them on a personal level.
College Junior,5,"I feel very safe on campus, and there is a constant presence of campus security.  I am not afraid to walk from buildings at night.  I believe that students are educated about sexual violence and are aware of what to look for and how to prevent any misconduct.  Any type of sexual assault is not condoned and would be dealt with in a proper manner."
College Freshman,5,"Malone University is a private Christian university with the motto of Christ's Kingdom first. This it's seen throughout the student body, faulty and the curriculum. For those who want a quality education and want to grow I their Faith, Malone is the best place to be."
College Freshman,5,I love that it's a christian school and almost everyone is a christ follower. My classes are very small and the professors are always willing to help at any time.
College Sophomore,5,My overall experience has been wonderful. I love being at Malone and the wonderful Community that it has. The faculty and students are incredible. It is a wonderful place to learn and grow.
College Sophomore,5,Nearly anyone who goes to Malone University leaves with a job. Malone is locally known for providing wonderful students. I mostly know about the nursing program. The NCLEX pass rate is at 99% some years. The alumni network is good as far as I know. I haven't personally reached out and tapped into those resources because I'm a sophomore.
College Sophomore,5,"Classes are generally small. Most classes are around 20 students besides the general education classes. Most professors are accommodating and willing to listen. They respond well to students that are working very hard. A lot of the professors are challenging and want to encourage growth. They encourage the view of college being an experience that shapes you as a whole person. Not just a place to get a degree. Quality of classes are high. They do their best to offer classes based on student interest. Such as backpacking, archery, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"Malone University lacks in facilities majorly. However what it lacks facility wise makes up in heart. The faculty and student body emphasizes community like no other school. Malone pushes you to grow intellectually and personally. Coming to Malone I wasn't a very strong Christian. The community pushed me to grow as a person. How to care for others. How to be a well rounded individual. I am a nursing student and I cannot tell you how much the faculty cares. The program is extremely rigorous but it has to be since it is a program that lets in anyone. If you fail a nursing test you must meet with the professor to figure out what can help you be successful. The love that is poured out is incredible. All a person has to do is reach out. Malone does have a mix of Christian and non Christian students so it is not a Christian ""bubble"" that is unrealistic. You do experience partiers but all of that occurs off campus. The campus is clean and lovely. The dorms are a wonderful size. I just wish that more people gave Malone a chance and truly saw Malone's mission of ""Christ's Kingdom First"". There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the president of the university eat lunch in the cafeteria and spends time trying to learn student's names. You don't get that very often."
College Freshman,5,I love the Christian atmosphere. All of our classes incorporate God and are always helpful.
College Junior,5,"I didn't want to go to Malone. It was a last minute option. I only went because of a scholarship. However, I soon fell in love and my decision to attend Malone has made all the difference. Itbis a place to go to get your life in order and excel in the classroom. It is a thought provoking, engaging school that I am forever indebted to."
College Freshman,5,There are so many different food options off-campus. Canton is loaded with great places that are not far from campus
College Freshman,5,"a lot of choices off campus, and super close too."
College Freshman,5,"Officer Dave is the best! Visitation hours are good, it's nice to have some days free of boys"
College Freshman,5,I got way more scholarships than from any of the other schools I applied to
College Freshman,5,"It's so friendly, it's nice to have my own space, the dorms were nice and clean. The cost in Heritage is more than others, but still convenient. It's close to almost all my classes. The moving in/out process was very smooth and easy."
College Freshman,5,"There are a variety of restaurants throughout Canton. You can find different priced food everywhere so it is very convenient. There aren't too many student discounts. There is a great sushi restaurant called Jasmine's not too far from campus among other cute coffee shops like Mugswiggs. If you're looking for something, you'll find it."
College Freshman,5,The administration has reasons for why they do things and convey the rules with kindness.
College Freshman,5,The school gives plenty of money for reasonable achievements.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms at Malone are spacious and the quality depends on which building you are placed in. They are all in excellent condition! The oldest dorms are WWF and PGB, but they also have the best atmosphere. They are community style bathrooms that are cleaned every weekday. There are many friendly, uplifting people that make your first year easier to get through. The better dorms are Heritage, Blossom, Haviland, and DeVol. They have suite style living and are in excellent condition. The laundry is free and the housing process is easy. The cost is a little pricey, but the atmosphere makes up for it. I personally live in WWF and love it. I wouldn't have grown into the person I am today if I didn't live in these dorms."
College Junior,5,There are so many cheap places for college students
College Sophomore,5,"There are lots of places for students to hang out. Places both for studying and for hanging out with friends. Malone also has 3 cafés on campus for hangout, study, and coffee. The library is also a great place for students to go. There are lots of book, tables, couches, computers, and study rooms for students to use."
College Sophomore,5,"Malone is in downtown Canton, making food options endless within a few miles of campus"
College Junior,5,Feel very secure. Have an alert system.
College Junior,5,"Small campus, easily accessible for walking or bike riding."
College Junior,5,Computer labs and library computers available.
College Junior,5,Malone has a great basketball team.
College Junior,5,Christian Campus. No drugs seen.
College Junior,5,RN to BSN program very easy to navigate.
College Sophomore,5,Academics are great here in every way.
College Sophomore,5,"My experience has been great so far. I've grown not only academically, but spiritually also."
College Sophomore,5,The nursing program is phenomenal.
College Freshman,5,I love it here. It is definitely where I am supposed to be.
College Freshman,5,It is a very friendly campus. 
College Senior,5,"As an Organizational Management major, I find the information taught at Malone University is very relevant and current with the business world. Every time I'm in class, I get a better understanding of the organzation I work for as well as my role. The class has really allowed me to focus on where I would like to develop my future career upon graduation."
Graduate Student,4,I had the privilege of doing my undergrad online at Malone University a couple years ago in order to receive my Bachelor's in the Science of Nursing.  My experience throughout the entire program was simply amazing.  The professors were passionate about their jobs and invested heavily in each of their students. Each one went above and beyond their role in order to help you succeed. They were all easily reachable and even willing to meet with you on campus even though in was an online program.  I had such a wonderful experience that I am currently in the process of going back in August for my Master's in the Science of Nursing. I highly recommend this University to anyone who has an interest in enrolling there.
Freshman,4,I am an education major at Malone. It is a great Christian faith-centered organization. They try to help incorporate the faith with everything we do. The professors here are amazing and they love helping their students. Everyone that works here makes an effort to know you for who you are. The university also puts you out into the field early. This is great for building an understanding of the profession you want to go into. Malone is a great university to attend.
Alum,4,"Great professors, great students. Bad administration, no party scene. 

Overall I would absolutely do it all over again if I could. Nothing was perfect by any means, but the relationships I built there are way too strong to wish I would have gone somewhere else. Almost all of my current friends went to Malone, met most of them there. All suffered through the same thing and there is a bonding experience we have from that ha.

Love that school, always will and I hope it is here for a long time to come!"
Sophomore,4,I like the community and openness of Malone. It's my home away from home. Malone has a lot of services for it's students like counseling and free tutoring. I came thinking I was not gonna make any friends and now  I am surrounded by so many amazing people of all kinds of majors. The teachers are a huge part of the campus. They pull late nights and crazy meeting hours to help us. They get back to emails ASAP and always answer clearly. All the staff are easy to talk to and are always willing to give a helping hand.
Niche User,4,Friendly staff and students.  Family atmosphere.  Smaller campus.  Faith based education.  Intentional interaction between staff and students.
Freshman,4,"So far it has been a blast! I'm only at band camp right now but it's great. The food, people, staff, and students are all amazing. It's really exciting to be able to call this place my home."
Junior,4,"Malone University is a great Christian private school. Since I have been there, I have been able to find a solid group of friends as well as receive the education that I know will set me up for the rest of my life. I found it easy to fit in socially due to the university setting all freshman up with a class that focuses on transitioning into the college atmosphere. Going into Malone, it must be understood that it is a religious institution, so there are obviously going to be required chapel credits as well as more strict rules. Some students do not realize this and dislike their time at Malone as a result. Ultimately, college is what you make it, and Malone is a great place to find your opportunity to succeed."
Alum,4,I was given a great educational and prepared me for the nursing world. I had great clinical experiences and opportunities to learn and grow.
Alum,4,"I liked the overall atmosphere. I wish students and faculty were more interested in other ideas rather than their one size fits all, cookie cutter view of Christianity."
Freshman,4,I love the community here! Professor really care about you as an individual and your education. There are great spiritual formation opportunities that get you in worship with your peers. I feel like I have grown a lit closer to God in my semester here. I love it here!
Niche User,4,"While visiting Malone, I had a very pleasant experience. The staff was extremely welcoming and seeming to care deeply about their students."
Freshman,4,Malone  University is  full of wonderful God-serving people. The community is just awesome and so uplifting. Everyone is so kind and the staff is extremely helpful and compassionate about the students.
Freshman,4,"Some people at malone act like they're being held captive there. But I think it's a pretty darn good school. The science department is tough but ultimately fair. Non believers are truly welcome but believers are going to have the best experience. Parties are available off campus if that's really your thing, but it's not forced on anyone. They do a good job of maintaining the place and I've only had one thing stolen (a sled of all things.) if you're considering malone, attend one of their summer camps. I think it gives you a good picture."
College Freshman,4,there are decent class sizes compared to other universities and professors here seem to be very decent.
College Freshman,4,there are not many problems around here on campus
College Sophomore,4,I feel extremely safe on campus and are unaware of any major incidents occurring.
College Sophomore,4,"I live in one of the newer buildings and it is fantastic. However, the older buildings are not as spacious, clean or updated. They have community bathrooms and there is no air conditioning."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is a very safe and friendly environment. There are alot of rules but following them isn't impossible. It isn't for everyone, but I love it here."
College Junior,4,"I have not tapped into this resource much personally.  But I have read about the high rating of internships and job placements that has occurred in the past.  I hope to take advantage of career services, in hopes of finding a job for next summer in my field.  I have met with a staff member from career services and they are very nice and seem to want to do all they can to assist me and the student body."
College Junior,4,"For the majority of dorms, they are newer and well maintained.  We do have some older dorms, but they are clean and maintained as well.  The cost of living on campus is a bit high, but that is because of the smaller size campus, and fewer students than a major university.  But the atmosphere and the overall campus environment is makes up for the cost and size.  I feel safe and well cared for on campus.  Although  a little cramped, it is a typical dorm room.  I appreciate all that I have."
College Junior,4,"I am a tranfer student and I am amazed at how friendly everyone is on campus, from financial aid staff to students and fellow softball teammates.  I feel like everyone genuinely cares!  It was not like this on the campus that I had previously attended.  From the very first contact with a staff member from Malone, I felt at home, like I mattered to them.  I only wish that I had started my college career here, but I am very grateful that I have found my way here now, better late than never!!"
College Sophomore,4,"There are many ways that inform us of the available resources and information like security numbers, call phones on campus, presence of security personnel."
College Sophomore,4,"Since just transferring, I am relying on an alum and other students that have shared how satisfied they are about how well career services help them."
College Sophomore,4,"I am just transferring there, but I have heard many positive things about the professors and the classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I love how the dorms are centrally located to the most common buildings.  The rooms are small, but most students are polite and seem easy enough to live with."
College Sophomore,4,"The coaches really seem to care, all of them.  They engage with me, even though I am not playing their sport.  Because it is a conservative christian college some athletes struggle with being aggressive and playing hard.  I hope to help inspire other teammates that you can play this way and still be a good witness."
College Freshman,4,"The value of a degree from maloneuniversity is great. A lot of people look at Malone University and see that it is well Christian, liberal arts, private school and they think of world around it students with value and morals. We have a very high graduation rate and our academics and education is very rigorous and prepare students to be the best at what they perceive to be in their careers."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience here so far has been great. The friendshipsnd relationships that I have built here are priceless and lastlonging. Socially and academivally, it is a great place to be. The curriculum here is challenging and prepares you for your career in the best way possible."
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus is in a nice part of town.  Don't venture south of 18th street; it gets real scarey real fast.
College Sophomore,4,Very spiritual atmosphere. Encourage spiritual growth. Some rules are unnecessary and don't allow you to meet members of opposite gender.
College Freshman,4,I love how quiet my dorm is at night. It allows me to get a quality night's sleep and work on homework.
College Sophomore,4,"the professors are excellent and challenge you to think critically. The workload varies depending on the professor and the major. Some are very challenging, some are easier. The class registration process is very simple and generally accessible. Curriculums are applicable and challenging. There are also interesting options for Study Abroad and Service Learning opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,I have very rarely not felt safe on campus. The student body itself and the design of campus make it a very safe place to be. Crime on campus is very low. The safety and security services are accommodating and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Many majors require an internship or some kind of off campus professional experience. The local community values Malone grads. Most majors have very good success rates with their students getting jobs. The career services offered are good, but aren't well advertised so many don't take advantage of them."
College Sophomore,4,High quality courses with professors who challenge you to think critically and deeply. The class sizes are often smaller which promotes discussion and meaningful interaction between the students and with the professor. There are many interesting classes offered at Malone if you can fit them in your schedule. The professors care about their students and are passionate about what they do.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Housing is great. Clean, close to most buildings, good community."
College Sophomore,4,"Workload is difficult but it is worthwhile in the end. I cannot express how expanded my views are on the world. The professors aren't afraid to talk about very real issues like Tinder and sex. Students are exposed to knowledge from all dimensions and aren't receiving a sheltered Christian education. Free peer tutors are available. Popular study spots are the library, barn, and off-campus coffee shops like Starbucks."
College Sophomore,4,Campus security is slow. However I always feel safe. Malone is known for being a safety bubble. If anyone is up to mischief it is normally pranks. I lost my laptop and campus security worked extremely hard to get it back. The top cop even went into work at 4 in the morning to personally address the person that stole it.
College Freshman,4,It was a great experience
College Sophomore,4,The school is such a friendly place with incredible people! There is lots to do off campus and sometimes campus sponsors activities off campus too!
College Junior,4,"My school is essentially one big family. Everyone seems to get along with you, including the professors. The faculty and staff show genuine care for both you and your education experience."
College Sophomore,4,Overall I am pleased with the university I attend.
College Sophomore,4,You know what you're getting into before you agree to come to the school.
College Sophomore,4,Turn in the FASFA form ASAP
College Sophomore,4,Compared to other colleges it is pretty good.
College Freshman,4,The scholarship that helped me out the most was my athletic one for swimming and diving. Financial aid felt like a pain because it is very strict as to how much money you would get based on your family's income instead of what the student makes
College Freshman,4,"There is always a variety of food to choose from. Sometimes it's not always the best, but we do have a great option"
College Freshman,4,The resident hall that I live in is very nice! It is always clean and reminds me of a hotel
College Freshman,4,"They will always figure things out right away. You can't hide anything from them. Malone is very very strict about things. Some people compare Malone to a prison, others like the strictness. Personally I think the visitation hours are too strict"
College Freshman,4,There is little to no actual partying on campus which is great
College Freshman,4,"Sometimes the food in Froggy's is burned, but still good. The smoothies are fantastic! The dining hall options aren't always good, but most of the time they are."
College Freshman,4,Living on campus really helps you settle into college life and really helps it to feel like home away from home. Having your friends close by makes easy to study and gives the social life a lift. I love being able to see everyone when classes are over and I love the closeness to all the classes.
College Junior,4,"It has pretty strict rules. I don't mind them, but some people do. If you're looking for a party school, look elsewhere. No alcohol is allowed on campus, and if you come back drunk and really obnoxious (even if you're of age) you could get written up. Visitation is pretty open, but they're strict about being in the dorms of the opposite sex after hours and will definitely write you up."
College Junior,4,"I didn't have any major problems. But I would say to anyone up for work study, if you get on the waiting list for it keep in touch about where you are on the list. They might not let you know right away if you got it and you could miss out on free money."
College Junior,4,"Housing is great, really close to classes. The housing system is a little hard to get at first but not biggie once you understand it. The RA's are super awesome people and love getting involved with you, but you don't have to be friends if you don't want to. One downside is that dorms with AC are a little more expensive per year, but not a lot."
College Freshman,4,There aren't many dining options on campus but the dining hall tries to make up for that. They have several options to pick from everyday from pasta to sushi. They have a comment board where they respond to what students want and generally fulfill the different wishes of the student. They have a gluten free station and do their best to appeal to everyone. The cafes are basically Starbucks with some small food options. They recently added burgers and other hand foods. It seems like they are trying to make a real effort to constantly improve the food at Malone.
College Senior,4,Good scholarships specially for athletes.
College Senior,4,"Good professors, specially in the business department."
College Senior,4,Safety is always visible around the small campues.
College Junior,4,Christian College - everything safe and boring
Senior,2,"I like that the classes and campus is easy to navigate as it is so small. 
The weather is awful and if you commute can be an issue. 
People seem very superficial and although it is a Christian school I feel as tho the requirement is too much. You need 15 hours of extra spiritual formation hours or you have to write 3 separate 5 page essays. If you do not attend they charge you upwards of 600 dollars on the next semesters tuition. 
Incredibly expensive for such meager facilities. They are in debt and got rid of football and many of the majors this year."
Sophomore,2,"This college is great for some people, but if your mood is heavily effected on visuals such as beauty and weather, avoid this place like the plague. You will be constantly depressed, because nothing outside of the campus is very beautiful. The entire surrounding ohio area I found immensely depressing, keep in mind that this is my personal experience, though, because some people are totally fine and unaffected. I just personally get very depressed without sunlight and nice weather, so this place was bad for me. Make sure to take a look at street view and google earth instead of just looking at pictures of the campus.

Also keep in mind that if you are somebody who gets excited and energized by large groups of people, this campus is definitely not for you. I was depressed by this as I didn't feel a lot of energy or excitement on campus, and on the weekends everyone goes home. It is 85% vacant. Depressing for me. Nice for an introvert, though. Just some things to keep in mind."
Junior,2,"Great professors that will do whatever it takes to help you succeed. Current renovations make the campus attractive to future students and families. Student development will help you find internships and jobs. Departments throughout campus do not communicate efficiently or effectively, and it negatively reflects the students."
Senior,2,"Malone University is a University where you need to know exactly what you are doing to attend. I have changed my major multiple times and have made it very difficult for myself to graduate. On a positive note, I recommend the music program. They have a few teachers that really want to see you do well and to succeed and so far they have all been in the music program. I love the music teachers here at Malone."
College Freshman,2,We have a Greek life I campus but I never heart anything about them and their activities because they are low key. We don't have fraternities or sororities on our campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mostly off campus (Walsh, Mt Union, U/Akron, Kent State, off campus in Canton)"
Recent Alumnus,2,"1.  Limited electives.

2.  Limited coursework within majors.

3.  Very rigid academic policies; most courses are on rigid requirement lists; very few opportunities to explore other areas of interest.

4.  Only college I've ever seen that doesn't have a language department (doesn't even offer Spanish coursework!)

5.  Library is terrible."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Drug scene is very underground because of school policies; but it's there.  This is a no alcohol campus, so people tend to take scrips, etc. since they are harder to detect."
Recent Alumnus,2,Great if u r an athlete; lousy for everyone else.  The jocks get all the attention and resources.
Recent Alumnus,2,"1.  Most professors are more interested in converting you to their religious beliefs rather than the academics.

2.  This campus lacks basic amenities; it's the only campus I've ever seen that lacks a swimmng pool.  Many dorms have no air conditioning and barely functioning heat.

3.  It's a dumb jock school; the cross country runners are treated like royalty; most would flunk out of a state school, but the professors adore the athletes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Awful dorms.  Terrible professors.

2.  Library is too small and very noisy.  It's impossible to find a real librarian; work study students who could care less work at the desk.

3.  Most students here are more interested in finding a future husband / wife than learning anything.

4.  Students are very prejudiced, particularly against gays, liberal ideas, and Catholicism."
College Freshman,2,There are no parties at Malone. If you got away with one I don't know how you did it. Most students go to houses that other students have purchased off-campus. Others go and party at Mount Union University and then go to downtown Akron
College Junior,2,"Malone has fairly strict rules, so there's not really a big party scene. I think there might be if you go looking for it, but it's not a big thing."
College Senior,2,The rules about visitation hours and drinking are very strict
College Senior,2,There are no parties on campus ...
College Senior,2,I believe the school has a lot of growing potential but it is located by a poor zone of the city.
College Junior,2,The school has a huge dept and the students can feel that! Tuition is going through the roof and even with an athletic scholarship it is getting hard to pay for it. At the same time the school is not worth paying so much money for.
College Freshman,2,"We need facilities if we really want to contend in the GLIAC, sports don't even have their own weightroom"
College Freshman,2,"We have an old barn to hang out in, that's it"
College Freshman,2,"You are not treated like an adult living on campus, Malone is more strict then my house."
College Junior,1,There are none on campus.  We choose to focus on other things and activities.
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life on this campus.  We choose not to focus on that kind of extracurricular activities.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not sure if this is intentional or it just happens, but this is a VERY homogeneous campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is forbidden at this school; one of the many problems with Malone.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Senior,1,There is no Greek Life
College Junior,1,Visitation hours(horrible and weird) - I am an international student and I was shocked when I heard about visitation hours. Guys&Girls are not allowed in the others dorms on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you are visiting doors have to be opened at 45 angle and you are not allowed to sit on someones bed with your feet up. I don't even have words to describe that weirdness.
College Junior,1,"We don't party on campus, all off."
College Freshman,1,"I wish we had Greek life at malone, but it would never be aloud due to how strict the school is"
College Freshman,1,Athletes are fired to stay on campus all 4 years
College Sophomore,1,There is always snow. Driving to school is bad.
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife is non-existent since this is a christian college.
College Sophomore,1,"Absolutely no Greek life, or at least what I know of."
College Sophomore,1,"Malone University has a large amount of student athletes attending it, but the facilities that accommodate those athletes are not to what is needed to obtain the greatest results.  We do have an athletic building that holds the weight and cardio rooms, along with all of the coach's offices and a gymnasium.  We do have an outdoor track, but lack an indoor track along with a football stadium.  Swimmers that are on the swim team have to travel every morning and night to get to swim practice, sometimes having to cram everyone in their cars on time to get to practice.  Overall, Malone University is in need of a Recreation Center that accommodates to all the athletes attending MU."
College Senior,1,"No Snow Days – The campus is located at the highest elevation in the city. It is extremely cold during the winter months. Not to mention, there are never any snow days, no matter if everything surrounding campus is closed. Therefore, one can look forward to having days when one will have to walk through weather in which a hand right in front of the face cannot be seen."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Facilites Are Poor – 1.  The library is totally inadequate; limited collection, very noisy inside.

2.  Buildings are generally in poor condition; mostly old, dated 1950s and 60s era, never been updated.  The freshman/underclass dorms are real antiques.  Many buildings lack air conditioning.

3.  The student center is an interesting piece of architecture (a renovated barn), but doesn't have much inside.  Even the game room is pretty lame.

4.  Fine arts facilities are very limited; minimal studio space, limited gallery/exhibition space."
College Senior,1,"First year mens' housing – First year male housing (Penn-Barclay-Gurney) is pretty awful.  The dorms were built in the late 1950s, and I don't think the school has put a nickel into them since then.  No air conditioning, the heat barely works in the winter, and the bathrooms are dirty.  These are probably the most bare bones dorms I've ever seen in my life.  They actually smell funny when you walk in, and the furnishings are ancient and tacky."
College Senior,1,"The library is pretty awful.  It's very noisy, has a limited collection, and it's very difficult to find a reference librarian.  The reference desk tends to be staffed with student workers who usually are useless.  The entire library staff tends to be surely, short, and rude.  The curricular support for my major (English) is pretty limited.  The only bright spot is Canton has a large public library, and will give anyone a card.  The Canton/Stark County library is actually really good."
College Senior,1,"Collection of Dumb Jocks – The teams frequently win, win, win, particularly track and cross country.  Unfortunately, these same dumb jocks also take classes here.  Most of them are real boxes of rocks, and shouldn't even be in college.  They ruin the classroom atmosphere for everyone else.  I honestly don't think many of them would have ever been admitted had they not been able to run, jump, or kick a soccer ball."
College Senior,1,"The department is pretty lame.  Classes tend to be the professors lecturing AT you, expecting you to memorize their words of wisdom.  There isn't a lot of meaningful discussion or interaction.  Library materials to support this department are pretty minimal."

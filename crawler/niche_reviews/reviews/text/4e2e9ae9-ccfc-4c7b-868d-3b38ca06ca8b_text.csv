Sophomore,5,its really good most of the teachers are really responsive and understanding during this time as well as they make the work due dates flexible for students
Alum,5,East Carolina was a great place to get a degree from. I did the online program and enjoyed every class. The professors were helpful and available.  I learned so much about my field and was able to get a job in that field.

Freshman,5,The online learning experience has been the best it can be under the circumstances. They have made the transition as good as it can be.
Freshman,5,It’s a great college and atmosphere to be around! The academics are great and the campus is beautiful!
Alum,5,"I loved going to school at East Carolina University because of the great professors, campus, and college town vibes. It was a great experience and something i will never forget."
Freshman,5,"I am registered to take one class online at East Carolina during the Fall semester and I feel confident that I will do well especially with the professor's instructions and guidance along with the help of study groups.  I can attest that the university in general seem to be forthcoming with information; hence, can only believe it would be the same with the online learning experience."
Freshman,5,"I am a new student to East Carolina University, and I will enter as a Freshman in the Fall.  Thus far I am impressed with the university ranging from the initial campus visit, the enrollment process, to the way they have kept me informed since my application has been accepted, to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, class assignments and to my recent move into the dorm, which in itself was positive.  There were staff on hand who were extremely helpful and accommodating, allowing adequate time for me to set up my room, and provided directions as needed.  From my very first visit to East Carolina and more so now that I am “Pirate Bound” I sense that this will be a favorable and rewarding journey for me.  Overall, I rate my experience with East Carolina University on a high scale and I cannot wait to experience all there is to see and do on campus."
Junior,5,My online classes have been very interactive in terms of campus and community involvement. The few that I have taken have been challenging but very knowledgeable and I definitely enjoyed them more than some of my in person classes. The teachers were also much more accessible.
Junior,5,"From my acceptance to East Carolina to currently entering my junior year, I have had the opportunity to grow as an individual, and as a future educator with the support of my peers and campus organizations. I have actively pursued service experiences on campus or in the community, as well as participating in donation events to provide for students in Pitt County schools."
Junior,5,"I think that being transitioned into an online academic learning experience was a very uncharted territory, but East Carolina University made the most of it! Educators were supportive at every turn, and we had ample opportunities for adaptive course requirements to respond to varied student needs and capabilities during the pandemic."
Freshman,5,I have loved everything about EAST CAROLINA ever since my parents first brought me.  I think I was a toddler.  The atmosphere of the pirate community is the BEST!
Freshman,5,I haven't take an actual class online but all of our orientation and registration has been online and it has been GREAT!
Sophomore,5,"I have never taken any classes online at East Carolina, but when, it comes to using pirate portal online to register for classes, deal with financial aid, and anything of that nature they are spot on. East Carolina is a great school and I would recommend them to anybody!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at East Carolina University has been nothing short of fantastic! From attending classes with the best professors the world has to offer to screaming ""living on a prayer"" at Dowdy Ficklen Stadium when we cheer on the Pirates during football games, I love every bit of it. Student life is fantastic, there are lots of clubs, fraternities/sororities, and many other student organizations for students to participate in. East Carolina is very diverse and there is a lot of opportunity to succeed there. There are lots of different options for majors at East Carolina like medical, dentistry, construction management, and so many more. East Carolina is a great to place to be and my favorite place to be!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall it’s a fun time, I have no complaints. It’s one of the best choices of my life. I made so many friends and can’t wait for next year"
Junior,5,I normally am not one to take online but when I have in the past it has not been as bad as I thought it would be.
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. The professors are all amazing and they really care about their students. I feel very welcomed and at home when I am away from home.
Junior,5,The teachers maw a lot of accommodations to students during online learning. They have made a lot of adjustments to their own curriculum which helps all students.
Freshman,5,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my spring 2020 classes were moved online. The professors handled it incredibly well. I believe that I did not miss out on any educational experiences. The online lab simulations and instruction allowed me to still walk away from the classing feeling confident about my mastery of the material. The communication of professors through online learning is consistent and valuable. Although they lack a face to face classroom environment, all of my professors made individual assistance available and continued to arrange office hours. Thanks to this experience, I plan on taking more online courses in the future to work towards my minor due to their functionality and the success I have had with them."
Junior,5,ECU tried its best to be as accommodating and inclusive as it can be with all students. Staff are very supportive and resourceful and professors really want their students to do well in their classes
Sophomore,5,"I was forced to finish classes online due to the corona virus. It wasn’t easy, but I feel like the professors were understanding and helped in the ways they could!"
Junior,5,East Carolina is an amazing School with many different opportunities. The very first time I was on campus I knew this was the place I should be. The professors and the staff are tremendously helpful and caring.
Graduate Student,5,Great school where the professors and assistants do care about their students. Great community and diverse group of people.
Niche User,5,"Great choice. Lots of majors. Big healthcare school - medicine, dentistry, nursing, therapy. Very loyal alumni."
Senior,5,"The environment and school spirit of this school is outstanding. Everyone truly bleeds purple. The professors are extremely supportive and due to the university size you are still able to make good relations with your professors. The university provides countless opportunities for you to get involved in activities and career opportunities. They are also constantly growing and improving things on campus including the library, dorm rooms, new learning and study areas and safety on campus. Coming from this school and applying for jobs I have a good reputation on my back with the degree from this University. Once a pirate always a pirate."
Freshman,5,East Carolina has brought an outstanding amount of opportunities as well as scholarships into my college career.
Niche User,5,"East Carolina University took my breath away from the moment that I stepped onto the campus. I knew that it would be my home for the next 4 years. My face lit up the second that I saw the students glowing faces tour the campus. I saw the teachers faces, guiding the students happily throughout the campus. I felt the warm rays of sun beat against my face and the wind brush my body. This was the place for me. Amazing food and restaurants everywhere that I glanced. I smelt the spring air as I toured for the first time last April. My heart beat out of my chest  as I realized that this would be the place I called home. I saw hundreds of classrooms, ready for me to start learning in. I loved the way that the football field lit up as the sun set that night. I heard the crowd abruptly applaud as the ECU pirates had scored a touchdown. I loved every moment of it. I still can't believe that this is my home."
Sophomore,5,"I just transferred here, but I immediately found a sense of home and love the people here so much more than my previous institution. The nursing program is very competitive and the academics are great. Don’t listen to the reputation of it being a party school, because the academics are important too!"
Freshman,5,"From the dozens and dozens of colleges I have seen during my search, Eastern Carolina was by far the most beautiful, most friendly campus I have seen. From the helpful staff to the helpful and advocating student body, I knew from the start that ECU was going to be the school for me."
Niche User,5,"I enjoy how much the university reaches out to me even when I don't ask for help. I really feel like they want me to attend their school unlike a lot of other schools that I had applied to, such as Clemson and University of South Carolina."
Freshman,5,"The campus is really pretty, it has football, and the people are really friendly. Everything is easy to get to, and there are food places to eat on and off campus. Tailgating on Saturdays is really fun."
Niche User,5,I will be starting my first semester in the fall but attended all the events for ECU. The professors seem very knowledgeable and kind. The dorms are nice and very clean with s very pleasant vibe to them. I love the modernness of the campus and how active everyone is in supporting their community. There are so many opportunities in this college and events to participate in. There are also a lot of great resources that students can use! So far I do not have any concerns or things that I think should be changed. I can’t wait to be apart of it.
Alum,5,Awesome university; Mom is an alum who swam for the Swim team 4 years.  Its always been my dream to attend this university
Junior,5,I love the relationship the professors try to have with their students. They try to keep the relationship on a level where you feel like you can email them at any moment for help.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus.  It felt like it was a city within a city and the fact that it is close to a major city is really convenient.  They offer a business program which is my major.  There seem to be a lot of extracurriculars that you can get involved in.  The school is within driving distance to family in NC.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to ECU after graduating high school in May with my Associates in Arts along with my high school diploma and I absolutely love it. Ive made connections within the College of Education, I've met amazing people, and I have had amazing professors and advisors in y first and second semester. I am excited to begin the process of diving into studying history education and I couldn't have picked a better school than ECU to complete my degree at."
Freshman,5,East Carolina University is a place for everyone. ECU feels like home and is a great place to stand out and prosper. If you are looking for opportunity and for faculty and students to bond with ECU is the place for you.
Sophomore,5,"As a student at East Carolina University, I have enjoyed being here so much. So far, I have really enjoyed the gorgeous campus, the great dining options, the professors have been wonderful, and so much more. I am part of a few student organizations and they have given me so many wonderful opportunities and great people to meet along the way. East Carolina University also has a fantastic Nursing program. We are highly ranked in the national list of nursing schools as well! I cannot wait to see what other opportunities I will get being a student at such an amazing university."
Freshman,5,"East Carolina University was the only college that made me feel welcomed and connected since the application process. I went to C.A.M.P. Pirate which is a summer camp that helps you with the transition. I've also joined two clubs (SAB films and LSU) which are great to meet friends with the same interest as you. One of the best things in ECU is how everything is united and together which makes it a great community to be for four or more years of your life. One thing ECU should improve on is safety, there have been a few crimes on campus."
Sophomore,5,"East Carolina has been very good to me, both in and out of the classroom. My experiences with last a lifetime."
Alum,5,"Great University with an great athletic program.  ECU has inexpensive tuition compared to a lot of other universities. ECU is known for their Medical, Hospitality, Criminal Justice, Arts and Humanities, as well Teaching programs."
Sophomore,5,I love East Carolina University for a number of reasons. I first fell in love with the community surrounding the campus as well as the variety of majors offered. The staff are knowledgable and are looking to help you succeed in whatever it is you may want to achieve.
Freshman,5,"I was a little nervous when I came to ECU. But little did I know I would find my second home. The campus is beautiful, the professors are kind and are willing to help you outside of office hours. Despite the tales ECU isn't just a party school. You'll find plenty of hard working people all trying to achieve their goals."
Freshman,5,"I love ECU because it feels like home. Instantly I felt supported from my team of advisors and now all of my new friends, everyone becomes a huge family. Also the school spirt is unbeatable! We have Pirate Pride!"
Freshman,5,"I am a first year student here but even so, I am thoroughly enjoying my time here. they offer help along the entire experience and show you how to get to where you need to be."
Freshman,5,The Diversity of the Campus allows for lots of friends to be made. The teachers are always patient leading to a more one on one experience with teachers.
Freshman,5,East Carolina University is a wonderful school filled with amazing staff and students! The campus is absolutely stunning. There is so much energy and love for the school! The amenities are great! If you are looking for a great college experience I would consider ECU! Go Pirates!
Junior,5,"ECU is my first university outside my hometown and it is an amazing experience. I love how the campus is so well kept and beautiful. The professors seem to be exited about you learning their subjects and what you to succeed in your classes. They offer help if you need it and even tell you where the tutoring center is so that you can get help there to. I have made many friends here and I hope to make more. East Carolina has been really good to me so far that I convinced my other siblings to come here as well. I hope to learn a lot at this campus and have fun to. I never knew that people could be so nice here, but they are. I cannot wait to continue my time here and explore more of the campus."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely adore ECU! The campus is gorgeous, the academics are rigorous, and everyone's incredibly nice! It's a big place with 29,000 students and I thought I would feel alone, but I actually feel right at home! Despite the party school reputation, this is a great place to attend!"
Freshman,5,"East Carolina University has an amazing campus with a great stuff and student body that makes you feel welcome and comfortable, it is located in a nice small town with a fantastic community that shows continuous support to anyone that needs it."
Senior,5,"Overall, ECU is a great school. I liked how the professors made themselves available at the students' convenience to help with any questions. The classes were average for the most part. I liked the campus and its layout; however, the school could use more buses. There's not much parking available, so it should be improved with more parking lots. In addition, the meal plans are very expensive, so it's better for me to live off campus. Athletics is a very large part of ECU. Attendance is always good at the football games, but the coaching needs to be improved a we win very few games. Some degrees should not be offered such as health and fitness, which is my major. I did finish my degree, and am now reapplying for ECU to get my BSN."
Junior,5,"East Carolina University offers a diverse, hands-on college experience that is well reciprocated with the students on campus!"
Niche User,5,Very nice campus. I thought it felt like home because of the atmosphere. I hope to one day become a Pirate Nurse!
Niche User,5,"I have two words to describe my trip to East Carolina University. The environment seemed so bright and alive between the students and individuals on campus. Everyone did a great job of making me feel comfortable. They allowed me to relax and just be me. The students located in the dorms gave off a feeling of one big family, connected by one hope and dream of graduating. That is why they are number one on my list of colleges to attend."
Graduate Student,5,So far I think its great and the campus has beautiful high tech buildings. The teachers seem great so far and very supportive! I am a first year graduate student and so far so good :)
Senior,5,East Carolina University has a great and welcoming atmosphere. I have never had a bad experience with professors or staff at ECU.
Freshman,5,"Personally, I love East Carolina Universtiy! The atmosphere is great and the staff is simply amazing. They are kind and caring. The campus building is so big and there is always plenty to do. There are plenty of students at East Carolina University so making friends shouldn’t be much of a problem. There are also plenty of clubs and sports to help you fit in and find your hobby and passion. I truly am looking forward to spending these next four years at East Carolina University!!"
Junior,5,I sincerely enjoy attending East Carolina University! They have many majors to pick from and a ton of help from advisors. The professors have been amazing so far. The classes aren't too hard but you have to work hard too pass.
Freshman,5,"East Carolina has the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. Not only is the campus magnificently built but it’s also put to use. The academics aren’t always easy but when they aren’t, professors reach out to students and get them the help they needed. The campus has research center and study centers where you can go get free tutoring and all the help that you need."
Sophomore,4,It's my dream college its so large and in a semi quiet area  and the workers and students are really nice
Freshman,4,"East Carolina has a very nice campus, good professors, tons of resources to help you with your studies, and is overall just a great atmosphere to be in."
Freshman,4,Doing school online has been very successful so far and professors have been very helpful in helping us adjust to it all.
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online and they were great as far as structure goes. However, i did not enjoy online classes because i found them difficult for me to pay attention and stay motivated in. I found the professors helpful though and should i have had a different mentality back then, i more than likely would have succeeded."
Senior,4,"I overall really liked ECU. I transferred here from Emory University after experiencing an awful sophomore year there. The students and professors at ECU were way kinder, more considerate, and very approachable. If you are someone who grew up expecting certain levels of common curtesy, everyone at ECU has it. I no longer get doors slammed in my face like I did at Emory! Everyone on campus also seems overall much happier!"
Senior,4,"All of the professors really care and try to teach you as well as they possibly can online. My only complaint was that one professor took it as an opportunity to nearly triple learning time, but other than that it was a wonderful experience and I really feel like I still learned a lot!"
Senior,4,I love that the whole city revolves around the campus life. There are a wide variety of majors and decent teachers. The campus is growing and so is the city around it.
Senior,4,I hate online classes but the teachers are very understanding and will work with you to make sure you don't fall behind
Junior,4,I would like to see a change within some of the staff (especially in the student health building) to be more endearing and want to create more of a connection with students.
Junior,4,"ECU offers so many great opportunities for all types of students with all kinds of interests. There is simply something for everyone! The education is fantastic. The College of Nursing is very challenging, but it is part of what makes a pirate nurse so great! Everyone is so proud to be a pirate!"
Sophomore,4,East Carolina is filled with diversity and opportunity. There are multiple resources for student life and engagement.
Sophomore,4,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, all of my classes were directed online. This was a scare at first, however, as one of North Carolina's number one rated online schools, ECU did not disappoint in the delivery of course materials and education."
Sophomore,4,"East Carolina is a very comfortable and inviting campus, even for a student out of state, like me. It is not a huge campus so its easy to navigate campus even with the immense amount of students who attend the school. I do believe that East Carolina University should be less prejudice towards people of color. Due to where many of the students were raised or who they were raised by, many can be very rude and racist towards others on campus. Also, parking at East Carolina University for students and guests, can be identified as a mess. There are not enough spots close enough to campus for students to drive somewhere near campus he campus."
Sophomore,4,"I did not have much of an online experience till quarantine. So I cant respond with a distinctive answer. I can say, Covid hit very quickly which made me initially think the classes that were once in person, would be a mess online, but they were actually very organized and easy to acquire the knowledge I needed from those classes."
Sophomore,4,"Professors were very relaxed, and gave those who where not as accustomed time to get in a routine. Love pd my first year!"
Junior,4,I like the community of East Carolina University. You truly feel like you are apart of something whenever you’re on or near campus. They have a problem with diverse teachers. As an art student there is only one black art teacher in the whole art curriculum. He’s the only black teacher I’ve ever had at ECU. I think that’s a huge problem.
Freshman,4,"East Carolina University has provided me with so many opportunities just in my first year. The campus is beautiful and a great place for young adults to create healthy routines and habits for their new independence. The amenities of the campus, such as Joyner Library and the Student Rec Center, really allow students to excel. Personally, I have found the Jenkins Fine Arts Center as my creative getaway where I can create exceptional work thanks to the facility. The faculty have proven themselves to all truthfully care about the students. Not only are they always willing to provide further assistance for students in their class, but they also are so dedicated to helping them pursue a successful adulthood and career. I have encountered professors willing to meet after hours to review material as well as having helpful and personal conversations about things such as mental health and finances. I am incredibly grateful for my opportunity to pursue my degrees and my future career at ECU."
Junior,4,The professors were very engaged with the students and made sure everyone was able to complete the assignments even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Junior,4,I took medical terminology online and it was a smooth and easy processes. The professor for the class was very engaging and was there whenever I needed help or guidance.
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience at this University.  Plenty of student resources and student involvement opportunities.  Many of the professors do care for your academic journey and  are willing to give extra help if needed.
Sophomore,4,It took time to adjust! I’m glad I found my friends and it wouldn’t have been possible without ECU!!
Freshman,4,"Although ECU is quite large (in numbers) it has a great small school and town feel, which I grew up with going back to my parents alma maters. I enjoyed ECU's football atmosphere during the fall. I hate that I didn't get to experience the baseball games this spring now that we're all doing online classes due to the COVID-19 situation. While I loved being on College Hill, living in Legacy Hall was a bit of a stretch. It was honestly just old and quite gross, but I enjoyed my time with my roommate which made it more bearable. Lastly, but most importantly, I enjoyed the campus and my classes- and with it being my first semester was pleased that I made all As and Bs."
Freshman,4,Things at ecu are amazing as an art student and an athlete i get the best of both worlds. I love the campus and everyone that works there i rarely have a bad experience. The only issue i have is with the cost of on campus housing as its the cost off a studio apartment in downtown and the dorms are super small.
Sophomore,4,"Big school with a small school feel.  Professors have been very helpful, available, supportive and knowledgeable.  Endless choices for connecting and getting involved.   Love ECU!"
Niche User,4,ECU has a nice campus and nice professors. The clarinet professor is especially nice and gives me lessons so I can get into ECU and get the most scholarship money I can.
Senior,4,"I have really loved my time here at ECU. I only give it four stars because I love my Latino community and I wish people were more involved, but overall this school has brought me a lot of happiness and good friends."
Sophomore,4,"Just getting back to classes after the new year and things are great.  I have a great apartment right across the street from campus.  Getting around is fairly simple, though if you have to pay for a parking pass it will be a tad expensive, $400+.  Meal plans are wonderful, and the food choices are excellent.  Facility is very helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Very good so far, very few complaints, nice people, nice environment, overall good school with good professors"
Freshman,4,There is so much to do on campus.  The campus is class to uptown so you have access to all the social scenes and restaurants.
Senior,4,I really enjoyed the university and how it has helped me to grow as a person. Going through these last 5 years at ECU; it has taught me how to rely on myself when struggling to do well on finals or to be able to support myself.
Freshman,4,I just finished my first semester at ECU and I loved it! All of my professors were wonderful and the campus is absolutely beautiful!
Freshman,4,I love the open environment that ensures everyone has a place to be successful and thrive. I love that a lot of the Major based classes are smaller and hands-on so one can truly see themselves being in the career.
Sophomore,4,"East Carolina University is a friendly, welcoming environment.  There are plenty of possibilities for students to become involved, including: clubs, sports, organizations, communities, events, and other opportunities.  The campus is safe, secure, and protected.  There are also two main portions of campus to chose to live at: West End, which is located by downtown Greenville, and College Hill, which is located near the baseball and football stadiums.  There is a wide diversity of students attending the university, and all students are inviting."
Freshman,4,I am a Freshman here at ECU an my experience has been pretty good since I've been here. Most of the people are very nice and easy to talk to. And being independent has taught me so much over the last couple of months.
Freshman,4,"Great school, beautiful landscape, and the school offers so much. tutoring, writing center, gym, massage chairs, movies all included with tuition. Professors are ok :/ could be a lot better. If you want a nice dorm clement, Greene, and white are way to go."
Freshman,4,"I am on the Cheerleading team here, am very involved with the community and student life and have loved my first year at ECU and would love to continue my education here!"
Sophomore,4,"I am only a sophomore at East Carolina University, but I can still say that I am head over heels for my college. I am definitely a pirate at heart. I think what drew me most towards ECU was the campus as well as the wide variety of majors. ECU has opened various windows of opportunity for me that I never knew would happen. I was able to get a job through our gym on campus. I work through the Adventure Leadership Program and could not be happier with the position that I am in now. I also picked up on a sport. I play for ECU's women's ultimate and love it! I would recommend coming to ECU, whether that be for a tour or for the next four years!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the soul of the school.  You feel like you are rooted in southern tradition, yet you are surrounded by ever-changing technology and academics.  Overall, my academics have been challenging and quality.  The faculty makes every student feel at home and always are available to help.  I've found that the Honors College at ECU is very helpful and I'd recommend applying to it to those who are currently seniors.  East Carolina University is working on healing from its party school reputation, and there are always other things to do on and off campus."
Freshman,4,"I am a current student at ECU from out of state. Niche is incorrect about some things such as the student body (its actually 28,000) and some more. ECU is awesome and the academics are way higher than it gets credit for. Most but not all professors care about their students. Greek life isn't as shitty as everyone says it is but it is hostile and there are lots of rivalries, plus most the frats are kicked off and there are only like 3 good ones right now. all in all i love it here and its so fun."
Freshman,4,East Carolina University is a pretty cheap school compared to other universities in North Carolina. We have a bad reputation for partying but overall it’s not that bad and we have a decent graduation percentage. I love it here it’s work the price I’m paying!
Niche User,4,"I liked the campus. It was big and beautiful, exactly what I’m looking for in a university. I really like that there’s a variety of food options, a gym, and a swimming pool. I also liked the tour guides and staff members. They were really nice and answered all my questions. I loved it so much!"
Alum,4,"I was not a typical 18,19 year old going to college. I was 24 and transferred to East Carolina during my sophomore year. While there, I took part in many student activity boards, joined a sorority and served for a year on the Chancellor's Leadership Academy Board. East Carolina is very invested on making student life a positive experience.  I would say the part I did not like at the time was there was not much to do off campus for students. The downtown area was not a good place to be after certain times and unless you wanted to go to a party somewhere, there was not much to do. Luckily, I worked the entire time I was attending school because I had rent and other bills to pay. Since that time, I have been back to visit and the down town area has been completely reconstructed. Overall, East Carolina University will always be my second home and I will forever be a pirate."
Junior,4,I do distance education so I am not physically there and live about 3 hours away. The professors work with me and make sure that DE students get the same education as the people who are physically there.
Senior,4,"East Carolina is an excellent option for a public university. The campus is beautiful, the professors are challenging but kind, there’s always a party, and there are so many clubs and organizations that it would be hard not to be involved. My only complaint: I wish there were more healthier restaurants to choose from on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I like how big the campus is and how the school puts on activates for us to do. I would change the food, not my favorite thing about college."
Niche User,4,"I am not a student at East Carolina yet, but the program is amazing. I have grown up a pirate because of my parents and already feel apart of the family."
Junior,4,"I’m excited, actually transferring in. To be closer to family, challenging myself by working and remaining a full time college student. It’s going to be something! But I’m ready for this next step."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at ECU was great! I just believe some of the curriculum is much harder than other schools of the same degree. The professors are good, mostly average but it helps that the campus is great and not too big. They have bus transportation which is extremely helpful on days where its super hot out which is most of the beginning of fall semester and the end of spring semester."
Sophomore,4,The public health department is really good and all the professors are willing to help if you ask. Some dorms are really nice in comparison to others. There is not much to do around campus.
Senior,4,"My major is Musical Theatre. The Theatre department is a small family that is somewhat part of the university, but also very isolated. My professors care for me on a personal level and want me to succeed, but also push me to do my best. I am very happy with my college decision. ECU is a beautiful campus with many amenities, and the meal plan is amazing."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at ECU is going great. I love it here: the atmosphere, the scenery, and just the organization of our school. They keep us up to date on events going  on around campus. Our advisers give the best advice when it comes to helping us pick classes and also give great life advice to. Our teachers are understanding and want to see us succeed. They are willing to cut time out of their day just to make sure we're fine. The community is very free and open. There is a multitude of clubs and organizations to join here. I made so many friends in RUF which is the club I'm in. They're like my family in way. ECU is an awesome place I hope more people come to our school."
Alum,4,"Campus life is amazing! Greenville isn't much of a fun place to live, which is one thing that impacts people."
Senior,4,"ECU is known as a party school but I have enjoyed the educational programs that they have. Its a wonderful school with a lot of school spirit. The location isn't in the greatest town, but the school makes up for that. I have met wonderful students and teachers here. I would recommend people attend school here."
Junior,4,"East Carolina University is a great school for kids who want to have the total college experience. East Carolina has the privilege of a vast town with many options to do almost anything! The academics are hard, regardless of the acceptance rate, and I discovered it was easier to get into ECU than stay at the school. The school spirit is definitely a marvel, you will always be able to hear someone shout ""PURPLE!"" and a returning ""GOLD!"". Since my first day at East Carolina, I have fallen in love with the vibrant and studious atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the campus is gorgeous, especially when it's sunny out. In terms of education, just because it's known to be a party school, ECU can be really tough depending on the professor that teaches your classes. The student life is lively as partying starts on Thursday nights; however, when finals/exams seasons come around, you'll definitely see students studying hard and helping others. It's diverse, but the dorm/housing throughout campus kind of lacks diversity. The surrounding area of the campus isn't the best, but it's not awful. The food is decent in the dining halls, but the student center has other better meal options. In terms of safety, this may have been said multiple times, but it's always crucial to take precautions such as walking in groups and having a buddy system for bathrooms and covering your drink when you're not drinking; the party scene can be a little wild sometimes. And use SafeRide! I hope this helped anyone!"
Senior,4,It is fun tobhe at ECU great nightlife but nothing else to do. Just know what you want to do before you come here because it is hard to find out what ECU offers.
Sophomore,4,"The people are honestly so amazing and I have learned so much not only through school, but through the new experiences that ECU has provided me with."
Junior,4,"I live in Greenville, NC. So my choice really had to be ECU because of 1) Price and 2) the location. I am able to live at home so I have no dorm or food costs associated with ECU. This saves me time and money. I transferred from Pitt Community College. I really like the art department at ECU. It's a great feeling when the professors recognize your work and accomplishments."
Freshman,4,"East Carolina is very good at getting students involved and making it feel like home. The academics are great depending on the major, I would like to see an improvement  in other departments besides the sciences."
Alum,4,Enjoyed ECU experience. A large amount of construction happening throughout my four years causing frustration and a lack of certain services.
College Sophomore,2,Most teachers do what they can to help  you.
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately, I am constantly receiving emails/text messages from campus public safety about crimes occurring (especially on weekends) but I think it's because campus is in the middle of the city so just be careful at night."
College Freshman,2,Only the suites and Gateway are nice to live in. Many of the dorms are old and need to be updated. The rooms are also very small in size.
College Sophomore,2,"Every room is tiny unless you live on West End or in the new Gateway dorms, but Gateway is reserved for smart people"
College Sophomore,2,I am not a big fan of Jones Hall. It is not very spacey and the communal bathrooms are awful.
College Sophomore,2,"East Carolina is obviously known as a party school. Therefore, it is fun and you can always find a party. Unfortunately, this does not help you in life at all and actually puts you at a disadvantage. Employers look down upon ECU. Going to a party school doesn't mean it's a good college. The classes were low quality and were honestly easier than my high school classes.  No one took education seriously, including the professors. This school is for people who aren't smart enough to get in anywhere else and just want to party or just don't care about going to a good or even decent school. I wish I had realized this sooner but thankfully I am transferring. I did have a lot of fun at ECU but the education part was just horrible. If you are serious about your education DO NOT GO HERE (unless you're a nursing major because ECU has a very good nursing program)."
College Student,2,You have to do crazy things to get into fraternities.
College Freshman,2,Way too many attacks on women & underage drinking
College Freshman,2,"West End Dining Hall is the worst.  The food is always the same and it's very blah.  Except for fried chicken Wednesdays, of course!"
College Freshman,2,i need more financial aid
College Freshman,2,It was bad because they told me they ran out of money before getting to me.
College Freshman,2,Off campus dining is not awful although a lot of the options close to campus can be too expensive for a full time student. Jimmy Johns and Mcdonald's are the best bet for a student trying to save money on food.
College Freshman,2,"There are several options on campus which allows student to get a break from dining hall food. The dining hall is subpar compared to other universities. The options are always the same, gross tasting options. The food is also prepared in a very unsanitary manor."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very spread out. RAs avoid getting to know students in their dorm. If you live on college hill it is very difficult to get to classes on the other side of campus early in the morning. Most dorm rooms are very small, and in some cases loo like prison cells."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do in Greenville. You can make the best out of the small mall or small shopping centers.
College Freshman,2,It can be hard to get the financial aid you may need directly from the school but there are other options out there that are available.
College Freshman,2,"No variety, not very high quality. Nothing is really terrible, but nothing is really good either."
College Junior,2,The buildings are old and not well kept. It's very close to the classes though.
College Senior,2,"Maybe my answer is biased because I am not a fan of Greek life. I do not have experience with Greeks on other campuses but the Greeks here love to segregate themselves from everyone to feel extra special. In my experience more than half of the Greeks, both men and women, are very snobby and do not like to associate with non Greeks. There are a handful of Greeks that I am friends with but many of those students are involved in much less serious Greek organizations."
College Sophomore,2,"RA's are strict. You will get caught trying to smoke in the dorms, along with too much noise. There will be check ins from the RAs."
College Sophomore,2,"At night, never walk anywhere alone. There is a lot of crime, mostly that of people who walk alone and get jumped off campus. The grid and downtown are the most dangerous to walk alone at night."
College Sophomore,2,"Being that ECU is a Public university, very little financial aid is given, especially if you are from New York like me."
College Freshman,2,its hard to find a spot and for games some have to move their cars even though it is the right lot to park in.
College Sophomore,2,I had a hard time getting my finical aid. It took them almost 2 months after school began to award me. I had to borrow money from a family friend to pay for tuition and housing until I was awarded.
College Freshman,2,"At least half of the men and women I see on campus are a part of fraternities and sororities. Fraternity men are usually the bro-type, and sorority women travel in packs and are usually obnoxious and gross. To be quite honest, all of them look and sound the same. Its either you're whitewashed to the point of no return or just ratchet. Or a mix of both. A large majority of the student body goes to the gym and eats salad religiously. There are a select few people whom are great - you just have to sift through crowds to find them."
College Freshman,2,"I feel as though ECU pays too much attention to things that don't really matter. RA's don't really pay attention to whether or not anyone is being overly loud, drunk, or high. Everything is lenient, but to the point where it makes certain things hard to enjoy - especially sleeping at night."
College Junior,2,It's a hassle but once it's done it's worth it
College Junior,2,"We need better light-bulbs on our campus and more campus lights. And why is our campus metered parking have no lights??? 

Safety first."
College Sophomore,2,The classes for nursing majors are extremely hard.
College Sophomore,2,Off campus housing is very expensive if you have to pay out of pocket.
College Sophomore,2,"Greenville is so bad for break ins and robberies, I am terrified to go out at night."
College Freshman,2,People at my school use drugs but it is not too noticeable. They do it behind closed doors but it is known.
College Freshman,2,"I've never received any form of financial aid, and I need financial aid."
College Freshman,2,they don't give that many scholarships to freshman
College Freshman,2,This weather is so BIPOLAR. One day it is so hot and the next it is snowing.
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do off campus.  I assume that's why so many people go to the club. That is the only thing to do for fun around here.
College Sophomore,2,They do anything to keep their money.
College Freshman,2,Alcohol is very big at this school and it is very obvious. 
College Senior,2,"In my program, Hispanic Studies, the workload is rigorous and teachers do not recognize talent. ""Talent"" is based off of academic performance, grades, and GPA, when in reality it should be based off of potential. Some students in my program earn good grades in their Spanish classes, but do not express a commitment to wanting to learn Spanish/be bilingual, nor are they experienced writers/speakers in the target language because teachers only weigh a small percentage on grammar, pronunciation, conversation and the practical part of the learning a second language. For example, with advisory approval and study abroad experience, a 1001-1004 level or Spanish minor may be able to take 3000+ level class with students who are way more advanced. This is difficult because the teacher has to grade each student according to their level, so their are discrepancies with the grading system/gpa/academic performance system because it doesn't take into account ""potential"" or actual ""skill,"" only numbers.  

This may vary with different departments. "
College Senior,2,"Hardly any spaces, too many tickets given out for parking, not enough space, and parking is cramped. "
College Freshman,2,The Greenville cops are only out to give drinking tickets and speeding tickets. They waste their time on students instead of trying to catch sex offenders or murderers.
College Freshman,2,"Greeks don't seem to want to associate themselves with anyone who isn't in Greek life. If non-Greek students attend Greek events, the members of Greek life seem unhappy about it."
Recent Alumnus,2,"not very diverse, black and white with a lot of racial tension based on the unequal distribution of wealth."
Recent Alumnus,2,it's downright dangerous in places.
Recent Alumnus,2,"i don't really know, i'm a distance education student."
Recent Alumnus,2,"i almost quit due to Ms. Julia Morrow, director of the clinical internship site in the SLP department.

she has made life miserable for myself and several of the other students in the program for two years."
Recent Alumnus,2,"i don't really know, i'm a distance education student."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not drink or do drugs and so I rarely go downtown because I feel so awkward when I do because everyone there is so drunk. I do not usually see drugs being used at parties, but I have definitely heard of them being used or noticed people who seem to be under the influence of something."
College Sophomore,2,Never lived on campus but friends that I knew hated it.
College Senior,2,There is defiantly not enough scholarship money to go around.
College Junior,2,"A great deal of the problem at my school is the dining halls. We have Chic-fil-A, Chili's, Panda Express, Subway, and many other small restaurants on campus that are always overflowing with people not because its their favorite food, but because its the best they can get on campus. Dining hall food is hardly ever even tasty, and they have little to no healthy food options besides a salad bar and bowl of fresh fruit to choose from. I chose not to have a meal plan this year because it would be more cheap and healthy to just cook for myself, even though its much less convenient. "
College Junior,2,"I personally don't have a parking permit because I think its much more convenient to pay a little bit extra to live as close to campus as possible. That way, I never have to worry about needing to get to campus. Parking passes are so expensive, and the university tends to oversell them. Even if you pay a coupe hundred dollars for a pass, there is no guarantee that a spot will be there if you need it. "
College Freshman,2,It's not my type of atmosphere
College Freshman,2,"If there was a bigger student center, or library, more students would have access to more computers."
College Freshman,2,"It's boring, but not on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,Ugh it changes so fast...in the morning you're in sandals and in the afternoon you're sportin rain boots.
College Sophomore,2,It could have been better.
College Freshman,2,Do not have wifi I room- very frustrating. Need own computer
College Freshman,2,I don't like the area or the people- I wouldn't go here if I chose again. 
College Freshman,2,The prices of off campus living is very expensive but you have to live off campus sophomore and up because so many freshman come
Niche User,1,"East Carolin University is a system with one thing in mind, money. The well being of their students is of little importance to them. Struggling with depression and anxiety only increased once I attended ECU. ECU'S solution to my mental health problem was to kick me out of my dorm, ban me from half of campus ( because my panic attacks made me a danger to the so called ""community"") and have me involuntarily committed to the hospital. ECU did not care about helping my mental health, I was just a problem the university was trying to get rid of. Even after withdrawing from ECU to focus on my mental health, ecu still has a hold on my account(making it impossible for me to get my transcript and enroll in another university) all for the reason that I refused to go and speak to their counselors. The same counselors who had me committed and made my depression worse. I was not suicidal until ecu stuck its head where it did not belong and had me commited."
Senior,1,"If your planning to attend the Athletic Training Program at this school....DONT attend this school, find another school.  If you have any self esteem you won't have any left by the time you finish this program.  The director of the program doesn't treat students with respect and will embarrass, humiliate, and make you feel as if you are worthless.  She makes assumptions and no matter what you tell her the only opinion thats right is her's even if your right.  She doesn't follow her own rules and regulations and if she doesn't like how you look she will force you to change it...your hair, beard etc.  Your always on edge/fearful and stressed out due to not knowing what to expect.  If you miss a mtg or do something she doesn't like there will be consequences.  She embarrasses students in front of other students/staff.  This could be a great program but the director ruins it!"
College Sophomore,1,I personally don't like our greek life. Its not for me. The greeks come across and rude and snobby. They aren't accepting of you if you're not in a sorority or fraternity.
College Freshman,1,"Ecu is terrible at providing rides/transportation. I am in fact an international without a car studying nursing. So many times have go to Brody school of nursing on Saturdays yet ECU provides no rides, and many times do not care how you get there."
College Junior,1,Everyone here is trashy and has no sense of morals.  They don't care about anyone but themselves and the school in general doesn't care about the students
College Freshman,1,"This place is a joke. Everyone is so rude and unless you're a part of a fraternity or sorority, you basically don't matter. The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. I had to send my transcript three times for them to even get it. Also, they somehow managed to lose my financial aid forms. My advisor is terrible. She will seriously not help with ANYTHING. I literally get a text every week about a robbery or some other crime around campus and I'm sure there's more they're not telling us about. Parking is a nightmare! I park over a mile from campus and have to take a bus basically every time I want to go anywhere. The campus is okay but at night is not well light and pretty sketchy. The biggest problem is the people here. The staff is lazy and the students are extremely stuck up. I went to a small town preppy school where you were basically judged for every single thing and thought it had to be better in college. Not here. Everyone is so judgmental and arrogant. There are lots of trashy people who seem very unintelligent. If you're into a crazy, drunk, arrogant lifestyle then this is the place for you. If you're like me and want to get a good education, make good friends, and overall have a great college experience, go anywhere but here."
College Freshman,1,Tons of options although joining a frat or a sorority is like joining a cult. All members act and dress the exact same and only interact with others in the greek system. It is very easy to tell a frat or sorority member from a normal student on campus just from what they wear or who they are walking with.
College Freshman,1,"Administration cares very little about the students. They are not very understanding regardless of the circumstances, they are really only employed to get students in trouble."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process would not be as bad if it weren't for the employees at the financial aid office who make the process a nightmare. Actually receiving the financial aid takes multiple visits and hours of time because the employees offer very little help.
College Sophomore,1,The process of finding out how much money I've been awarded takes too long.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you are lucky and have a cool RA, they are very strict with drinking, drugs and noise, but even with a cool RA it is difficult. If the dorm gets a little too noisy, there will be a visit from the RA."
College Senior,1,There are rarely any metered parking spots open on campus and you have to have a parking permit to park anywhere else. Parking permits are based on faculty and student status.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is probably the stupidest, most ANNOYING part of ECU. I hate it. I hate it I hate it I hate it. Please get rid of it. At least make sure your members are classy - not just have money."
Recent Alumnus,1,only fast food options within walking distance.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is terrible! There is no where to park on campus during the week if you do not have a parking pass. There are a few meter spots, but they are always taken. Parking passes are so expensive so it is very annoying if you live off-campus and have to find ways to get to campus. Parking officers are intense and you WILL get a ticket if you park somewhere you are not supposed to."
College Sophomore,1,Parking absolutely sucks on campus!
College Senior,1,Not enough parking. Permits cost crazy amounts of money and they make parking after hours inexcusable. 
College Freshman,1,Most of the students on campus are too full of themselves to talk to many other people that are not in the same cliques.
College Junior,1,"It was difficult just to get into my school. It took six months of emails and mailing paperwork to them for them to FINALLY accept. However, getting into my program wasn't hard at all but getting into my specif concentration seems like it will be."
College Sophomore,1,If you want to party do NOT come here.
College Senior,1,Underage drinking is a big problem. Also the abuse of study drugs is an issue.
College Junior,1,Food sucks!! The staff is very in between about how they prepare food. Its good one day then gross the next but 50% of the time its edible. Its way over priced for the amount of food you get and the quality. That is why I opted out of the meal-plan after my first semester at ECu
College Sophomore,1,"I really do not like Greenville. Coming from a big city to somewhere so small was a huge culture shock. There is not much diversity in the city itself, but the school is very diverse."
College Freshman,1,"The dining halls really suck. The food is bad and the hours aren't flexible enough. The campus restaurants like Starbucks and Chili's are good, but there are only a few restaurants. Also, the meal plan is weird. If you go to the restaurants, your meal plan only covers part of the cost. Considering how much we pay for the meal plan, we're not getting much value.  It's supposed to be revamped in the fall however. We'll see."
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife in Greenville sucks! The house parties are always busted by cops, events in Greenville are dangerous due to greenvilians. The only option for fun is downtown which sucks too because its just a bunch of lame clubs that cater to a certain race."
College Freshman,1,"The town of Greenville sucks, a large amount of students can be described as trashy or slutty, and the student population isn't intelligent enough to have a real football cheer/chant. ""Pirates arghhhh!"" Really? That's the best you can do?"
Recent Alumnus,1,I got towed twice for violations I didn't even know I committed.  I often was forced to park in dangerous areas.  The prices for permits are outrageous.  The ticket maids are always out harassing.  Don't even bring a car if you're in the dorm and you can help it.
College Senior,1,"Alcohol Law Enforcement is everywhere around Greenville.  They are even undercover downtown, so be warned!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking has always been an issue at ECU. Some is on campus but most is off-campus. It costs alot and you may have to ride the bus to get to your car as a freshmen. There rarely tends to be enough spots. The bus system is the best way to go. When I was there, Greenville had the second best bus system in the state. Students drive the ECU buses which is great money."
College Senior,1,"The dining halls are terrible. You have to stand in line for poorly cooked and unhealthy food, and the servers will not honor your request for more or less food on your plate. By the time you get enough food and find seating, your food has gotten cold, or even congealed to a plastic-y pile of goop. Gross! Cooking your own pasta and steamed veggies at your own apartment is a much better option. There's other dining places at ECU, too. I like The Galley and the coffee shops. The meal plans offered are overpriced and you're pressured to use up all your weekly meals with little flexibility."
College Freshman,1,It costs a lot of money to park around campus. Most spaces are inconvenient for drivers and the walk can be long. Freshmen get the worst parking because on game weekends they have to move their cars to make room for game day visitors.
College Sophomore,1,"Only staff can park on campus. The freshman parking lot was downtown, unsupervised. There aren't enough parking meters."
College Sophomore,1,"Awful Awful Awful – I absolutely loathe the campus dining.  We have quite a few restaurants on campus such as Chikfila and Chili's but as for the cafeteria's they are absolutely awful.  They have only a few choices, and a salad bar.  I am pretty positive everything, including the lettuce, has been bathed in butter.  Also, God forbid them give you a decent portion of vegetables.  They give you about three pieces of broccoli and that's all you get.  Healthy? Noooooooo. With their consistent making of pizza, some sort of fried food, and stir fry bar there is nothing I am going to miss when I get into my apartment this fall."
College Sophomore,1,"Drinking, Drugs, and Abusing Pills – There is a lot of partying, and dug use associated with it."
College Freshman,1,"Well I do not own a car, but my roommate does and we use it to drive to town. She told me that the cost was $350 for the parking sticker and when we drive around to look for a parking spot, they are always full around our building. You will be lucky to find one near by."
College Junior,1,"From the day you come to orientation to the day you leave, it is drilled in your head to not walk alone on or off campus. Greenville has one of the highest crime rates in North Carolina so this makes perfect sense. It seems as though the cops focus on busting pot smokers and underage drinkers while my friends and neighbors are being killed, robbed, and sometimes even worse things happen to them. Its easy to see the Blue Panic towers on campus, but one rarely hears about crime being fought in real time in Greenville. It's very sad. My computer got stolen last semester and GPD hasn't done anything to figure out where my computer is. They are corrupt, they don't follow rules, laws, or social mores, I am not exaggerating to any extent. This is a real problem in Greenville that police can only stop kids from having a good time and letting off a little steam."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in Greenville is terrible, it is always raining which for some reason causes the buses to be late."
College Freshman,1,"I am a freshman -so I had to get a parking pass for D Lot.
I have to take the ECU bus from my dorm to get to D parking Lot which is near the baseball field - and not a safe place on campus.

I usually sit in my car until I see the bus coming to avoid getting robbed at this parking lot."
College Student,1,"What Greeks? Greek life on campus is hardly noticeable. Sure, during initiation and recruitment, it's the only thing you hear about but afterward it goes by unseen."
College Freshman,1,"Parking around campus is awful, there's hardly anywhere you can park. If you do not park in your permitted area you will get a ticket almost always."

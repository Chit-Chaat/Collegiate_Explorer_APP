Senior,5,"I have taken almost all online classes and they have been great. The professors are reasonable and also strict in a sense that when assignments are due, they’re due."
Senior,5,I love Hiram College. The professors are knowledgeable and it seems like everyone I work with cares. It’s a great school that one can get personal attention from even if one is an online student.
Sophomore,5,what I love about Hiram is the class sizes and the overall layout of the college. it really has been an awesome experience at this institution
Sophomore,5,"the online experience at Hiram is wonderful, it allows students to work ahead stay on target with assignments and be actively engaging."
Freshman,5,"After my first year at Hiram College I can honestly say that it’s been one of the best years of my life. The people are friendly and the professor really care about helping you. All professors are contactable at all times of day through email and sometimes phone number. They also have a wide variety of classes that you can choose from, along with many majors to choose from. Hiram is a great choice for school if you like your professors actually caring about you and your future."
Freshman,5,I love how Hiram feels like a community and the togetherness of the campus! Everyone there is so friendly and always willing to help.
Sophomore,5,There is a deep sense of community and it's small. This gives you a better experience during classes.
Freshman,5,"I LOVE Hiram College! Being an out-of-state student, I don’t feel as if I am that far away from home (despite being 788 miles away)!! This campus is small and has an amazing hometown feel to it that is more than accepting to all different backgrounds of individuals! In addition, I am more than happy with all the different opportunities that Hiram offers! Such opportunists include: travel abroad, graduate school, and internships, just to name a few! I would absolutely recommend this school to any student that wants to feel supported and involved with their education!!"
Sophomore,5,"It is a great campus! It only has about1,500 students so class sizes are very suitable for learning, being a students athlete this is very healthful because meeting with professors is fairly easy. All the professors are very friendly and easy to approach. Overall lovely school!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the atmosphere. Everyone was very welcoming and professional. The people make you feel like you belong there. The only thing I would change would be the price, I feel as if so many smart and capable students are losing their chance to shine because of how expensive most schools are. Other than that Hiram is absolutely perfect."
Niche User,5,"I have enrolled at Hiram College and have only visited campus one time, and I absolutely love it. It feels very safe, and very much like I'm back at home in Nevada. I had some communication with other students during my visit, and they all had very kind words to say about their college. Their glowing reviews and personal accounts is what drew me to enroll to Hiram College."
Niche User,5,"Once described as the ""Happiest College in the Land"", Hiram college proovided excellent education when I attended there for two years.  Now that i am considering reentry much has changed, but the helpful, friendly people are just as helpful and friendly as those who were there before.   I sincerely hope i can get a scholarship so I can continue my very belated studies."
Freshman,5,"I love the College. It’s far from thing we need like food, clothes and dorm room items. Just getting to know people here so it’s kind of a slow start. I’m from Dallas so it’s definitely something new and different."
Sophomore,5,I love Hiram College. If you can get past the point that it pretty much takes 20 minutes to get anywhere then it is a great school to attend. They provide every student with IPads and boots. The professor are very personal. There have been a few occasions where the professor has invited the class to their house for dinner. An overall positive experience for me.
Sophomore,5,"The students are fairly friendly, they are easy to approach and are very inclusive. The professors are great for the most part, they really care about their students and what they are teaching to their students"
Sophomore,5,I Love how when you become a student or even a worker at Hiram it becomes a second family. Also they welcome your family as one of their own. They take care of you and you really are known as someone on campus unlike large colleges.
Sophomore,5,"I’ve had a very amazing first year experience at Hiram. The professors are very helpful when i need help. I feel safe on campus, the campus is very comfortable,  hiram was my first choice and I am happy with my decision"
Sophomore,5,"Hiram College is amazing! I love how tight knit the community is! Everyone is so friendly and you always see a familiar face. There are perks of going to a smaller school! The professors are amazing and always willing to help. They are all usually on a first name basis. You get to know them so well that they will invite the class over to their house for dinner! If it’s nice out or if the professors are chill, they will let you work outside or in the coffee shop! Hiram is the perfect place for me. It actually wasn’t my first choice of college, but I couldn’t of picked a better place. I never feel alone or left out. There’s always something to do and people to hangout with. I love Hiram!!"
Senior,5,"My time at Hiram has been extremely rewarding. I have met some great friends and professors. The staff has been accommodating and understanding. My adviser has been more to me than just that. She has been a mentor. She has pushed me even when I couldn't push myself. I like the small, tight knit community at Hiram. I am blessed to have attended and become a graduate from this college. I have grown so much in my time at Hiram, both professionally and mentally."
Junior,5,"I enjoy attending Hiram College because the flexible class schedule works well my busy schedule. The professors that l’ve had were awesome and professional .  Althoughthe cost is pricey,  l wouldn’t trade my experiences or classmates for any other college ."
Niche User,5,From the little time I have spent at Hiram I know that it is a wonderful place. Everyone is always so nice and will say hello even if they don't know you. The food and dorms are great and the nursing program is amazing.
Alum,5,"I was able to gain an incredible amount of experience in my four years at Hiram. For an incredibly driven student, Hiram is the perfect place to be able to have access to well-connected faculty members and their research and to have opportunities that will benefit you immensely coming out of college."
Freshman,5,Wonderful people who want to see you and help you succeed when you are there learning and in the years after your education.
Sophomore,5,Hiram is a amazing school. The College is small but everyone knows you by face. My first year there I was scared but as time went on I became very close with my professors and they helped me with so many things outside of the class room.
Freshman,5,Hiram is a quite college and small. Not many students go there but its very good for those who don't like to be apart of a big crowd. Everyone knows each other so it shouldn't be hard to make friends.
Alum,5,"Hiram is the place to grow into your own. It's a place to express yourself with extreme support from professors. The academics are top notch and the cost is relatively low for a private liberal arts school. It is beautifully placed in a rural setting with an amazing state park down the road-Nelson's Ledges. It was the absolute perfect place for a naturalist musician like myself. It prepared me well toward my goals, as I'm working toward a PhD in music."
College Freshman,5,EVERYTHING ABOUT HIRAM IS PERFECT
College Freshman,5,Hiram assures you have success and will stop at nothing less. Class sizes are not overwhelmingly big so the professors know each student and understands all of their goals. It is a great place with lots of safety and they have a lot of opportunities for each student in each major.
College Freshman,5,The school is in a small town. Everyone knows each other and the professors take all the time in the world to help students achieve their goals.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very passionate about what they do. They want to see nothing but success from each and every student.
College Sophomore,5,Hiram is a very safe campus. There is virtually no crime or assault of any kind.
College Sophomore,5,Hiram is VERY safe in my opinion. I can walk across campus at 2 o'clock in the morning on a weekend and nothing will happen to me. If
College Sophomore,5,I love Hiram flaws and all
College Sophomore,5,I love the opportunities being a Hiram student presents me with
College Sophomore,5,They are really fun and do a bunch of all campus events
College Freshman,5,"Hiram is engaging full throttle in its initiative to get students in the work place. Through its new Connect program, internships, study abroad opportunities and in depth learning options are required in some combination to ensure our ability to make an impact. After all, we are meant to be the generation that changes everything!"
College Freshman,5,The close knit class sizes have allowed me to reach out with my professor and they me. I have learned so many things beyond the textbook in just my first semester through the passionate staff at Hiram and my experiences both within and without the classroom.
College Junior,5,"Thus far I have thoroughly enjoyed my college experience. I have great relationships with the faculty and students both as classroom peers and as development friendships. Hiram is definitely a community, my home away from home."
College Junior,5,"Intelligent Professors, small classes and a rigorous workload."
College Junior,5,"I love college. I'm very involved and I've met a lot of amazing people. I'm an athlete, a co-op member, a member of a local sorority, and a member of 2 different honors societies. The small school life is the life for me. I've also been given a wonderful internship experience this summer."
College Junior,5,"Amazing, very easy to talk to and works with you"
College Senior,5,I have GREAT professors and small class sizes which is great.
College Senior,5,There is a large abundance of international students at my school so it is very diverse.
Recent Alumnus,5,They can be picky about their teacher students and help bring everyone up to par before they graduate.
Recent Alumnus,5,Hiram alum teachers can easily get teaching jobs in Ohio.
Recent Alumnus,5,The name means something when you're looking to be a teacher in Ohio.
Recent Alumnus,5,You can even create a class if you want to! That doesn't happen anywhere else like it does here!!
Recent Alumnus,5,Lots of minorities and international students.
Recent Alumnus,5,I'm the person I am today due to experiences at this school.
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with the program I picked. The work maybe a lot but it will all be worth it in the end when I am an RN. I would still pick nursing or something medical if I did this all again. I am very passionate about wanting to help people so medicals fields give me the opportunity to do just that. I would ideally like to after graduation go into working at an ER  then after into an ICU which will lead me to NICU. After paying my dues in the NICU I would love to go back to college and get my degree as an APN and run a NICU floor. I really do not have many concerns about the career I picked.
College Freshman,5,I love the program I'm in at Hiram. Yes the course load is a wee bit heavy but you can not really complain considering the field you want to go into has a lot of work in it. The professors are very helpful and will do anything to see you make it to the end with a passing grade if you are willing to work. It is very enjoy and I highly suggest it to anyone who wants to be a nurse.
College Senior,5,"Hiram has a diverse as well as a productive environment which consistently maintains an expansive sense in protection, social responsibility, academic honesty, academic advancement, disability services and non-discrimination policies. Part of experiencing the college environment, there will be instances of students  experimenting with substances. Being aware of this, the Staff as well as the security department maintains a watchful and thoughtful eye to maintain safety for all involved."
College Senior,5,To my knowledge Hiram as a private College has not within the past 3+ years in attendance had a drug problem. If there has been any issues involving drugs it has been at a minimal.
College Freshman,5,The workers are great! Every one is nice and helpful
College Freshman,5,Everything is convenient and near campus and  it is no longer than 10-15 minutes from campus.
College Sophomore,5,"People here are just that, people. I have yet to meet someone mean or malicious, and almost everyone, girl or guy, is open to hanging out and being friendly. It's a very welcoming and non clicky environment."
College Freshman,5,"Just Another Group – There is a growing Greek life here, but it's different than you would think. The Greeks are just another social group on campus like a sports team, or any other club. They are just a group of people that join together to be friends. They hold many events on campus and make an effort to connect the school as a whole. Last week they sponsered a toga party and then a campfire this weekend. They are viewed the same as everyone else. They have parties throughout the year and many times they are campus wide events."
College Freshman,5,"Drugs? What Is That? People who drink, drink. People who don't, don't. In fact, I believe that students in Hiram who don't drink have more fun than the ones that do."
College Junior,5,Completely Safe – Hiram College is one of the safest places I have ever been. Even things like petty theft of unsupervised laptops simply doesn't happen. I've heard of 2 crimes happening here in 3 years.
College Sophomore,5,"Dorms Got Character – Some of the dorms look like absolute s*** but, damn it, they got character. The dynamic on my floor is impeccable. Everyone gets along so well. They truly have made my college experience what it is."
Freshman,4,"It’s an amazing place where I’ve always felt welcomed and cared about. Because it’s so small, there is a tight knit quality to the campus and the students apart of it."
Freshman,4,"The professors did very well with accommodation. The switch to online was sudden, but I still felt like a was getting a quality education because the professors were so adamant on keeping consistency with their teaching methods as much as they could."
Junior,4,It’s a smaller school so it’s a good choice if you don’t feel comfortable at a bigger campus. There’s a lot of school sponsored events if you’re into that but it’s a good idea to find a friend group also.
Sophomore,4,"I took a class online, and it was a little difficult to try and learn the subject on my own since I wasn’t able to talk with the professor on a daily basis, but the professor did her best to try and find ways to still teach and help us as much as possible."
Sophomore,4,I love the size of the campus! The other students and professors are really nice and welcoming. The size of the classrooms are really nice because you can connect with your professors easier.
Freshman,4,The online learning experience was somewhat difficult at first. It became much easier once I emailed my professors. The only big problem with the online learning was some students being home had to get a job or work so it made it harder for people to get work done. The professors were very understanding with this and would extend the time of due dates for those who were busy.
Freshman,4,"I like Hiram because it is small, rural, and you feel a tight sense of community in all the people you meet. I really connected with others who became my friends through my job on campus, in my classes, in my residence hall, and around campus.. I really enjoyed the most of my experience at Hiram with living on campus, classes, and meeting new friends. I hope more people can!"
Freshman,4,"I love it here, the professors and faculty are all good people and very helpful. The only downside is that it very far from any type of stores."
Senior,4,Good small campus that focuses on the small student to faculty ratio for beneficial class sizes. Personal and friendly campus that does not have large parties. Staff are very helpful with assisting students.
Senior,4,"The only complaint I have is not enough parking. The Campus is located within other houses in the community, thus not leaving enough parking available. The nursing program however is excellent."
Sophomore,4,Hiram College is a great school for anyone who likes a small environment. It’s in a very quiet place about 15 minutes away from the city. It’s a great school if you like to party a little bit one day  and want to study and be quiet the next. That’s the kind of experience I had with Hiram my first year. I was never distracted from my studies at hiram because of partying too much. I was able to party some days and find a quiet place to study the next. I also play basketball at hiram. I love the fan base and support the students show the student athletes. The academic part of Hiram is also great. The professors really care about you and the class sizes are not big. It’s easier for the professors to assist students one on one. Giving students a better chance of succeeding in their field of study. Only thing I would like see change is Hiram adding in more majors and adding track and field. Hiram is a good school to attend.
Junior,4,"What i like most about hiram is the professor, they provide a lot of help and really care about their students and if they graduate."
Sophomore,4,I currently attend Hiram. It is my second year and I absolutely love it. I love the atmosphere of the campus and all the opportunities you get to pursue.
Freshman,4,"Hiram College is a small college in rural Ohio. Hosting roughly 1000 students, there is always something to do on campus. However, it would be best for students to own a car since even the closest mart is 4 miles away in Garrettsville. As a nursing student, the academic demand is exceptionally high, and students that are not 100% devoted to their coursework quickly find themselves behind and some forced to drop out. The professors are caring and are willing to help students to the best of their ability. I could not have survived the first semester at Hiram without the help of my professors for sure."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see more opportunities for commuters, more parking as well. The classes and professors, however, are amazing and all very personalized. Professors care about you here and make sure you are doing well not just in their class, but all your other classes as well."
Alum,4,"Hiram college was a close-knit community and it is very easy to make friends there. The professors and staff genuinely care about your success but they don't just hand you good grades. The classes can be challenging in ways that are meant to get you to work hard. That being said, it is very difficult to get off campus if you don't have a car."
Senior,4,Hiram College is a great school ! The education is great. It is a small school so everyone knows everyone.
Freshman,4,"Everybody is happy to be there, the staff are very great! The campus is very clean and nice! Everything is a good and nice walking distance, the rooms are very nice! The teachers are outstanding, the gym is in very good shape! The field house looks vey brand new and nice!"
Alum,4,"Small liberal arts college. Classes are small, campus is nice and friendly. Professors always want to help you. Very good for its value"
College Freshman,4,Peer pressure doesn't really exist. If you partake in drugs or alcohol or not nobody is going to look at you different.
College Freshman,4,Hiram has great safety procedures to assure that everyone stays safe. There is always people around to assure you never walk alone even if you do feel un safe
College Freshman,4,There is always activities for everyone to feel involved. It's what keeps everyone together and everything fun.
College Freshman,4,No matter how good or bad the teams can be there is always constant love and support. Everyone sticks together
College Sophomore,4,An internship is required for graduation. Hiram makes you put yourself out there to meet new people and build your network.
College Sophomore,4,"Being a football player, I get first hand experience in the realm of school sports. The coaches love what they do and will push athletes to be better both on and off the field."
College Sophomore,4,Its great. The people are friendly and there are so many different kinds of people there.
College Sophomore,4,"The academics here may be changeling her and it's hard to get that glorious 'A' that we all want but, that's done on purpose to make the students gain more experience points to level up as a human being. The workload is a lot depending on if you schedule your time and choose your classes wisely so that aren't slowly dying every time you walk out of the classroom. the professor that I've had already were willing to help me out if I had any questions regarding anything class related. Hiram also has tutoring for that little extra kick of support if you ever need it. The popular places to study are either at the library, your dorm room (don't ever do that it's a trap), or in the common areas of each dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes that I took this past school year were interesting, helpful and changeling for myself. Our class sizes at Hiram are small (an average 12 students to 1 teacher) so, I was able to get to know my professor more and he or she was more willing to help me out of I had any questions about the assignments on hand. I may sound scary, with the whole 'changeling' aspect that I briefly mentioned, but the professors do that on purpose to engage you more and help you out more in the long run. Finally, the class I took were discussion based. with this aspect we aren't just staring at a power point presentation for 2 hours. the class gets to talk among each other and throw off ideas at each other, which in the long-run, helps you think in a different way and may just help with whatever paper you may have to write later on."
College Sophomore,4,"As a rising up sophomore, I'm not to into the networking pool as much as I would love to say that I am. However, if you stop on by the career center, I am sure that they can hook you up with something. The career center was VERY helpful when it came around for all the reviewing and polishing the advisers did to make my resume shine more."
College Freshman,4,"It is a very small school, and sometimes you feel a little bit cut off from the outside world. This is only if you don't have access to a car. Be sure to be open to every aspect of life and get involved! We need people who are excited, passionate, and willing to work to make things better."
College Sophomore,4,Every system has flaws but Hiram is putting in the effort to make it better
College Sophomore,4,There are few issues with campus housing
College Sophomore,4,I love Hiram the only flaw is we are kinda far from everything
College Freshman,4,"its pretty safe on campus, rarely anything happens"
College Freshman,4,My overall experience is great but I hope it gets better in he next few years
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are great at Hiram. The coaching staff are great and understanding. they care more about their players grades rather than their game performance, but don't get me wrong they want to win games but get you ready for the real world also."
College Freshman,4,"The Coleman Ceter is kept clean and adequately organized. It has a good mix of everything you need to work out, rather it's leg day or not."
College Freshman,4,Hiram College has its ups and downs but the school has been great so far. I'm just a college freshamn in her second semester so I haven't experienced it all yet but I probably will sooner or later in the rest of my time at Hirm College.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe and secure on campus at all hours of the day. Campus crimes are very low and any that do occur are very minor. Campus safety is always patrolling around campus and the Hiram police keep a close watch as well.
College Freshman,4,"I am very confident that I, as well as other Hiram graduates, will see great things come from their degree earned at Hiram. There are countless study abroad opportunities as well as internships that are made very accessible and affordable for students to take advantage of. These kinds of opportunties allow Hiram's students to gain experience in the line of work and studies they'd like to pursue."

College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities at my school are of great quality and used very frequently. Athletes as well as non- athletes are allowed access to the gym almost 24/7, which allows for great involvement and use of the facilities by the entire campus. The fan sections are incredibly enthusiastic at our sporting events and school spirit can be seen all of the time around campus and at sporing events."
College Freshman,4,"Hiram College is a great school and the perfect school for me. I love that everywhere on campus is within a 5-15 minute walk. Everyone is incredibly friendly and the professors and staff are always helpful. One of my favorite experiences so far was at one of the stress-relieving seminars where dogs from the community were brought in for the students to play with and relax for a few hours. My college is very concerned with it's student's well-being, mental health and success."
College Freshman,4,"There are always people around to help, and the emergency stations placed throughout campus are in conveniant locations. But even more, Hiram itself is a safe community with a lot of people who will take care of you if anything surprisingly did happen."
College Freshman,4,"The matching system for roommates, at least on my floor, paired amazing people together in ways that will help them grow as individuals and make life long friends. I live on the honors floor of Miller and the community is amazing. The central lounge area also helps to cultivate friendships, and the lounge downstairs with the TV allows groups to watch movies together to bond or just hang out and play ping pong."
College Freshman,4,"This very liberal (arts) institute engages its apprentices in experiences that not only engender life long learning, but inspire mental awareness, purposed ambition, thoughtful acceptance, and passionate adventure. And I have received a great taste of this indulgence."
College Junior,4,"I am not a participant of the sports teams. However, I do use the athletic facilities for daily workouts"
College Freshman,4,"I love my school! The only thing I really dislike is the proximity to home. I wish I had gone somewhere further to get the full experience. However, overall I fell in love with this school. The campus is beautiful. The small class size and personal environment make me feel like the professors truly care about you and your learning experience for your future career. The students are very diverse which makes for a lot of different philosophies and opinions to learn from. The liberal environment adds to the experience of personal growth."
College Junior,4,"Hiram's professors are accessible after class and easily contacted through via email. I know that I will still be in contact with my professors once I graduate Hiram. I had an exciting experience as a member of Student Senate this past year. I was able to talk with and ask the president of Hiram College questions concerning the ""magic "" of Hiram. The members of Student Senate including myself were able to give feedback on matters concerning orientation, dining hall experience, etc."
College Sophomore,4,Its convenient and very worth the cost.
College Sophomore,4,"With regard to the size and the location of campus, it is a lot of fun. 

It is what you make it."
College Sophomore,4,"With regard to the finances that Hiram possesses, it does the best that it can to give out aid."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a large variety with regards to living options and choosing where to dorm. 

One building is extremely old and smells horrible, the Quad. Mostly athletes love there. 

However, the other buildings are incredible! 

The hill and BC are both good qualities dorms. I've really enjoyed living in them. 

The townhouses and tge east hall suites are obviously the nicest because they are so new to campus. 

I cannot wait to be able to explore them in the next two years. 

They are placed conveniently to the rest of campus and it is extremely easy to get to class on time. 

The social atmosphere is what you choose to make it. 

I have a lot of friends and enjoy what is offered to do on campus."
College Junior,4,I like the upperclassmen option dorms because they are nicer and have larger living areas.
College Freshman,4,Haven't been to many games but the students like to go to the games and cheer on the teams! Students and faculty are supportive
College Freshman,4,Campus does a good job enforcing its rules and policies. I think the dorm halls need cameras though. There have been a few issues going on with vandalism.
College Freshman,4,I received a scholarship for academics
College Freshman,4,The people on my floor are a great group of kids. My RA is awesome and does a great job at being fair. My building is the best building to live in it is so convenient to everything on campus. I wish the campus had more places on campus to eat and more things to do on campus.
College Junior,4,Transportation is pretty much unnecessary. Everything on campus is withing a 10 minutes distance at the absolute most.
College Junior,4,Its hard to find someone who has conservative views on topics such as sexuality/gender orientation and the like. Most people accept people for who they are and move on. It does not seem to be something people get hung over on.
College Sophomore,2,"The lack of passion within the student body is absolutely disheartening. The academics are great but you don't just go to a school for school. It becomes your home. Hiram College is absolutely dull and lifeless. If you don't mind sitting in your room studying all day, it's a good fit.  Having to search for human interaction is exhausting sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life isn't really prevelant on campus. I don't know too much about it.
College Sophomore,2,"There's at least one or two small parties every weekend on campus but, they're not always the best (unless it's Springfest, that is a totally different case all together)."
College Sophomore,2,"Sure, we have the varying backgrounds from all over the world here at Hiram. However, there's a few people that just so intolerant to other people's life stories because they come from a privileged lifestyle. good for them, let them stay that way but once you take that handful of people out of your mind, the rest of the community on campus is supportive of each other and are willing to talk and learn about you and how you are as a person. A lot of the time, you can gain a new perspective on life when you can talk through the differences that each person may have for each other."
College Sophomore,2,Some of the dorms are okay. None of the dorms have air-conditioning which would be really nice in the spring/fall.
College Sophomore,2,"The only places to go are to the townhouses for parties or ""Da Hub,"" which is the only bar on campus. I haven't been to either because it just doesn't sound fun. A lot of students spend nights playing games with floormates, or something."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you have a car and can go to Streetsboro or Garrettsville, you're stuck with the bistro and it's not the greatest. Plus, the hours are just dumb, in my opinion. But even if you have a car, there's pretty much only chain places around."
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes the food is okay. There's some days where everything is great. But it's basically the same all the time.
College Freshman,2,"I like the faculty a lot, but I really dislike Hiram's setup of classes. For instance, they have a very weird curriculum where you have to take 8 different classes that are different ""methods"" of teaching. For other schools, this seems like a joke so it's hard to find classes that will transfer at all. Also, the colloquium and FSEM classes are really varied so it's hard to actually get really useful writing skills. The teachers are really great though, I haven't found a teacher that hasn't been able to keep my attention. And it's nice to have small classes."
College Freshman,2,"Well, the sports teams have hardly won anything but that doesn't mean the people who play them aren't passionate about the sports. I'm personally not interested in them."
College Freshman,2,"I like the fact that they give you a decent amount of money for printing papers and whatnot. However, that's your money that you're using anyways so it's not like they do it for you. The network connection and speed are sooooooo bad. So bad. It constantly cuts out or stops working and whenever it's a busy part of the year, it gets so much worse because everyone's using it. You definitely need your own laptop if you ever want to get things done. You don't need a printer though, it takes up more space than you'd ever want it to."
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is nice, intramural basketball was so much fun, but it was the only intramural sport that people really participated in. The gym closes at 9 and the sports teams often take up most of it. The pool is rarely open to free swim and no one really ever gets pick-up games at the basketball courts."
College Freshman,2,"There are only a few bars to go to at a close distance. The bars only allow 21 and over. There is usually a lot going on on campus at different places, such as the townhouses."
College Freshman,2,Unless you're in football you're pretty much overlooked. We recently got a new rugby coach and we have an official lacrosse team this year. Soccer is really big because of the international students and even though other sports are sometimes deemed 'less important' we are still treated well and have competent coaches.
College Freshman,2,"When there's parties, you can go to the townhouses and float around all night. When there isn't a special occasion, there are a few regular places that have parties."
College Junior,2,"If you have a car, you have access to great places to eat in Kent, Cleveland and Streetsborro. If you don't have a car, you can call delivery or go to the local pizza place."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, better find some one who does. 
There is very few places to eat that are near campus."
College Senior,2,"The only thing that could be considered ""Off-campus"" is a limited amount of townhouses that were built very quickly and have physical problems now."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are nothing fancy. very plain typical.  they get better as you move up. There is no real chance of living off campus unless you intend on buying a house.
College Freshman,2,"Football Team Needs Improvement – Our college football team sucks. Our women's volleyball team kicks ass. Our men's soccer team is okay. School spirit regarding athletic activities? Not so much. Yet, the athletic facilities have state-of-the-art equipment, and students who take full advantage of these privileges will be very much satisfied. IM's (intramurals) are practically non-existent."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school will not help you succeed in the real world. My horses lost weight and conditioning, and training. I was embarrassed  to come home thats how bad my horses were. The riding program is terrible the instructors are unprofessional, the horses are unsound, and the whole program will not teach how to train but how to ride in their eyes what is correct this is false."
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife here isn't the best, you'll have to travel over to a different town or school if you would want to not go to the same place over and over again. To be honest, the best way to have a good time for that whole 'nightlife' feel is to just go do something with a group of friends all together."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have enough students at my college for Greek life unfortunately.
College Junior,1,No options unless you drive 20 minutes away
College Sophomore,1,"I think there's like two or three sororities and frats on campus, but no one cares about them, and you hardly hear anything from them."
College Senior,1,A majority of students live on campus.
College Freshman,1,There is no off-campus housing.
College Freshman,1,"IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. There are no attractions that you can go to without having to drive at least 15-30 minutes. There's some activities on campus and some cultural events but they don't have too much interest for most students. The safety is almost guaranteed which is good. But this town just feels so suffocating at times because it feels like you're not doing anything. Or at least, that's how I feel. Others might feel differently."
College Sophomore,1,The wifi connection is awful. It's inconsistent and often unreliable is crucial situations. The library is the only spot on campus with a decent connection. There were times in my dorm last year that the connection would be bad right when I was in the middle of saving papers or tests. There is one open computer lab that stays open all night though at least.
College Sophomore,1,"The closest town is a few miles away, which is inconvenient for most people without cars. In town, which is Garrettsville, there is a McDonald's, DQ, Subway, a couple pizza places and maybe one or two ok sit-down restaurants. Main Street is a nice restaurant by the river. Also on the border of campus is Gionino's, which is a very good pizza place."
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife at Hiram is very poor. There is only one small bar on campus that is not exciting and hardly gets business. The other bars are between .5 and 1.5 hours away. There are almost no house parties, except for at the townhouses located on campus. However, these are often packed with students and almost always get busted or at least broken up at the end of each night by the village police. The best bet for students is to have a car and travel to Kent State University, which is about a half hour away, or head to Cleveland which is about an hour away from campus."
College Junior,1,"Not for a Free Sprirt. There are rules in all the res halls and you will get cited/fined if you break them. If you are outside, the police will find you."
College Junior,1,If you dont have a car or know someone with a car then you will rarely get off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I would suggest that students who plan on entering Hiram College as Freshman have good SAT and ACT scores if they want a good financial aid letter. My grades were awesome but not so much my test scores. Apparently, they put more weight on those than your GPA score in high school. Overall, Hiram College is a very expensive school. The cost of attendence is $41,000 dollars every year. They don't really like to offer that much financial aid help and the representatives aren't understanding of your financial problems at all. If I could do it all over again, I would've attended a cheaper school."
College Freshman,1,"Picture This – You are stranded on a desert island covered in sand, maybe once a month there is a boat that comes by and offers to take you to the sand store.  This is Hiram, there is no escape."
College Freshman,1,"It's Private School – If you are focused on getting with hot guys and girls, go to public school. The focus of Hiram is not looks nor partying- it's studying."
College Freshman,1,There is nowhere to live off campus unless your family lives near.
College Freshman,1,"The cops here are pointless.  They are fools who have let a little amount of power go to their heads.  I understand it is a police officers job to uphold the law and to protect the citizens, but it is not their job to harass people.  There is so little to do here they will jump on the smallest thing like J-Walking.  Most of the RAs here are decent and fair people.  There are some though that have the same problem as the cops, they are power hungry and enjoy writing people up for small offenses."
College Freshman,1,Average to Ugly – Both guys and girls here are very average to ugly.  There is maybe one girl that is attractive at Hiram.  There are different types of people but on a whole everyone is very average.
College Freshman,1,The one pizza place off campus is a great place to go if you feel that you arteries were lacking saturated fat.
College Freshman,1,The Gym Is Usable – I was deeply saddened when I found out that Hiram's gym did not have a rowing machine. But overall the gym is pretty good.  There is one place to eat off campus and it is a sketchy pizza place that serves an great deep fried coronary bipass.
College Freshman,1,"Utterly Miserable – Unless you enjoy isolation, boredom, and average people, I would advise not coming here.  Personally it has made me realize that there i absolutely nothing appealing about Hiram Collage and that I need to be in a city.  The classes are good but few.  Everyone disappears on weekends leaving the campus empty for people form out of state.  Overall i am enthralled that the first semester is nearly over and I will soon get to leave Hiram and never return."
College Freshman,1,The food here is great for the first few weeks...And then you realize that it is the same thing day after day dafter day.
College Sophomore,1,Computer Helpdesk Is Lazy – Every time I call for help at the computer help desk about Wifi routers being down they insist that there is something wrong with my computer until everyone in the dorm calls.
College Sophomore,1,"The Parking Lot Is Destroyed – THe student parking lot at Hiram College is filled with pot holes. Hiram charges $65 per year per person for a parking permit, yet the lot is unacceptable."
College Freshman,1,"Hiram College is located in a very small town, therefore the dining options available are slim to none. There are no off campus dining options available in walking distance and other than a McDonalds or Dairy Queen the options are at least 20 minutes away"
College Sophomore,1,"As If – Our sport teams are pretty bad. The college likes to spend money on shipping in kids from states like Florida in hopes of spiking our losing streak into something not pathetic, but fat chance. No amount of fresh turf is going to make our teams good for anything but a chuckle. The rugby and soccer teams do throw a decent party though."
College Sophomore,1,"There are not enough parking spots for the number of students that attend Hiram, they are even getting rid of some previous parking spots."
College Sophomore,1,They Don't Exist – There is a campus dining hall and a bistro. The only near by off campus option is a small but delightful pizza place. Cleveland is only a 45 minute drive though and there are lots of fun places to eat there.
College Sophomore,1,"Hiram College has transportation for things rarely, they prefer to bring a lot of events to campus to save money, also they need more drivers to drive, there is only two vans though. When students need to go to the stores which is about an hour away they have to find a way or wait for the time that the campus do the store trips which are normally around holidays when students are going home anyway."
College Sophomore,1,"Partying at the townhouses are the best it gets... and it doesn't get very good. Most dorms are strictly dry and this is heavily enforced. If you are underaged, you can drink locked in your room with a couple of friends if you are quiet about it and the RAs are asleep. Pot is available but not popular. The dealer charges $15 for a dime. 

Come here for good old wholesome fun--movie night, walmart runs, games until 2am. Don't go to Hiram to party."
College Junior,1,"Dining at Hiram is unacceptable, given the high price tag of the meal plan. The dining subcontractors at Hiram are incompetent, and treated poorly.  We spent a great deal of money on a new dining hall, but kept the same grimey contract employees which serve the same quality of food as the old dining hall.  Of the 21 meal swipes I pay for each week, I only use an average of 3-5/week.  The food is of low quality compared to other college dining halls I visited.  Often, I have to shovel food down just so I don't become malnourished.  Last year it also became apparent that a dining hall employee was fired for blowing the whistle on health code violations.  They were accused of serving chicken that was dropped on the floor when raw, then cooked and served to students.   I had contracted food poisoning twice from eating nothing but dining hall food.  The last case made me miss some class, and now I find it hard to eat there."
College Junior,1,"Virtually Non-Existent – There's one pizza shop that gets old after a while.  The dining hall is not open late.  There's the Bistro in the student commons, but is overpriced and closes at 10pm.  Also there is a convenience store, but it's only open until 6pm"
College Junior,1,"It's Fake – Hiram has a few pseudo-Greek organizations.  There are no frat houses, and parties are not frequent. They do not belong to the national Greek system. Any event they do have is heavily policed, and usually takes place on campus, so no room for shenanigans."
College Junior,1,"We are in the middle of nowwhere.  Partying is very limited, usually the same group of people doing the same thing, at the same set of houses, very repetitive.  The sole bar on campus is pathetic, and serves watered down cocktails with a side of crappy music and atmosphere.  No designated driver system is in place. Without a responsible driver, you're pretty much stuck on campus.  Underage nightlife is sketchy.  It is routine for those in the under 21 crowd to get busted by the campus or police.  Cops always show up for any major gathering. They have not much else to do anyway.  Transportation is by far the worst.  As a native of a major east coast city, I was shocked to learn how limited it was.  No cabs or commuter trains to Cleveland.  PARTA buses are  a joke, and don't run at night anyway."
College Sophomore,1,"Firstly, the parking space is extremely limited.During the college hours, it is hard to find space to park.However, at night, the scenario is worse,as there is n o parking for commuters and due to limited parking space not everyone gets to park.After 2 o'clock if a car that is not holding a pass to park in the college vicinity is charged penalty.More space would solve the parking problem"
College Junior,1,"Isolated, You Need a Car – you need a car to make use of the area,or to go to buy any groceries, since hiram is quite isolated. which is not necessarily a bad thing"
College Junior,1,"the weather here is horrible, we are snowed in all the time. It also get colder faster because we are on top of a hill."
College Junior,1,People do drugs but it's not the main thing to do...Alcohol is
College Junior,1,there is NO parking at Hiram college unless you get there before 8 am. They keep removing parking areas to build new dorms and townhouses but they don't add any additional parking areas. I live off campus and can circle around campus for 15 minutes before I find an opening. Talk about a waste of time and gas...

Freshman,5,"The environment of the school is very welcoming. For me, it’s a place where I can walk and campus and it just feels like home."
Freshman,5,The professors have done their best at making it a smoothness and easy transition for people that have not had to do much online learning before. They have also been able to find ways where we can meet in person while still following state guidelines to keep everyone safe.
Senior,5,The campus is one of the most beautiful I have seen. The classes are challenging and really prepare you for the real world. The business school has thousands of connections that can help you get your foot in the door with the world.
Freshman,5,"I like the school and have made some great memories, but it’s not without flaws. The party scene is pathetic, there’s not much to do around Selinsgrove, and the diversity is so-so. Some professors are kind of unbearable, some are really great. I think it’s a good school and I definitely would recommend it, but I suppose be aware of its flaws going in."
Alum,5,Small liberal arts school in central PA. Faculty and staff really care about students. There is a reason we say: Sweet Home Susquehanna!
Freshman,5,They are amazing and have really put in such great effort to help me through the process. The campus in amazing and our tour guide was so very nice. the club and student activities available on campus are make me super excited to go there. Admissions has been nothing but helpful and really showed us the process for college application and applying for scholarships.
Freshman,5,"I’m currently only a freshman at this university, but everyone and everything about this campus gave me a reason to love it. I am enrolled in the Sigmund Weiss School of Business which has been highly impactful on my college experience thus far. All of the professors are excellent and truly care for their students. The food is alright, there are a lot of options, so it’s not the worst. Overall, I am ecstatic that I have chosen to go to this college, this college truly knows how to make their students feel at home."
Junior,5,They really care about their students and it shows! The business school is amazing and full of opportunity & the school as a whole with work well with you to help you accomplish whatever it is you need. Also the study abroad program is beyond amazing.
Freshman,5,"They are very personal with you and really care about you as a student. The class sizes are small enough where you get individualized attention. At a larger school, you wouldn't be able to get that."
Niche User,5,"It is great - campus is nice, everyone is very helpful. The entire atmosphere is just what I need in a college."
Junior,5,Abroad in South Africa right now!! Love that the business and abroad program create a well rounded student and provide many opportunities to work with real companies and non profits!
Freshman,5,"One of the most friendly college campuses I've ever been on. The tour guides are nothing short of amazing, and admissions will work with you 110% of the way. Financially the school partners with admitted and prospective students to make the process THAT much easier. When I say that Susquehanna is worth your investment, I'm just being honest."
Freshman,5,"I feel that the school provides strong connections between students and teachers, even before we begin the year everyone offers a helpful and accepting environment."
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at Susquehanna and so far my experience has been phenomenal. Susquehanna has given me countless opportunities to become a better version of myself and grow as an independent woman with supporting faculty members and other peers. I've learned to raise my academic expectations of myself including managing work and time with volleyball. I would recommend Susquehanna to anyone.
Freshman,5,I love Susquehanna because my education is one on one with my professors and they know my name. My classes are below 40 people especially when working in Science Labs. The campus is also very beautiful and staff is very friendly.
Freshman,5,I love how beautiful the campus is and how nice all the professor's are. I have made some really good friends already and I can't wait to stay there all four years.
Sophomore,5,"I love SU! I enjoy the different activities on campus, and I have met a lot of amazing people here! The food is delicious, the dorms are spacious and clean, the common areas are well maintained, and the gym is awesome! The professors are approachable and knowledgeable, and there are lots of opportunities for sports, clubs, and jobs on campus and around Selinsgrove!

GO RIVERHAWKS!"
Niche User,5,"I was an applicant of Susquehanna University as a high school student, and I got accepted and received financial aid to my astonishment. Unfortunately, I turned it down and proceeded to study in another country. However, I am applying to this university as a transfer student and throughout my application process, my counselor has been nothing but caring and understanding about my situation. I praise all of the aid and support this university gives to its prospective students and its current students. This is indeed the one true university that actually invests its resources to the future of their students."
Niche User,5,"It is a wonderful school that offers a vast array of majors, and has a beautiful campus.  The student body is dedicated and passionate in their studies and the professors are helpful as well as take the time to ensure their students understand the material.  There are a significant number of extracurricular activities to be involved in, and most students take advantage of the study abroad program there."
Sophomore,5,"Susquehanna University has an active campus that encourages diversity and can help guide you in whatever you pursue. There's a little something for everyone, as the professors and staff members are very kind, patient, and cooperative as they teach you the necessary skills that you will need in the job market. Overall, my experience with Susquehanna so far has been astounding, and I would highly recommend it to others who are college searching."
Junior,5,"Susquehanna is an amazingly beautiful campus with beautiful scenery that is well kept by facilities. The students will become friends, the faculty care for your future, and you will developed into a fine business professional."
Niche User,5,My sister went here and she absolutely loved it. I know how much she learned over her four years there and it really made me want to attend the same school.
Junior,5,"I like that Susquehanna was so open and willing to help me succeed. Professors made time to see me when I had questions, especially Professor Wilce with my Statistics class. I was a transfer student, and during my first week of school, it was super easy to meet people because of an activities fair I went to. I signed up for Women's Rugby as a club sport and fell in love. I have never felt as happy as I do at Susquehanna University. My grades also showed because of it, I finished my first semester with a GPA of 3.25, this school pushes me to want to succeed."
Freshman,5,"I took a class here my senior year as part of dual enrollment. Although challenging, the workload was do-able. The campus was easy to navigate, making getting to class a breeze. My professor and classmates were very friendly. Parking can be scarce at times."
Niche User,5,"What I'd liked about Susquehanna University were their academic classes. From computer science to health care studies, there are many programs and classes that'll lead you to your career."
Sophomore,5,"I've spent one year at Susquehanna University and will have begin my second year this August. Going into S.U., I was afraid I wouldn't be able to fit in, but I was greeted with smiling faces the moment I got there. Everyone is so kind and willing to help anyone in need. This campus feels like a small hometown, so it's easy to get adjusted to. I would highly recommend this university to anyone."
Junior,5,The only thing I would want to see changed would be the issues with housing. As a growing campus we are beginning to run into problems on where to house everyone. Either allow off campus housing for upperclassman or build more housing options
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed everything about Susquehanna.  My experiences have been nothing below amazing! I love this school and have no complaints.
Niche User,5,"Susquehanna University has a wonderful music program, beautiful campus, and great food. From my visit during the ACDA conference in 2016, the general feel of the campus was inclusive and fun."
Niche User,5,"Every time I visit, I am not disappointed. I feel like I will be challenged and pushed out of my comfort zone. The traveling abroad program initially caught my eye.  This is the college I see myself succeeding in and I strongly feel like I will get the help, support, and encouragement from other students, professors, and staff. I can't wait to start my journey here."
Senior,5,"Over the past three years I have had an incredible experience at Susquehanna. From meeting faculty that genuinely care about me as a student and a person to having multiple pre-professional opportunities such as internships, SU has shaped me into the best version of myself."
Freshman,5,"Right now I am a first-year here at Susquehanna, and I am loving it! This campus is really beautiful, and the people are really great. My professors are great, and they really want to help you to be the best that you can be. Everything on campus is a nice walking distance and there are always events going on every day of the week. This is my home, and I definitely made the right coming here."
Sophomore,5,"As a student at Susquehanna, there are an endless number of opportunities for you to get involved around campus and the surrounding community. I couldn’t imagine myself being anywhere else. I love this school and I’m so thankful for the opportunities I’ve been able to take advantage of day in and day out."
Junior,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and the people here are so welcoming and friendly. I love that it's a small campus because it allows me to really get to know my professors and learn in a smaller classroom setting. It's really easy to get involved and there's always things to do on campus. I have found my home here at SU and I am so happy with my decision to come here!
Freshman,5,"I have just started my second semester at Susquehanna University and I am so happy with my decision to attend this school. I really feel that the professors care about students and make an effort to get to know you and help you succeed. Everyone that I have met here has been so welcoming and helpful. I am able to study what interests me and I do not feel like just a number. The campus is really beautiful and I feel safe being here.  I am a vegetarian and I have always been able to find food that is healthy and delicious. I am not a party person and I have never felt pressured into doing that here. There are so many clubs and activities available  for any interest. Overall, I think attending Susquehanna University has been one of the best decisions I have made."
Senior,5,Susquehanna University is a hidden gem in central Pennsylvania. The professors genuinely care about all the students and there are so many great opportunities for students of all majors. The student body is very welcoming to all students and consists of motivated students that all strive to achieve their best at this small liberal arts school.
Junior,5,"So far, I have had an amazing time during my college career at Susquehanna University. The business program has provided me with the right outlet for my educational path. The ability to travel abroad was also such an experience. I will always recommend this school to others who are looking."
Junior,5,"At Susquehanna University, I found my home away from home! The community here is full of incredible support and pushes me to learn and grow every day."
Freshman,5,"Susquehanna University is the college equivalent to a mythological creature. It is a small campus but big enough to allow you to grow as an individual into your adult years. The class sizes are similar to that of a public high school and it prevents from an overwhelming feeling. The staff is hired based on student input and therefore they are the best that they can be, according to the students."
Alum,5,"I had a terrific experience at Susquehanna where I met the best friends of my life. I am grateful for a well rounded education that offered small class sizes, friendly & helpful professors and a campus that is  gorgeous and inspiring to live on. Greek life made my experience even better. All three of my siblings followed me to Susquehanna, a true testament to my happy and loving experience. Thank you SU. I will forever cherish my time spent with you."
Freshman,5,"Excellent Music Ed Program. The welcome week for freshmen is great for getting you into the college spirit, and it's small enough to not get lost around campus."
Sophomore,5,Susquehanna University offers a variety of majors and minors and is a very diverse and well-rounded institution. The faculty and staff at SU are wonderful people and will help each student strive and achieve their goals.
Alum,5,The faculty within my department were key factors in cultivating my success after graduation. They pushed me throughout my four years at Susquehanna. I'm very grateful for my experience there.
Sophomore,5,"Susquehanna is such a great school. First off, the academics and rigorous but definitely worth it. I feel like I am learning so much here. The school offers so many clubs and activities as well. They make it really easy to become involved. Also, all faculty and staff and willing to help with any situation. They are so open and make this place feel like home."
Alum,5,The diversity of classes. I was a biology major but I enjoyed all of my classes. I even had a class co-taught by our dean. Susquehanna provides a well rounded education. The class sizes are small so introverts won't get lost in the crowd. It sounds corny but I truly found myself here. I now work full-time as a scientist for a pharmaceutical company and keep my creativity going with a candle business on the side. The town is cute but it's very small so it's not for city lovers. The dorms are very nice though. 
College Freshman,5,"The career development center on campus is great because they offer trips to visit job fairs and breakthrough trips that allow students to visit alumni working at corporations within the city such as JP Morgan and etc. The alumni network is very strong and the services on campus are well. The only thing that is not good about student careers is the fact that there is only a handful of jobs on campus for students, while the town of Selinsgrove has many part-time job positions. Transportation makes it hard for students to travel to job locations that take fifteen minutes to get to driving."
College Sophomore,5,"Classes here are small so student-professor relationships really have the opportunity to exist. Also, counselors vary on how helpful they are but the scheduling process isn't difficult. Workload is pretty average, you can't slack off but it doesn't feel like way too much work either, and if it is talking to the teacher may help. Some of them move deadlines/test dates if you have like 3+ other assignments/tests around the same time."
College Sophomore,5,"Susquehanna has become a second home to me. So many people here, from fellow classmates, to upperclassmen, to staff and faculty work to engage you as a student and make you feel welcome. And they work to create more and more programs, from Preview Days in the summer before your first year to yearly events like our Thanksgiving Dinner, to ensure that this engaging attitude remains a Susquehanna staple. I also love that Susquehanna is dedicated to preparing students of all majors for life and work outside of college. From professional grade science instrumentation and an intensive first year business program to a tenacious Career Development Center, I'm confident in saying that Susquehanna will best prepare me and my classmates for whatever the future holds for us."
College Sophomore,5,"My school experience so far has been nothing but eye opening in the best way!

I am honored to have been able to make this place my home and I can not imagine my life if I had chosen somewhere else."
College Freshman,5,I am double majoring in Art History and Studio Art with a minor in Museum Studies. My professors and advisor have been extremely helpful and personable.
College Freshman,5,"I am in my first year at Susquehanna University and am loving it! The school itself is amazing, safe and clean. Lots of places to eat and a fantastic gym and library. The professors are great and extremely friendly and helpful!"
College Junior,5,"Susquehanna University and the surrounding Selinsgrove community are extremely safe. I have never once felt threatened or unsafe when walking across campus by myself during the daytime/nighttime. On the outskirts of campus there are emergency call-boxes and all students are provided Public Safety (P-Safe)'s phone number. When/if a student feels unsafe when walking across campus or in downtown Selinsgrove, he/she can contact P-Safe via phone and they will pick the student(s) up to transport them (with no charge)."
College Junior,5,"As a junior in the AACSB-accredited Sigmund Weis School of Business, I am receiving a personal and experiential education, thanks to my personable faculty and their courses. Many of our professors present their class material in innovative ways (e.g. through a ""flipped"" classroom or allowing students to contribute to class discussion without raising their hands first). Furthermore, my professors (in and out of the SWSB) care about students and want to get to know us as individuals, not just academically. My economics research mentor hand-picked me to be his assistant during my first semester at Susquehanna in my Global Business Perspectives course. He specifically reached out to me after recognizing my strong ability to public speak and high quality of writing - and getting to know me personally through office hours and my in-class participation. Every day I am grateful for the hands-on experiences afforded to me by my mentor and the genuine mentorship provided by him and other faculty."
College Junior,5,"Our Career Development Center is extremely helpful in assisting students with locating and applying for internships and determining which career field is best for students. For instance, the CDC found out through word-of-mouth that I have a strong interest in working for The Walt Disney Company in the future. As a pleasant surprise, last year a director within the CDC emailed me with contact information to alumni who currently are employed by Disney. Now I have created connections with these alumni (via LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) and hope to utilize these connections to help me when applying for future positions for my dream company."
College Junior,5,"Susquehanna University Housing is some of the best I have seen compared to the other schools I visited while in high school and the other schools my friends attend. At SU, all students (unless you commute) are required to live on campus and our housing ""grows up"" with the students - for example, as a first-year, you live in single/double-rooms in a corridor-style residence hall while, as a senior, you live in a two-story on-campus apartment complete with full amenities (kitchen, bathroom, three bedrooms, living room)."
College Junior,5,"I have absolutely loved my Susquehanna University experience. The AACSB-accredited Sigmund Weis School of Business features PhD faculty who genuinely care about the needs, interests, and ambitions and career dreams of their students. My economics research mentor specifically reached out to me as a first-year at SU after he got to know me not only academically as a student but also as a person (personality, my hobbies, passions, etc.). Since becoming his research assistant, I have been afforded opportunities to coauthor scholarly articles/works, lead focus groups to collect data, and more. As an passionate undergraduate, I am honored to have the chance to apply what I learn in the classroom to hands-on applications in my field of study with an accomplished faculty mentor."
College Freshman,5,Professors are great and you get to know them pretty well
College Freshman,5,Susquehanna University is a great experience.
College Freshman,5,We have a gym that's three levels: Nice for basic working out and sports teams.
College Freshman,5,Provided an easy transition and welcomed students
Junior,4,"The campus is a very beautiful place.  We are a liberal arts school so we are kind of in the middle of no where.  We have a bowling alley, a roller rink, a small mall, and a movie theater.  I have liked most of my professors and enjoyed most of my classes.  There are always on campus jobs available.  There are a ton of clubs to join.  The school provides a lot of majors and minors.  Study abroad is a requirement here which is a great opportunity."
Niche User,4,I visited the Susquehanna Campus after I was accepted into the college. They gave me a very favorable scholarship that I think most people would taken in a heart beat. The campus is in a very safe environment surrounded by a local town that has a great reputation. The school has a lot to provide academically as well as with sports. They also provide great opportunities with studying abroad and internships within your four years there. The University has a lot to offer and is a greta choice for anyone looking to go there.
Sophomore,4,The small campus allows you to always see a familiar face when you are walking around. You will have professors who know your name and are willing to help you one-on-one if need be.
Sophomore,4,"Overall a great university with a lot of opportunities for students and a phenomenal amount of support from faculty unlike what I have experienced elsewhere. There is definitely room for the school to grow in aspects such as student diversity, student services, and a few other places. However, I love Susquehanna and if it is the right university for them, people have a fantastic experience here."
Sophomore,4,"Susquehanna is a great environment for the classic small town college feel. With everyone living on campus there’s a sense of community, and with the small number of students you’ll likely recognize nearly everyone you see around. The professors really care about your success and will go the extra mile to help you if you take the time to establish a good relationship with them."
Junior,4,"This was the best place for learning! The environment is so energetic and fun, there’s never a dull moment! I would really recommend this college for other students looking for a fun and easy to be around environment. Although there was this one teacher, I won’t name I didn’t think particularly liked me but other than that everything was amazing,. Including the food mmmhm. It’s also very easy to pay off ! Campus is always clean and presentable."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very nice community with a beautiful campus. Susquehanna may be a small school comparatively to others, but in that small school environment, you gain individual attention from professors which is absolutely invaluable. It really allows you a better ability to understand your classes and get assistance right from the source as opposed to bigger schools who have graduate students answer all of your questions."
Alum,4,"The biology major at Susquehanna University is pretty good, I've found that it has better prepared me for graduate school and working in lab."
Senior,4,"Susquehanna is often underrated for its academics and opportunities. Many of my professors have been great in advancing me through my majors and encourage you to do as much as you can, which I also strongly advice if you come here! There's also so many clubs and activities to participate in it's hard to choose just a few. Greek Life is also super strong, and is something I didn't expect to be a part of, but found it enlightening regardless.

Downsides include a meh party scene at times. Housing has also become a nightmare in recent years, since Res Life keeps trying to compact more people in less space. The food can also be pretty mediocre at times. 

Despite that, I recommend Susquehanna. There's a lot of opportunity here if you just take the initiative to do it."
Sophomore,4,"The first year at Susquehanna University proved to be challenging, although sophomore year has been amazing. Equestrian Club has allowed me to make forever friends and participate in the community. The academics are rigorous, but challenges you in a good way. The one thing that sets Susquehanna apart from other universities is their Go Program. Every student must study abroad to complete their curriculum. This allows for every student to experience unique and diverse experiences that challenges their everyday life."
Sophomore,4,"Susquehanna University is wonderful college, that because of its small size provides students with amazing opportunities. Although, it seems as though sometimes the administration does not hear the concerns of the students."
Junior,4,"Susquehanna is great universities to learn and mature. For individuals that enjoy communities and places where one can be involved around campus, this school is the right choice. Faculty and staff are very helpful and care for the well-being of the students. The food in the dining hall can get repetitive but you will always find somewhere to eat on campus."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience as a college student is everything I could've asked for; thanks to SU. The amount of resources and opportunities students have to get involved is unreal. Not only will it improve my resume in the future, it will improve my skills, and make me a well-rounded student. The amount of clubs, sports and activities on campus makes me excited to go back. It not only makes me want to learn and be around all intellects, but it gives incoming freshmen multiple opportunities to be happy at SU. The only thing bad I can say about SU is that some Professors, Coaches, and Administrators sometimes take their beliefs too seriously which may prevent students from stating their opinions, even though they want people to disagree with them. This minor thing is something that effects everyone everywhere they go; so really this is something that is unavoidable."
Freshman,4,"Susquehanna University may seem small but it is rather effective in providing the necessary components for education. The size of it as well as the help of the faculty quickly makes the University feel like home and helps first-year students easily adapt to the new environment.

Most of the teachers are nice and somewhat laid back. They help students with questions or topics they may be struggling on and even help to redirect toward projects or things the student may personally find investment or interest in."
Niche User,4,I am excited to start there this fall as a new student. I loved the campus's atmosphere and their focus on each student's individual journey.
Junior,4,"Susquehanna is a very community-oriented school, which is definitely a big plus. Class sizes are small, particularly for language classes (my field of study), so students receive a lot of hands-on learning and are encouraged to participate and ask questions. It is a smaller school in rural Pennsylvania, so there is not a nearby city, sports are a little smaller (D3), and all housing is on campus. If you crave a big city or a lot going on, it may not be for you. The extracurriculars are abundant and excellent though. The professors are very supportive and helpful in providing opportunities for their students."
Freshman,4,So far as a freshman I have been enjoying my time here and really trying to become involved in every way.
Freshman,4,"I think the overall academics is really amazing. All my professors truly care about the subjects they teach and are so incredibly knowledgable on their respective subjects. I feel like the education I am receiving is worth every penny. The food though really is subpar and is not worth any of my money. Also the tuition is just too high. The education is great but $60,000 is too much."
Alum,4,"Susquehanna University was a great experience! Susquehanna had an amazing President, President Lemons. He was very involved in the campus life and socializing with the students. They have a wide range of athletics and academic programs. It is a small campus and your professors really get to know you."
Junior,4,I have had a pleasant experience at Susquehanna University. I am taking classes in many different fields including neuroscience and religious studies. I have joined great organizations that have helped me make the most out of my college experience.
Junior,4,I am currently a junior at Susquehanna. I have enjoyed my experiences thus far and the opportunities that SU offers. I have made great friends and have had the chance to have my mind stretched because I am receiving a liberal arts education. The sciences program here at SU is extremely rigorous but it has molded me into a hard-working and dedicated student who wants to succeed and is already successful!
Freshman,4,"I love the campus. It is very beautiful and I feel at home here. Some professors are really interested in connecting with the students and we have the opportunity to do so. During my college search process, I visited Susquehanna and I kept comparing the others to SU and that's how I knew it was right for me. There is a lot to satisfy your varying interests and I could not imagine myself else where."
Sophomore,4,"I love the Cross Country, Track, and Economics program here at SU. I don't drink, and that is kinda a huge culture here."
Senior,4,"I am a senior Biology major at Susquehanna University. I love the faculty and staff that have shaped my academic experience throughout my 4 years here. I was drawn to Susquehanna by the welcoming nature of the students here, the beautiful campus, and the stellar academics."
Senior,4,"My experience at SU has been very good and rewarding. My professors know who I am, so I'm not just a number, and I've had the opportunity to participate in two different internships based on my experience here at SU!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Susquehanna University has been very good overall. I have met a lot of people I would not have otherwise. The professors and custodial staff are some of the nicest people i have ever met, and through them i have learned a lot of life lessons that i can use both in and out of the classroom."
Niche User,4,The campus as small but large enough to accommodate the students. Their business program is great and so are the staff and students. They had many food options and were very good about talking about financial help.
Freshman,4,The professors are very understanding and incredibly knowledgeable. I row for the crew team and the entire team was welcoming. We kicked off the semester with a team bonfire to get to know the upperclassmen. Susky had more opportunities for its students than I can imagine; not to mention the GO program that requires students to study abroad.
Sophomore,4,"Its a good school with good intentions they need to work on some things to make it a great school. Such as the food, housing, amount of classes, academic services. But the professors are really do care about you and get to know you an personal level."
Alum,4,"Professors care about students and about teaching. Very supportive and helpful staff.
Mostly upper middle class white students from PA and NJ, mostly from suburbia. Foreign students are somewhat isolated. Very few non-traditional students.
Beautiful and historic location but area around campus is rural and economically depressed. The lack of organized weekend activities and options off campus for entertainment leads to a lot of drinking, pot smoking, and boredom. However, most students participate in clubs, sports, fraternities, and volunteering too. People do get to know each other well and form strong bonds. Everybody does one semester as an exchange student, which is unique and necessary.  
Part- time jobs off campus can be hard to find. Career services are generally bad. Alumni career services are poor. 
Again, the best thing about SU is the supportive and close-knit community. Very few people drop out or transfer and most everybody graduates on time."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and professors are helpful and it's really easy falling into the everyday routine there. The size isn't too small or too big and it's easy to navigate.
Junior,4,"The students at Susquehanna University will come to be wonderful friends of yours. When our tour guides say that SU has a wonderful community, they're telling the truth! You will get to know your professors, and will likely work closely with multiple professors. The school offers a wide variety of jobs to students, especially those receiving work study. Unfortunately, like all colleges, there are issues with the administration, in that they sometimes have a misguided view of what the student body wants or needs. However, a wonderful pro of this is that this brings the students closer together."
Sophomore,4,"I just recently transferred into Susquehanna University from a college in California and I am loving it. I have yet to come across a single person who seems unapproachable or rude, the professors are understanding and accommodating, and the level of student involvement is incredible. Students have the opportunity to get hands on experience here, no matter what their major is, that helps to prepare us for the professional world."
Sophomore,4,"Susquehanna University provides an excellent education in beautiful central Pennsylvania. This school really cares about the success and well-being of it's students, offering many majors, classes and services to it's students."
Sophomore,4,Susquehanna have great staff member and professors to help students to achieve their goal. Professors know each students in their class and have close relationship with students. Which this help a lot people succeed and do good in their class.
Junior,4,"While the professors are nice, the school lacks diversity. There are very few professors of color and while there are a handful of LGBTQ* professors, it doesn't match how diverse they advertise the student body to be. There isn't nearly enough housing for the freshman class. The counseling center isn't adequate for the number of students they try and service. The study abroad program, for it being a graduation requirement, is kind of a pain."
Senior,4,"The university does a good job of drawing students in to apply, but once students are accepted and begin, the school does not pay much attention to students. The university has also made many significant changes since I entered as a student in the Fall of 2013, most changes were not for the better. Very few changes that I have seen have been beneficial; however, programs that have stayed consistent and have not made unnecessary changes have been very successful. For example, the main reason I chose to study at Susquehanna was due to the study abroad program. Susquehanna helps students significantly with financial aid, especially for studying abroad, and my dreams of spending a semester in another country came true."
Junior,4,"In the past few years, my experience at Susquehanna has been fantastic. The campus is gorgeous, especially in the fall, and the creative writing program of which I am a part of is inclusive and engaging. I've learned so much since coming here, and am excited to embark on my final year as a student here. I have two majors and have not had to overload even once in my time here, and will not have to. As a senior, I will have ample opportunities to take electives that I'm interested in exploring. The academics are set up in such a way as to make this possible, and I couldn't be more grateful to my university for allowing me to explore my passions in a secure environment that allows me to succeed or fail with little to no consequences."
College Freshman,4,The duration of classes is great and the professors have many office hours to help students if they are struggling. There is an average variety of courses offered since its a small school and the class sizes are generally similar to high school class sizes.
College Freshman,4,Greek Life is a big part of campus life and they all have a community goal and effort that is specific to their fraternity or sorority.
College Freshman,4,The school has a great curriculum and events on campus.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of parties going on, pretty much all week. On weeknights, there are dorm parties, which are mostly just kids packed into one room. On weekends, 18th street is really lively and almost always has something going on."
College Freshman,4,"I don't go to bars but there are a couple places to drink that are literally a block from campus. You could also take an Uber to the town around Bucknell, which is only like 20 minutes away, for more options."
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are really dedicated to their field, which makes it easier to absorb the material they teach in class."
College Freshman,4,I'm not concerned with trying to get a job after school. The on-campus job advisers are very helpful and I'm confident that they will be very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Smith, and I actually like it a lot. The room is a decent size and it's easy to make friends on the floor. The quality of the dorms really depends on what floor you're on. Overall, they keep it very clean. The cleaning staff is great, it's just the kids that make it disgusting."
College Freshman,4,"The experience depends on the type of class and teacher you get. Generally, they are both pretty great (big classrooms, and professors) but it depends on luck and your preferred type of learning. Class size is usually small, and there is a lot of different classes to pick from."
College Freshman,4,"I've never had to use them, but we have an office solely used to help students find jobs after college."
College Freshman,4,"Also not involved a lot in greek life either, so my opinion is pretty narrow"
College Freshman,4,"Pretty great-has its faults, but is still pretty decent."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is diverse in terms of diversity, sexual orientation, and political beliefs. Though we're not very mixed, the community is accepting of anyone and everyone. Everyone is accepting of people's choice and there are no acts of intolerance as far as I've witnessed. People definitely fit in as whoever they are, and everyone is open to new things."
College Sophomore,4,"I definitely know people who don't use drugs and don't feel extremely pressured too, so it's always a choice here. However, if you go out then as long as you control yourself most people are fine. There have been some alcohol problems, but the school is clear about communicating the rules and listening to everyone's side of the story before taking action."
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt in danger, however if something happens Public Safety isn't always quick to respond. Also, upperclassmen have complained about them using fire alarms or invalid reasons to search rooms, which makes it a little questionable. School said they're working on it though. There's not much campus crime so I wouldn't say it's bad."
College Freshman,4,I feel so safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,Very clean and the peopl are nice and great to live with.
College Freshman,4,From what I can see they are very important and people love to play wand watch.
College Freshman,4,Great people yo be around. Also a wonderful learning environment and a beautiful place to live.
College Sophomore,4,"Susquehanna is a Div 3 school, so varsity athletics don't take precedence here like they do at bigger schools like Penn State. However, our athletes and the rest us are enthusiastic about their performance. Our Jacobs' Fitness Center is being renovated this summer to create a varsity only conditioning center that will be under the direct supervision of a full time strength and conditioning coach. The rest of the Fitness Center is also being updated, so that it can serve nonathletes and club athletes just as well as the conditioning center will serve the varsity athletes. As a member of the Rowing team here at Susquehanna, which is registered as a club sport, I can say that club athletics are very popular here and perform just as well as our varsity teams. For example, my team is consistently competes against Div 1 schools at regattas and our men's rugby club team just finished their season third in the nation!"
College Sophomore,4,The connections and job placement coming out of this school in the real world are the only reason im still at the school and even considering staying.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are up to date and the teams are very close. The fan base for female sports isn't the best though.
Freshman,2,"Stuck up, arrogant,rich brat college. Great if all you're looking for is a mediocre education with a great party scene. Terrible if you're looking for a real and useful education."
Sophomore,2,"I wasn't sure why so many students ended up transferring out during this school year, but after finishing my freshman year, it made perfect sense. The food is just ok, I don't feel academically challenged, the town is actually filled with racist white people, none of the students at Susquehanna are nearly as welcoming as they say they are, and the overall campus is just dry and bland.  I, for one, am transferring out by the end of my sophomore year. If you want to have a real ""college experience"", save your energy and don't even apply!"
College Sophomore,2,"The RAs are the ones you hear about that are out to get you, Public Safety goes beyond their call of duty harassing students, and you never really get a sense of family unless you live in Hassinger, which is a very boring hall."
College Freshman,2,No body trusts public safety on campus and measures have been taken as of the end of the year to resolve these issues. I have never felt uncomfortable walking or running around campus by myself however as a female student.
College Freshman,2,Most of athletics teams are not that since. Because of this sporting events usually are not well attended.
College Junior,2,"Public Safety rarely responds to any forms of threats on campus. Their most used ""deterrent"" has mostly been posting an email of something that happened on campus."
College Junior,2,"Often times when I mention how I am going to Susquehanna University most people are unfamiliar with the name, even other people who are from the same state as the university. When I had visited the campus in the past I was promised a plethora of career development resources. Recently, I had visited the career development center in search of potential internship opportunities, in which I was directed into an office where they pulled out a laptop and directed me to an employment website. Honestly, I guess this is a way of looking for an internship, however I figured most of us at this university would have a little more of a network to work off of for career opportunities. Very unimpressed...."
College Freshman,2,No more off campus housing
College Freshman,2,"I don't necessarily like the cafeteria. There aren't many decent tasting options on a regular basis. I prefer Benny's because once you find something you like there, you don't really want to play russian roulette with the cafeteria and hope that there's something good there. Personally, I am trying to get my meal plan reduced."
College Freshman,2,"Seriously, all Pub Safe does is break up parties and write parking tickets. So many people partake in underage drinking, but no one does anything or even seems to care. Last time I checked, that's against the law. It's hard to get sleep or take naps or use my room to study because noise violations are tolerated and nothing is done about people being too loud."
College Freshman,2,"I prefer to bring my own food and eat that. Unless it's a good week at the caf, the food tends to make me feel sick. There are no fresh fruit options. Aramark might say that they have fresh fruit available all the time, but canned fruit isn't fresh. I wish I didn't need to have a meal plan and I also think it's dumb we can't have microwaves in our rooms and don't have stoves in the dorms unless they're apartment style housing."
College Freshman,2,I do not have a car so when I am hungry I just order dominoes or walk to the local Chinese restaurant. Most of the bigger restaurants are near the mall and students would need a car to travel there.
College Freshman,2,The parties are usually on Saturdays and sometimes Fridays and the parties usually have the same music playing.
College Freshman,2,The social atmosphere is not good at all and there is no off campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"Either Domino's or Papa John's for cheap disgusting pizza, or BJ's, a semi-fancy restaurant good for dates, are basically the only options."
College Freshman,2,"There is no off campus housing, which means all parties are under the watch of Public Safety and are boring"
College Freshman,2,"Ele's is the only good option (it's kind of like Panera), but there is usually a half-hour wait or more until you get your food."
College Freshman,2,The Local Area... is very small and as a minority it isn't always welcoming.
College Freshman,2,I'm sure they're just keeping us safe but it always seems like they're coming in and looking to find something wrong. The parking situation is the worst and they're always putting tickets on people's cars.
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't many place you can go, and the few places you can go to aren't amazing. Except BJ's but that could get pretty expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"As a Hispanic students, it can be a little uncomfortable being one of just a few ethnically diverse students."
College Sophomore,2,"Public safety walks and drives around campus, but takes a long time to respond to calls and situations."
College Freshman,2,They wont let us off unless we get more kids here so come here and party
College Freshman,2,"The school is in a very small, pretty rural town, so there really is not much to do. There are a few bars, but I've never been to any of them. If you have a car, you can drive a few towns over in Lewisburg and there are a few more things to do."
College Sophomore,2,We are not allowed to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,The weather in this campus is very bipolar. One day it would be 55 degrees then the next 32 with crazy winds.
College Freshman,2,"The school decided to not let anyone off campus for the year 2014-2015, which was a  really bad decision because now there will be little to no social life! Other than that, the promotion of off campus housing is great with a lot of options all around town."
College Sophomore,2,"There's a shuttle for when the school has breaks, but aside from that, you're on your own."
College Sophomore,2,Off campus housing isn't really an option.
College Sophomore,2,"The housing process is pretty unfair. The school pretty much forces you to stay on campus for all 4 years too, so living in an apartment or house isn't really an option."
College Freshman,2,The football team is awful.
College Sophomore,2,It is easy to get away with a lot of things.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of caucasians, but many different places represented."
College Sophomore,2,"It rains at least several days a week, but the landscape is beautiful."
College Freshman,2,"Selinsgrove tends to have some crazy weather days. It rains A LOT so I would suggest investing in a pair of rain boots. It also snows quite a bit, but don't expect to have class cancelled, that rarely (if ever) happens."
College Freshman,2,"If you like fast food, this is probably the place for you. Just about every fast food chain imaginable has a location on the strip. There is a couple of good options in town: BJ's is the most popular and pretty delicious. This is where everyone goes with their parents and to eat the famous ""bongo bongo"" dip, but save yourself a trip if you won't eat any meat/seafood because the menu will be SEVERELY limited for you. My personal favorite is Emma's Food For Life where your meal will be made with local, organic, natural, etc. ingredients and absolutely delicious. There are plenty of options for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free diets, but there's great burgers if you do like meat! Don't come to Central PA for the ethnic food- even the Chinese is done better by the caf and people here seem to think Dominos/Papa John's is real pizza."
College Freshman,2,"In general, very full of themselves for no reason. Yes, there are people who are attractive/athletic/interesting/fun/intelligent, but most are average in appearance, unexceptional at their sport (or else they would be at a better school), and far from the sharpest tool in the shed."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few parties to go between on Fridays/Saturdays and also Wednesdays, but it's hardly an exciting party scene. This is not the type of campus where you can find something on any given night of the week, any time of the year. There are people who drink/smoke on any given night, but only in small groups in the dorms. You also have to know where to go, and it helps being a girl/having a connection to someone at a party because the houses tend to get crowded/get kicked fast. There are a couple of bars frequented, but it's hardly a plethora options for regular bar crawls."
College Freshman,2,"Nothing to write home about- most facilities are decent but not exceptional. The campus is pretty and the buildings blend well together, both new and old. The new science building is cool and modern but not out of place."
College Freshman,2,"Student athletes easily make up half the student body, but the teams are generally just average. This is a DIII school in the Landmark Conference. Sporting events are attended, but few people stay for the whole game. Would be nice to see more spirit throughout the season, not just when a team has success."
Works Here,1,"The staff are seriously underpaid. The employees (HR) who decide the hourly rate in which the staff (facilities) are paid, should be ashamed of themselves. The way the staff of facilities gets treated is so, so disappointing. The disrespect, ignorance to what that jobs entail, ignorance to how hard the work actually is... for a private, liberal arts school, a person would think this university would treat all employees fairly (especially lgbt and women).. however, these past few years, the favoritism and unfairness of it all has increased drastically. Disgusting."
College Sophomore,1,"Our Greeks somehow manage to party less than the average student. They're SO lame, it's dissapointing"
College Sophomore,1,The school overall is bland and terrible. From the food to the diversity within the student body. I had an awful experience.
College Freshman,1,There is currently no off-campus housing available to the students.
College Junior,1,No one can live off campus.
College Freshman,1,"The school just recently made it so that NO students are allowed to live of campus unless they are a resident (I.e live with their parents). They say its to have a better sense of community on campus, but clearly it is because they want to suck as much money out of students as possible."
College Freshman,1,You will pre-game in your dorm to walk outside and find out that there are no parties or that the cops have shown up and its not even 9pm. 
College Freshman,1,The town people are very scary. Its freezing cold for the majority of the year and there is absolutely nothing to do. 
College Sophomore,1,"Susquehanna attempts keep all students on campus. You have to apply and be approved to live off campus and very few students get approved. They just finished building 18th Street Commons which is considered ""on campus/off campus housing"" because it is apartment style with a full kitchen so you don't have to be on a meal plan. Because SU tries to keep students on campus their upperclassman housing is really nice, so that is a plus. After your freshman year you most likely won't like in a typical dorm again, you'll have the opportunity to go suite-style with anywhere from 3-8 people. Because few students are approved to live off campus, sometimes the party scene is limited since on-campus partying doesn't really happen."
College Senior,1,"I think the percent of Caucasian students is near 90% if not. When student's are away during the summer the percent of Caucasians in Selinsgrove actually goes up, be careful of the townies a considerable amount are racist crazy drunk jackasses."
College Junior,1,"The average student is white, fairly conservative, and a practicing religious Christian. There are a lot of LBGT students though, which is awesome."
College Junior,1,"I personally hated Susquehanna University and I am in the process of transferring schools. A very large majority of the students are white, fairly conservative, and religious (they practice some form of Christianity). There have been multiple instances with swastikas being posted around campus. The surrounding town of Selinsgrove is practically microscopic; the only thing to do is to go a restaurant called BJ's and order Bongo Bongo Dip (which is actually delicious). A ""fun"" outing is to take the school's shuttle bus and go shopping at the local Target. The campus food is awful; I actually got Irritable Bowel Syndrome from it. The dorms are okay... but beware of incredibly large spiders infesting your room. If you are lucky to not have a spider issue, you will have an ant issue. Or both. So, keep a can of Raid handy. Classes and professors are wonderful, though the art program here is unbearably small. On weekends, many students go to parties. They are often disgusting. 100 people crammed into a small space is not exactly fun. Girls get in for free, guys sometimes have to pay. The male students are typically disgusting at these parties. I myself have been raped twice during my freshman year. There was one reported rape on campus which did get handled by the local police. The university's counseling center and the health center are absolutely wonderful. They are so helpful and caring. I think that the health and counseling centers are better than what any other college has to offer its students."
College Freshman,1,"One main caf with limited options and meal hours but still your best bet to get something close to ""real"" food. Very limited options if you are vegetarian, virtually zero options if you are vegan/lactose intolerant/hypoglycemic or trying to eat gluten free. Don't listen to the administration/food service's banter about ""local ingredients"" or natural/organic options; they do not exist. Benny's is the only place open later than 7 (until midnight on weeknights) and serves gross and unsatisfying fast food...very very slowly. Clyde's has ""Mexican"" and is ironically located in the gym. Ele's/""The Periodic Table"" is an attempt to mimic Panera and is located in the new science building. It is not Panera, but it is probably the best on campus. Anything bought outside the caf WILL go over the limit for a meal and tap into your flex."
College Freshman,1,You are in the middle of nowhere. The most culturally stimulating experience you will have here is people-watching at Walmart and spotting a Mennonite at Sheetz. All the big-box stores are here though.
College Sophomore,1,"Required that you house on campus. Then they have RAs and ""Safety"" officers constantly random select and check your houses and rooms. The Head of ""Safety"" is a former ball busting napoleanic police chief Prick by the name of RAMBO (crazy right?) who is connected to local law enforcement. Bottom line is that you surrender your civil rights at the school house gates and don't get them back until they ""LET"" you leave. All of this for your benefit and ""Safety"" of course. This place is like a forced lock down from the 50's. Everyone is very FAT and very very WHITE. Especially the Rambo guy."
College Sophomore,1,Bass Ackward Conservative White Bread roll the Sidewalks up religious Judgementle folk.
College Freshman,1,"My program is great (Creative Writing), but it's nothing special, and I definitely would not do it over again."
College Freshman,1,"First year students are only allowed to park in the first year lot, which is very far away from everything, including the dorms.  This makes getting to your car a chore."
College Freshman,1,Mostly White – The majority of people here are upper-middle class whites
College Sophomore,1,The RA's are very strict in freshman doors. I have seen RA's holding their ears to doors listening for people who are drinking. I was written up for a number of things including running in the hall ways and having more than 2 chairs in my room becasue it was a fire hazard. Punishments aren't very severe but they RA's and public safety hassle you every step of the way.

Sophomore,5,I chose USJ because of the small campus and the family feel. I love the special education and elementary education program. All of my professors are so helpful and I have learned so much.
Sophomore,5,My professors are so helpful and make sure all instructions and assignments are clear. They make sure they are also available to meet virtually and help you.
Sophomore,5,"Overall the school is a very good school. Athletics are rising greatly and everyone there just has a passion and excitement to be there. The teachers do go out of their way to try and help you, making sure every student succeeds"
Niche User,5,taking online classes were amazing and i was able to be flexible with my time. i would realy recommend taking a onlie class.
Niche User,5,"enjoy the school and the classes are amazing, the staff provides great supprt to students . I would love to see the school have more places and opportunies for students to have fun outside the classroom."
Sophomore,5,"It's a small campus so you're bound to know a lot of people. It's like a little community and everyone there is very kind. The professor's also care alot for their students and are always willing to make time for them when they need help. Also if you are struggling academically, the school has tutoring available."
Senior,5,USJ was a great fit for me. The class sizes are small and students get to know professors well. This helped my learning experiences greatly.
Junior,5,"Very small campus and virtually no party life (which I enjoyed). I am a commuter, which this college mainly consists of, and my major is nursing. Most of the students know each other and see the same people every day-- your professor is likely to know your name as well. Nursing program is excellent but very rigorous. Most people at this school are science/health majors."
Graduate Student,5,"The campus, facilities, and amenties are clean and accessible. The faculty and administration team are about 1 or 2 degrees away from direct sources or heads of department which makes for easier communication, answers, and updates. I would add a kitchen at the pharmacy building and/or some more kitchen items."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved how inviting and hands on this university is. The social work program is excellent with their field work, they really care about their students."
Sophomore,5,Being that our university is small in size it makes for a very welcoming environment which made my transition smooth and enjoyable. Everyone is supportive and it amplified my motivation to succeed.
Sophomore,5,Choosing to attend the University of Saint Joseph was one of the best decisions I ever made! The people around are constantly encouraging me to do my best and I know that when I need help there is always a place to go!
Graduate Student,5,"I like the smaller classes and the connections that I am able to make with my professor's.  I feel as though I get a lot of time to interact with my professor's, as well as my peers. 

I would like to see more diversity in my classrooms, however, this may not be related to USJ, as much as it is related to my program.  As a graduate student studying Education, I am a white female student, and would love to see other ethnic groups  studying education as well."
Graduate Student,5,"Undergrad program was better than the grad program, but I wouldn't have chosen any other school. USJ is a wonderful school and has the potential to be a leader in the field of acedemia."
Alum,5,"I am proud to be USJ alum. I am a graduate of the adult learners program, and I felt welcomed when I started as an adult learner. I'd recommend USJ to other adult learners in pursuit of a school to earn their bachelor's degree, but I will not apply to the Masters program due to affordability."
Junior,5,The people here are very helpful and eager to help you figure things out the campus is beautiful and it’s small the ratio is 14:1 so the professor will get to personalize with you and your way of learning if needed
Junior,5,"At the University of Saint Joseph, I enjoy having the small class sizes and having a closer relationship with my professors. My professors would do anything they can to give me extra assistance and available to contact through email."
Senior,5,"I am an Undergraduate rising senior at the University of Saint Joseph and the faculty & staff here are really amazing. They have pushed me to be a better student and person while attending, and have helped me find what I enjoy and better yet, my dream job. I do not think I would get the experience I have had here at any other university around."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about this college. It is very diverse, the teachers are great, the food is good, resources for success are everywhere on campus. There is no way I can not do well."
Graduate Student,5,"I am a graduate student at the University of Saint Joseph (USJ) and really like the small class sizes, the individual attention the profession is able to give you, the proximity to shopping centers.  The information taught is relevant and practical to you’re major. I would like for there to be an increase in men to women ratio. The new President of USJ recently made changes and declared USJ to be a co-education university."
Freshman,5,What I love about the University is how welcomed I felt as I entered the school year as a freshman. I was very nervous about starting college but this school made the transition easier. I think the academics are great here and the university makes it one of their upmost duties to ensure each student's success with various resources.
Sophomore,5,The University of Saint Joseph is such an amazing school and I am so blessed to be apart of such an amazing community. The amount of diversity that you are surrounded by. Staff and faculty are always encouraging to do your best. They have amazing resources that students can utilize if ever in need of help the most common resource is the CAE.
Freshman,5,"I love the dedication of the professors at USJ. They genuinely care about their students, and are willing to go above and beyond to help their students pass. The classes are involved, the homework is reasonable, and the professors give help to anyone who needs it. I feel important at USJ, and like my work, efforts, and dreams matter."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at University of Saint Joseph has been very good because they take their time to reach out to all their students, the class are very small which I like because I tend to ask more question without having fear also it a all women college and I feel more powerful in saying and giving my opinion. Once you go here you would love all the activities, the school, the professor , and everyone here."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at the University of Saint Joseph as an undergraduate student. Although the school is not always the top of prospective students' lists due to the all female aspect, this should actually be seen as a positive of the institution. This school produces strong female leaders that are ready to go out and make a difference in the world. The class sizes are small and the professors are dedicated to helping you succeed. I believe in this institution so much that I will be continuing my graduate studies in the inaugural Physician Assistant Program at USJ starting this winter."
College Freshman,5,"Campus safety is always around and is always there for any student. Even at night if a student doesn't feel safe walking by themselves they are happy to assist them by walking with them just to give them that assurance. It is always a very quiet campus, and a big thanks for campus safety making that happen and giving me a feeling of safety when I'm around campus."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy learning under all of my teachers and know that I can go to them for help and advise. The teachers do their best to help all the students in the classroom and keep the material easy to follow and interesting.
College Senior,5,"There are many choices at both the Dining hall and Jays Nest. They have healthy choices for all types of required diets for the students and guests. The many stations with choices from Sandwiches to hot meals make for a better dining experience. The dining area is large enough for the amount of students and staff that use the facility. 

The Jay's nest on off hours of the Dining area have a nice choice of healthy foods and snacks to get you through to the next class."
College Freshman,5,"I don't know much about the scholarships here, but from my own background I am only grateful for what I could receive from the University of Saint Joseph. Not everyone gets the chance to come here and have to pay nothing out-of-pocket like I am. There's a weight lifted off your shoulders when you can receive so much from a wonderful University as this one."
College Freshman,5,"Uconn and Uhart are very close to the campus and so students often hang out together or go to parties at either campus. The town is small but it's beautiful and there is so much to do because we have the mall that is not too far away, as well as Blue Back Square which is right down the street."
College Freshman,5,All well taken care off.
College Freshman,5,All different types of foods for all types of people to enjoy.
College Sophomore,5,I worked in the Information and Technology Department at USJ and I loved it. The school has many opportunities for jobs and internships.
College Sophomore,5,"The courses are hard, however the teachers are there to help you and will do what ever it takes to help you succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"At the University of Saint Joseph we girls are a family. Everyone here is part of a family and we treat each other as such. The students here are extremely determined and their main focus is education and education alone. I highly recommend this school to any girl who wants to focus on her education rather than the typical ""college life"" portrayed in comedic films."
College Senior,5,A safe town with lots to do!
College Junior,5,"There is a wide range of majors, and it is possible to double major in two completely different things."
College Junior,5,"Both are small majors, and you quickly get to know all of the students and professors.  The professors are always willing to help you however possible."
College Junior,5,"It's a small school, so everyone gets to know each other.  It's nice to always be among friends."
College Junior,5,BIochemistry and Art History.  Neither program requires an additional application.  Understand that the biochemistry major is work-intensive.
College Junior,5,"Both are small majors.  Biochemistry is a wonderful program, and the teachers help you get research experience.  Art History provides trips to study art firsthand."
College Junior,5,Some alcohol as it is a wet campus.  No parties; no drugs.
College Student,5,I dont go off campus for food but if i did i would be happy with the selections
College Student,5,the school is so not a party school. there is no underage drinking and if you do choose to take drugs they will find you and you will be punished
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. There is always a security personnel walking around campus and they are friendly too.
College Freshman,5,Public safety is the bomb. 
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus and i absolutely love my room mate.
Living on campus gives you the opportunity to win cool games at Bingo every Sunday for the girls who stay on campus. It's fun to enjoy the silence and get assignments done too."
Recent Alumnus,5,There is no drug or alcohol use at saint joes. No parties go on either. My school is driven towards education and learning.
College Sophomore,5,"Never seen drugs on the campus, very rare alcohol usage"
College Freshman,5,normal weather. not something that can be controlled
College Senior,5,The social work program is growing and they are hiring professors for their MSW program which is new.
College Freshman,5,"They have an awesome social work dept, may it easy to become acquainted with and get into the program"
College Freshman,5,"There are no drugs on campus and if people want to drink, they go off campus.  There is no feeling of peer pressure and if a person drinks underage or uses drugs there are consequences."
College Sophomore,5,"University of Saint Joseph is an extremely diverse community, one of our core values is diversity. Our community is always excepting of those who are different from us, I feel as though students here are actually eager to learn about others that are different."
College Sophomore,5,USJ campus is extremly safe. I never felt unsafe. Campus safety is constantly doing rounds at each dorm and are always available if needed.
College Freshman,5,business school is amazing its the only thing i like about this school. the ONLY thing....
College Senior,5,Online Courses – The online courses that are available at this school are exceptional.  The professors are always interacting with their students online providing a large quantity of useful information.  The assignments for the online courses were practical and involved information that will be applied in a future career.  I would not change anything about the set up or online interaction with information.  This was a great online program!
College Sophomore,5,Saint Joseph College students are very welcoming and accepting of all students who enter.
College Junior,5,"No Alcohol Allowed! This school has a very strict drug and alcohol protocol. Drugs are not allowed and they will call the police, if they find it. If you are under the age of 21, and you are caught with alcohol, then you'll get in trouble. They do check facebook, so don't leave any incriminating evidence. If you are 21, then you are allowed to have alcohol but there must be less alcohol than other drink, like water, so you're arent have so much alcohol in your room. But if you have someone in your room that is under the age of 21, then you are the same age as that younger person, in the RA's eyes so you wouldnt be able to drink around them. Lots of rules. And some only the RA's know about, so the residents aren't aware that they're doing something against the rules."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Business Management – Lots of reading, as with any graduate program but nothing over bearing."
Sophomore,4,"Online was pretty decent and I still got my education, but obviously it wasn’t perfect. No one was prepared for what was to come so it was all kind of done on the fly but for the circumstances they did very very well."
Senior,4,"I like the close knit community that is established there. However, after men started to attend the University a lot has changed and the environment has turned into male dominant with little attention/help to the females who attend."
Senior,4,The online learning was challenging for both the students and the professor. It was a huge adjustment but all of my professors were understanding and truly did everything in their power to ensure that their students received the same learning that we would have if we were in the classroom.
Graduate Student,4,I have loved my experience so far and intend to stay with the school through the completion of my master's.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, so far it’s been a great experience attending the University of Saint Joseph. The small classes are really helpful and the professors really care."
Freshman,4,Overall a good school with a lot of programs. The professors are good and the campus environment is friendly. The resident life on campus could be better and a lot of residents end up leaving campus for the weekend.
Freshman,4,I like the school. I'll be at the incoming freshman starting this fall the only downfall I would say they have currently is the construction limiting the resources we have available. Also since parts of the school is old it comes with setbacks.
Sophomore,4,Small class sizes. Teachers are always very helpful and create a positive environment to work in and study from. The campus is small and easy to get around. There are tons of resources available to all students.
Junior,4,"It's a great school, with great professors and students. However, I feel like the fees they charge us with are a little absurd. Additionally, there's not a whole lot to do on campus. However, my favorite thing that happens there is Woof Wednesday. Every Wednesday, a therapy dog is brought in to play with us for an hour and that one hour every week relieves so much stress. I really love the school I am at, I just wish there was more detail on the charges we are charged."
Junior,4,"Campus life is widespread and colorful. Atmosphere is committed to thoroughly well-rounded education with focuses in critical thinking. While food and housing rank approximately average, changes may be expected as the University of Saint Joseph welcomes undergraduate men in Fall 2018 for the first time. 
I am extremely satisfied with my choice to attend USJ."
Junior,4,"Overall my experience has been good. As a junior nursing student, who has lived on campus for the duration of my college experience, I feel that I have had a good experience at USJ, and I also feel that my evaluation of the campus is accurate because of the amount of time that I spend there. I thoroughly support USJ and it’s faculty, especially the nursing faculty. As is the experience with any college, there are ups and downs to the handling of situations, as well as pros and cons to every professor-student match. I love, however, the small class sizes, which is often hard to achieve at many of the other schools around the Connecticut area."
Graduate Student,4,Overall experience was good so far . I will suggest my friends to do  secondary  teaching certification course here . Instructors were really great . They helped me a lot .
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoy going to a smaller school. The professors get to know you one-on-one, the school resources like tutoring center, and reference librarian are more available to you, and you get to know your classmates. USJ has a great community of diverse students without feeling like just a number at a larger school."
Junior,4,"It is a pretty good school.  If you live in the dorms everyone knows everyone. Only bad thing about the school that there really isn't anything to do on campus even with the few events planned for students, they often times are planned with I have class and one can only go to Bishops Corner and Blue Back Square so much.  Lastly if you do not have a car and want to come here, think about getting one. The hours and the days the shuttle run have been cut down."
Junior,4,"What I value most about this university is the small size. It has allowed me to grow academically, but also personally and professionally!"
Graduate Student,4,"I like that the University of Saint Joseph community was very welcoming and friendly. There's open communication between students and professors and staff. Also, professors are willing to help students when they need it. Small class sizes help students with getting individualized attention and direction from the professors."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Saint Joseph is a wonderful school, but it could use some improvement. Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has ""quiet hours"" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers. Some teacher loves what they're doing and love to work with you until you understand what you are doing. Other teacher don't understand how to convey concepts to students in a manner that is understandable. The class sizes are really small, so you get to know the teachers personally as well."
Sophomore,4,"Overall it is a very good school. The education and academic opportunities range and provide the students with many options to try new things. Every professor that I have had the pleasure to meet has done an excellent job. Both with teaching the academic class, but also showing that they care for the students well-being and success. The school is quiet and there is not a huge party scene, but there are other things to do around West Hartford that are close. The sports teams are also fun and the athletic teams tend to be very close with one another. Overall the school does a great job providing an exceptional education for their students."
Sophomore,4,I liked the professors as well as the classes offered at University of Saint Joseph. I also enjoyed the small class size and campus. I would change the tuition.
Junior,4,"I used to live on campus but always went home on the weekends. There was not a lot of things for students to do on campus so no one ever wanted to stay. I now commute to school and like it much better. There's great resources at the school like the librarians, CAE, and writing tutors. Wonderful faculty and professors who help students pursue their dreams."
Freshman,4,"University of Saint Joseph is a very good university to attend too. Everyone in this university are helpful and supportive to each other.  This school has a small campus, which is helpful for incoming students to not get lost when going to classes. Also the professors knows students names and understands the students."
Sophomore,4,The school is VERY small but the professors are pretty good. It's very much old school with very little online.
Sophomore,4,"It is a VERY small school, definitely be aware of that while applying. However, this does create a very comfortable environment swith professors and fellow classmates."
Senior,4,"I am glad that I transferred to USJ. The professors and students are very friendly and I love the welcoming environment. The sciences are great here, you will love the classes and teaching."
Sophomore,4,"This school has a beautifully welcoming community. Everyone here is interested and invested in your success as a student and future career-woman. Class sizes are small allowing me to get to know my professors and classmates on a personal level. This comes in handy when its essay or test time because i have a ton of resources to go to. I also love the CAE at this school, also known as the Center of Academic Excellence. The tutors have very flexible hours and the ability to get help as a group comes in handy because you have other students experiencing similar challenges in the same class. At USJ you are challenged, encouraged, empowered, and inspired to achieve so much more."
College Freshman,4,University of Saint Joseph gets a fabulous representation for their nursing program and has a very good stigma going on for them.
College Freshman,4,I feel like here I have a place to blossom and be myself. Everybody here is very accepting and willing to help each other out which creates a lot of close bonds with everybody. Being at an all girls school is very different but it is totally worth it in a long run because of that focus on education.
College Sophomore,4,THE SCHOOL IS SMALL BUT IT FEELS LIKE ANOTHER HOME.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience so far at USJ honestly hasnt been much since im starting in august, however, my experience with meeting all staff there has been awesome. Everyone there seems extremely nice, friendly and helpful. They all seem as though they genuinely care."
College Freshman,4,As far as I am aware there is very little crime on campus and I always feel safe walking around campus. Because we are near Hartford we do need to be careful off campus but public safety is there to escort us as needed.
College Freshman,4,I would always the school again given the chance. I love that I can always talk to and ask for help on a wide variety of topics from many teachers and advisors. I have made many friends and the systems in place are very student friendly.
College Freshman,4,"The course can be hard, but the professors are available to help us with anything we need."
College Freshman,4,In the nursing major we start clinicals sophomore so we get experience.
College Freshman,4,School has been an amazing experience for me. I've made many new friends and learned so much. I'm excited to continue my schooling and to graduate.
College Student,4,Can be better like offer financial help to student
College Student,4,Professors are very considerate if your an athlete
College Sophomore,4,It's had excellent academic programs
College Senior,4,The variety of restaurants is great.
College Senior,4,I feel the administration has been very helpful with any issue on campus. The students wanted to do a silent not aggressive demonstration concerning the Ferguson tragedy. The Administration looked over the meaning and advocacy of the demonstrations and supported the students in doing so. I felt it was a great way to be involved with the community of St. Joe's and also the national needs of showing care for ALL individuals of our nation.
College Senior,4,"The process was went well. I rarely had to go into the Financial aid office. If I had issues, which I had few the workers and counselors at the financial office were every helpful in finding other options for aid."
College Senior,4,"I don't live on campus I am a commuter, yet i hear good things from the students that do. They speak of many oncampus events that include all residents on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The Jay's Nest has a great variety of foods and beverages. They also have microwavable food or food you can cook that you can bring back to your resident hall and heat or cook it I the kitchen. They make the best chicken tenders
College Freshman,4,It is really good unless you can't have meat or animal products.
College Freshman,4,"Expensive, one door, walls suck, floors dirty"
College Freshman,4,"Filling out the FAFSA is confusing especially when both of your parents never went to college, and therefore have never seen the form, but almost every school requires completion so its not the school's fault. I am satisfied with the amount of financial aid I am receiving. I would suggest contacting the school if you are unsatisfied with the amount you have received because the admissions advisors will even tell you that if you call and say you need an extra thousand dollars or so, they will more than likely provide with more aid."
College Freshman,4,Campus safety officers are always present on the campus. There are blue buttons which are lit up at night that you can press if you feel unsafe at any time. Campus safety will even walk you to your car at night if you feel unsafe. The campus is very small and secure and I always feel safe when I'm there.
College Freshman,4,"There are many options for off campus dining near my school because Blue Back square is right down the street and there are multiple different restaurants. Some of the restaurants are sit-down restaurants, while others have to go options. There is even a whole foods for someone who wants to eat healthier and a Walmart grocery store as well."
College Freshman,4,Most girls come here because of their financial aid packages. The school tries its best to take care of you.
College Freshman,4,"There are lots of places near Bishops Corner, in Blueback square, or West Hartford Center."
College Freshman,4,Campus security does a great job.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very helpful. Do not be afraid to ask questions.
College Freshman,4,Most care for their students and want them to be successful so they provide lots of help.
College Sophomore,4,Campus security is extremely nice and helpful. They treat us like we are their own daughters and are therefore protective of us and take our concerns seriously.
College Sophomore,4,Most teachers are helpful if you approach them and show an effort.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of healthy options. Whole Foods, Big Y and Trader Joe's are nearby. Tons of restaurants."
College Sophomore,4,"VERY, EXTREMELY FRIENDLY CAMPUS! I love it but since it is a Catholic university, it is a little strict."
College Senior,4,There are so many great restaurants in the area to choose from. There is always a new place you can try.
College Junior,4,"West Hartford is a middle- to upper-class community, with easy access shopping and medical care."
College Junior,4,"There is 24/7 security on campus, with rounds every hour."
College Junior,4,"The dorms are traditional, with between 40 and 130 people per building."
Sophomore,2,"I have lived here for about a year and a half. There are zero parties, food is terrible,  Public safety is very strict, buildings are breaking, there is a very small gym, heat doesn't work, there's no A/C, extremely small class sizes, and no transport if you don't have a car. The pros are small classes, good nursing program, pretty campus when there no construction,  close to West Hartford ( there is no public transport or shuttle there, however), its in a nice area. Really a commuter school that happens to have dorms basically. Everyone also leaves each weekend, a car is almost a must. They also don't have enough parking spots so, its double edge sword. It also a D3 school so.... and no student life like clubs and stuff"
Graduate Student,2,"USJ has a pretty and small campus so it is easy to get around. The Physician Assistant program is new and needs work. Sky high deceleration rate (by national standards) absolutely no support for academically struggling students (weeder program), and poor quality faculty with limited teaching experience that bully their students."
College Freshman,2,"Dorm rooms are fairly small with little to no space. Beds are very uncomfortable. There is no central air and they do not allow AC in dorms. They do not allow a lot of things including extension cords, tapestry, candles, etc. Everything is kept very clean though."
College Freshman,2,Athletics is not very popular at this school and definitely not what we are known for. The teams are okay and there is a good sense of teamwork though. We do not have much for athletics here and the gym is quite small.
College Freshman,2,"It's okay sometimes, but occasionally I can't find anything to eat so I'll end up having cereal for dinner. However, when they do ""normal"" foods, it's good. Global where the chef makes your food to order is also good at times."
College Freshman,2,My father has myself and my sister both in college and he is a single parent as our mother is deceased. Do not feel as if I get much help.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no guys on campus, it is an all girls school."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of diversity. I could probably count the number of ethnic minorities on two hands.
College Student,2,the town isnt too far but its far enough that you dont want to walk. wish the school provided the students with busses everyday not just on the weekends when im not there
College Junior,2,"They are not very helpful with getting scholarships, only loans"
College Freshman,2,"The only boys on campus are in the graduate program, but the girls are awesome. Most of us are friends."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mostly Catholic kids from the Northeast, upper-middle class to wealthy. Pretty vanilla. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Pretty lame. Off-campus bars are accessible, but few; they don't card, so that's a plus. If noise, crowds, sloppy drunks and sticky floors are your thing, you'll be happy. Otherwise, good luck. Also: walk home with buddies. If you walk home alone, drunk, at 3am, there's a decent chance that someone or several someones will mug you, possibly brandishing a steak knife, and take your iPhone and wallet. Don't be a moron. "
College Junior,2,"Most students either live on campus or commute from home (CT residents).  There are some apartments and houses available nearby, but they are fairly pricey.  West Hartford is a very nice, safe area."
College Junior,2,"When a person steps on campus at the University of Saint Joseph, they may feel overwhelmed by the disproportion of race. There is a large number of Caucasian students and a smaller portion of African Americans and Hispanic individuals. There are only about 20-30 Asian students. It would be nice if the population at USJ was more diverse. Having a diverse population of college students allows for a rich environment with many fulfilling friendships and classes. I don't think the University of Saint Joseph has gotten there yet."
College Freshman,2,"In West Hartford there are many apartments available.  They are average apartments, but i personally do not know much about them because I live on campus. However, they are easy to find and close to campus."
College Freshman,2,"Not much around. But as you leave campus and drive, Blue back square in Hartford is Beautiful and i've heard there's nice parks.. The clubs are decent though, not the best. Plus there is a nice mall called westfarm mall."
College Freshman,2,"West Hartford is a very expensive town so unless you want to rent a house with 10 other people, you will not be able to afford to live here. It's just cheaper to live on campus, and by cheap I mean the best option. No one wants to move to a cheaper town just to have to waste gas to come to classes. It's more convenient simply to live on campus."
College Senior,2,"There is not enough parking on campus and it's difficult to find a spot that won't result in a ticket.  It was bad before inclusion of the pharmacy school and now, it's just impossible.  You need to arrive really early in order to get a space.  Tickets are $100. You don't really need a car on campus as the campus is small enough to walk around but you do need one if you want to do anything else."
College Sophomore,2,AWFUL! Always find myself parking where im not supposed to because there are no spots and i get tickets.
College Freshman,1,There is only a small gym on my branch campus and most students do not utilize it because of its small size.
College Freshman,1,It sucks professor are not supportive
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process was horrible. No one helped me. They got it all messed the first time they did it.
College Freshman,1,This is not a party school at all. There is no parties on campus.
College Freshman,1,If you aren't a nursing major then DO NOT COME HERE IT SUCKS.
College Freshman,1,Girls who play on teams think they're the best.
College Freshman,1,There are absolutely no parties. The girls call RAs on duty on you if they even think you are partying. Upperclassmen who live in suites have more opportunities but it is still very quiet on campus. RAs and campus security have no tolerance.
College Freshman,1,Girls tell on you if you even smell like weed. They also judge you if you like to drink or smoke. They will call RAs on duty if your music is loud and will tell on you if you have a visitor past a certain time. Campus security treats you like criminals and they're sort of racist.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life which sucks.
College Sophomore,1,I can't even think of it without feeling bloated and sick.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office has two women that practically do nothing. You can never get the answers you need or the help that you need. They shove papers in your face and the lady at the front desk has the worst attitude. But outside of the financial aid office, there are financial advisors and counselors that are much better."
College Student,1,wish we had greek life
Recent Alumnus,1,"Piss-poor food, and madly expensive. Hours aren't great. The main dining hall is a-la-carte. Unlimited quantities of mediocre-to-decent food; you can probably find something decent. But it's not worth the price, and it's not very good."
College Sophomore,1,"the dining hall leaves a lot to be desired. Horrible food, and high prices. The declining balance side is ten times better but also costs more and you only have a limited amout of declining balance (i ran out in 5 weeks). The surrounding eateries: Wendy's, Cosi, Starbucks, Larry's. Wendys is open all the time and is good. Cosi has weird hours and often closes at 7 on Fridays. Starbuck's hours are even worse closing at 4pm which is a problem if you have a 2:30 class across campus. Larrys is only good on a weekend after 1 am"
College Freshman,1,"Parking is very hard to find at the school. People like to go home on the weekends, so it seems that everyone has a car. The parking spots are limited and first come first serve."
College Freshman,1,"Truly Poor. Its only available on the weekends, Friday till 11pm, Saturday till 10pm and Sunday till 6pm.....Transportation is very difficult, it should provided at all times, but its not."
College Sophomore,1,"There are not a lot of transportation options, and by not a lot I mean none. There is a shuttle that can take you to the mall, but you have to call and wait around for it for too long, and then you don't get picked up or dropped off on time. There really isn't any type of transportation, unless you use the buses or one of your friends or yourself has a car. That's practically the only way to get around unless you walk."
College Freshman,1,I came to this school over west virginia university because i thought hey i really need to focus on school i should go with the smaller school. well there is absolutely nothing to do here that is fun. everyone is from central and south jersey and are stuck in 2007. i am done with all my hw before 7pm and no one wants to have fun during the week. frat parties are the worst things I've ever experienced. so crowded and the keg is kicked at 10 30. I've been to better parties my freshman year of high school. this school is full of a bunch of try hard unattractive and simple minded white kids who got a lot of scholarship money because their grades were mediocre at best. you never see any upperclassmen on campus since they all live 20 minutes off campus so good luck trying to have a social life because if you do not have a fake id you are screwed.
College Freshman,1,"no school spirit, no unity. no one tailgates for events. tailgates are one of the best things about going to sporting events and no one does it here. everyone is so sheltered and safe. sports are decent at best at this school"
College Senior,1,"Non Existent Social Life – i go to a school where the majority is girls! i wish there was a more variety of guys to interact with and i also wish there was more of a social life. since it is a commuter school there is very little interaction off campus with other students. Everyone just goes to class and goes home, never any parties."

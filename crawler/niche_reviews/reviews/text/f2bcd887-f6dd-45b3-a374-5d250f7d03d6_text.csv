Sophomore,5,"All of my courses are online due to COVID. The teachers do a great job being sure that the Livestreamers are included in lectures, and providing as close to an in-class experience as possible."
Sophomore,5,"I have attended several academic institutions, but NYACK stands above them all. The welcoming atmosphere, the Christian foundation, the heart of the teachers, and other staff members makes for an unforgettable experience."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are great because you still have to engage with students and the professor, which to me makes the experience like being in a classroom. Work assignments are done weekly and tutoring or any help is still available if needed. Professors can be reached by email or an appointment can be made to see them in person."
Sophomore,5,"Great college that offers many major areas of study.  The professors and all faculty staff are very caring and offer help at all times where needed. Even though the school is religious, religion is not pushed onto you. They allow you to learn religion at your own pace, which is comforting. Love this school,can't wait to be a graduate."
Sophomore,5,"I took online classes by default, because of social distancing and remote learning. The professors made that transition very seamless and provided instruction for every assignment given. They uterlized every way of communication we had video conference classes and also they made the online experience very interesting. We had so much supporting material to aid in the completion of assignment and to add to our learning experience. I will be taking more classes online because of my experience and not to mention the  very supportive professors"
Sophomore,5,Nyack is a faith based College which promotes faith and scholastic achievement. Nyack ensures that students leave prepared to serve the community in more ways than one
Alum,5,"I currently hold a B.S. in Organizational Management from Nyack College. As a military veteran, I appreciated the Adult Education programs. I received high job offers over the years and the degree has been worthwhile. I would recommend this college to anyone. The faculty members were willing to assist and friendly. After Nyack College graduation, I then moved on and graduated with an MBA. Currently, I work as a Program Analyst in Washington DC Metro Area and am very happy with my career opportunities."
Niche User,5,"I am not a student but visited. Though the person I was originally supposed to visit was out of office because of miscommunication (and summertime), they quickly made sure I could speak to someone else. The tour guide was very kind. They spoke about God very naturally/easily. The admissions counselor I spoke to was also very sweet and helpful, but not sugarcoaty.
The NYC campus is clean and has a great layout. Area was clean and safe, plenty of eating options."
Sophomore,5,I liked the professor and students. My experience at Nyack has been rewarding. The availability of classes was ok but could have been better.
Freshman,5,My experience so far has been amazing. So Grateful to attend a Christian School where I can freely talk about God.
Junior,5,"It literally has changed my life. I am so impressed with the academic atmosphere and the professionalism of the staff. I did not really know what to expect going in, however, it has been one of the most transformative decision I have ever made in my life. My college mates have been an added bonus, it was a pleasant surprise that I had not anticipated. Seeing the growth in everyone is a source of inspiration to me. It makes me want to be a better person and really utilize the knowledge I have attained at Nyack College in the real world."
Graduate Student,5,I live overseas and it was very difficult to find an online graduate program that would work with me. The staff at Nyack were not only accommodating but very kind. I was truly impressed.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy Nyack College because this school have been helping me accomplish my goal in being a musician and singer. Very respectful principal, faculty, staff, teachers, and classmates all working together. Brings an excitement on continuing my education. Nyack College is a blessing to be apart of."
Niche User,5,"Nyack College is a place where you can grow so much spiritually and as a person alltogether. If you want to encounter God and learn what your purpose is, this is the place to go. They have great extra curricular activities for ministry. Great praise dance team, step team, chapel worship teams, chorale and a gospel choir!"
Freshman,5,"I haven't attended yet, but I am going in as a freshman this next semester. So far, the process has been great, with great relationships between me and the administration."
Niche User,5,The community is very welcoming. I really loved my visit. Especially the tour around the college. I met a lot of good teachers and students.
Senior,5,"Nyack has a well being feeling, mind, body and soul, very close to highways and the palissades mall. A small community of professors and students make learning possible, if you want to be close to home while away from home come to nyack college !"
Freshman,5,"At first I thought I just chose a college to get my degree and leave. But I actually became apart of something great. The vision, the foundation and great leaders of this community has welcomed me with open arms to do more than just get a degree."
Freshman,5,"I love that as soon as I walked on campus, the people I met were welcoming and so helpful. I love the sense of community that Nyack has. One thing Iâ€™d change is the lack of a visual arts program or club."
Freshman,5,Nyack College is an amazing christian seminary alliance school. I have finished my first semester there as a freshman on campus and so far it has been one of the greatest. It has it's ups and downs but the professors are there to actually work with you and the guidance that we have is great.
Sophomore,5,The professor are helpful getting you to have the right classes to ease  some of the pressure  of college  life.
Graduate Student,5,"I loved the community, the availability of the professors and the holistic approach of this school to theology and biblical studies."
Alum,5,"I went to Nyack when they had a branch in Dayton, Ohio.  The school was great.  I got a ton of help of everyone that worked there and the professors were amazing.  I would recommend this school to anyone."
Alum,5,Great school. Wonderful professors and love the fact that it has several campuses  and great place to study
Freshman,5,"Nyack is great if you're looking to grow spiritually. There is a culture here, a very real sense of community. It is easy to get to know people, but you have space if you want it. The food used to be a slight complaint, but after my first semester survey it changed by second semester! Chapels might be better off at night, but overall Nyack is one of my best experiences."
Freshman,5,I liked that being here everyone is like a small community and are very caring for one another. I like that we have chapel and the music is very up beat. I like the fact that there are small groups to earn chapel credits. I like that they don't force you to have a relationship with God but they get you involved in it by having to attend 27 chapel credits a semester.
College Junior,5,"I love my school. There would never be another school like mine. I enjoy every minute I am in school. If I could do it again, I would."
College Sophomore,5,I love it! It's extremely diverse
College Sophomore,5,"There has never been a crime in the campus. I feel completely safe & confident. My safest and confident can be shown every time I leave my wallet, phone or iPad in the library and go downstairs. Once I come back none of my things are missing! It's super safe! Love Nyack college"
College Sophomore,5,"I love Nyack College! It's a very small community, super friendly and caring. Everyone in the school pushes you to grow and if I ever want prayer or a advice anyone is willing help me out. If I ever had to redo my college search I wouldn't have picked Nyack College this is the only school I applied to but, it's very expensive for me. If I had scholarships then I'll stay! But I have been applying and no one reaches back to me."
College Sophomore,5,"Because the classes at school hold 15-20 per room. So more time for a personal setting, and less stress. So far my professor show great pride in knowing they can satisfy their students needs."
College Sophomore,5,I'm in the city and police are on every corner
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. To me it's like my second home. My experience so far has been welcoming. And the best part this college is blessed with Jesus love.

College Sophomore,5,There is no drug usage allowed.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my program at my school. Christian school, so be prepared to do devotionals from time to time with your professors and classmates. It was my weekly time with God and like-minded individuals."
College Sophomore,5,"Although I am a part time student, I have found all my classes to be quite challenging.  I have not had one complaint against a single professor at Nyack College.  I believe that each and every one of them  (the one's I have had for my classes) to be dedicated to the cause of Christ, the education and spiritual formation of their students as well their own personal integrity."
College Sophomore,5,"I am attending Nyack at the suggestion of my pastor.  While I am receiving a great liberal arts program, I am greatly enamored of the pastoral ministry core curriculum, the knowledgeable professors and the internship possibilities."
College Junior,5,"I do not live on campus. I attend evening classes because I work full time. The campus that I attend has never instituted any policies that has affected either my academic or social lives. The only requirement is that the assignments be done on time which can affect your academic or social life if you are a serious student like myself. During the school term, depending on my classes, my social activity decreases dramatically. I socialize during the summer."
College Freshman,5,I personally do not mind it because i did not go there to waste my time doing things I ought not to do.
College Freshman,5,"The computers are very reliable, and fast."
College Freshman,5,I did not see any use of drugs on campus.
College Freshman,5,There really is no fear on campus of anything dangerous unless an animal is nearby which is rare. There has been no campus crime since I have been here or that I have heard of.
College Freshman,5,Great we all have different views towards it
College Freshman,5,The school offers a good amount of scholarships
College Freshman,5,We are in the city of new york
College Freshman,5,We have both dell and iMacs
College Sophomore,5,Nyack College is known for being intentionally diverse and we live up to that expectation. We have foreign students from all over the world. There are many people of many different ethnic backgrounds as well.
College Sophomore,5,I love my Psychology program. My professors provide one-on-one discussions with students. If I had the opportunity to do it over again I wouldn't change a thing. I'm very happy with the program I'm in. I plan on becoming a Psychologist and potentially specialize in drug and alcohol abuse. Finding jobs in this economy with a degree has proven to be difficult so I am concerned about finding a job. 
College Junior,5,"Students are able to have a great social life without having to use drugs or drink alcohol. There isn't much peer pressure, and the school policy is very strict. "
College Junior,5,Nyack College facilities are very modern and clean. There are many students actively engaging on campus. 
College Junior,5,"I received immediate responses and replies through email from my financial advisor. They are very helpful, and try to help students receive as much aid as they need. "
College Junior,5,"The campus is very strict about the honor code, and abstinence from substances such as alcohol or drugs. "
College Junior,5,I have heard from a friend that the athletics at the Nyack College Rockland Campus is great. 
College Freshman,5,very spacious and very clean
College Freshman,5,i very rarely com across a problem not being able to access a computer or the network. the wireless network ALWAYS works. 
College Freshman,5,i love it. the professors are helpful. the registration was easy even when i needed a little help. the professors break down the curriculum very well and there are many options when you need extra help. the work load is a lot but there are resources that are there to help you. 
College Junior,5,Honestly very safe and secure on campus. Security is pretty much always around.
College Junior,5,"Little to no use is visible, but some students are known to drink at times."
College Sophomore,5,"DRUG SCENE? at Nyack College? Forget it. Minus the handful of students who smoke weed or pop molly or whatnot, you'll find nothing but Jesus-loving Christians here. They don't call it The Dryack for nothing, but you'll be surprised that a lot more people do smoke a hell lot of weed than you think. It's just on the low. Being lowkey is stressed amongst the group of people who blow it down."
Freshman,4,"For one thing, Nyack is a Christian College. It just has this homey feel and everyone is so welcoming and friendly. It is just a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online classes. But I know in class, the professors ae good and they help make sure that you understand what you are doing."
Graduate Student,4,I am an ATS student in the MDiv program. I love the hands on experience that is taught. I love the idea of a community atmosphere. The professors are great and will work with you.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Nyack college is going well so far. I am in my sophomore year and the Manhattan campus experience is great. There's good food nearby all in walking distance, the diversity of students is a plus and they all are genuinely pleasant people. The staff is professors are amazing. They are always willing to thoroughly help with any situation."
Freshman,4,I have really enjoyed my first year at Nyack. It has been a difficult transition going from home to college out of state but the people at Nyack have been great. My only complaint would be that i wish they had better selections at the cafeteria and that they had better hours.
Graduate Student,4,Nyack College is a christ base center university. It posses diversity in their students culture and community. Its number one goal is to equip each student with a higher academic knowledge and skills as we as to equip the Christian community to serve with excellent their society.
Sophomore,4,"Nyack is like a small community. Everyone knows each other, everyone loves eachother and gets along. The campus is filled with the spirit of God."
Sophomore,4,"Nyack is unique. Everyone you meet cares about the individual and wants to help them succeed. Because of this, we have a spiritual formation team that is always ready to pray with you or just talk with you or mentors you. We have a Counseling Services team that I love who will meet with you for free. But above all we have an amazing community filled with internationals, third-culture kids, athletes, musicians, etc.  I have only been going for a year and although it does have its flaws there is nowhere else I would rather be. This is where I feel at home, this is a place where I am surrounded by people who care about me. So this is where I am staying."
Graduate Student,4,"Very enganging professors who knew the field of subjects studied.
My exposure to this program allowed me to serve as advocate, activist and volunteer with a national moms group. I now advocate for children, women, and families all over the country at the federal and state levels on early education, gun violence, and paid leave to name a few."
Graduate Student,4,"I feel that although it's a small college, the relationships will last a lifetime. I've never been so excited to go to school again."
Sophomore,4,"Nyack is a very diverse school with a good spirit about its students. The best parts about Nyack are the things that can't be seen: student life, academics, personable professors, and an ability to coexist. Living conditions and food are tolerable, but it shouldn't completely deter anyone from attending Nyack"
Freshman,4,Everyone is very nice and the professors seem to actually care about you. It is a very small community so you get to know a lot of the people on campus.
Sophomore,4,I love what Nyack stands for. I came to Nyack because it displays the love the school has for Christ. I plan to grow closer to God this year. Going into my sophomore year I want to see a change in my walk with God and I hope Nyack can help me reach that level of relationship that I need to reach with God.
Junior,4,"Nyack promotes an safe and community centered environment. I love being here because I have learned so much about myself and have been  blessed with a number of opportunities that I never even knew I wanted. The professors  challenge you academically, spiritually, and personally. Nyack's community is divers so you are able to met and learn about so many different kinds of people. Over all, my time here has been an enriching experience."
Freshman,4,I love that the teacher are very humorous and straight forward. I am still amazed with the fact that all my teachers pray before starting class.
College Freshman,4,"Im A Freshman So Im Getting Used To All The Works , Specially That Its Online But Overall I Like My Professors And I Love My Major ."
College Freshman,4,"Under Construction , But Great Building"
College Freshman,4,"So Far I Have Heard Few Announcement , But Usully Its On Each Floor's Tv And On The Fb & Instagram Page ."
College Freshman,4,"I Love The Environment , Classmates , And The Faculty . Only Thing Is That Is A Bit Expensive ."
College Senior,4,"The workload is accessible to allowing students to understand the material through books, online programs, and the school engine. Professors are easy to reach through emails and school engine.  Tutors are available"
College Senior,4,The school motto is to be intentially diverse
College Senior,4,The school policy is that there is no drinking on campus at all. And people can not come back drunk....
College Senior,4,The professors go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  when you need help with a subject they are reasonable and helpful
College Senior,4,"Being a private school, they don't have every sport like other colleges. But with the sports they do have. They do an awesome job representing school spirit"
College Sophomore,4,The school attended was a christian college. So most of the the students share the same values. Due to the diversity of Professors they are many opportunities for after college jobs.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Nyack was very good. I fell in love with the people and support that they gave. I don't think i used all the resources and opportunities they're to my advantage but it is something i have learned i need to do. I hope and wish I am able to return but as of now It docent seem that i will return due to money issues. Hopefully in applying for this scholarship I am one step closer.
College Sophomore,4,As a freshmen my living experience was what would consider better than most. I was in location with students that ranged from freshman to seniors. I had my own private bath. Everything ran smoothly.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics at my school were a big part of my time at Nyack. Although some teams weren't the best people were always there and supportive. Sports were another way for people all around campus to interact. Just by coming out and supporting teams I was able to make friends with people i probably wouldn't on any other terms. Also just by attending games other students and clubs were able to show and introduce other cubs and activities at the sporting events.
College Junior,4,Nyack is great at helping every student.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors in Nyack really care about the students. It was different I thought they weren't going to know my name or accept any excuse. But Nyack professors are different they value, care and want to see the students grow & become successful."
College Sophomore,4,"To be honest I would t know how to answer, because I have yet to graduate. So only a student of experience will be able to best explain ."
College Senior,4,My school is great. I love the professors and the content of the courses. I just wish the tuition was lower. It's a great school but not for the amount of tuition they're charging.
College Sophomore,4,Classroom environment gives a better student teacher relationship. Also teachers open up the floor for discussion on how the subject being taught is going to help the student outside or after college.
College Junior,4,"There is a lot to do in the area! If you are into nightlife, there are many bars downtown.  There is also a huge four story mall just down the road from the college.  There are also many artsy places and museums.  There are also local parks and hiking opportunities and there are always beautiful views, as it is right on the Hudson River."
College Junior,4,"The Education depart is like a family.  The professors and heads of the department really care about their students and work to provide the best learning environment possible.  Because it's a small school, the professors truly know and care about their students and strive to help students achieve their goals and go above and beyond the degree requirements."
College Sophomore,4,"The city campus, recently moved near world trade center. We are near the jewish museum, american indian museum, and the staten island ferry. There is s many ways of transprtation, depending where you live. It is very easy to get to jersey. There are shopping areas, parks, the brooklyn bridge, food areas and the statue of liberty that is not far to view."
College Freshman,4,"They have a great Business Administration program.  The Professors are great and the courses are also good.  they also have good internship opportunities for Business Majors.  Business is also a easy major to get into, there aren't any special requirements, and its a good major."
College Freshman,4,"The workload is not bad, but you should still stay on top of your studies as always. I think the curriculum is good and registration process does not take that much time or energy."
College Freshman,4,"I will be in intercultural studies and it is great, we learn about missions and how to plug into missions once we graduate. I suggest considering all majors, and choosing whichever major fits you best, or you can come in undeclared"
College Freshman,4,"They were so generous, and gave me a $9,000 academic scholarship right off the bat, which helped a lot. If they want you at the school they will try to provide for you the best way they can"
College Freshman,4,They try to keep everyone safe and will be protective of everyone.
College Freshman,4,"You have options to go to the mall which is a short drive and get some late night food, or you can go into town for food."
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are all great, many will pray before class and it sets the class of on the right foot, knowing that we are all here to not only learn but grow closer to God."
College Senior,4,There is no Greek life at my school.  I go to a Christian College and either Greek life is not allowed or it is not focused on.  There are organizations and small group but I have yet to see any sororities or fraternities on campus.  From previous schools I attended in the CUNY systems Greek life was there but no one really took it seriously.  In a NYC school setting where dorms are limited many students do not have time to be involved in such things and just want to get their education over with sadly enough.
College Sophomore,4,The people on this campus are friendly. They have unique styles and they all come from all around the world.
College Sophomore,4,Good amount of computers for the amount of students. Bring laptop to take personal notes during class.
College Sophomore,4,Our campus is in a high rise office building.  We have building security as well as a small security staff for the school floors.  Never felt unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,"Since Nyack is a Christian school we do not have a lot of political discussions going on - a lot of social discussions, yes!  In regard to other areas I have seen people of all nationalities and economies.  I believe we are a truly non-denominational school that tries to minister to each person on their level.  We do have a small gay community in our student body and I have never heard anything negative in regard to those students.  Acceptance of everyone is key at our school."
College Sophomore,4,"The school has changed over to Macs which I am not a fan of, but whenever I have an issue there is someone there to help.  Printers are available readily and the cost for using the copy machine is fair."
College Junior,4,College is very diverse. We have students from all socio-economic backgrounds and diverse beliefs.
College Junior,4,"In the new manhattan campus, we have state of the art computers in the computer labs and on other floors for student availability. Wireless is excellent and I do not find it necessary to bring my computer. I manage with a tablet."
College Freshman,4,"The diversity is obvious on campus, it is as real as oxygen. I mainly see it in the ethnic and religious background."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The chair of my department was amazing, I loved her and her commitment to her students. She really changed the way I see the world. The department did lose a couple of professors during my time there so I hope they have hired some since then. The curriculum was great, the workload was rightfully challenging. Internships would be a great addition."
Recent Alumnus,4,Nyack has the highest diversity for a private christian school in the nation. But they are not good at making space for that diversity and conflicting perspectives. LGBT students are highly persecuted and often forced to leave or are dismissed.
College Freshman,4,"Since the campus is near the Palisades mall, there are a great amount of late night options to go to eat. There are also many restaurants in town that are very friendly and provide discount for being a student. Many also deliver."
College Freshman,4,"There are many little shops in town that don't require having that much money. These shops have small town owners and they are very warm and welcoming. There is also the Palisades mall close by with many other shops and activities. The people who know about Nyack College tend to like the students a lot and if they are hiring, will typically hire a Nyack College student."
College Freshman,4,Everything is close and there's different varieties to choose from
College Freshman,4,They offer at Manhattan and upstate campus
College Freshman,4,We are known for the basketball sport. Warriors
College Freshman,4,We have a great deal of diversity and a lot of different Christian denominations
Graduate Student,2,"I just completed my first year in the graduate program . What I dislike the most is the lousy communication between the administration and students. In addition, they are still requiring grad students to get in contact with their advisors in order to drop/ add a course. In addition, I abhor the fact that they closed their Rockland Campus. When I applied, it was with the understanding that I would be able to take courses upstate, which is closer to home. Overall, I don't feel that I am getting the most for my money."
Niche User,2,"My daughter completed her first year of college at Nyack and although the overall experience was good, we found out in mid October of last year that they were shutting down the Nyack campus and if she wished to continue going to Nyack she would have to transfer to the Manhattan campus. I understand that these things can happen but I also know that the college knew this was at least a distinct possibility when we signed up to over the summer and I believe they did not tell anyone because they were afraid they would lose some of the new students and with that the tuition money.

We did not want an urban setting for here college experience and chose Nyack over some other colleges primarily because we liked the Nyack campus.  I wish Nyack would have been upfront with the parents and students who were in the process so we could have weighed the options and made an informed decision at the time."
Junior,2,"The facilities are horrible, they are going under financially, slowly removing professors and on campus help! The atmosphere is good, and God is difenitely there but, the school says that Godis involved in alot more than they actually involve him."
Niche User,2,"Nyack is a beautiful campus at first, however the administration is created of alumni and not professionals who know how to run the college. There is a lot that students are forced to do that is not required of a normal college student. People do try their best there however it just is not enough to run a college."
College Freshman,2,"They have a lot of unnecessary rules. For instance, Freshman have a curfew and guys are not allowed in girls dorms except for certain hours and vice versa. During those designated hours your door has to be open with all of the lights on and there are people that check up on you."
College Freshman,2,Don't expect to enjoy a true college experience. This college is full of judgmental Christians. Rules are strict and the social atmosphere is poor. It is pretty expensive and the education level did not meet my expectations. I learned more in high school than I did my year here.
College Senior,2,I am not sure what they do. We don't win.
College Freshman,2,"The only good thing in this area is Palisades mall.  It is the only attraction in this town.  The town of Nyack, and main St.  which is very close to the college, are places you don't go alone.  Our Faculty has told us not to walk to town alone! Frankly I don't see why you would want to walk down there anyway, all that's down there is bad food, rude, drunk and creepy people, and big scary dogs. Most of us don't even go down on Main Street.  The only good thing down there is Starbucks, and even their pumpkin spice latte tasted weird.  SO you probably should just go to either McDonalds(during the day) or Palisades."
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus at the residence Simpson Hall in particular stinks.  Simpson Hall is old, filled with spiders and ants, and run down.  We constantly deal with maintenance issues that we should not have to deal with. For instance no hot water, or maybe no water, and don't forget the nasty washer and dryer machines. I mean where is our money going!  It is the oldest building here and I feel it needs to either be remodeled or condemned.    The cost I guess is fine they should just exclude the room and board, or make it cheaper.  Simpson Hall is an slightly upscale motel 6.  Simpson is literally a hot mess.  Im not even gonna tell you about my private bathroom."
College Sophomore,2,They are fines for every violation. Rules are visited each month 
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone focuses on the basketball games. No one really pays attention to any other sport to be honest. The basketball team rarely ever wins though, BUT there is a whole lot of school spirit shown at games."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't even have a nurse. We have a health advisor or whatever that bullshit is. Basically, she doesn't help. She just gives you appointments to the doctor's. Don't even get me started on campus security. They're deadbeat security who just roam around campus. Our campus is an OPEN campus which means anyone can walk in and out. We deal with witches in the town. YES witches. Google NYACK WITCHES. You'll find out a lot more than you think. Campus security don't do anything. But they're not the ones in charge of breaking up parties and whatnot. The RA's are."
College Freshman,2,"When its nice its nice. But when it starts to snow, its gets pretty bad. most of the time they have to cancel classes. Also when it rains there is alot of heavy flooding that goes on."
College Junior,2,I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE A CAR BUT TO SEE MY FRIENDS LOOK FOR PARKING I HAVE OBSERVED IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT
College Freshman,2,"Nyack is a christian college and community therefor there are no parties and not many places to go out to at night. This is something that i value about my school, with no parties its more likely to just hang out with friends have a good time and stay out of trouble."
College Freshman,2,"It can cost up to $200 to have your car registered on campus, and as i freshman i have to park in the furthest lot at the school. Being as i am a freshman this us understandable. However the upperclassman parking lots are very small and they often times have to park in the far away over flow lot as well. parking could be much more organized and efficient. Not to mention the overflow lot is in a dark and deserted place, its often times very scary and I don't feel safe when walking back alone."
College Senior,2,"New York City Campus â€“ In the campus that I attend of Nyack College there are no sports/athletic activities or clubs that students can become involved with.  I give the grade C because there has been sports events that the student government and I have coordinated in efforts to bring the school spirit alive in this campus.  However, there was lack of interest within the student body.  I believe this is because the majority that make up our student population in the New York City campus are men and women that are full-time students, full-time working, and full-time parents."
Alum,1,"Sigh... OK.
I graduated a period of time ago and while there were positive aspects of the school, those have slipped through the cracks.  
I get that selling a campus was inevitable but I am disheartened when I think of the wonderful faculty they let go, and the sub-par faculty they have not only kept on but promoted to greater positions.
Thankfully, there are still some gems on faculty, but Nyack has seriously lapsed on its judgement with who to keep and who to let go.  
Spiritual formation was pretty narrow-minded... while they meant well, I heard from spiritual formation leaders several things that were either close to heretical, or at the very least insensitive to those who didn't have the exact same doctrinal views as them.
They've slashed their majors down so much as well... again, I get cuts are needed but this is not the same school it once was.  A real shame, isn't it."
Niche User,1,Financially unstable in the city. Closing Rockland campus.  Do your research if  looking  here. Read updated Statement of Faith. Ask a lot of questions.
Niche User,1,It's financially unstable in the city and is closing Rockland campus..  Do your homework on this one.   Read their updated statement of faith.  Ask a lot of questions.
Alum,1,"Very boring campus but you are close to New York City. People are friendly but the campus is divided between athletes and non-athletes. The only reason I somewhat enjoyed it was because I was on a sports team. Administration is awful and does not communicate well with students. Overall, the professors aren't anything special and I learn way more at my current college. College is supposed to be a fun, learning experience with lots of opportunities but you will not get that if you choose to go to Nyack."
Junior,1,I have been going here for 3 years now! I am currently sitting in the cafe typing this review! This school is absolutely terrible the only reason I am and half of the others are is because of the sports we play and the scholarships we get. The food is bad when itâ€™s time to go on break they barely feed us with good food the dorms have mold in it and they donâ€™t ever clean it like we ask. The staff say they care but they really only want our money so they fine us for every little thing (Yolanda Jean-Pierre). Let me tell yâ€™all how they discriminated my gay friend because she likes girls if this is going to be Christian school then why donâ€™t they accept people for who they are.  We have to pay to dorm and are not to living the way we want to. This school is bad and I wouldnâ€™t recommend this to anyone to come here
Sophomore,1,they are selling and closing the campus very soon.  too small anyway with only five hundred undergrads and two hundred grads.  if you had this on your list you need to do your homework on it.
Sophomore,1,"Everyone has crazy crazy views one after the other which you cannot escape throughout the entire campus. This is because everywhere you go, people are having theological debates. The classes all have a ""Christian"" twist to them, even the Psychology classes and most of my credits are required theology credits which will not transfer even though my major is Psychology. Some of the teachers are great people while others make me angry concerning how they run their class and treat others."
Niche User,1,"Attending Nyack College has to be one of the worst college experiences I've had. I thought because this school was built based on Christian fundamentals, the staff and people around me would be supportive and helpful. In return, I dealt with much drama, the food was terrible, the dorms did not match the amount of money you're investing and most importantly, the financial services, ESPECIALLY in the Manhattan campus is just horrible. I needed help and they treated me like a city school would- another number. I am EXTREMELY disappointed."
College Freshman,1,Unless you count going to the one club downtown there is no party scene.
College Freshman,1,Expect your body to retaliate after eating their food.
College Junior,1,"There is no Greek life! It is a small, Christian college and does not have frats or sororities."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene
College Freshman,1,We don't see any of that because we are a Christian college
College Student,1,Absolutely no nightlife if you are under 21
College Sophomore,1,DUMB BRICK COLD IN THE WINTER. SUPER HOT IN THE SUMMER.
College Sophomore,1,"THIS CAMPUS IS OD STRICT! You plan to drink? You wanna have a blunt with your friends? You wanna have girls/guys over your dorm? Forget it. We have this thing called ""OPEN DORM"". The opposite sex is allowed over from 6pm-11pm on Fridays and 2pm-9pm on Saturdays and Sundays. It's wack. If you're caught with alcohol or drugs on you on campus, it's a wrap for you. You'll have a meeting with the Dean the next day and you'll probably have your bags packed to get kicked off campus later on in the day after the meeting. However, if you're over 21, you are allowed to drink OFF campus, but you cannot come back to campus drunk."
College Sophomore,1,"PLEASE have a car. I am not even kidding you. Taxis are money. Buses are money and to even get to the bus stop is mad work. Most students have cars. Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars, so you're pretty much f***ed if you don't have one, but you manage to befriend upperclassmen. If you wanna party and go out, you really need to have a car on you because chances are, if not all, most parties are OFF campus."
College Student,1,professors not helpful even though classes are small
College Senior,1,"the computers were very, very very slow. Wireless access was inaccessable at times."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dorms are so old and falling apart, girls and boys are in different buildings and only allowed on each others floors during certain hours/week. FOOD IS TRASH!! WORST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. There is a curfew for freshman (1am)... and that's not even the half of it."

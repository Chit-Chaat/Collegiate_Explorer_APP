Freshman,5,I liked that Juilliard broke all the steroetypes associated with it. The students were not snobby and the teachers want to see you succeed. Everyone is working their hardest to achieve their goals and will not let anything stand in their way.
Niche User,5,I liked how quick the admissions directors respond back to any questions I have as well as the enviornment of the school.
Graduate Student,5,Best school I ever went to I want to go back. But I can't because my roommate was nice they had really nice security guards and very polite people I was surrounded by people I wanted to be including my proffesers
College Freshman,5,I am so glad that I chose this school. The teachers completely reached out to the freshman class and created an intimate and challenging environment.
College Sophomore,5,"The common outsider sees Juilliard as a prestigious, uptight school with classical views. However, the insider sees the real Juilliard. The amazingly supportive community and family of artist that we are. We learn to collaborate and enjoy or time with in the the glass walls that allow us to draw inspiration from the city, our canvas awaiting our mark as artists. I have had an interesting time here at Juilliard and wouldn't change my decision for the world. The faculty is amazing, the work-study opportunities are phonemail. I not only have a genuine dance family, I family in the admissions office, in the costume shop, I've made amazing friends with the security guards and even the chefs and cashiers at the cafeteria. Its a home a way from home for me."
College Freshman,5,"The Juilliard School, although assumed to be a very competitive environment was filled with the most welcoming community of dancers, actors and many musicians. I'd never seen so much school integrity and spirit anywhere as I did within the first few weeks of orientation. Days filled with educational and recreational activities allowed students of all years of study to come together and get to know one another. The diversity within the school is admirable. As an international student I feel right at home. Having the teachers, mentors and peers by my side I believe Juilliard is the school that will guide me towards a desired future."
College Freshman,5,"Being in New York City means there is food located everywhere. Having so many options is very convenient for students who wish to rehearse late into the night. Also, there is an app called Seamless that delivers food from a very large selection of restaurants for students who do not have time to go to the Cafe or go grab food from a restaurant."
College Sophomore,5,It's New York... It's great :)
College Junior,5,Juilliard is a part of Lincoln Center and security is everywhere.  There is not a time that I don't feel safe and secure.
College Freshman,5,They are very dedicated to their studies but also very nice.  Everyone works very hard and very long hours because the classes are very long and then there is a lot of practice time needed.  When one goes out to unwind they are super nice and very encouraging.  The girls are really pretty and everyone is super smart.  There is a wonderful diversity with people from 39 countries.
College Freshman,5,You can get public transportation (subways) a block away and taxis (but they are can get very expensive) are not hard to find.  Feet work great and it is a wonderful area to find everything you need close by.
College Junior,5,"Cheaper Than Campus – You can find a two bedroom 20 min from the school for a third of the price you pay on campus. Also, at this cheaper price you get to have a kitchen, your own room, and not be surrounded by the constant warm-ups of the hundreds of musicians you share the dorms with. 

Talk to the school to make sure that you're in a safe area. Anything right off of subway line, east/west-village, midtown, or west of Broadway is typically pretty safe

HOWEVER, in the dorms there are two pianos on every floor of the dorms, so if that interests you (24 hour access to pianos) then maybe the dorms are worth the steep markup? Your choice."
College Freshman,5,Student Life – The Freshman class is half guys half girls in the dance department and we are like family.  We totally support one another & go on outings on a regular basis.
College Freshman,5,A fabulous library including music.  The dance rooms overlook the city and the music rooms have incredible acoustics. The theaters are amazing as well. NYC has any kind of food or shopping you could want & the dorms overlook Cental Park.
College Freshman,5,"Juilliard Is One-Of-A-Kind – The atmosphere is Juilliard is like no other school I've every encountered. The teachers are amazing, the students are amazing, the administration is amazing. Everyone is involved in making extraordinary art. It's a lot of work, but the rewards are intensely gratifying. I love it here. I know I'm at the right place for me."
College Freshman,5,"If You Want It, You Can Find It – New York City is great for finding great food. And if you know where to look, it's cheap, too! The Upper West Side (near campus) is relatively expensive, but if you have a few hours, check out the East Village for some great Indian food. Or Hell's Kitchen for anything you desire. NYC is the place to be for great food and entertainment!"
College Sophomore,5,"Diversity in Juilliard is very high. You would think a music school would be all just talented musicians. However, there are 3 main facets of Juilliard, each with their own students. Music students which include every instrument and some ancient instruments as well, Drama students, and Dance students fill the campus and and individuality everywhere. As an arts school, could there be any less diversity in artists?"
College Sophomore,5,"The Area Around Juilliard – The Area around Juilliard is amazing. Ethnic shops, and cuisines are everywhere and artistry fills the air. Located in the heart of New York Manhattan, it is blocks away from Times Square and just steps away from the Metropolitan Opera House. For elegance and sophistication, nowhere beats Juilliard and its surroundings!"
Freshman,4,"The school has extremely rigorous training in whatever field you may be entering in the arts, but it is very rewarding and builds your skills so much as a performer."
Senior,4,"Very individual experience attending The Juilliard School. The past four years have all been different, but musical and artistically very rewarding. My professors and teachers are the highlight of being at this institution. My colleagues are also a very important part of being at school, reminding me of the diversity and talent in this world."
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great for NYC. Its located right in Lincoln Center on the Upper West side of Manhattan. Approximatley 100 yards from the Juilliard building. The rooms are small but the worth the location and proximity to the school.
College Freshman,4,"The administration is great at the school. They try very hard to make the environment very friendly and welcoming. The freshmen orientation may seem very tedious and long, but the staff does a very good job getting out tons of information. Most students want to be practicing or rehearsing, so the administration does a good job accommodating students to their needs. In the dorms they've put practice rooms on each floor so that musicians do not keep other students awake. There are strict quite hours however, that require students to be done practicing by a certain time."
College Freshman,4,"Once the school has selected their incoming freshmen class, they make every effort to get the kids they want to attend. They offer very good financial aid to kids that need it."
College Freshman,4,"Living in New York City as a college student is a dream come true. At the Juilliard School, you are living right in Lincoln 

Center, which provides you with many opportunities to see different shows in all art forms. Many people tend to stay in the dorms for the connivence it brings to students. The school is connected to the dorms by a short walkway outside. With student's busy schedules, being that close to the school is very helpful.

The living arrangements are arranged in a suite style living. In each suite there are 5 dorms, three double rooms and two single rooms. Also, each suite is equipped with a living room area and three bathrooms, which all contain a toilet and sink, one with a bathtub, and one with a shower. The bathrooms and suite are cleaned weekly by students to keep the environment sanitary. 

Freshmen are required to live in the dorms, while upperclassmen are put into the housing lottery. To apply for housing for the following year, students are required to attend three informational seminars called Horizons. These seminars range from a variety of relevant young adult related topics from information on substance abuse and warning signs of sexual assault, to a lesson on the history of hip hop dancing. Many students attend these because they want to stay in the dorms for their convenient location.

Being such a small school, the social atmosphere created amongst students is incredible. Everyone shares a common passion for the performing arts, and the school is constantly putting on events for students to participate in. Having the school located in the heart of Manhattan also gives students the chance to explore the city and see what all New York has to offer."
College Freshman,4,I haven't noticed a lot which is great
College Freshman,4,Able to meet many artists in the business.
College Freshman,4,Their dedication to the student is key.
College Freshman,4,City has alot to offer
College Freshman,4,Could use better contacts to outside clinics.
College Junior,4,"Decent Quality and Reliable Equipment. The computers in my school are fairly dated, but the programs on the computer are updated and function properly.  The lab is fairly small and is usually pretty crowded during cram periods at the end of a semester.  One great thing about the computer lab is that there is always a monitor to tend to printer and computer malfunctions."
College Senior,4,"All Basic Needs Met, Plus a Few Special Needs. Juilliard has a good, basic computer lab, with fairly recent computers and programs. There are also newer computers with good special programs for the music students and people to help with technical problems and navigational questions. Internet is good, sometimes it gets stuck. The lab gets crowded pretty quick during finals and midterms, even regular lunch hour on occasion. Printers are good."
College Senior,4,Campus Is Too Small/Intimate for Blatant Drug/Alcohol Use. Most people do their drinking and drugs at home after school and only rarely come to school high or drunk. Smoking regular cigarettes just outside is very prevalent though.
College Senior,4,"Rubbing Shoulders With Brilliancy. Being surrounded by brilliant people - faculty, staff and peers - has provided an incredible environment of sky high expectations and ways and means to reach them. With the administration there are often moments of discouragement, misunderstanding and there is room for more departure from stereotypes or subjective priorities, but the overall success of the curriculum and teaching methods are worth the trouble."
College Sophomore,4,There are subway stop all around Juilliard so it's pretty easy to get to and you can get anywhere from New York. So not half bad.
College Junior,4,"The administration, in my two years at Juilliard, doesn't make frivolous rules: just don't forget the school opens late on Sundays, and you WILL NOT be let in. 

The dorms have a man in charge of them who is power hungry and very condescending to the students: even though many of the graduate students are very close to his age. I have heard nothing but horrible reviews when it comes to him, and my interactions with him have always been less than pleasant. He is the type of man who goes with the ""letter of the law"", instead of supporting the ""spirit of the law"""
College Freshman,4,"The school is near several subway stops, so it is very convenient to move about the city. The price is modest for the service, and you can get anywhere with a subway/bus card and a little walking. Taxis are also an option, but only if you have a deep wallet."
College Sophomore,4,"Dining in Juilliard – There is only one hall to dine in. It is located on the lobby floor of the dorm building and overall, the food is good. The grill, salad bar, and hoagie are always maintained fresh and there is alot of choices in snacks and drinks. Overall, it is a good dining experience."
College Freshman,2,"There is no parking for the school, you'd have to park on the street and that is VERY hard and expensive (plus you would need to keep moving the car every few hours during the day.  There is a parking garage for the area but that is VERY expensive.  You really do not need a car at all."
College Senior,2,Not much greek stuff except for the occasional party
Graduate Student,1,"The school doesn’t accept talents, they want people that were recommended by alumni or wealthy people."
College Junior,1,"As a freshman, students are mandated to live on campus in the dorm.  My experience was not that good.  Our suite was very outdated, it smelled, bathrooms/showers were in horrible condition with mold and extensive signs of where on the ceiling and floors.  The students were also responsible for cleaning of the suite and bathrooms...that was like the beginning of germs being built up for the entire year.  Students don't know how to clean and clean so that germs are not being spread.  I hated the experience in the dorms because of the filth and condition."
College Senior,1,"I barely got any school aid.
All from the government"

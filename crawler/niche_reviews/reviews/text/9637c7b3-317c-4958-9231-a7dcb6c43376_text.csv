Senior,5,"ISU provides several helpful resources for a non-traditional student, like myself. It is the top medical school in Idaho. Several health related degree programs are in high demand and have guaranteed job placement after graduation."
Senior,5,ISU made an easy transition to online learning during the Covid 19 lockdown. My professors were great to work with online. I was able to finish my semester classes and continue working toward my degree.
Freshman,5,"From what I have experienced so far from Idaho State University, is that the professors and faculty are there to help the students and residents out, always with a smile on their face.  Also, the campus is clean and well taken care of, it is a smaller campus, which makes it easier to navigate for students who are overwhelmed by the thought of college at first."
Freshman,5,"Over this past summer I partaked it Idaho State University Bengal Bridge program for incoming freshman, this summer semester was supposed to be in person, but due to covid-19 it could not be.  Idaho State University professors are very understanding about the whole learning online and were very accommodating on making sure they were available when ever a student needed help.  I personally do not like learning online, but now somewhat enjoy learning online."
Senior,5,I have had very positive experiences with my online learning. Teachers have always been helpful and easy to connect with when i have had questions. The classes have been laid out in ways that were easy to follow the lessons and clear on expectations and schedules.
Freshman,5,I like how accessible the professors/instructors have been. Especially with online classes..........
Freshman,5,So far it has been an amazing experience taking classes online at Idaho State University. Everyone is willing to help!
Senior,5,I transferred to ISU and they make a great point to try and help transfer students get to know their new university. The professors are great and so are the resources the school provides to help us succeed.
Senior,5,"Online in general is not the easiest, however the professors try to have it be as easy to understand as possible. ISU also had handled the switch to online for the lockdowns was well done."
Niche User,5,The Early College Program provides students with a great opportunity for credit while still in high school.
Niche User,5,The online aspect of my Calculus final was fairly painless. My only complaint is that the time allotted for completing it was a bit short for the rigor of the test.
Sophomore,5,I love ISU! It is a fun college with really great professors and staff. It has a very home-y environment and is a very loving community.
Freshman,5,"Idaho State University offers amazing education for affordable prices. The city of Pocatello offers numerous beautiful attractions and social activities. The professors at ISU are quite friendly and helpful. Several clubs and sports offered by the university offer students many opportunities to stay active and involved. ISU is within a day's travel of several unique sites, such as Jackson, Wyoming, Salt Lake City, Lava Hot Springs, Boise, and more!!"
Sophomore,5,I attend the Idaho Falls campus of ISU and I do love it. It isn't to hard to get around and it's very easy directions and not confusing. The professor are very nice and good to work with and the student building always has something going on and a lot of the times they have a meal for the students and professors for free.
Niche User,5,"My high school was able to go to ISU to the ""experience ISU"" they offer. We are able to go to different colleges to see the majors ISU has on campus. It definitely helped me narrow down the majors I was interested in."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school at ISU. The classes are challenging and the professors are willing to work with the students. Pocatello is also an amazing city. It is big enough that people originally from a city will feel at home, yet it is rugged enough that those from smaller towns will not feel so trapped."
Freshman,5,I am a first year freshman here at Idaho State and i love it here so far. They have great professors who care. Also great diversity. Pretty campus
Senior,5,"Idaho State University offers a large variety of majors for just about any interest. They offer multiple online programs which is convenient for those working full time, taking care of kids full time or live too far from the university to be able to attend daily classes. The tuition I believe is one of the highest across the state of Idaho which is a down fall. This should not affect their rating because college education across the United States is extremely expensive."
Graduate Student,5,Very good quality education for an affordable cost. Lots of online options. Great librarians. HIgh quality professors. Very accommodating with the admissions process. Great communication with students. The main campus is easy to find from the interstate. Nice parks near by. Near Idaho Falls. There is a club for the graduate program. There is an easy scholarship application site for students through the school. There is an emphasis on student success from faculty.
Freshman,5,"The staff here at Idaho State University is so kind and attentive to all the students needs. The University's staff and students create incredibly fun and welcoming events that make every student feel at home. I began feeling extremely homesick the first few weeks after I moved here, but the wonderful staff knows exactly what to do to keep students entertained and not feeling left out of anything. I'm so happy I chose a great place to call home and continue my schooling."
Graduate Student,5,Idaho State University is the first college I attended online. The online program is suited for working professionals such as myself.  The professors I've encountered are all very supportive and the course format is easy to follow.
Graduate Student,5,I applied to the PA program at ISU 5 times.  On the 5th application I was interviewed and the faculty conducting the interview made me feel as though I already had done everything necessary to be admitted and had proven I had what it takes to be in the program.  Before I got out of the building I had an offer waiting for me in my email inbox.
Senior,5,"I have been an online student at ISU for over a year now.  I finished my first bachelor degree through them and will finish my second in 2021.  The professors are helpful, the online forum has been a great way for me to learn, and I have enjoyed being a full-time student at ISU"
Alum,5,"I attended the Idaho Falls campus of Idaho State University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. I found that it was easy to get involved on campus through volunteering, student government, clubs, and student activities. There are opportunities to support any level of involvement you are looking for! I was highly involved but not all of my friends were. I also felt that the staff and faculty I worked with really cared about me! They wanted me to succeed in and out the class room and checked in regularly. I made some wonderful friends and amazing mentors!"
Freshman,5,I enjoyed a lot about living in Pocatello and attending Idaho State University. Some of my favorite things about going to school there was I enjoyed that everyone was extremely helpful when I was trying to create my schedule and figure out what was going to be the best way to go about my classes. Another thing that I enjoyed about Idaho State University was that it is a very social interactive campus and there is always something going on.
Senior,5,"I love my Bengals but it can seem pretty dull in Pocatello for the most part. Campus is dead in the summer like most of the town. What is good about Idaho State University is that you get some great feedback from faculty and professors. The attention that each student gets by teachers assistance and faculty make going to Idaho State University worth the money. Another added bonus is that the tuition for this state run institution is much less than in other places in the country. It is nestled between some of the most beautiful country in the nation, with Yellowstone National Park and the gorgeous Teton Mountain range."
Niche User,5,The staff is extremely friendly and want to help you succeed in your career. The campus is easily accessible and fun to be on. They have so many fun activities to do all of the time. Plus the movies are almost completely free.
Junior,5,"I’ve really enjoyed my time at Idaho State University. Upon entering, I was given an intern opportunity that will help to understand my major more in depth, as well as help me find a career in my future. The staff and faculty genuinely care about the students’ mental and physical wellbeing and are quick to remind us about their love for us. If I were to change one thing, it would be to update some of the buildings. ISU has some rundown buildings, and these buildings could use some love and attention."
Freshman,5,Idaho State has some great majors and wonderful faculty who help you in your college experience they are a great school and they always strive to help college students in their dreams. Idaho state has a good graduation rate as well.
Freshman,5,I have only been there a few times so far but am really excited to attend there full time.  The staff seems dedicated and helpful. The students I have spoken with like it there and speak highly of it as well.
Niche User,5,"I live the bengal bridge program Idaho State University has. It helps students get an early start for a more affordable price, allowing us students who’s parents can’t help financially to get a head start for our education. The campus is absolutely beautiful! It is close to home and also incredibly safe!"
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student to Idaho State University from the College of Southern Idaho. At first, I thought that I would be attending the University of Idaho, but after a long wait to hear back from the program director, I called ISU to see if they could offer the same program. They were wonderful to talk to and put together an online program in my area that would work for me! They have been great to work with and that is why I highly recommend going with Idaho State University!"
Niche User,5,"what i liked about idaho state university was the great staff, they were very helpful and nice. the campus is wonderful and pretty. I toured the dorms and housing and i liked that it wasnt too crowded and you get to pick who your roomate is if you wish to have one"
Niche User,5,I have heard many great things about the university. I have gone to visit it and loved it. It has amazon programs in the field that I would like to pursue.
Niche User,5,"I am a Bengal link student from Pocatello High School, and while as a honor student, I am persuing collegial credits.  I'm very happy this program exists.  The counselors are excellent!  They have taken much time to advise me.  I enjoy the challenge of learning and really enjoyed my last semester.  I don't party , so that is why I have marked it weak.  I enjoy the instructors.  I enjoy the campus extracurricular activities.  I'm looking forward to attending ISU in Pocatello, Idaho next year as s full time student.  There are many fun things to do for relaxation.  One may go to the on campus movies, climb red Hill, use to the pottery lab.  The library is so nice and quiet.  There are many friends to get to know and a high level of diversity!"
Sophomore,5,Idaho state university had the best study environment for whoever want to stay focused on academics and school work. There is less distraction. It’s environment encourages lots of outdoor activities and can be really cheap for college student. Lots of platforms are provided to help their students successful mentally and academically. You want to be successful as a student? Go for Idaho State university.
Graduate Student,5,The grad school program at Idaho State is amazing because there are only 7 people in my cohort and we get amazing individual training.
Freshman,5,Meeting new people around the campus will make you feel like you’re home. It’s a wonderful plays that makes you feel connected with everyone!
Junior,5,I have been highly impressed with the professors here at ISU. Every instructor I have taken a course from seems to genuinely care about their students. It has been a great experience.
Sophomore,5,"Idaho State University is a good sized school that offers many options! There are tons of activities for students, and is in a great location in town."
Graduate Student,5,"Great place to live, affordable and very safe! I am happy to be living in Boise, Idaho. The school has a brand new osteopathic medicine campus nearby which I will be attending. I am excited to start a career in osteopathic medicine and I am glad to be doing so at Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine."
Sophomore,5,"Idaho State University has a beautiful campus. If you're like me, you love small secluded spaces for studying, and ISU has plenty of them, inside and outside. The student center, The Rendezvous, has delicious food and tons of natural light."
Junior,5,Idaho state university in Pocatello is so beautiful. Everyone really loves the campus. All the buildings and classes are easily accessible to everyone. The food choices there are great. There are so many little places to hang out and do homework and projects. All of the faculty is amazing and helpful. The housing is pretty good as well.
Freshman,5,Overall I really enjoy ISU. There are many opportunities for extra-curricular actives. Also all of the professors I have had up until this point have been very knowledgeable and helpful.
Niche User,5,"Idaho State University offers students plenty of choices of study, I have seen nothing but successful graduates employed in the field of their choice, the tuition has no hidden agenda, and there are constantly opportunities to be familiarized with everything that is going on in the school and on campus! 
     Idaho State University also has a great reputation nationwide for the quality of education received!  I am an individual studying psychology. in the state of Idaho alone,  mental illness is the highest in the nation. Idaho State University is highly recommended  in this field of study! It is greatly appreciated to have the opportunity to study at a school that is acknowledged for having a reputable course in a career in psychology."
Freshman,5,"I've been to ISU a few times, and it's a cool place to walk around and check out. I've also heard a lot of good things about there Physical Therapy program"
Sophomore,5,It has been a terrific experience so far.  The teachers are very easy to get along with and are very understanding.
Freshman,5,"Idaho State in Idaho Falls was a good pick for me my freshman year. I wasn't ready to move away yet, and I wanted to save money. The professors have all been incredibly helpful and seem to only want what's best for the student. The campus is small, but provides a small taste into what the future will be like for anyone who may want to venture away like me."
Freshman,5,Overall Idaho State University tries to help its students in everything from financial aid to social gatherings. Classes are fairly small and teachers are very helpful and accommodating.
Freshman,5,"Being a first year student can be and intense one.  My experience at ISU has been informative.  The Staff and Student Staff were helpful  and encouraged me to come to them if I needed help.  The classes are all within walking distance with an occasional sprint.  I like that you have students from around the globe.  I went and toured another University in Moscow, Idaho.  Thought I had my heart set on that school until, I had the opportunity to tour ISU.  Idaho State university had classes that I had been wanting to take.  My minor is in Japanese and I am loving my class.   I would recommend that High School Seniors come by and see what Idaho State University has to offer."
Sophomore,5,Idaho State University has the resources of a larger university as well as the closely knit feel of a community college. Everyone knows everyone! The professors go out of their way to be helpful and offer guidance. Would recommend to anyone.
Freshman,5,My experience with Idaho State University has been fantastic! With all of the people I have met the atmosphere has been so friendly. All of my professors have been so helpful and making me want to achieve my goals. They push me to do my best and really give their own time to see each of their students succeed. My roommate is pretty great and the building manager in Schubert Heights is always available when we need him or someone is always available to help make our transition to college just a little bit easier.
Freshman,5,"I have had no issues with this school. Going into my second semester and I’ve loved it. So far there is nothing I would change. I’ve had every class online so I haven’t had any experience with the campus yet but I’m guessing its good.  I like how easy it was to get registered and get my classes that suited me for my life at the time.  Working full time and being a single mother, going to the campus doesn’t always work."
Niche User,5,Idaho State University has a great campus and everyone is always there to help you with what ever you need. They offer many different scholarships and have a great campus life. There is always something to do there.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the people there. They genuinely want you to succeed and have a good time while you're there!
Junior,5,I liked how the professors are really willing to help out with the students after class is over. I really liked how the class sizes were smaller than a bigger University because there is more interaction and participation with the students.
Sophomore,5,"I haven’t been in school for 17 years, I have 2 advisors that really care about how I am doing. All my teachers care and truly want me to succeed. The campus is beautiful. There are so many activities to keep the students engaged and happy."
Senior,5,Love the campus and the teachers. Wish the parking was a little more organized but there are several things to do on campus and the food is decent.
Freshman,5,"Really enjoy the atmosphere. Professors are great and teach very well. Great opportunities to further your education, meet new people, and have fun."
Sophomore,5,"I started going to the Idaho Falls Campus and the faculty and satff there were excellent. They are prompt when you need help with academics, setting up class schedules, and answering other questions. The overall ISU atmosphere is welcoming and I know I can make it to my goals with their help."
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Idaho State University for a little over one year and I have rarely had a problem with the university or it's staff. Most of the professors are effective in their subject and tend to keep the budget of their students when picking books. The cost of tuition is cheap as colleges go. However, the school's websites are not user friendly. I would recommend that an upper classman or student advisors help you to navigate each of the sites."
Freshman,4,"So far the online classes have been really informative and I’m learning a lot, the professors also make it fun"
Senior,4,"I have been taking classes at ISU for almost two years now, with the exception of one teacher I have loved each of my professors as they taught with expertise and knowledge. Many were very passionate about their subjects and knew who to get the class excited about the subject as well. Registering for classes has been so easy and I have always been able to get into the classes I needed, I have taken classes on campus, online and at the satellite campus in Idaho Falls and each experience has been positive."
Junior,4,"Idaho State University's College of Technology has great academic resources that cater to student's needs. Instructors teach their subjects well and grant their students the means to be successful. The campus provides means of relaxation, hobbies, and events for the students and public."
Sophomore,4,I loved the online course experience with Idaho state University. The Proffesors help you in anyway they can. They help you with due dates or just understanding the material they are teaching. The campus is a very nice campus.
Sophomore,4,"I really like Idaho state. I love the rodeo team that I am on. I like the environment,  the proffesors, and the other students."
Junior,4,What I liked about Idaho State University was that it had such a great community and that there are many activities for students to do in order to alleviate the stress that they may build up over the day. I also enjoy the fact that many of the classes are very small which allows for students not only get to know their professors but to also be able to get help with things such as assignments or concepts. The only things that I would have to complain about are the food and the on campus housing. The food itself is not very good and the on campus housing needs to be remodeled as it has been the same since about the 1970s.
Alum,4,"I received a degree in Biology. I felt very prepared to go into research field. My professors were passionate about teaching and they loved their research so I learned a lot. I always safe on campus and felt like there was a lot to do on campus, in the Pocatello, and around the area. Only down side was finding a job as an undergraduate student."
Freshman,4,"They are amazing to work with if you need help, they will help you. If you have any questions they are more than willing to answer them. They are a really easy to work with."
Niche User,4,"I will be a freshman here starting in the fall and I have appreciated how welcoming Idaho State University has been throughout my application process. We had a small hiccup because I almost didn't get my commitment deposit in on time due to not receiving my acceptance letter; however, we got it all sorted out and I cannot wait to start in the fall!"
Freshman,4,There is a very large open campus many nice people and great teachers who know what they are talking about.
Niche User,4,"Idaho State has great activities for all types of student whether your an athlete, a book worm or a gamer. They also offer great teachers no matter what field of study you are going too. I would highly recommend at least going on a campus tour and seeing if it right for you because they are great choice for most students."
Niche User,4,"As a student of the early college program, I have experienced life on campus. I have attended events, taken  classes, and felt the environment that Idaho State University provides."
Alum,4,"If you are looking to get a great education while paying affordable tuition, I recommend Idaho State University! They have excellent programs in the health sciences."
Niche User,4,Idaho State University Does look like they have a good computer science program! They have a great machining program as well as Automotive tech!
Niche User,4,"I have only toured the campus, but from what I saw, it is excellent. I went into the dorms, which I was not too impressed with, but the stadium was very nice. The town  is overall pretty nice, and the medical program that the school offers is superb."
Freshman,4,I choose Idaho State University because I felt like it was the best deal for the cost of going. So far it has been good but Im only a freshman so Im going to have to see if it continues.
Sophomore,4,I love the Campus. The mountains give you somethings to do if you are an outdoor person. The town itself is hard to get out and do something. There are not very many options. The professors that I have had so far have been really good and easy to work with.
Senior,4,"Returning to school at Idaho State University has given me the opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream of earning my bachelor's degree. I will graduate in 2020 at the age of 46 and will be extremely satisfied with my accomplishments. 
At ISU, I have met some wonderful people that will continue to be friends for years to come. I have had the chance to engage in extracurricular activities like clubs and honor societies. These activities have afforded me the opportunity to do volunteer work in the community which is always fun. My program is loaded with the best professors. I have learned ample amounts from them and look forward to continuing my friendships with them long after I am graduated."
Sophomore,4,"I love how much is taught in the classes. Tests and homework are never just busy work but actually provide great practice for improvement. The texts and material provided also has always been very clear and a great aid in learning outside of class. The campus however, does not provide great study environments. It is better to do homework at home or at a library due to the lack of quiet and comfortable places to study."
Junior,4,"Idaho State University has overall so far been a good post-secondary experience.  The College of education is friendly and helpful, and the professors of that college are both knowledgeable and seem invested in pupil outcomes.  Central counseling and student finances offices push for students to take out more loans, so as to work less and progress on their degrees faster.  This did not sit well with me because this would incur a great deal more debt.  Granted this experience occurred in 2016, but I feel it still relevant."
Junior,4,"Idaho State University is a wonderful school. I really like that it is a smaller university. The classes have a smaller student to teacher ratio, but the university is big enough that there is a wide verity of classes."
Junior,4,"I really enjoyed having campuses that weren’t only in Pocatello, I think that makes it easier for people who can’t move there to be able to get an education from Idaho Sate University. Every professor I have had while attending have been knowledgeable about their material and have been more than willing to meet and work with me outside of class/lecture time. Free tutors are available for almost every subject to help students succeed. That campus itself is very clean and very well maintained too."
Alum,4,Has a decent variety of majors. The campus has recently been redone so a lot of it is very new and clean. most teachers are friendly and very helpful and care about the subjects they teach.
Freshman,4,So far a great college. Some what flexible with classes (more flexible when it comes to web classes). Good hen it comes to options for majors and minors.
Alum,4,"I liked the small university feel of Idaho State University, the classes were small enough that your professors knew you."
Freshman,4,My first year here was enjoyable. I made some new friends and the band program is amazing. The professors are nice and for most situations are understanding and will sometimes extend a deadline for you but communication is key.
Niche User,4,I have been a dual credit student at ISU for 3 years and I am planning to go there for college. So far all staff have been really nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,The START program at ISU has given me the 2nd chance to start over at the age of 47! So many resources and so much support!
Senior,4,"I really like the diversity on campus and the many opportunities there, but I really feel that the parking should be worked on. When it comes to parking you have to buy different permits for different parking areas and not to mention the fact that there's more permits handed out than there are parking spots available."
Junior,4,Idaho State University is a great college for anyone seeking a degree that is  Health Professions related. It has a really good nursing program and we are the only school in the state that has a Pharmacy program.
Senior,4,There are specific departments that are definitely not as good as others. If you are heading into the communications or health fields you are bound to have some very awesome professors. The education department could use some work. They are very bias with specific students and only work with certain criteria whilst making exceptions for others.
Sophomore,4,"Idaho state university is full of helpful professors and kind loving people. They have a wide variety of programs and an many helpful resources! The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate through. Winters are cold, summers are hot, but that doesn’t stop ISU from being on top."
Freshman,4,"Campus is amazing! Its so pretty, and within a 3 hour drive, you can be in a variety of places. For those people who love the outdoors and the COLD, this is an amazing place to be. It's like a huge family here, with the professors doing whatever it takes so you succeed, and the other students helping as well."
Freshman,4,"I love Idaho state university. They always have activities that get students ivolved, and everyone is caring about a hotter. The teachers and staff care about th successof their students."
Junior,4,The teachers are interested in your achievements and are willing to help you succeed. It is an affordable school.
Sophomore,4,Idaho State University provides an excellent opportunity for all students with a desire to learn to succeed. The professors here are willing to work with students individually and reach out to ensure that every student has the resources they need to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy ISU simply because the university is small enough that you will be able to know your teachers, but big enough that you won't be able to experience everything it has to offer.  The classes that Idaho State offers are amazing and very diverse. This university has really impressed me since I've been here and I haven't been disappointed. While the town of Pocatello isn't the most exciting, this truly is a place for outdoor enthusiasts. Rock climbing, hiking, fishing, and so much more are found just a few miles away from home."
Freshman,4,"its very nice school, the that everybody is very nice. professors are among always listen to you willing to help whenever you need help."
Junior,4,"The college is open to all age groups, and have plenty of helping aids for advice. Majority of instructors are knowledgeable with their subject and helpful to students."
Niche User,4,I went to the early registration for incoming freshman. It was very well prepared and organized event. They were excited to have us there and made it fun for us to participate in the events of the day. All the staff that was their we so helpful. They had a great variety  of booths that explained so many of the activities and opportunities that are available to students . The housing tours were well given and we had the opportunity to tour many of the dorms. They also had this event on three  different days so that we could come at  a time that was good for us.
Senior,4,"It’s been a great experience for me at Idaho State University, coming from Nigeria to the University has helped me meet a lot of individuals from all part o the world."
Junior,4,"You can easily look at the academic stats of this university, with what programs they excel at, the aptitude and uniqueness of the professors from all around the world, the graduation rate, or what have you; but the number one thing that really stand out for me, as a junior, is the social community that you will gain from attending Idaho State University. no matter what program you are in, you can find reliable and friendly class mates and colleagues, that will help boost you potential. Along with a great social environment, ISU has a great tutoring force for any topic you need help in accelerating."
Sophomore,4,"Idaho State offers a an appreciated and recognized education and degrees, however the ""college experience"" would otherwise be considered lacking. Although I enjoyed my time at Idaho State, it felt very similar to high school due to the absence of good sports teams, party scene, and campus events. My professors were all very helpful when needed and my classes were for the most part organized. The education aspect of Idaho State university is excellent, in my opinion, I believe I gained a solid education and I feel equipped to further my self in my studies. The university offers a very wide range of programs and degrees, making it a very well rounded school for students of all desires. I would recommend this university to others based on the academics, but when considering the college life and experience I would not suggest this school."
Freshman,4,I like the campus life here. There is a lot to do while I have attended this college. The professors here have taught me so much in and out of the class room. They go into so much detail and are willing to do what ever it take for you ta\o have an enjoyable time here.
Sophomore,4,"I love ISU. It is a great university with excellent academics. Being an Idaho resident, the location of ISU is fantastic. I am able to live at home and easily attend college."
Senior,4,"Everything has its own pros and cons, so does this University. I am an International student and i had high hopes with this college. The major setback for me was to complete General education requirement of 32 credits. It would take two semesters to finish them which meant loss of money and time. With some research i came to know that it is very much similar with every other college as well. Apart from this, other things are quite good. The college has economical tuition fees with the scope of multiple scholarships. The professors are also good. Pocatello City is also cheap and perfect for students who can survive with low hours of work and less money. Overall my experience at this University has been good."
Sophomore,4,Warm and engaging faculty and staff.  I truly enjoy my time at ISU. I enjoyed that there are extensions locally which I can take classes that apply to my degree.
Senior,4,"ISU is a school for those who really want to focus on school. It is not a party school, and many of the students are non-traditional; parents, returning students, seniors, ect. They offer a good education if you're ready to buckle down."
Freshman,4,"It is a campus full of kind, motivated people. The town is also a small friendly little place to live."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it's a very good campus, it always seems safe and has many things to do for if you live on campus. ISU also has many degrees and programs to offer with great advisors that have helped me a lot. Some of the dining and parking throughout the campus could be better, along with some professors, but most of them are great and can help you at a reasonable time."
Freshman,4,"I was very impressed with the University campus tour. what I would like to see more of would probably more on campus student activities. Their isn't much for students to do for recreation. However, the school has an amazing football and basket ball team."
Freshman,4,I love the campus it is very nice looking and not that far to walk from one side to the other side. The people are really nice. The location sucks because all the of my favorite place to eat or drink are 40 minutes or more away. The food is excellent. there is a lot of public safety on campus but if you go off then its risky.
Freshman,4,Idaho State University is a good college to start out in. Best part of Isu is the the small class. My biggest class has 30 kids. So the proffers do really care about you. I recommed this college who is looking for a good start and wants to learn.
Freshman,4,I have loved my college experience so far! If I could change anything it would by the parking because it's very crazy sometimes
Freshman,4,"I have a lot of experience on the campus of Idaho State University, I grew up on campus as my parents (now alumni) went to this school. As young children my brother and I attended the ""early learning center"" daycare for children of students and now as a college freshman I appreciate how nice the campus truly is. It has a wonderful gym complete with exercise equipment of all sorts, a pool, courts of all kinds and a rock wall. The student union building is also an excellent place on campus with food, games, a theater and bowling. There are always people on campus enjoying the grassy areas playing volleyball, soccer, ultimate Frisbee the list continues. I've always lived off of campus but the dorms seem pretty nice, though they are one of the more expensive experiences at Idaho State."
Senior,4,"Idaho State University is close to family, and provides a welcoming atmosphere.  The campus has a great flow.  Many of my classes are often in the same building.  The diverse group of friends made at ISU are always eager to cheer each other on to face each challenge as it nears.  It is easy to call ISU a home away from home."
Junior,4,I go to Idaho State University at the Meridian campus. So far all of my professors have been great! They are great instructors and genuinely care about the success of their students. I have learned a lot of things that I know I will be actually using in my career. Great education. Their online class fee is a little ridiculous though.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed Idaho State overall. I was an athlete on the women's basketball team and the family community was amazing. No matter where we would go the community supported us. The diversity was very limited though. The majority of the diversity came from the athletics program. I was in the mathematics program but did a majority of my undergrad classes here. The professors were extremely nice and always willing to work with my busy athletic schedule. Overall, Idaho State is a good college but just lacks its own special flare."
Junior,4,"I love the people in the Political Science department. They really are there to make sure you succeed. Dr. Stoutenborough and Dr. Kirkpatrick find and encourage students in outside activities. Dr. Eckert is an amazing professor who make his classes interesting. 

What I do not care for are the things that go on at the administrative level of the University. They let go of all of the adjunct professors and then hired people who, I believe, should not be working as professors."
Sophomore,2,The online professors are entitled and lazy. I have felt like I have had to teach myself. I am not pleased with my education that I have gotten from ISU.
Sophomore,2,My experience with ISU has been frustrating. My interactions with the staff and faculty have been poor. My education that I have received from ISU has been unacceptable and the professors are lazy. I truthfully feel that I have been set up for failure.
Graduate Student,2,"The turn over was awful in the advising portion of the college in general.  Classes were good size, and most Professors encouraged your best work.  I personnaly did not fit in to the life on campus due to the fact that I have a family and am not single.  There is a lot to do on the campus for people who want to stay busy and a lot of free things that are available to the students. MY favorite was the gym."
College Freshman,2,I live off campus. Campus housing is too expensive and not value to money
College Sophomore,2,"The school sports are not very good.  I honestly root for my hometown team over my college.  Nevertheless, they are there."
College Senior,2,if you are not totally fit mentally and physically then you would get chewed up and spit out probably in first 2 weeks
College Senior,2,"herded in and out like cattle, no respect"
College Senior,2,need more trained exercise regimes and non-elective available  participation choices for the afternoon and evenings during the week. The facility needs to extend their hours of operation  since most people are not free to go to the gym until after 6 pm which is the time they close
College Student,2,I didn't even know we had a greek life
College Freshman,2,"They told us to take a mandatory online drug and alcohol class.  None of my friends or I did it, and there were no consequences.  There are however many opportunities to learn about the effects of drugs."
College Freshman,2,I think I made the wrong choice.
College Senior,2,I have not enjoyed Idaho State University due to the way that you are treated by the staff. No one is ever very helpful and no one ever knows what is going on. You have to talk to 5 different people in order to get an answer about whether or not you are on track with your degree.
College Sophomore,2,"All of the houses near campus are horrible. Old and dilapidated and in poor condition. Most of the previous tenants just trash the homes so the new tenants are stuck in crappy conditions and the landlords don't bother with fixing anything because the next day it will just be broken again. 

If you want a decent place off campus, your best bet is looking on the other side of town."
College Sophomore,2,"Our campus has strict policies, however, they do almost nothing to enforce most of them."
College Sophomore,2,Near the school I think there are three real food place you can go to.. the rest is stores of in chubbuck which is pretty far from the school.
College Sophomore,2,I have heard of one party this whole year that was hosted by a frat and I only have one more month of school.
College Sophomore,2,"I really don't hear much about them. they're good at getting club funding, and they have a house close to campus for parties (which I've heard suck a little bit). Few girls go, and they're never there long. It's a dry campus, so that probably inhibits it. I don't know why, but we have very few Greek organizations. I heard it rumored that there was a scandal years back that shut down Greek life entirely and it just never really came back strong. That's a rumor though, I have no concrete knowledge of why Greek life is pretty small. It could be because we have lots of non traditional students. I do t mind not having Greek life though. I'm a traditional straight-out-of-high school student, and we can throw our own private parties that get fairly large. You always meet someone new at a friends party, and always have fun."
College Sophomore,2,"Pocatello is an awful town. It's very rundown. There isn't much to do. But again, I don't live there so I don't know about all the activities that go on. But from what I do know, there isn't much available. Besides school related activities."
College Freshman,2,"The food is a little sketchy, I do not even live on campus, but I still would never eat on campus."
College Junior,2,Compared to the first school I attended ISU is very weak. It would be nice if people at Idaho State were more sociable. It could bring a positive side to the school because people would interact more.
College Junior,2,Greek Life just isn't a big thing at Idaho State. I wish It was because I went to University of Idaho my freshman year and the Greek system there is very large and they do many good things for the community. If Idaho State had a better Greek opportunity I bet it would hugely impact the campus in a positive way.
College Freshman,2,Some of the food is overpriced & not good.
College Sophomore,2,"Our school spirit is lacking.  Even though our sports are not amazing, it still is disappointing to see that not many students go to support our teams."
College Freshman,2,The people in Greek life aren't very nice and it has no affect on the campus life.
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much outside the school. It is a boring town in all.
College Freshman,2,"You see middle eastern students, African exchange students, and a lot of Chinese and general White students."
College Freshman,2,"Its a small town that basically survives because of the college. However theres very little to do in way of activities such as skating bowling, or anything of the like."
College Freshman,2,You can survive without a personal lap top for the first year of classes or so. After that you better get something or you'll suffer.
College Freshman,2,Theres a greek chapter at ISU in name only. It doesn't mean anything.
College Freshman,2,"There is little to no support for the college football, track, or other sport teams because they're not very good."
College Freshman,2,"The housing situation in Pocatello is horrendous, with very few choices and those choices often being with slumlords."
College Freshman,2,I need more vegetarian food.
College Freshman,2,I do not like this place.
College Junior,2,"I have only known one person involved in greek life.  It seemed to dominate her whole life, but I never really saw it affect the rest of the campus at all"
College Freshman,2,"I personally feel that the cost for a permit is reasonable for a whole year of parking but the availability of parking is something to dread. I live an hour drive from campus, so a car is essential for me to get to school. I'd prefer to park closer to the buildings with my classes, but the majority of parking is in lower campus, while my classes are in upper campus."
College Sophomore,2,there is not a lot of homework
College Sophomore,2,i haven't started my program yet
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid is a constant headache. There is limited scholarships on campus, all with specific requirements I usually don't meet, Fafsa usually isn't much, and applying to online scholarships is just hours of time not even knowing if its worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a lot of different types of restaurants fairly close. From fast food like mcdonalds and taco bell, to  restaurants like ruby tuesdays. Mexican, 
italian, Sandwiches, steak houses, you name it."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really go out
College Sophomore,2,I don't live on campus
College Sophomore,2,While it seems there are quite a few scholarships they're usually for students who live with their 8 siblings have no job. Not much if you work and live in a single student household. 
College Junior,2,"My program has some odd requirements to be eligible. It doesn't seem like there are too many classes that you have to take to get in, but all of the classes have other prerequisites that make things highly inconvenient. Figuring out which classes you really do need to take is somewhat of a pain, but the advisors are good about helping to figure all of that out."
College Student,2,"workout facility is pretty great, library is a good source for studying. Campus events and traditions are almost non existent. I don't know of any of them"
College Junior,2,Most of the guys at the school that are hot are already taken. There are other guys though that are nice and actually listen to you. There is a lot of very religious guys at the school
College Junior,2,"Its just as average school, not too much going on but doing your own thing."
College Junior,2,"The majority of the students are caucasian, but there are a few international students.  It's hard to say overall, though, because I'm at a satellite branch of the school."
College Sophomore,2,There are really only parties to go to. All the bars ID here and they aren't that good to go to anyways. The best bet is to make friends with football players because they are always throwing parties at their houses.
College Junior,2,"It is very strict at this school. You either pass or fail, maybe in the intro classes they are more lenient, but with upper division courses, it is very strict with plagarism and cheating, it is either a F on the test or automatic F in the class. WIth social life, strict on campus to have any real normal college life, strict of alcohol, even with student housing outside of the campus. Most people just keep away from having real crazy fun, until they transfer out."
College Freshman,2,Class sizes are large and there is more graduate students than proffesors teaching the making college more memorization than learning.
College Freshman,2,"I do not enjoy the atmosphere, no pride to speak of, and the math program is terrible. All online and graduate students who don't care. Many classes are large I have not had one under thirty. The experience is less exciting than working all day."
College Freshman,2,"I've come to realize that you have to show financial need for more than 65% of the scholarships or you have to be of a certain race/religion. It seems that scholarships are not granted on a GPA or good standing basis anymore, and I feel like all of the scholarships require some sort of essay. Not everybody has time to write a perfect essay to get a scholarship."
College Junior,2,"Near the school, you have Taco Time, Subway, MacDonalds, Elmer's, I suppose that they are low enough cost.  Not sure about discounts, or more of a variety, do not live in Pocatello"
College Junior,2,"It was fairly easy to gain admission, need to have a good GPA or test scores that were comparability with the program.  Math, Lots of Math."
College Junior,2,"I would have liked to have one, but I am in my last semester."
College Freshman,2,In the winter walking to classes is not something I look forward to but the classrooms are warm! But in the fall it's nice to be outside in between classes.
College Senior,2,"The program I am enrolled in at Idaho State assigns busy work as we have to rewrite the labs we complete in class step by step, word for word, exactly as the printout handed to states. It is pointless and tedious. The registration process is difficult because if you have any fines on your record, you cannot register. They will not take it out of your financial aid, you have to pay upfront. For example, parking tickets; they are the bane of my existence. They oversell parking tickets at a ratio of like 15:1, for every parking spot, 15 people have a pass to park in that spot and it makes it nearly impossible to do anything. Hardly anyone lives on campus, most people commute as this is a non-traditional school. Anyways, the parking regulators are RIDICULOUS and hand out tickets like candy at a parade. They are completely unwilling to work with you to resolve the issues. Yes, you can appeal the tickets but no one I know has ever had an appeal result in their favor. You even have to buy a parking pass to park in a handicapped spot! ISU nickels and dimes you to death! They even charge you fees for your classes on top of tuition- usually with an excuse that it is a ""lab"" or a special class but it is upwards of $200-$300 dollars on top of ridiculous tuition that is the highest in the state (more than Boise State and University of Idaho- the schools that overpower ISU in every aspect)."
College Student,2,"It is Idaho Weather, which means it can be hot and sunny one minute, than an hour later you can be in a blizzard.    The summers stay pretty warm, and autumns are lasting longer and longer.  The winter is harsh, cold, and windy, so be prepared!"
College Sophomore,2,"We have a few good athletic programs. For example Girls Volleyball and Soccer have done really well. However, the football program is terrible."
College Junior,2,"I would not say the weather in ISU is the best because the winters are really harsh. For the students who grew up here, it is quite bearable but i have never been able to stand much snow so i would definitely give the weather a C especially since it affects my school. When it snows too much, i prefer to sleep at home which does not help me especially since classes hardly ever get cancelled."
Junior,1,"Professors are great as well as the students. The housing staff and facilities are HORRIBLE. Sports teams are a joke, with virtually zero school pride. If you go to school here do NOT get a meal plan. The food is by far the worst I've ever seen on a college campus. In conclusion, everything is sub par except the professors. Like i said previously, the housing staff are absolutely terrible people and down right mean. Live off campus if possible!"
College Junior,1,We only have one sorority and one fraternity. I have no motivation to join.
College Senior,1,"what greek life???????????, If your not Mormon then you are treated like an axe murderer"
College Freshman,1,Scholarship access at my school is disastrous
College Junior,1,I continually try to get some sort of help and it never seems to happen so I have started searching for ridiculous scholarships just to help me out and at least get me some money to afford to drive to school.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not much of a party scene on campus. If there are dances or events, it's not captivating for the whole student body."
College Sophomore,1,"Being a minority, I would be lying if I said it was easy going to ISU.  As much as I love it, most people you meet are going to come from places that have close to no diversity at all. They're going to assume things about you and fit you into stereotypes, but that's part of life. It's not their fault for not being exposed to such things before. ISU is also largely Republican, so those with Democrat views are often hard to find. Although there are many Mormons, they all are very friendly and respect me for my own religion. I don't see people often judging others for their sexual orientation. They may believe a certain thing about them, but they are generally very open to them."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene at all.
College Freshman,1,The staff is poorly informed and not knowledgeable and they care not in the least whether you attend or not due to financial aid. Absolutely the worst.
College Freshman,1,You wont survive long in Pocatello if your a vegetarian or vegan.
College Freshman,1,"There is no nightlife at Idaho State University. If your going to a bar, its likely to be filled with 40+ year old people."
College Freshman,1,"The campus police make everyone constantly feel like criminals if you spend more than three minutes standing next to your car, and their parking violations are ridiculous."
College Student,1,I do not attend parties so I have absolutely no idea on what goes on. I am a person who likes to study and care about my education. 
College Freshman,1,This school isn't very unique. It is a typical college campus.
College Senior,1,There is never anything to do in this small town. Ever!
College Senior,1,"They are ""trying something new this semester"" and it's taken well over half the semester to fix all the problems. "
College Sophomore,1,There is a lot of people from all around the world
College Sophomore,1,I haven't heard of anyone during drugs around here
College Sophomore,1,It is really hard to find a parking space 
College Sophomore,1,I'm not really interested in this topic

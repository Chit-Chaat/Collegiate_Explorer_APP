Junior,5,"By far the most caring and compassionate school I've ever experienced. I'm challenged each term with new instructors and information, yet everyone is like my cheerleader, always willing to help out if I need the guidance"
Junior,5,"While the terms are fast paced and 8 weeks long, I'm never bored and I feel I'm getting the most challenging yet rewarding experience a college can offer me. I would hands down recommend this college to any busy professional."
Alum,5,"I took all of my classes at Southern New Hampshire University online. The platform was great; with only two weekly deadlines, it was mostly self-paced, which is what I needed. There was a fair amount of self-teaching involved, but that also varied based on professors. Professors were very responsive to questions and concerns I had; it's school policy that they respond within 24 hours of your email. Advisors are also very involved and helpful as well. All-in-all, I never felt isolated, even as a fully online student. Great experience."
Alum,5,Southern New Hampshire University's online program made earning my B.S. possible when it would not have been otherwise. It allowed for me to establish a work/school/life balance that worked for me.
Sophomore,5,My experience at SNHU has been phenomenal. The professors and advisors have been great. They have always been accessible if I had questions or problems.
Sophomore,5,"SNHU makes it easy to take online classes. I wasn't sure that online learning was going to work for me, but it really did. I'm getting ""A's"" for the first time in my life. And my goal of graduating and getting my bachelor's degree is no longer a dream, I am making it a reality!"
Junior,5,The online platform very easy to navigate.The professor are very professional and easy to communication with online.
Junior,5,I have had great understanding experience as student that Southern New Hampshire University couldn’t ask for more.
Freshman,5,"I have taken all of my classes online, and the primer they give you to start is a really great resource to get you used to that format."
Sophomore,5,The professors are so helpful. I would recommend this  college to anyone that is looking to go full online. The ease of using the online is very helping and less stress.
Sophomore,5,The discussion boards were very helpful. From other students to the professors answering questions really helped me get through the courses with ease.
Junior,5,"The personable approach from the school was by far better than previous school. I enjoyed the accessibility  I had to my professors when did have an error or problem on an assignment. The advisors I've been dealing with is by far the best motivation I could have they contact me before, during, and after semester. The help I received on the financial aid and other avenues to accommodate my needs  were also greatly appreciated."
Junior,5,The online classes were very easy to navigate and to grasp with the concepts that you choose at the beginning. The school has a webpage that has all your courses in a tab that can help you go back and forth between to look and complete both assignments. The teachers are available for questions typically a 24 hour response time is the window usually hear a response before  the elapsed time given
Sophomore,5,Their online college experience is awesome for me because I'm a single mother working two jobs and I can complete the work on my own time frame within the due date of assignments. The 24/7 support you get from professors and your advisor is great. They are always there to help In any way possible.
Sophomore,5,I love how easy it is to navigate through the online system everything is one step at a time. the courses are in great detail and explained very well for our understanding.
Freshman,5,I just started this year but so far I’m loving everything about it. They communicate with you well and also help you with any questions.
Freshman,5,I’m just starting my online classes. I believe from the reviews and help I’m getting so far my online experience will be great.
Alum,5,"Southern New Hampshire University was the best college I've been to. The process of admissions, coaches, and aids were all around amazing. I did the online program via Duet and it was amazing."
Alum,5,"Yes, I did the online program and the instructors were great. I received the appropriate feedback and constructive critique to ensure my success throught my program."
Junior,5,I have never met more friendly professors and staff then I have ever met at SNHU. I feel extremely fortunate to have an opportunity to finish my degree online.
Junior,5,Whenever I have any questions all of the staff take the time to find out all the answers I need in order to succeed. I am so fortunate to have a wonderful group of people in my corner rooting me on.
Niche User,5,Online access was very simple. Having everything in a single online portal made everything very smooth.
Niche User,5,Yes I attended my classes exclusively online. There were quite a few classes that had materials included with the course so there was no need to buy books.
Alum,5,"Southern New Hampshire University helped to provide me with the flexibility of working full-time while also pursing my education. It was beneficial to be able to begin working in my field prior to graduation based on the foundational knowledge that I received.  I also am truly grateful for my academic advisor who continually checked-in and supported me through my degree. One thing that I would like to see differently within the online class platform is providing students with more virtual interaction with both the instructor as well as other students (ie. via Zoom, Skype, etc.) One challenge with remote learning is the lack of human interaction that not only can enhance student learning experience but can also aid in creating foundational networks for the students future."
Alum,5,"I completed all my classes online for my undergraduate degree with Southern New Hampshire University. While studying for my degree in Accounting, the instructors successfully provided me with the foundational tools that I needed to be successful in my career. The professors often provide educational context to textbook reading by providing hands on projects and modules that simulated the actual workforce. I can personally say that this level of learning has aided me in advancing in my career."
Freshman,5,"I got online to enter my info, no sooner clicked submit and within seconds my phone rang. The woman was informative and helpful. Extremely nice!"
Freshman,5,Im excited to start my online journey. I like that I can complete on my time. Being a single mother makes it hard.
Graduate Student,5,Wonderful professor and great classes. Recommend to anyone. There are plenty of class choices and lots of help for after college.
Graduate Student,5,The advisors are wonderful. Love the classes. Easy pace and no worry. Easy transition to grad school.
Senior,5,I'm an online student and appreciate studying independently. It's been a good experience so far and I'm glad I had the choice to study online during the global pandemic.
Senior,5,It's been a great experience and I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys studying independently.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a transfer student at Southern New Hampshire University. I attend school online and I chose this university for several reasons. From the moment I began my process to attend this school, everyone has been SO helpful with everything. They made the admission process a breeze and they answered every question I had. They made me feel like I belong and I felt happy with my decisions. I began my classes in August and I have loved everything about my school thus far. My professors are very helpful in interactive with me. They give me great feedback on my work and answers any questions I have about it. I am very confident that I will be a graduate of SNHU in 2024!"
Freshman,5,I am an online student but I have not had a problem from SNHU. Every one I have came in contact with is very helpful and respectful. They made the admission process easy for me and helped me get a better understanding of financial aid. They clearly explained everything to me and I am very confident in my school!
Junior,5,The online program is easy to use and a fantastic substitute for in class learning. It helps me to keep my current job to support my family and still gain an education
Junior,5,"I have nothing bad to say! I enjoy Brightspace and how the classes are structured. I'm an English major so I imagine it may be a little more difficult learning as a STEM major, though."
Junior,5,I've had a great experience taking courses at SNHU remotely. Some of the courses require a bit of self-teaching but professors are always accessible.
Freshman,5,"I really like this school, because they teach the material in an understandable way, they offer a lot of help like tutoring, and they are proactive with answering calls."
Freshman,5,I take all my classes online and really enjoy it. It is fast-paced and it teaches me a lot of tje things I need to know. The teachers are nice and helpful.
Alum,5,"I transferred to SNHU with the maximum 90 credits and took 10 classes there (all online) to acquire my remaining 30 credits in order to complete my BS in Business Administration. This is by no means an easy program. There were several classes that I took that had lengthy papers due every other week, if not every week; I wrote several papers that surpassed 25 pages and required extensive research. 
I would also suggest planning out your course schedule at least 3 semesters in advance as classes book up extremely quickly."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed attending this university. I was especially pleased that none of my previously earned credits had ""expired"" according to SNHU and were all transferred and utilized toward the degree that I was working on completing. This was an amazing contributing factor to keeping my degree costs down as much as possible. Another thing that I appreciated was the 10% discount for Phi Theta Kappa members, which I just happened to be! Since I was paying for my classes out of pocket, receiving no financial aid or tuition reimbursement, and avoiding taking out any student loans, the 10% discount saved me a significant amount of money.
What I wasn't a fan of, personally, was the policy that students had to essentially prove their academic abilities before they were allowed to take 3 classes per term. As someone who was trying to finish my degree as soon as possible, this did not appeal to me because it threw a wrench into my plan. 

Highly recommend."
Junior,5,"As stated before, I find the online experience to be perfect and something that I needed with my busy lifestyle. I also find the accelerated learning to be a plus and also if I find that I have any issues, I know that I can get in touch with someone who can help me."
Junior,5,"I go to school online and work full time and this college offers me everything I would ever really need. As someone who has struggled with online classes for years, it is refreshing to know that with this college I have the support I need to be successful in my endeavors. I am also happy with the accelerated learning offered earning my Bachelor's degree in around 3 years instead of the normal 4."
Freshman,5,"The course catalog is very direct and with the eight week courses, you are taught the main core of each class. I automatically fell in love with this university for the main reason of online learning. Online learning for me has been amazing. The professors respond very quickly and they give the necessary guidance needed to succeed. I love the fact that you can move at your own pace and most of your work is already unlocked so you can complete your assignments in a timely manner within the 8 week term."
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled at southern New Hampshire University and I must say that attending this college was the best decision I've made. The advisors are very friendly and willing to work with you in achieving your academic goals. The professors are very realistic and work with students that so they can achieve their highest potential. This university is equipped with many different resources that are beneficial to almost any crisis that someone may encounter.
Freshman,5,"My admissions advisor, Rachel, was amazing. She fast tracked my application in two days so that I was able to begin on 31 Aug 2020. She did all of this on the weekend, which I greatly appreciated. 
After I started, the school called and asked how my first day went-EXCELLENT, of course. 
I completed all of my tasks early and one of my instructors thanked me for being so open and honest in the 
""Introduction Discussion"". 
Overall, I'm excited to begin classes and I can't wait to see where I go in my educational life and into my chosen career path."
Freshman,5,"I am already bragging about beginning classes at SNHU. I have told my best friend how helpful my admission advisor is and how they were concerned about my first day during our initial phone call. They called me at the end of the day to ask how I felt about my first day of classes. 
I truly believe I'm going to succeed here at SNHU"
Junior,5,My online experience is great! I am a student and I am treated as such. SNHU makes sure that we are a priority and the curriculum is the same just like being a in person student. I love online because it is very convenient and it helps me learn at my pace. SNHU gives us the encouragement we need to succeed as online students.
Junior,5,My university puts its students first. Having a voice is important for us. We are included in decisions. Diversity is a huge thing for SNHU. Making every student feel welcomed and included.
Junior,5,My expirence at SNHU was wonderful the staff is great. The classes teach you real world knowledge and get you ready for your job.
Junior,5,"The people helping me with my classes, financial aid, and admission were very knowledgeable and helpful. The proffesors were very nice and accomadting since we these were online classes. Overall it was a great experience."
Senior,5,"I took all of my classes online, and it matched wonderfully with my schedule.I was able to manage two jobs while finishing my degree."
Sophomore,5,Online learning platform is well laid out. Willingness to help and explain any questions that you may have.  Financial Aid explained everything very well.
Senior,5,I really loved this school. It's easy but fast paced so you can get your degree in no time at all. I can even work while getting my degree.
Senior,5,"I loved this college. It was easy and very affordable to go to. The classes are easy, but informative."
Graduate Student,5,They are on top of everything and do all of the leg work. So far they have been extremely helpful and supportive.
Graduate Student,5,"have not started yet, but have heard great things from my sister who is now an alumni. I'm excited to get started in this program."
Senior,5,They are very hands on and will guide you through every step of the enrollment process as well as getting adjusted to being an online student.
Junior,5,SNHU has a beautiful campus located in Manchester New Hampshire.  The surrounding area brings me back to home.  The campus itself is pretty big and they have an amazing center for those of us that have served in the military.
Sophomore,5,"The online experience is amazing, teachers reply within 24 hours of sending emails. They give great feedback on work and give opportunity to everyone."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far has been amazing, I love the classes and environment at Southern New Hampshire University."
Graduate Student,4,Accelerated semesters (8 weeks) lead to a fast pace towards getting your degree.  Great advising team.  Expect a lot of reading and writing.
Graduate Student,4,"With any school, you get what you put into it.  If you put forth good effort, you will succeed.  The advisors are there to help you."
Junior,4,The classes here are really great and i have enjoyed most of them. i with there was a bit more communication in terms of financial aid but other than that everyone has been really helpful!
Junior,4,All of my classes have been online and it works really well while working full time. I would recommend this for anyone who also works!
Freshman,4,As an incoming freshmen I found the staff to be very helpful and they really worked for me instead of against me during the process.
Freshman,4,Working Online at SNHU helps me especially because I work a full-time job. They have great online support to help you excel in your academics.
Freshman,4,SNHU has been a great experience for me so far I am just starting out only this is the virus gets in the way of learning.
Sophomore,4,So far it's been an easy process enrolling and getting the classes I need. Overall it was really easy to transfer from my junior college and get accepted into this one.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at SNHU. The professors are incredible and I graduated with field experience, got my first choice job, and am ready to go back to school for my masters"
Graduate Student,4,I enjoy this university due to the understanding of the instructors and the course work. I am not stressed and the pace is good with  someone who works full time.
Graduate Student,4,Great Instructors and information for following instructions is great.The instructors are very helpful and email students to keep everyone informed.
Junior,4,I've only taken online classes with SNHU and I find it to be the best method in this climate. Their platform is so user friendly and well equipped and the professors are great and accommodating.
Junior,4,Ive had the best experience so far with Southern New Hampshire University. They have been nothing but kind accommodating and helpful with the process of application and enrollment and the course professors are also amazing.
Junior,4,Great administration services especially over the phone. Tech support is quick to respond. My counselor is always available and quick responsive when I need them.
Sophomore,4,"I have found within my program(s) (I'm essentially a double major) that most of my professors and instructors have been quite engaged. I have had strong rapport with a few, particularly those in my direct field of study, and feel that educationally, I'm learning as much if not more than I did at brick-and-mortar universities, including a large SEC school renowned for academics. I do sometimes feel as though some professors and instructors pass along my work without giving me much critical feedback, but this is truly no different than my aforementioned college experiences that were not exclusively online."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience has been generally positive. In a few of my lower-level courses, I have felt a little ""shuffled,"" like I'm just a number --- but this is no different than what I felt at brick-and-mortar universities. I'm given reasonable assignments and often given excellent supplemental material. I am a self-starter in a research-heavy field of study, and I don't feel as if I'm ""missing"" much by utilizing a non-traditional route."
Senior,4,Southern New Hampshire was a wonderful experience over all. The faculty worked with me every step of the way.
Sophomore,4,"Very good experience, helpful staff. Only experienced the online learning. Would highly recommend this university. Financial Aid office explains everything very well also."
Senior,4,All of my classes are online the staff is very helpful and diligent and there are tons of resources for students to get help when they need it
Junior,4,SNHU has a great online program and a flexible staff that are there 24 hours to help you with anything you need.  The courses are perfect for what I would love to attend in the future and it helps me bring out my creativity.
Senior,4,"The opportunity to advance my nursing career though an online bachelor's program has been invaluable. Especially through these unsure times, the university has given me the ability to improve myself in a safe way."
Freshman,4,"I like that through the online campus, I am able to create my own schedule since I am a working adult. If I could change anything, it would be the consistency from class to class and in the grading process."
Junior,4,Working along with admission staff is a courteous process. I replied to Pursue University only cost and location limited their acceptance. I plan to join a work-study program center in New Hampshire where I will move to in the future.
Junior,4,working with Southern New Hampshire staff has been a pleasure. I am in phase with the animations process and preparing to pay for college expenses.
Alum,4,The online program itself was great I had a few instructors that were difficult or to contact or had incredibly delayed response times which often resulted in me receiving information about a project I had already submitted due to deadlines.

Junior,4,"Professors have been very accommodating especially during a pandemic. I have been with SNHU for 4 terms now, (8 weeks))  You get 2 weeks before class to go through the class and get familiar with it. Tutoring, writing center, math center. So much help available."
Junior,4,"Southern New Hampshire University has been extremely easy to work with, easy to learn, and easy to understand. Many schools confuse you, here you get straight answers."
Senior,4,"Convenient online learning, many very understanding and knowledgeable professors. Interface for study, email, and more is user friendly.
Would like to see some updates to the course structure so there is more variety and less monotony. A little character and change things up a bit go a long way."

Freshman,4,"I do enjoy going here and glad I chose this school as the place to further my education and work towards a better future. I am an online student going for my bachelors in criminal justice and it has not been easy. I also work two jobs as well so I do not have much time to dedicate to school and pretty much no free time at all. This school and the people who have hlped me in it are probably the only reasons I have been able to keep up with my schoolwork as it is, if not for people like my academic advisor working to help me as much as they have I would not have been able to make it as far as I have."
Niche User,4,"Carla, the admissions advisor, was quick to answer all my questions. She explained that there are no timed requirements. Everything can be done on my own schedule. Professors respond within twenty-four hours, and all the course materials are available online."
Niche User,4,"SNHU has been great about helping me go to back to school. After being out of college for over ten years, I was nervous they'd laugh me right off the phone. Everyone I've talked to has been great about helping me, and proactive about my case. The only thing I wish would change is that they have only the male/female options for ""legal gender."" As a nonbinary person, it would be amazing to be able to accurately reflect myself in my documents."
Sophomore,4,The professors are extremely helpful and normally respond to you within 24 hours. The support staff is always available no matter the time.
Freshman,4,I’m a freshman this year . My classes start August 31st and I am excited to get the ball rolling. So far my student advisors have been helping me get all the information I need and answer any questions I have .
Freshman,4,the online student portal is very easy to use and my advisor is easy to contact and always replies to emails promptly
Senior,4,"I attend SNHU's online school. There is a lot of consistency between classes from term to term; all classes are scored out of 1000 points, and classes follow an eight week timeline. I do feel as though the professors really do not care about you or your work, as much of the feedback I have received has been very short and unspecific."

Freshman,4,"I'm glad I can go to college online. I don't think I'd want to go to a class in-person right now, and the resources are really helpful at this particular school. The advisors and counselors are super nice and helpful too; I don't feel nervous when I talk to them like I do with a lot of my teachers."
Senior,4,It is a good online experience for the most part especially to learn on my own time while having a job and taking care of two disabled parents. The time for assignments is crunched sometimes but within reason with the fast paced semester's. I only wish for more learning from each class and for videos of professors themselves sometimes or class meeting optional to be available more as well as resources for certain learning in which is hard to access to depending on the program.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my experience at SNHU. My program was online, which worked well for me since I work fulltime."
Alum,4,"Took classes online. For me it was much easier, and more convenient than going in person because I work full-time. So I was able to work around me schedule, which was flexible."
Junior,4,"I was forced to transition to online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Although my instructors weren't prepared for this shift, they quickly made due with what they had and managed to still deliver a structured learning experience. I am continuing online classes into Fall 2020, and I believe SNHU will do a good job with this new shift because it is one of the leading online universities in the country. I achieved a 4.0 in my first semester of online classes, which helped me realize I could perform as well online as I did on campus."
Senior,4,Most professors are very understanding! I only had one class where the professor had no compassion for what I had going on at home!
Freshman,4,The online classwork should be better organized. It takes a bit to search for things because they are scattered all over and may be titled differently than the way the instructor refers to them.
Freshman,4,"I just started with Southern New Hamshire University online in March of this year. I chose them because I liked what I was hearing/reading about their Psychology program. So far, the school has been meeting my expectations. In all of my classes so far, the instructors are fairly quick to respond to any questions, inquires, and assistance with any difficulties if needed. I feel like I am learning a lot with the courses I have taken so far and the material covered within the classes is relevant to my career path. The one thing that I would change about SNHU is that sometimes the syllabuses and rubrics for the courses can be a little confusing at times, so I would like to see them changed to be a little more clear on what is being expected of the students."
Graduate Student,4,"There are 24 /7 resources available such as the tech support,  libraries, and weekend advisors. I loved that they help with resume and job searching engines. The classes online was easy to navigate through."
Graduate Student,4,Thank you SNHU it’s a blast to be in your campus if I get this money I will invest in my education and the master program
Senior,4,It has been a journey to remember  and if I had to do it all over again I wish I started at SNHU. This school had given me a lot to remember and look forward to.
Senior,4,Like any School its not easy but I have accomplished so much and it had been a journey to remember.  I wish I started there it would have been much better to have everything in one place.
Sophomore,4,"I'm not sure if there's anything I would say needs to change but I really like how diverse the campus is, there's always something to do as well. Everyone's always encouraging each other to get out and be involved in some way or another."
Alum,4,"Enrollment was a seamless process and quick with rolling admissions. Once I was accepted into the school I was assigned an 2 different advisors who was extremely helpful throughout my time at the school. They were always responsive and helpful with any questions I had regardless of day or time. The teachers were also great, always available to help students with anything at anytime."
Freshman,4,"I found this college to be very helpful to me, the admissions process was very easy and had not trouble at all in signing up, I was also able to transfer my credits without any mishaps. The university offers many different interesting programs and provide valuable information for each degree.  The college offers many resources that can help you find information about many almost anything and has a good support staff that is very helpful. 
I would recommend this college to anyone that is willing to improve or looking for a degree.; because of what the college offers. 
I found the courses for my degree challenging at times and had to do some research on the subject matter.  The only thing that I would recommend is, improving the online portion the college offers. It would help a of students by improving more  interactions and activities that can give students a real connection with its instructors. This truly is a good school and can improve your life with a good education."
Niche User,4,SNH has online counselors who help you through your course. They invite you to come to their campus if you choose and their tuitions is the lowest I have ever seen. They offer a very excellent wide range of degrees also.
Freshman,4,"I loved the campus, it was very new and up to date. The dorms looked nice and clean and new as well. It is close to home which I like, and the food on campus is amazing. although I wish they had more health care classes on campus."
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed the price of applying to southern New Hampshire university. I had a  great response from my admissions advisor on how to choose my classes, and any question that I had for them. I also felt comfortable talking to the financial assistant about anything money related."
Graduate Student,4,I appreciated the satellite options for cohorts that allowed me to access my graduate program from my home state of Vermont.
Freshman,4,"As an online student I cannot comment on student life, however the online program is easy to understand and response times are quick."
Freshman,4,"Snhu has been a really good experience for me, so far, and they are very helpful. The professors and advisors make themselves very available and return calls and emails very quickly. My credits were transferred from over 15 years ago and I found that most are transferable, which is a big help when returning to school later in life."
Sophomore,4,"I first chose SNHU because I read that they had one of the best ratings for Cybersecurity, and I have to agree. I was an online student for SNHU and I had my worries at first since I am in a different state and most online schools I have attended or visited, online courses were difficult to run but at SNHU it was smooth sailing and I was able to keep up and get all the materials I needed. My only issue was the financial department was hard to get a hold of."
Freshman,2,"As a former student, I was caught aback by just how little they cared about their online students. There were no opportunities for networking or advancement. It was more about 'do the work, get the paper at the end'. I was even told by the honors society head that they absolutely refuse online students. The classes were remedial and offered no chance to excel. Dropped out after the first semester out of boredom because it offered absolutely no intellectual stimulation."

Freshman,2,"I take all of my classes online. It is at times difficult to get ahold of professors, and I had a negative experience when filing a dispute against a professor who agreed to update my grade and then never did. When I spoke to the person in charge of my claim, it was very clear that she didn't even read it and tried to belittle me for filing the claim in person. I'm confident that had this all been handled in person, I would have received better treatment."
Alum,2,The advisors were okay but offered little to no help after graduation.  I have now had my masters degree for over a year and have yet to find a job making more than minimum wage.  What a humungous waste of time and money. I had to go back to my undergrad school for help finding a good job.  Don't waste your time here!
Niche User,2,"I was forced to take a class that had nothing to do with my major, making it impossible for me to complete the course work."
Senior,2,"My experience at Southern New Hampshire University has been horrible. While the University does have excellent Academic Advisors and a few of their Professors/Instructors are super nice. There are so many others negative issues with their courses, syllabus and curriculum. The required courses are boring and nothing to do with your current major. I am currently attending online and I would not recommend a new student to attend their online courses. The video tutorials are outdated and are very confusion to understand. The textbooks are expensive and there are also too many learning modules per course. No, I would not recommend SNHU. I am an older student, maybe that is why I am being so honest."
Freshman,2,"I signed up for the online program in the understanding that it would work with the current obligations I have going on in my life. I was told that I would be able to work at my own pace and have one deadline. Instead I had to read and do a quiz the middle of the week and have a post on a discussion board done by Sunday. Which in theory would be nice if I didn't currently have obligations. Then when I had unexpected things come up, I got behind.  When I did turn in my work the professor wasn't too helpful on the things I needed to work on. Most the time they told me to look at my syllabus and rubric. After  I decided SNHU was not the school for me, I had a hard time with the financial aid, my FAFSA and other grants were not on my bill. Overall I really felt disappointed, I was so excited to go back to school and then I hit a brick wall of problems."
Senior,2,"Financial services is no help.  They did not even go over any methods of paying for college at the beginning of my time there (scholarships, grants, loans).  Some teachers should not be teaching their particular course.  I asked for assistance from a teacher as to where in the book I could find the correct answers to the questions she said I missed on the exam and she said she didn't have time for things like that.  All I wanted was page numbers.  I have had very few teachers so far that have been helpful.  Career advisors who seem to be gone more than they are there.  Financial aid cannot get their paperwork in order.  They say contact loan servicer for a particular form.  I do this and fill out my part and send it back via the school's website.  I confirm receipt of the paperwork the same day and yet, a week later they are still hounding me for this information.  A bunch of little things that make me regret having transferred into this school."
Junior,2,"Online learning weak in English department.  Deadlines are just a sample.  half the class submits assignments on weekends.  They make 2 assignments just one and many don't follow guidelines and instructors don't enforce them.
I work 2 jobs....  while taking classes"
College Freshman,2,All I have to say is if your going to join any do Kappa otherwise its pointless!
College Freshman,2,"I am going to 100% honest I came for the liberal arts program which is pretty good but I am a business major and their business core is just awful. You are required to take a bunch of gen ed courses that make no sense to your major and 8 week classes that your teacher will most likely cancel (if your paying $40,000 class should not be cancelled that much). 

While the sense of community is great and their are some pretty fun events it can be difficult to be involved on campus because the clubs are so biased and are like your high school clubs where friends have their friends be in power positions. Greek life also sucks and their are only like 2 good party spots other then clubs and tbh campus is dead on the weekends because for some reason half the campus goes home.

Resident Assistants party and quiet hours are never obeyed when its midterm and finals week. They dont tell you that the dorms you may be stuck in have mold and the bathrooms are disgusting, and your paying $8,000 for it still. 

Some of the pros for SNHU are the staff because OneStop and Academic Advising are awesome and if you have the guts to go see Career Development they will hook you up with some awesome job and internships. Also the Professors are amazing and fair, I will emphasize that a lot of them cancel class a lot which may sound awesome but when your paying this much money you want to be getting something out of it. 

Last thing I would say though is SNHU is basically High School just without all the friends you have known for years and as for the experience its pretty mediocre. Needless to say I am transferring!"
College Freshman,2,On the Southern New Hampshire University campus there are no Greek Houses. There are only two greek life families (two sororities and two fraternities). Greek life does not have much affect on campus and most people don't pay much attention to them.
College Senior,2,"I don't think employers pay enough for individuals with degrees. I take classes on line, so I'am unaware of the career service at the school."
College Freshman,2,Housing is difficult sometimes. The best dorms are very expensive and some of the cheaper dorms really need some work. The social atmosphere is pretty good.
College Freshman,2,Unless you play the sport or are related to a player he games are mostly ignored. It's hard to get students hyped up about games when our schools lacks a football team. Our cheer team is mediocre and the baseball team is exclusive.
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any Greek life.
Recent Alumnus,2,"As an online student, you can't actually speak with anyone in FA, just a call center, and they don't have all of the information.  I am in the middle of doing an appeals as their FA policies do not make sense."
College Sophomore,2,"I still need more cash to go to school and survive. The loans all have to be paid back...I sure do hope I am able to land a good job after school, just to pay for the schooling I will have gotten...it is very hard."
College Junior,2,"Not a big influence in the school. The frats and sororities don't live in their own places, the members just try to live nearby. They don't represent any majority or popularity on campus."
College Junior,2,I wouldn't know I refused to pay attention to the drama
College Senior,2,"Because if a few incidents, the city police are now allowed to patrol and enter rooms.  This poses having parties nearly impossible."
College Senior,2,"My freshman year, the weekends were fun and usually non-confrontational.  As a senior who doesn't participate in the consumption of alcohol, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music.  The Public Safety officers bring city police onto campus and give them free will to enter dorms that appear ""suspicious or loud.""  I have had to let the police search my room because my music was too loud, and they were under the assumption there could have been illegal activity.  As a person who appreciate their civil liberties, I do not condone the violation of privacy my university deems acceptable."
College Freshman,2,The only attractive boys here play sports
College Senior,2,If you are not living in the new buildings then its not worth the cost.
College Sophomore,2,"When I called about financial aid, I was given a list of scholarships to try for and advised to apply for loans."
College Sophomore,2,Greek Life is not a huge part at SNHU.
College Freshman,2,"have never been to a computer lab, but i know there are some decent ones. i have my own laptop. wifi here is horrendous which is weird considering its a school with a huge online program."
College Freshman,2,"typical new england weather. Winter is snowy, cold, and brutal but a lot of people ski."
College Freshman,2,i wouldn't really call it greek life
College Freshman,2,Would go to a school with a better program
College Freshman,2,"So far, the work is way easier than high school. Registration is a mess, and if you do not have early registration, you will be lucky to get a single class that you want. It is incredibly difficult to get the classes you need for potential majors, especially if you have normal registration. Workload is average, but every class back-loaded the semester; weeks of no work were followed by 3 projects per class, all due within the same week. Professors leave something to be desired; I have had professors correct my papers with spelling errors in their own corrections. "
College Freshman,2,"Public Safety certainly leaves a lot to be desired. People from off-campus jumped one of my friends and stole his iPhone, and proceeded to tell his mother (after her son was hospitalized from the resulting injuries), that ""it happens all the time and there is not much they can do"". I now feel the need to carry mace. Local police determined that the assailants were not even SNHU students, they were locals looking to rob students. When another friends windshield was cracked with footprints left all over it, while parked on campus, Public Safety told her that there was nothing they could do because the cameras on campus ""don't actually work"". Personally, my car broke down on campus while I was in community parking. Public Safety was incredibly rude on the phone, but gave me permission to leave my car for 24 hours. Even when my car was removed before the deadline, I was fined. "
College Freshman,2,"The Greek community is barely noticeable, but the pledging is incredibly long. For males especially, pledging is time consuming and involves an excessive number of logged study hours in the library. Overall, I have heard more complaints than  anything else from friends who have pledged. "
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do on campus, we are in the middle of no where if you don't have a car it kinda stinks. The parties get shut down very early and the RA's are bound to write you up under any condition"
College Freshman,2,"The best schedule could be better if you want to go into downtown Manchester. It could be a lot better, run more frequently, etc. Very hard to get transportation to Boston to a large airport. Definitely a car would be handy, but parking isn't always the easiest to find."
College Sophomore,2,I'm paying my career cash.
College Freshman,2,"Not being a partier, I'd rate the nightlife here as average. "
College Freshman,2,"Because there is no football team, baseball is the biggest sport on campus. "
College Freshman,2,I truly have no idea how the financial aid process went. I didn't handle it.
College Sophomore,2,"Not terribly important, though the Soccer Team has a large enough following."
Senior,1,This school is terrible I literally just went through a dispute to get a new teacher because the current one was discriminating against me for medical reasons in the middle of COVID-19. They sent me a letter literally admitting she had in fact discriminated but they would not get me a new teacher or fire her from the school to prevent this from happening to someone else.
Sophomore,1,"Don't let these reviews fool you. This is the worst college I've ever been to. My goodness I'd sooner cut off my own foot than to go back to this place. They label this college as affordable but it's a lie. The tuition is incredibly high even if you live in the same state as the college. The staff is rude and hostile for no reason. The professors don't grade on time and most don't give a crap about their students. I heard one professor called a student an idiot because she didn't understand a question.

I had a friend that got an Academic Dismissal and she was upset about it. When she tried explaining her situation, the woman on the phone laughed at her and told her it's not her problem. How unprofessional! Don't sign up for this horrible school unless you want to deal with unprofessional staff members and a non-affordable tuition. Seriously you can find cheaper colleges."
Sophomore,1,Websites need to stop labeling this college as affordable. No it is not. Look anywhere else but at this college. The online classes are decent. However don't expect your grades back ASAP. Most teachers take their time but a few are pretty fast.
Graduate Student,1,"I have had nothing but problems and stress from attending Southern New Hampshire University. There were terms I had to take off and prolong my degree because of the faculty not doing their job or notifying me with important information. They also did not inform me that I owed $700 once I finished my degree and couldn't receive my diploma until it was paid off out of pocket. Overall, it was a stressful time and I feel that my future career path was screwed because of the staff I dealt with."
Niche User,1,"Tenured teachers only care about collecting their paychecks. The only advice they will ever offer is ""read the syllabus."" And their favorite past time is to wait several weeks, a minimum of two, before they will grade anything and expect you to play catch up and make corrections for a final that is due in less than eight hours. If they actually did their job things wouldn't be stressful. Apparently asking a teacher ""How does this not answer and fit what the syllabus  says"" is asking them to hold your hand through the assignment. I swear I thought 'teachers' this terrible were only in movies and television shows. No one cares to correct their behavior and you have a better chance teaching a stray cat to high-five on command than getting a teacher to actually teach."
Niche User,1,"Not very student focused. I switched schools after a year of attending, because I felt like I could get a better education in the field I was going for (graphic arts) on YouTube, and I felt like I would not be marketable in that field even after graduating."
Graduate Student,1,"It is a non-profit but acts as a for-profit, admission staff are rude, very money oriented college but you get little for what you pay for. The instructors were inexperienced adjunct professors, and their job seems to be, basically to read a powerpoint, quality of eductaion is pretty low. It is basically a diploma mill. If I had known how it was, I wouldn'thave  chosen it in the first place."
Graduate Student,1,"Some of the professors are a joke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  That is all, I would require they have a clue what they are doing before hiring them."
College Freshman,1,Public Safety is a joke on campus people know they arent going to get in trouble and their are never consequences. They never take action and just drive around aimlessly.
College Freshman,1,As a freshman I got stuck in Upper Suites which are the crappiest dorms their besides Lower which is even worse. Their is mold in them and the carpeting is disgusting and the showers make you want to leave ASAP partner that with the thinnest walls ever and it makes for a interesting adjustment to SNHU.
College Junior,1,These people are the worse than the movies
College Freshman,1,On campus we don't have specific housing for our greek life so it's lacks a lot of the lust that comes with greek life especially down south.
College Sophomore,1,"The admissions review team is narrow minded and unwilling to admit to their mistakes. I was accepted but they misunderstood my application materials, judged me according to their misperceptions, and refused to revisit my file after I explained the truth. The admissions coordinator lied to multiple members of my class. My advice - AVOID SNHU."
College Freshman,1,Greek Life at SNHU seems pointless to me.
College Junior,1,"Scholarships are only offered for on campus students, leaving online students to fend for themselves and try to find scholarships online. This is especially tedious when you are considered a dependent of a parent with a six figure income, despite the fact that you live on your own without any support from either parent. They should think about extending scholarships to COCE students."
College Sophomore,1,SNHU greek life is embarrassing and almost plays no part in the social life on campus.
College Junior,1,"I initially had an issue with my Federal Student Aide, and no one contacted me for 2 weeks to correct it.  When they locked me out of my class, they offered no help in how to fix it.  It took multiple calls to find someone who could explain what was wrong and how to fix it.  When I ask about scholarships, internships, or job location assistance, I get brushed off.  They have offered absolytely no assistance of any kind."
College Freshman,1,"parking here is horrible. Horribly set up, makes no sense. Expect at least 89 tickets in your first week."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly this school would be tight if it wasn't for the public safety officers. Just the dumbest bunch of assholes you will encounter on campus, you can't even respect them. All they do is give out extremely large amounts of parking tickets and try to bust kids having a good time."
College Freshman,1,"The permit is $200 for freshman which I found ridiculous; the ticketing happens all the time, and if you don't have a car on campus you are basically stranded. "

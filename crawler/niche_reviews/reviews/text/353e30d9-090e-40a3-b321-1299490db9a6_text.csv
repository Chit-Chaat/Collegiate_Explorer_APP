Junior,5,The school is a great experience for everyone. The small class sizes allows for easy one on one conversations with professors and easy communication about grades.

Freshman,5,CBU is an excellent place to find the support systems that will be with you for the rest of your life. The resources available to both current students and alums are top of the line and unmatched elsewhere. CBU will prep you for the toughest career paths while remaining one of the best places on earth
Freshman,5,Christian Brothers University has a beautiful campus with a very attentive and and caring staff. The student body are always there to help and the school offers a wide variety of clubs and activities to the students. The only thing I'd want to change about the school are that some dorms are small and minimalist. They aren't cramped but it may take some getting used to.
Senior,5,"Small, close-knit environment that, when you get involved, feels like a family. Sometimes it can feel too small and too limited in terms of opportunities, but if you are looking to know your professors, know administrators, and be a student leader in organizations (or looking to start a new organization!), CBU is the place for you!"
Freshman,5,Christian Brothers University is an exciting university filled with amazing people that you would have never expected to meet nor see in your life.
Freshman,5,I love my school and I love the dorm life. I have many friends. I love the students and academics but I feel like more needs to be done to keep campus safe.
Freshman,5,"Christian Brothers University is the place I call home. In this environment, I feel protected, but also safe enough to go outside of my comfort zone. The professors always encourage my best work, even when I am going through something. Organizations like the Honors Program have helped me grow in ways that I didn't even know I was capable of growing in. Overall, CBU is a great choice for anyone, especially those who want to push their own boundaries and change the world for the better."
Alum,5,Small college and wonderful campus. Great teacher to student ratio for a more personal experience. I would recommend any high school student to come make a visit!
Freshman,5,Great teacher to student ration. Classes are not over crowded. Teachers are very reachable. It is a campus to feel safe on. Great parking as well. Looking forward to earning my degree.
Freshman,5,I'm going to start college this year but when I visited the campus I loved the atmosphere. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The college has a good class size and excellent staff.
Freshman,5,"The people are kind and the staff is very nice. As soon as you walk on campus you feel welcomed and you don't feel like a outcast. The environment overall is calm and peaceful, there's kind people all around campus as well."
Freshman,5,"Christian Brothers University has been one of the best choices I've made since graduating high school the campus is safe, they offer a variety of scholarships the professors and staff are attentive, professional and easy to talk to when you need more understanding of subjects and my peers are like family, we look out for each other. I love CBU. The campus is safe my mom gets stopped wveryrime she comes in campus  and she's there everyday lol the campus cafeteria food is great with a variety of options.Laundry is free so I don't have have to lug clothes home on the weekend"
Freshman,5,"Academically it’s has been very enriching and fulfilling. Campus life is good. The overall academic, social, and campus life exceeds expectations."
Freshman,5,"Christian Brothers University is a great school to further your education and connect with people from all over he world. The connection with the teachers is great and the class sizes are small. Campus life is good and helps with sleep and studying. the school has on campus facilities and  academic success centers to help students succeed as much as possible. Overall, Christian Brothers University will provide you with a great learning experience."
Freshman,5,"Christian Brothers University is a great University to attend if you would like to receive multiple academic scholarships and sports scholarships. A high percentage of students that attend this university receive a large amount of scholarships academically. I had a 3.0 in high school and i received over $12,000 in for an academic scholarship! The class are also very small so getting help from the professor is a lot more accessible. The class size on average is about 15-20 students. Many of the professors have office hours two to three times a week and they are very friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,"Christian Brothers University is located in the heart of Memphis, and is a highly sought after school for local and national employers.  The small class sizes allow for a truly personalized education.  The professors provide a great educational experience in a faith based environment."
Senior,5,"CBU is an excellent place to learn. The class sizes are small and the professors are really dedicated to your education. It can be a bit expensive, especially if you're planning to live on campus. But, CBU tends to be very generous with financial aid and are willing to work with students to make it more affordable."
Senior,5,"CBU is such an amazing university. I am so glad that I am a student here. Faculty and staff are always so helpful, and I have noticed that they want students to succeed. The honors program is amazing. I feel good about being nerdy about things I like."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is super nice, and your professors actually care about you and your future. The school is small, but that just allows you to easier access to leadership roles, getting involved, and getting internships or experience in your desired feild."
Freshman,5,"I just started my Freshman year of college here, and so far I have been very impressed. The classes are very thorough and never crowded. All of the faculty are friendly and approachable; I have no trouble going to any one of my professors for help. The Christian Brothers themselves are very uplifting and inspiring people, both as a group and as individuals. They are always there to give wise guidance and a kind word of encouragement. Very striking is the intelligence, kindness, and integrity of the students; it truly shows that CBU holds strongly to the Lasallian principles of a quality education and social justice. The manner of the students, professors, and Brothers make it understood by all who enter the CBU campus that it is a safe place where all are welcome, where the dignity of the human person is respected, and where we remember that we are always in the holy presence of God. St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, pray for us! Live Jesus in our hearts forever!"
Senior,5,Christian Brothers University  has been a home to me. It has not only helped me grow my knowledge but it has helped me grow in my faith.
Freshman,5,I think that overall CBU is excellent! CBU is very diverse because I am exposed to different cultures. The proffesors that I met during orientation and welcome weekend were very nice and helpful. I feel safe while I am on campus because security is always present. The campus is beautiful and always kept clean. It is in an excellent location because it's not far from my home. The campus food is delicious and is always fresh. CBU is an inviting community.
Sophomore,5,"My experience as a first year student at CBU was by far one of the best in my life. From the small class sizes to more than devoted teachers , you really learn a lot at the school. Every student is nice and we are like a big family its amazing."
Senior,5,"Overall Christian Brothers University is a fantastic school. The professors are all very committed to making sure that they're really teaching rather than just giving you grades. The quality of education is my favorite thing about being a student here. 
The campus itself is somewhat modest but what it lacks in size it makes up for in resources. There are tutors in math, writing and language available by appointment completely free to students. But if the academic resources weren't already enough, the school also takes care of their students' in ways that go beyond the classroom. The student life office periodically organizes trips to Target for residential students who don't have cars. During finals week the school pays for therapy dogs to come for stressed students. One day they randomly set an icecream truck in the middle of campus and gave away free popsicles."
Junior,5,"Christian Brother's University is an amazing school. It's staff and students are very diverse. The campus is also small and student oriented. Classes consists of usually 10 students which makes student teacher interaction more reliable. I've met some of the best school mates as well as teachers and faculty. CBU provides a lot of opportunities to become involved on campus. There are many clubs, organizations, and events that are open to anyone. I would recommend CBU to anyone, because I believe it is the best college experience and environment."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved CBU when I toured.  The campus is absolutely beautiful. Also, i love the small school/class environment because I have always had very small class at my small christian school. I like that at CBU that I will be able to see the professors directly if I have any question or need help in a course."
Niche User,5,"I attended CBU for my freshman year of college.  I absolutely loved my experience studying and making new friends at this incredible school.  The small campus size makes for personable, individualized learning opportunities that are simply not possible at larger schools.  This college provides its students with great educational opportunities, wonderful professors, and beautiful memories."
Freshman,5,"CBU is a community that takes pride in their school. THe professors are extremely knowledgeable in their fields and many are active in the huge variety of student clubs. The campus is very accommodating and classes are very personal. The food is top quality and is served as both a buffet or take-out. The dorms are 50-50 depending on the amount you spend, which at this time ranges anywhere between $2,800-+$5,000. The nicer, LLC, dorms provide a modern, homey, feel that is beyond spacious. The lower bracket of dorms, such as the common Maurelian Hall,  are in desperate need of renovations and fall into the small to average size for a college dorm. The return on investment is second to none and I encourage everyone interested in our school to research our graduate student statistics."
Sophomore,5,"I never wanted to go to a big school. I needed the personal relationships with my professor because of how I am as a student. Christian Brothers University gave me exactly what I needed. It was a great school as I have met many alum who loved it. The classes aren't too hard or too easy. The student body was always active- there is always something going on on campus (Events,parties,etc)."
College Freshman,5,The school cares greatly about the safety of the students and it is an environment where everyone feels safe.
College Freshman,5,There is not a day where I don't get emails about potential internships or externships. The teachers and advisors help connect students with jobs before they graduate and was a major reason why I went here
College Freshman,5,Classes are difficult but it is all completely manageable. Teachers are extremely helpful and the class size is small so there is a lot of attention on each student. Academically it is one of the best schools.
College Freshman,5,I currently don't stay on Campus but the dorms are nice and there are different options to choose from. You can get to class in five minutes from almost any dorm.
College Freshman,5,I'm currently in a fraternity and it was the best decision I made. I would recommend everyone to join a fraternity or sorority.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love the school.  It feels like a big family and the teachers are the best. The teachers all have office hours and are more than willing to help you with any problem and offer advice.
College Freshman,5,There's hardly ever any crime on CBU's campus. I love that. CBU sent out a crime report to students and it was relieving to see that the worst crime committed in the past years was theft.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love that professors are approachable. They are more than willing to explain topics further when someone doesn't understand. I love that the campus community is relatively small because that means everyone gets to know everyone else. The faculty and staff are always so friendly. Everyone on campus seems to love their jobs and all the students love being there.
College Sophomore,5,"CBU is everything I wanted (even if I didn't know it at the time) in a college. Small campus, friendly staff and faculty, challenging courses. The only thing I'd say is that the library needs some help, and there aren't enough places for commuters to hang out/study."
College Freshman,5,"Mulan, pretty much everything on poplar"
College Freshman,5,They're always around and really nice making them easy to approach.
College Freshman,5,They told me pretty quickly the one's i was eligible for. The application process was easy. They were available for questions at all times.
College Freshman,5,The school provides plenty of opportunities to excel socially and academically on campus. There are plenty of clubs and its very easy to create clubs as well.
College Freshman,5,The campus is extremely safe. You have trained officers patrolling at all hours and the campus safety office is easily accessible. You feel very comfortable talking with campus safety officers. There is little to no crime on campus.
College Freshman,5,Christian Brothers University has absolutely one of the best securities I've ever seen. They treat each student with dignity and respect and care for the safety of everyone. Every where you go your are bound to cross at least one security guard at anytime of the day. They are always ready to help and always watch out for their students.
College Freshman,5,I live off campus with my parents. It is the best thing i could think of doing. Most students live in the Christian Brothers University Campus and they love it. I have never heard anyone complain or say anything negative about it. But i am not a big fan of living away from home so i just commute.
College Sophomore,5,It has really changed my life.
College Sophomore,5,Really amazing. Teachers really know you.
College Junior,5,parking is great and it is easy to find somewhere to park.
College Junior,5,Business Accounting gives you the skills and prepare you for the work environment through class room training and internships with companies.
College Freshman,5,"For a Catholic school, it's very diverse with race and economic status. While more may lean towards well-off, many are working their way through college with working wages. This school has a sprouting Gay-Straight Alliance and sexual orientation isn't an issue at all on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. From my understanding, there has not been anything to worry about since I started attending CBU. There is a guard at every entrance of the school and there are security cameras everywhere. If you do not feel safe walking alone, you can call campus safety and they will escort you to where you want to go."
College Freshman,5,The school's sports teams get a lot of support from the other students. Many people always show up to the games. We have a lot of school spirit!
College Freshman,5,"I have not had an internship, but I do plan on getting one. I do not have any concerns about getting an internship because my teachers have taught me how to look for one and how to apply. Right now, I am assisting my advisor with a research study she is conducting."
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy being in my program at school very much. The teachers are nice and are more than willing to help you. They may give a lot of work, but it is nothing that is impossible to do with time and effort. The teachers always email students different internship opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"All of my teachers are awesome! They are always willing to help you with any problems you may be having. It is a lot of work, but it is nothing that cannot be done with much needed time and effort. The faculty is always sending internship opportunities through email at least twice a week."
College Freshman,5,"The teachers are great. They are willing to work one on one with you if you need them to. The teacher to student ratio is 1:13. Also, the school has tutor centers for math, writing, and science so that help everyone a lot. There is a lot of work, but it is nothing that cannot be done. Many people study outside when the weather is nice, the library or one of the eating facilities."
College Freshman,5,"The school is very expensive to attend. I have received some financial aid, but it is not enough. It is just my first year in college and I am already over nine thousand dollars in debt. I really love the school , but if this continues I will have to transfer."
College Sophomore,5,"There are alot of good restaurants on Madison Ave and the general Mid town area, which is not very far from school.  I'm not aware of student discounts though."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are very nice and helpful.  They will help you out if you are struggling.

I noticed the the most popular majors here are Biology, Psychology, and Engineering.

As far as the registration process, it's been fairly easy for me.  Classes don't fill up as quickly because the school is small. But when I come across full classes, I contact the professor and they let me in."
Junior,4,I like it. The classes are small enough to have a more direct relationship with professors. Campus life is okay.
Junior,4,I took some online classes and they were stimulating and demanding. This was during the pandemic so there was a lot of variety of online classes.
Alum,4,"My experience at CBU was a great one. For a college that's not as large as the University of Memphis that's down the street, what one gets in the lack of a plethora of students is a close-knit campus. I cannot explain how I met some of the friends I've made, whether it was in a shared class or just by being in the same corner of the library for years. The professors are indeed hard on us, but what students get out of it is a invaluable education. In response to the current pandemic, CBU adjusted tremendously as best as they could. So while there were some hiccups along the way, I would never trade the past four years at CBU for another college. I'm happy to be a Buccaneer forever."
Freshman,4,I like how diverse the student body is and how everyone is able to find a way to fit in with the university.
Sophomore,4,What I like about Christian Brothers is that you get to know the teachers and they have a lot of programs that are helpful to students. They make it feel like a home away from home.
Sophomore,4,"Despite being a small college, it does not shy away from making the most out of it. All professors want to help you and want to see you succeed, but they make it clear that it's your job to make the grades. On the downside, the food is not great at all."
Sophomore,4,"Christians Brothers University is truly an amazing place. The University is educationally stimulating in regards to the obvious sense as well as assisting students to make connections to be more successful in the careers of their choosing. The professors are experienced in the majors and apply the material in a way no textbook can; not to mention the overall involvement said professors have is immaculate. However, the university should consider acknowledging some of the concerns of the students including but not limited to the conditions of the dorms, campus security, equal benefits for on-campus and commuters as well as student life."
Junior,4,"The university have some pretty good programs, especially for engineering. Also, it is a small campus which is a positive for some and a negative for others."
Niche User,4,I would say Christian Brothers is a great private liberal arts school in Memphis. My favorite thing about this school is good the professors are here. I feel like they know exactly what they are talking about and are decent at teaching that material.
Sophomore,4,What I like most about Christian Brothers University is the small campus size. It is easy to establish connections and friendships with other students and it is easy to get to know your professors. What I would like to see change is the quality of the food here and I would love to see more minorities on campus.
Sophomore,4,The campus is small which makes everyone closer. The only thing I have a problem with is the parking lot is too small for all the students.
Sophomore,4,I went to Christian Brothers University on a cross country scholarship. My mom went here when she was my age and the school has not changed! The university offers a bunch of actives at the start of the year and they die down toward the end. I wish to see Christian Brothers help the residential and commuter students come together more often.
Sophomore,4,An excellent university where the small community allows you to create valuable connections and relationships with others
Freshman,4,"Christian Brothers is a very good university. When I first came here I was so nervous, but the teachers and students here are so nice and welcoming they made me feel apart of the campus as if I had been here for years. The campus is not that big, so it is easy to learn your way around. The only thing I would change about the school is the cost."
Junior,4,"Lacks social interaction. Dorms are below average. Food is lacking. Faculty are good, classes are good. Class sizes are smaller than high school class sizes."
Senior,4,"Christian Brothers University is a great college! All the professors are very helpful, and one great thing about them is that you can always go to them for any question you might have. They are very helpful and supportive. Overall, I really like the campus, it's safe and provides a great academic program. Most importantly I really like the career counseling team at CBU because they make sure that you have selected the right career for yourself, and provide the right guidance that will help you in the future. I would definitely recommend someone who is looking forward to applying to a four year college."
Senior,4,"I love the small class sizes! The campus is growing and offers many fun activities for its students. The courses are difficult, however direct communication with the teachers is a major plus."
Senior,4,"Everyone in this campus is very knowledgeable in their area of expertise. In case they do not have an answer however, they often have suggestions and references to someone who does."
Freshman,4,"Even though I am just a freshman, the first year experience CBU offers is awesome! The student life staff work really hard to make sure there is something for everyone to do. The teachers really care about their students' success, and sometimes even offer extra credit to the whole class. The dorms are very nice and make me feel at home. Definitely happy with my choice!"
Freshman,4,"Christian Brothers Uni. has a homey feel to it. They take you in as a family member your first week. They won't hold your hand, but you can always find the right help on campus when you need it. It is small enough that you can get to anywhere on campus in about 5 minutes on foot. It is small enough you won't be just one of the numbers."
Freshman,4,"Christian Brothers University is a very accepting college.With its warm and friendly environment,newcomers can feel welcome and comfortable.The orientation program is top-notch and helps you make new friends and become familiar with the campus.The professors genuinely care about the students and education,and the campus security is friendly to everyone.Also,there is an abundant amount of student-led clubs that grows each year that correlates to the many different interest of the students.Overall,I love this school and I believe that it is a perfect fit for me.I'm very excited to see what new adventures await me in the following years."
Alum,4,"I had a great experience during my time here. There are definitely some dorms that need major updating and renovations. Overall, the campus is great! I always felt very safe and at home here. The food could definitely be improved...I got food poisoning at least once a year."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I love CBU and in the past year it has truly become my home away home! A few of my favorite things about CBU are that there no shortage of things to do on campus, I always feel safe there, and the professors really care about the students.  One thing I would like to see change is the relationship between commuters and the school. I am not a commuter myself but I have a lot of friends who are. A lot of events happen later in the evening or during week days, making it hard for commuters to get involved on campus. If we could change the commuter experience in anyway, I'm sure there would be an immediate increase in Buc pride on campus."
Junior,4,"Great student to faculty ratio so classes are small and engaging. Overall the professors are great and seem to really car about their students and their education. My only complaint is that with CBU being a small school, the sports here aren't very big."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at CBU has been very exciting. I really enjoy the small class sizes and my ability to get to know my professors. The school's small size also makes it easy to find and make friends. This makes group studying very common here, which is great. I would like to see the university increase its school spirit with more events and extracurricular activities."
Niche User,4,"Christian Brothers University is a small, but friendly, private college located in the heart of Memphis, TN. The professors there are wonderful to work with and have earned the best education."
Freshman,4,I visit CBU on a college campus tour and the environment seem safe to me. The classes as I was told are small and the professors will work with you. Going to a college where everyone believes in one another is a place I would love to attend. Also with my career major (CyberSecurity/Digital Forensics) I think CBU you give me other opportunities to help push me to the next level.   
College Junior,4,I am happy I was led to this school. Every time I feel like I have an obstacle they make sure I am helped. The school I came from I was not use to this. Thank You CBU for all that you do.
College Junior,4,I'd give it a 7 out of 10
College Junior,4,They try pretty hard in career services to help us out. Much appreciated
College Junior,4,We have a fairly secure campus but it is in Memphis so
College Junior,4,"Christian Brothers University is such a great school if you are looking for a small community where everyone knows your name! If you apply yourself in classes and extracurricular activities and make friends, then you'll find a great home at CBU."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is small so it is not a wide area that has to be secured. I feel that the campus has a good security and staff that allows the students to have a good environment that is free of sexual assault and violence. I know that a completely safe school is about impossible but it mostly great at prevention of altercations or incidents at CBU.
College Sophomore,4,"Students are very passionate about their learning on the campus. We are all in a melting pot trying to figure out the career we would like to have after graduating. The curriculum and the challenges does discourage students alike, but it doesn't take away from the main goal that is a  consensus across the student population in obtaining a degree to start our lives."
College Sophomore,4,"As an engineering major, this school is very good for getting a job after college. I have already received an internship."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are hard, but the professors are usually very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,You can be a lot more involved and get to classes easier.
College Sophomore,4,I like CBU for its location and engineering community.
Recent Alumnus,4,The counselors were very good in helping with application process and the choosing of classes
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've only attended the basketball, so this is the only event I can review. Student attendance is great, and there is a TON of school spirit at the games."
College Sophomore,4,Seems to be pretty on top of things
College Sophomore,4,Almost all profs. are amazing! Almost!
College Sophomore,4,I really love CBU! Great campus and great people!
College Freshman,4,"I have been at CBU going on 2 years and I never heard about any criminal acts, at least not yet."
College Freshman,4,Unfortunately I don't live on the campus.
College Freshman,4,"I had some struggles my first year of college but everyone I spoke to encouraged me to not give up or give in, some even shared their struggles to me as well. If I had to start all over again I would choose CBU again because this school represents the best for your best."
College Freshman,4,"Students are always representing CBU and they do it well. What I love about CBU is the school spirit, the fan support, the respect everyone has during game time or any other time. From the administration to the employees, back to the students at CBU, we illustrate one big happy family and we know how to support one another."
College Freshman,4,I haven't had as much experience with the career center as i'd like. I know a few people who got great internship opportunities through the career center and I look forward to meeting with them after break ends.
College Freshman,4,"All of my professors seemed really engaged with me and other students, except for one. I talked to my academic advisor about the challenges I was having with my English professor. She suggested that when surveys came out, that I fill it out and be as honest as I was to her. I did so and I feel better now that the class is over."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life doesn't really fit my personality, but i'm still able to appreciate it. My friends who are in fraternities and sororities all love it. It makes me happy seeing them happy because they're able to get involved in something they like. Greek life allows students to connect to and shape the community in a healthy way."
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I don't get involved with sports. However, my friends that do tell me that they enjoy what CBU has to offer. I walk past the fields almost every day and they always seem to be in pristine condition. Games always have a great crowd and there's even options for non-athletes to still enjoy playing."
College Junior,4,Parties are ok. The best parties are toga and foam party.
College Junior,4,The professors care about you learning to think critically more than just repeat the material. Theyre always there to answer questions via email.
College Junior,4,Campus safety is always available to give you a lift to your dorm if its late at night. There are numerous safe zones on campus in different offices and buildings with staff that have been trained to deal with sexual assualt.
College Junior,4,The career center is very helpful with constructing and editing resumes as well as placing internships.
College Junior,4,"I love CBU. I cant see myself at any other school. The teachers really care about you in all aspects, not just how youre doing in their class. I have really enjoyed my time here. The main bad thing is tgey raise tuition and fees every year but dont raise the scholarships accordingly."
College Junior,4,I feel in love with the campus on my first visit. The students teachers and administrative people are very nice and helpful. CBU has a long way to go as far as making the campus more commuter friendly and technologically friendly but the people are the heart and soul of CBU. They say college is what you make it and thats so true at CBU.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school! The professors and staff are friendly and the grounds, though small, are well designed and are beautiful during the spring and fall. The food is pretty good as well. My only complaint would be that I feel the tuition is a little high, but it's a great school, so I suppose it is well worth the cost."
College Freshman,4,"I been over to CBU many times while in high school and the campus was great. The engineering courses they offered was what caught my interest in the first place. Plus, the people over there were friendly."
College Junior,4,"I think my school is great but of course everything needs a little work. The school is actually the best in academics, but we could work on joining everyone together for a more ""family"" feel, that I had in high school."
Freshman,2,"If you are considering coming to CBU as an upcoming freshman, do not waste your time or money!! 
This school is completely awful and not worthy of its reputation. The freshman dorms are dirty and old. With so many issues with leaking and mold in Maurelian, it needs to be torn down completely. Maurelian has actually run out of hot water a number of times just this year.
The food in Alfonso dining hall is terrible. It's bland, soupy, and undercooked. The fruit that they have out is usually never fresh. They're old, bruised, and brown. Unless you want to pay out of pocket for Bucc dollars, you're stuck eating in Alfonso. 
The staff is lazy and have some of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered: The financial aid office, the kitchen staff, and Student Life. They do an awful job at handling certain situations and it is obvious that they just work here for a check by their dismissive attitudes."
Sophomore,2,"While the small class sizes and friendly staff were great, my experience with the School of Business has been very disappointing. The unprofessionalism amongst faculty members and ignorance were distracting and un-motivating. Halfway through the semester, I debated on whether or not I should go to class because of all my class cancellations. In one semester for a single class, I had at least 10 classes that were cancelled or our professor simply did not show up. 
The lag and untimeliness of communication from administration and Business Office and Registrar made financial payments and organization extremely difficult to keep up with. I was charged twice, with a late fee and penalty because of miscommunication from workers in the Business Office. 
Ultimately, my personal experience has been very poor here at CBU, and because of the reasons above and the lack of academic rigor offered here, I decided to transfer to a better fit university where I will hopefully be more challenged."
College Junior,2,"Unless you want to pay your life's savings, your dorm will be very terrible"
College Junior,2,"CBU isn't an athletic school. We support our friends however we can, but going to all the games isn't normal unless you're super close friends with the athletes."
College Sophomore,2,There is only get togethers and Greek functions and if you are not part of the Greek life there is not much to do and the parties are not in abundance.
College Sophomore,2,There really sis not any kind of night life at the school.
College Sophomore,2,"You will be accepted, but the school scene is very clicky and form groups based off backgrounds and status. Many come from the same background and school so if you don't already know a person or group you won't really be involved with the people."
College Freshman,2,"The hours are horrible, the caf doesn't open very early and it closes too soon. The weekend hours are worse, it opens for brunch when people are going to work and closes right when they get back, so the students who work on weekends can't eat on campus. The menu isn't bad, its somewhat predictable. I think that we should be able to choose our meal plan and opt to not have one at all."
College Sophomore,2,Don't do anything about complaints
College Sophomore,2,"Though we have some really good teams, not a lot of people come to the games.  This is largly due to it being a commuter college"
College Freshman,2,"Residence halls have issues with switching from heating to cooling and with Memphis weather changing so often, we find ourselves suffering at at weather's mercy."
College Freshman,2,"The food is not very healthy, but since I live and campus and do not have any money to eat out, I am forced to eat the food in the cafeteria. If you eat at the other eating establishments on campus it can get expensive."
College Sophomore,2,They promised me money for achieving high grades. After my freshman year with a 4.0 Nothing! After my sophomore year finishing with a 3.87 Still nothing. halfway done with junior year have a 3.82 still no additional scholarship still waiting.
College Freshman,2,There's my many fun things for me to do on campus 
College Sophomore,2,At our school we personally don't throw many parties but because we are a Memphis school there is a lot to do around the city plus we are very close to at least three other large schools who always invite us to there events.
College Freshman,2,The on campus housing although more expensive is much better.
Recent Alumnus,2,Memphis weather never knows what it wants to do lol
College Junior,2,"There Is Not Too Much Night Life – Since CBU is so small, there are not many parties."
College Junior,2,Greek or Nothing – The greeks are nice but sometimes they seem selective about who they associate themselves with.
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria has REALLY good breakfast but that is about it.  The first few weeks the food is really good because they want you to keep your meal plan. but after that it is the same thing every day.  Also if you do not come at the right time for dinner, you could be getting cold food.  Also if you are on a sports team, the cafe closes so early, that you don't have time after practice to eat there."
College Freshman,1,The weather is the worst. On Monday it can be seventy-five degrees and on Tuesday it can be thirty-five degrees. This is totally ridiculous. I always have a cold because of the changing weather patterns.
College Sophomore,1,The food is pretty bland in the cafe and usually the same things but their fried chicken and mashed potatoes are amazing. The Buc Grille has really good food though.
College Freshman,1,The sororities and fraternities have parties and events that are exclusive for the most part.
College Junior,1,"The residential students can only park in the lots near the dorms and apartment.  The commuters are required to only park in the visitors lot which is all the way on the other side of the campus.  Also, all students are required to have a parking pass."
College Sophomore,1,"Unneccesary Roughness – Campus security at CBU is extremely strict especially on the minorities.  For instance, they will always chack for IDs even though they absolutely know that we attend CBU and they are also very strict about vistors being out of the dorms at curfew time and even way before curfew time."

Niche User,5,Judson college makes you feel at home. All the ladies make you feel special. Great equine department and much more. I can not wait to become apart of the Judson family.
Sophomore,5,"Judson is a smaller private college so you get more one on one time with your professors.  I like Judson because I am enrolled in the Equine Science field of study.  We have our own barn, horses and riding team.  I learn things daily with the hands on approach of learning.  Another great thing about Judson is with us being a smaller campus we all have a close nit bond.  We are all Christian women looking to better ourselves and our community.  If you decide to join us you won't be disappointed."

College Sophomore,5,No one does drugs that I know of.
College Freshman,5,"Admin is great! Almost everyone takes honor code seriously, and those who don't usually leave. Lack of alcohol and drug use is AWESOME. Being a women's college, the students are very serious about academics and usually don't mess around with stupid stuff."

College Freshman,5,The security personnel are very nice and easy to find. They are always there to help in a situation or to just escort students if desired.

Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19, some of the classes I took were online. For the most part, the online classes were good but due to short preparation time, teachers were not prepared."
Senior,4,"Judson College is an awesome school but has some things to improve on. The student body is small which allows for students and teachers to build relationships and for students to have individual help when needed. On the latter side, Judson needs to work on becoming more modern and being racially inclusive."
Junior,4,"Judson College is a very small campus. It is in a very small town, but Judson always has plenty for students to do to have fun."
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at Judson College. Overall I rate the institution 4 stars. In the past years, I have experienced my ups and downs just as any college student has. My upsides include the people I have met and the heartwarming impact through my involvement within the Marion community. This year Judson College hired a new Chemistry professor in which I was the only person in many of his courses. The new professor proceeded to call me names and make me cry every day. As the college failed to take action until it was too late, I have resulted in changing my major in order to graduate on time. Being treated this way from a college that I have grown to love over the years is truly devastating and I am seeking further help to allow me to further my passion for chemistry as well as criminal justice studies.  Overall, I would like to see Judson College care more for the impoverish community around it and also hold true to the ""Christian"" atmosphere that is promised in the brochure."
Freshman,4,Judson College is where women from all walks of life come to learn and grow in the name of the Lord. A place that feels like a little piece of heaven.
College Junior,4,I am a strong believer in involvement in school.  I have experienced great opportunities and areas to submit and commit my interests and desirable experiences in my education.
College Junior,4,"Athletics is a great part of the school's development and association.  However, it is not the basis of everything that yields success for all students."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are really great and will help you learn.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing. There are a handful that don't make sense to me or are ""easy,"" but for the most part, the professors are helpful and knowledgeable."
College Junior,4,"At my school, everyone is a big family. Everyone is there for each other, and all of the teachers make sure we succeed. They take the time to make sure we understand all of the material."
College Freshman,4,"The food is really good, the staff are friendly, and the chefs are great. Food's not so good on the weekends, but they work with you when you ask for specific things or food you miss from home."
College Freshman,4,"The RA's and RD's are the best! You can go to them for anything, and they care about you and look after you when you're sick. The dorms are a bit on the older side, especially the Jr/Soph dorm, but they are well taken care of."
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers are about the only good thing about Judson. Not all, but almost every singly teacher cares about you personally and will work with you to do good."
College Freshman,4,Judson does a great job of helping you find oppertunities on and off of campus
College Freshman,4,"The area around Judson doesn't look very safe, but on campus you are very safe. We have a great security team"
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of rules in place but they are all very reasonable and help to maintain Judson's good reputation
College Freshman,4,There is always something to do if you are looking. The only problem is that some things are mandatory even if the timing is bad(semi-finals week on occasion)
College Freshman,4,The rooms are mostly spacious except for a few small rooms in one dorm building.
College Freshman,4,As long as you fit the gender criteria of the school (it is an all female college) and have a strong GPA the application process is painless.
College Sophomore,4,"We have four computer labs with at least 15 computers in each. They are very useful. When you arrive at Judson College, you are given 100 free copies. I believe this is very generous."
Niche User,2,Overall lifetime friends were made. BUT this school was honestly the worst decision I made. This school has a strict dress code. It is in the middle of no where so there is no where to go. If you’re gay don’t plan on going there. So much negativity around there. The academics aren’t the worst. They actually are very helpful. There is a writing center and the library stuff is VERY helpful. They do have some of the best cooking in the area since it’s the only place to eat.
College Freshman,2,The only option is the cafiteria and the food there is rarely good quality.
College Sophomore,2,"Besides the teachers being so helpful, everything else about Judson is not good."
College Sophomore,2,Very few days is the food actually good.
College Sophomore,2,"You have to constantly check up on it. It was almost November before I saw any of my money, and they held the other half over my head for next semester."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much around town.
College Junior,2,"Non-Greek College – Judson College does not have Greek life really, but we still have plenty sisterhood."
College Freshman,2,"Need Different Food – The food in the dining halls is good in the beginning but they serve the same food, and you just get so tired of it. when you get hungry in between classes, you can not really go there because they have their food set out at a certain time. So you have to wait to eat. the best thing to do is bring lots of snacks and take them to class wiht you."
College Freshman,2,The weather around Judson is horrible. There is always tornado warnings and it constantly rains.
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere around Judson is extremely small. However, it is easy to drive to the surrounding towns."
College Sophomore,2,All About the Bubble – Judson is away from most everything. It is best to have a vehicle of your own. There are few places to eat and 2 grocery stores.
College Sophomore,2,Paying for Access and Copies – Judson College requires you to pay an access few to use the wireless system but tends not to work right half the time. Also everyone is required to pay for each print out or copy they make which makes expenses for the school even more challenging.
College Freshman,2,"White College, Black Community – Judson College is located in the middle of a predominantly black community.  Since Judson is a private, baptist school for women, the community gets the impression that a bunch of rich white girls attend here, when in truth most of us are here on some type of scholarship. The people in the community are very nice and accept us in their daily lives with church functions and the small stores around town, but others give off the vibe that they would rather us stay out of their quaint town."
Freshman,1,"Judson has very good one on one academic classes. On the other hand judson has a lot of odd things going on. The tradition are fun to be apart of. Judson is an all girls school, so most of the girls there like girls. I did not know this before going there. This is the bad thing about Judson. Over half of the people there like each other and you just feel weird and out of place."
Junior,1,"I transferred to Judson after earning 2 college degrees with high honors and multiple academic awards. I appreciated their self paced music online degree. But since I started their program it has been one nightmare after another. First they made promises about transfer credits and classes. Then after paying $5,000, they would not fulfill either commitment. I fought with staff after staff until finally it got to the Dean and we came to an ""agreement"" where they only kept one of the promises and justified the others. Also, despite being accepted in July, it took until January to get enrolled and their excuse was ""this is the south, we just do things slow here."" Since these problems, I have insisted that everything be put in writing and signed by the dean. Currently, I have been trying to reach the dean for 3 weeks regarding another promise. Emails and voicemails are rarely returned, and if you get a hold of anyone via phone it takes a dozen calls thereafter to get anything resolved."
College Freshman,1,Students have to live on campus unless they commute from their parents' or spouse's house.
College Freshman,1,"The only parties that ever happen are thrown by Marion Military down the street. They have bonfires about every three months. They usually suck. University of Alabama is about an hour drive, so if you must attend Judson and party, drive there."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't any off-campus housing, unless you live close by to begin with."
College Freshman,1,"This is not the place if you want to spend your freetime blackout drunk or high. Here at Judson, we are serious about our academics. There are no parties, and we love Judson for it!"
College Sophomore,1,The school is run down and needs a lot of improvement
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene.
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely nothing to do in Marion. You have to drive at least a half an hour to find the nearest city to do something in.
College Sophomore,1,There are only like three places in the whole city to get good food off campus
College Sophomore,1,"Especially as a freshman, you are treated like you are still a child. Strict curfew as freshmen. Also, absolute ZERO tolerance for drug, alcohol, and tobacco use."
College Freshman,1,"There aren't really any party scenes around. I'm sure you could find them if you searched, but Judson is not really a party place"
College Freshman,1,Bars and clubs are off limits to students.
College Junior,1,Nothing to do unless you travel an hour away.
College Sophomore,1,"What Buses? Here in Marion, Alabama public transportation is not a choice. Carpooling with a friend from here to there is the only option close to public transportation."
College Sophomore,1,We Don't Have Them! Judson College makes it mandatory for all students to live on campus unless they live with a parent or is married. This leads to expensive room and board for those students living on campus.
College Freshman,1,"At Judson we have an Honor Coucil, or what other girl's refer to as Judson Hell. We have an image to uphold being a Judson girl, therefore if you break it then the consquences can be quite serve. I wouldn't know though, I have yet to go before them."

Sophomore,5,It didn't start off too well but it has gotten better over time. The professors and the university as a whole is working hard to make it similar to in person lessons.
Sophomore,5,It is amazing and lots of fun. The school has great resources and wants to see you succeed. The professors are great as well
Freshman,5,"All of my classes I am taking are fully remote. Some of the classes I take are meet three times a week, but some of my professors make one class live on zoom, and the others asynchronous which I like and it gives us the opportunity to learn at our own pace and rewatch videos until we understand the concept."
Alum,5,"I took one online class in the summer, it was Calculus. Really easy interface, Blackboard, professor was great at providing a lot of resources."
Sophomore,5,I took full remote classes. All of my professor either had asynchronous or synchronous remote classes. There would be zoom meetings or recorded video lectures.
Freshman,5,They are handling online teaching very well and are not faced by what is happening right now. Academics are proceeding as normal and there have been no issues with their online learning
Sophomore,5,My professors were very on top of their stuff when it came to online learning. It was a very smooth transition that left me with no complaints.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the structure of the program and coursework! It’s so straightforward and no ambiguous information, they make the expectations really clear and have such a good layout to help you succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"I love how much student support they offer. There are people assigned to help you every step of the way whether it’s applying, registering, etc."
Junior,5,I love Fordham University. I believe that the experience and education that you receive at Fordham are unmatched by other colleges or universities. Choosing to attend Fordham has been one of the greatest decisions of my life!
Junior,5,Fordham University and its professors did a great job transitioning to online classes and education amidst COVID19.
Niche User,5,"Fordham has been so accommodating and I don't believe I could ask for a better school. They have a community within their student body and it is full of intelligent, vibrant people who are there because they recognize that Fordham is a school which values a community and the individuals within it."
Graduate Student,5,I took all of my classes online. The school partnered me with field experience in my area which allowed me the opportunity to gain hands on knowledge of the program. The classes are intense if you go the acceleration route like I did but it is well worth the time. You graduate much sooner than the traditional path and you really gain a lot of experience not only through the online classes but through the field experience.
Graduate Student,5,Fordham is a great school to attend. They really go above and beyond for their students and only accept those who really show commitment and motivation in their educational goals. The MSW program really prepares you to become a licensed clinician in the field. The school is well worth the price and the commitment they show towards their students.
Sophomore,5,"The best part about Fordham University is the community and environment. Fordham has an attitude of acceptance and is a close-knit community that I really enjoy being a part of. I met friends at Fordham quickly, and really like how comfortable I have become with them. I am excited for my next three years at Fordham, where I will meet many more friends like those I have at this point. The environment is another huge selling point for Fordham. The close proximity to New York City (20 minute train ride to Manhattan) provides plenty of opportunities to explore the city with friends. A big concern at Fordham (especially for parents) is safety. Fordham takes safety very seriously, and provides a comfortable environment for all of its students. I have never felt unsafe at Fordham. Fordham University is a great community, with a beautiful campus and an awesome environment surrounding the school in NYC. I highly recommend applying and visiting to get a taste of it for yourself!"
Freshman,5,"I have had great professors who care about me as a student.  I am aa commuter which is more challenging because it is harder to meet people, but my mentors for undergraduate freshman and pre-law are very helpful."
Freshman,5,I really liked my experience at Fordham. Everyone is extremely welcoming and nice. They really want you to feel adjusted. The academics is challenging but professors are open to help and there are free resources available around campus.
Graduate Student,5,"Overall Fordham has been a great experience. Their EMBA program allows you to learn, not only from professors, but from your whole cohort."
Freshman,5,Fordham is a great University with and excellent business program. I had an amazing first year and can’t wait to go back.
Freshman,5,"I love Fordham with my whole heart. I got into schools much higher on this list and I do not regret my decision one bit! Best campus, best people, best restaurants, best location, I could go on. Just the best school."
Niche User,5,I had an excellent time at Fordham and loved living in New York City. The most amazing part of my time there was getting access to the amazing professors and internships in the city and through the career resources center.
Sophomore,5,"The school is very adaptive and supportive, they also really care. The professors are incredible, and are extremely knowledgeable."
Niche User,5,The community at fordham is unlike any other. The campus is stunning and the professors and students are incredible. It truly feels like home!
Freshman,5,Very close and connected campus. Excellent place to grow as a person and to make life long friends. Very small classes allow personal growth and academic ability to flourish. Professors will know your name and you will get to know your fellow classmates.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the tight knit community at Fordham University. The student body is welcoming and eager to help one another. The faculty is committed to you as a student and are extremely resourceful. The professors want you to do well and are available to help you both academically and for your future. I am glad I transferred to Fordham and know I will treasure my years here well beyond graduation.
Freshman,5,Located in an amazing area of Manhattan where NYC u us your campus! Small campus but this is perfect for me.
Sophomore,5,"Fordham is a wonderful school. I love how easy it is to get into the heart of the city, yet Rose Hill still maintains a campus feeling. I adore the community and finding people who challenge me to become a better person. Overall its a great school."
Freshman,5,"Honestly, I don't think that Fordham gets the appreciation it deserves. Academic wise Fordham is really strong. The professors, variety of classes, and the concentration options allow students to really explore what they are interested in. Student life-wise, I think that Fordham is as fun as you make it. There are a bunch of stuff to do around campus and tons of clubs but you have to make an effort. The only thing that you should be wary about in Fordham is the food. But we have great eating options off-campus so it's all good."
Junior,5,A great campus with great teachers! The business school offers a wide array of options in coursework. The campus is located close to Manhattan so Fordham Students can intern during the week which is greatly beneficial.
Freshman,5,"The faculty at Fordham try their hardest to ensure that any problems are addressed within the student body. Additionally, there is a community that allows for students who commute and students who are residents to all equally be involved within student life on campus. Overall, the environment there is super encouraging and is just a place you want to be at."
Junior,5,"Best overall NYC college experience. You are still able to get the campus atmosphere in the middle of the city. Great classes and professors, well-rounded education."
Senior,5,"I love studying at Fordham University because of all the connections I am able to have and make. Not only is the Lincoln Center campus located in the heart of Manhattan, it is also full of passionate professors and hard-working students that want to make a difference in the world. There are so many extracurricular clubs and events happening that you are never bored!"
Freshman,5,Great school great campus great experience! This school exceeds expectations. Opportunities are everywhere in nyc
Niche User,5,This school is amazing!  Fantastic location in the heart of New York City and offers the ability to intern for some top companies in NYC.  The dorms are beautiful and the cultural diversity at this school is incredible.  Perfect place to start your college experience!
Freshman,5,"Fordham University fosters diversity and innovation both within and outside of its community. They not only push their students to challenge themselves in the classroom, but also motivate them to bring this knowledge to use in the real world."
Alum,5,"rigorous, well-rounded education in the heart of nyc. wonderful professors who challenged me and prepared me well for the future. hard work, but totally worth it!"
Junior,5,"The price is just too much to bear. However, I've met the best people and have gained the most amazing experiences from Fordham University."
Alum,5,"I went to school at the Lincoln Center campus. Amazing community and many great resources for students and alumni. Academics were rigorous and enjoyable. The Lincoln Center campus does not have a traditional college feel like the Rose Hill campus, yet you are in the heart of Manhattan. Tons of opportunity and room to build a network. Highly recommend the school."
Niche User,5,"My daughter just completed her Sophomore year at the Rose Hill campus. She has had 2 amazing years, which have included challenging academics, great teachers, wonderful friends,a beautiful campus,  being fully involved in clubs and working on the newspaper, The Ram. It’s been Academically and socially rewarding and she’s looking forward to studying abroad for the first semester of her junior year."
Freshman,5,"easy enrollment process so far. Financial aid was very helpful and patient with me. I'm a first generation college student so there's a lot for me to learn. They helped me understand my finances, loans, how to pay them back, and all types of other things."
Freshman,5,I love the campus so much. I'm planning to attend the rose hill college in the fall. I can't wait! I know I'll love it there.
Freshman,5,"I love Fordham! The campus is beautiful and the people are so nice. The professeurs really care for students. The food is ok, not as terrible as people think it is."
Graduate Student,5,Fordham is a very great school. They have very intelligent teachers. Nothing I will like to change except cheaper tuition.
Freshman,5,"Fordham has a great campus, friendly staff, enthusiastic teachers, prime location, helpful administration and a positive environment and culture."
Graduate Student,5,I love the master program in Fordham. You get the support you need. The way the online is set up; it makes so much easier for the people that are full time workers and parents can still be flexible and happy about it.
Junior,5,The professors are very accessible and always relate real life examples to the topics we are studying. The food is also affordable at most of the places and it has such a diverse community!
Freshman,5,"Fordham's location in NYC makes my college experience really strand out, and it is preparing me well for a dynamic and exciting future, giving us access to career fairs, enjoyable and fair classes, and a welcoming faculty and student body!"
Alum,5,Fordham University is a decent school for some subjects and a great school for others. I went to school for Visual Arts and English.
Freshman,5,Good school. Provides students with a welcoming learning environment! I am very satisfied with my experience at Fordham University.
Sophomore,5,"It is a great school with rigorous academics. The science department is not the best, and the food is not great but the overall experience is amazing."
Freshman,5,"Excellent communication and recruiting process. Starts with an informative on campus tour, welcome speeches and information sessions"
Sophomore,5,"I am an undergrad in the Gabelli School of business, and I have become increasingly impressed with the school the longer I have been around. In my sophomore year, I participated in an internship at a large bank in the city during my days off from class. At no other school will you have the tremendous opportunity to do this. Sports are not relevant on campus but club teams are inclusive and competitive. I have found them to be a great way to stay active and make friends."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about Fordham University. It has the perfect campus. It is very green and nature is all around you, yet New York City is only a train ride away! The students, professors, and administration are all wonderful people."
Niche User,5,It is  a nice school. I like the majors . The area is great. It gives great opportunity's for freshmen and transfer students
Graduate Student,5,"I attend Fordham University online in pursuit of my Masters in Social Work degree. The online community is very supportive and the professors are professional and hold a lot of knowledge. I like that the on campus program curriculum is the same as the online one so I don't feel like I am missing out, and many of the professors are from on campus classes as well. I thought I would feel lost in obtaining an online degree but Fordham makes it easier!"
Sophomore,5,"the campus is gorgeous and the academics, particularly in the honors program, are fantastic. diversity is good and there are plenty of opportunities for students. there are lots of music programs for student musicians and there are events nearly every day, many of which include free food! It is a good choice for students who want the New York City vibe while still being able to escape the noise and relax on a beautiful campus."
Junior,5,"Fordham is an amazing school with great professors.  Each campus is in a great area close to food, transportation and activities.  Fordham also has many sports events that you can attend to cheer your fellow students on."
Junior,5,"Fordham is an academically challenging University with a strong alumni base. The Bronx campus receives more attention and has the best campus scene if one is looking for the true college experience. However, the Lincoln center campus is right in the middle of the city and as they like to say over there ""Fordham is my school, New York is my campus."" This statement could not be more accurate as most of your time outside of the school will be spent exploring the amazing city."
Graduate Student,5,"When I went back to graduate school for Social Work, several people recommended Fordham to me - I am very grateful they did.  The Graduate School of Social Service has a focus on Social Justice that I have not seen from any other program.  The faculty is extremely positive and helpful and my learning experience at Fordham-Lincoln Center has been incredibly rewarding.  I have learned more than I could have previously imagined in the past two years about public policy, the socio-economic factors that shape our society, injustices that our clients may (and often do) suffer from, and to simply have compassion and empathy for our clients as we work with them to improve their lives.  I had thought I was aware and well-informed about the factors that shape our society but my professors at Fordham have shown how (and where) to look deeper, to see more, and to advocate for positive change in our society for those who cannot speak for themselves."
Sophomore,5,"I loved the professors, mainly because it is such a small school you really get a one on one with some of them and they are really willing to help you with whatever you need"
Alum,4,"One of the best things about attending Fordham is the beauty of the campus. Although its too cold to do so for much of the fall and spring semesters, nothing feels better than stretching out under the sun on Eddie's. Another major benefit is the resources available to student's and alumni. For example,  career services helped me structure my resume in a way that made it more appealing to employers. In my experience with the psychology department, 90% of professors and graduate student lecturers were amazing. The biggest downside in my opinion is the amount of students who don't understand their privilege....."
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student in social work, being an online student has been a great experience. I have been able to build relationships with fellow students and professors even though it is online. The 2For platform has been great and IT was very helpful as was as disability services. I know I am a graduate student, I only wish there was a one week break in between semesters or ""sessions."" I say this because as soon as you finish one class, you need to study for your next class the following week."
Graduate Student,4,"Fordham University has been very help with applying, when getting in having a student advisor has been very helpful. The professors, some are better than others in that they make themselves more available to for their students. I am very happy at Fordham."
Freshman,4,"During coronavirus, I did not mind that much that I am learning online. There are still times were workload especially during midterms and finals can be tough to handle, but overall I think it is fine. The professors are really understanding and sometimes extend deadlines if need be. Especially during online learning, I understand more how important time management is especially in college."
Freshman,4,"Overall I think that Fordham is an amazing school that gives students a lot of opportunity to pursue their passions. The staff and the professors are always willing to help you become the best writer, speaker, advisor, you can be. The campus is also very clean and beautiful. The city lights when you are in the dorms is amazing. The only reason that I give Fordham 4 star is because their food isn't that great, the Fordham Ram Dining. To me it doesn't really matter because we are in NYC and there is a lot of good food places nearby but I wished they would get more professional chefs for the amount we pay for our meal plans. Academics, campus, athletics, professors, student life, dorm/housing are all solid. Safety is key in NY so they take it very seriously. Even though coronavirus has changed some things such as testing and quarantine, they have done a good job in keeping it down.  Party scene depends on which campus, we are in NY so clubs are everywhere around us."
Freshman,4,"As a student who just started attending Fordham University, the transition to such an elite education is something unimaginable. The amount of new things I've learned within my one semester is indescribable. Even though I am not on campus and am learning fully remote, I still feel I am receiving a great education and can't wait to continue my remaining 3 and a half years here."
Junior,4,"The teachers in this school really care. The Lincoln Center campus staff is very dedicated to anti-racist ideologies. The academics are excellent however, it is so so so ungodly expensive and nearly impossible to pay for. They are not helpful with this, not with scholarships, not with financial aid, not with creative solutions. This university has happy and talented teachers and staff, but it is hard to afford unless you're very wealthy."
Alum,4,"I went there from 2014 to 2019, and I was a Psychology major. 

Great people, great professors, beautiful campus. You will learn a lot and get a well-rounded education. The underclassman dorms suck but they get better for upperclassman. Food on campus is okay, but right off campus are a bunch of great places. Nightlife is decent, no frats but a few popular bars around campus, lots of house parties. Going out in Manhattan is also super fun but it's expensive so it's not an every weekend thing for most people. Really safe, don't be scared it's in the Bronx. It's right across from the Botanical Gardens and the Bronx Zoo. Lots of easy ways to get into the city, people go into Manhattan all the time. I'm taking one star off because it's way too expensive and the Core Curriculum is kinda extensive. Every university has its issues, but overall, it's a great school especially if you like small classes and critical thinking and will take advantage of the location."
Sophomore,4,I like the environment of the school such as the places around the campus and the professors mostly very nice. I wish there were more racial diversity at Fordham.
Freshman,4,They are handling online teaching very well and are not faced by what is happening right now. Academics are proceeding as normal and there have been no issues with their online learning
Junior,4,I like the campus vibe and the greenery. I would change how the school addresses its relationship with the Bronx community.
Alum,4,"Fordham University rescued the liberal arts college i attended. This acquisition brought a lot more advantages to my school in the form of access to technology i.e  new computer lab, greater internship oppurtunities with fortune 500 companies and access to their campus activities and student life."
Sophomore,4,"While I have had a good experience at Fordham so far, it still has its downsides, specifically in the areas of diversity, housing, and food. Another issue is the the outdated guest policy, which is meant to keep students of the opposite sex out of one's room, but many students still sneak people in."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my online classes were good, but obviously was not the same as taking classes in person. I also had some older professors that were not well equipped to handle the switch, resulting in little to no instruction."
Alum,4,"I had a positive experience at Fordham on a whole. I loved my interdisciplinary major, and I was grateful that I got to combine several interests I found in the core curriculum into one major. The opportunities for professional development are also a great advantage. Since the core curriculum is pretty substantial, I wish it had been more diverse (for example, instead of two Western philosophy classes, one Eastern & one Western). I do recognize that there are huge disparities in Fordham experiences, especially in the resident/commuter divide that is quite apparent on campus. There are also huge problems with many high-level administrators not listening to students, but a lot of the student body is taking a stand against the injustices on campus."
Alum,4,"The only online classes I took were due to the coronavirus, and I think Fordham did an adequate job adapting their courses accordingly. Discussion-based or seminar-style classes did not transition well."
Niche User,4,"I have friends attending universities all over the country, and none of their schools are as well prepared and planned as Fordham. Though, I don't believe any school's transition has been seamless theirs is as close as possible. Just look up their plan for the 20-12 school year, and you will understand what I'm talking about."
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience is not bad for Fordham. The professors are pretty lenient and understanding. Class time runs a bit longer but still engaging as ever. It feels like a semi-real class with all the work and time deadlines but, it's not so bad. Some professors take the time to video chat individually to catch you up and make sure you are doing okay."
Alum,4,"I had a very positive experience at Fordham. I was able to cultivate my worldview with the help of caring professors and inquisitive peers. Throughout my four years, I was able to experience both campus life and living and working in New York City. Fordham gave me the ability to explore my interests, while also expanding my academic horizons with its commitment to Liberal Arts education. I would recommend Fordham to anyone who is interested in social justice, business or the arts. All around a great school."
Alum,4,"I took three classes online during my final semester at Fordham due to the pandemic. One professor heald Zoom meetings, one professor sent the class video lectures, and one professor sent out assignments to be completed in lieu of class. I received As in all three classes and felt like I learned the material. The professors were understanding of the situation, but still expected students to put in the work."
Senior,4,I'd like to see the University justify the price of attendance as it seems unreasonably high for people who are paying full price. There is also unreasonable priority given to business school students.
Freshman,4,"My Fordham University has been very good so far. The staff are very supportive, any of the offices are ready to answer any questions you may have. Particularly, my financial aid package was very flexible, only with a call, gave me the tools I needed to request more aid, and in the end I was able to receive enough aid to attend the school. It is a very good school!"
Freshman,4,My online experience with has been pleasant. I have been able to complete all the necessary tasks that Fordham requires of me with little challenge. It has been a great experience thus far.
Junior,4,Professors were very understanding and made online learning not so complicated. They were available for online office hours and responded to emails fairly quickly.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience with Fordham was both good and bad. I am in the Lincoln Center campus so the school does not really feel like a college campus. While I am okay with that, I found that it was difficult to gain valuable resources most colleges have to offer. The class sizes are very small so you get to actually know your teachers which is nice. In terms of the student involvement, there are not that many clubs to join and I wish there was a bigger variety of classes. The best thing about Fordham I would say is its location, the proximity to an array of subway lines to Columbus Circle to Broadway theaters makes it a hotspot for a flourishing college student."
Sophomore,4,"Since this pandemic was so abrupt, I found that some of my teachers were not fully equipped for the switch to online. Since I went to an online high school, I could clearly see how Fordham was not fully prepared to be online. I felt that I did not learn as much as I did in class, and I wish we were given better resources to help with the gap you get from learning online."
Sophomore,4,"Throughout my life I have consistently challenged myself to explore different opportunities and to help better my community. The ideals I value most in life include accountability, honesty, integrity, passion, and fostering a strong community. It is these ideals that have shaped me into becoming the person I am today, and it is these ideals that I want to continue to foster. Fordham University gives me the opportunity to do just that. Not only does my school have a community of growth and diversity, the programs Fordham offers are some of the best in the country. I have also recognized that Fordham works diligently to help students find the right major, not just a major. To attend a university that emphasizes the diversity of thought and helps guide one to find the best major is critical. Perhaps the most wonderful quality that Fordham fosters is that it encourages students to be bold, to think outside of the box, and to escape one's comfort zone."
Sophomore,4,"The way Fordham University transitioned to online courses during the pandemic was smooth and convenient. Fordham professors use either blackboard ultra or zoom to communicate with their students during class time.  The online lectures were informative and in depth, and the professors always saved their lectures for students to view at a later time. In addition, all assignments were easily accessible."
Sophomore,4,"I took 4 out of my 5 classes online from March 11th until the end of the semester on May 11th. All of my classes met at the same time as they did when in person, and 3 of them were on zoom (one class used Blackboard Collaborate instead). One class did not meet online, and just had assignments emailed from the professor every day we had class. Putting aside the fact that I disliked learning online, I think Fordham did a good job handling the situation. Live classes allowed me to best focus and learn like I was studying in the classroom. I found it very difficult to study at home, but that was a result of the circumstances of COVID-19 and had nothing to do with Fordham in particular. If my classes did not meet live at their normal times, it would have been much more difficult to focus and retain the knowledge that needed to be learned. For this reason, I think Fordham handled online learning well despite the struggles and difficulties with the outside circumstances."
Sophomore,4,I have been challenged to learn and to succeed. The classes are very rigorous and the exams and work load is rigorous as well.
Sophomore,4,I took all of my classes online for the second semester due to Covid-19. The professors were quick to create an atmosphere in which we could learn and also speak up in case we had any issues. I was very happy with my online semester for the Spring.
Freshman,4,"I have had a mix of teachers doing in real-time learning, and others posting assignments for me to complete.  Most teachers answer emails quickly and have helped me with discussing the things I need to do to get an A."
Freshman,4,"At Fordham University, I feel very happy with my experience as a student who just completed their freshman year. The campus was beautiful, the student/faculty community was very welcoming, and the classes were engaging. I am seeing great benefits to being in close proximity to NYC, not only for entertainment but for job opportunities and internships in the future. I greatly appreciate the Jesuit values instilled, as they allow me to expand my thinking and understanding of others. I am looking forward to what my next three years at Fordham will offer!"
Freshman,4,"The professors all tried to make the online courses more interactive and mirror real face-to-face setting. However, one issue was with courses such as Calculus, where there are a lot of theoretical and proofs that might involve. In this case, it became more challenging because the professor couldn't really draw and can only reiterate previous notes, which can make it confusing."
Graduate Student,4,Professors worked hard to make the online experience as close to a classroom experience as they could.
Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year at Fordham University. I love how compact the campus is as the walk across campus was at most ten minutes. Food sucks, and there are limited options. Even though the dorms were sort of trash, I know that next year will be better."
Alum,4,Fordham University was a wonderful experience. I made life long friends. The educational experience provided opportunities that  I have taken into my career.
Freshman,4,"The location of the Lincoln Center campus is unbeatable. 
However, while off campus opportunities soar, those on campus seem limited due to the small number of attending students. 
If you want to be in the heart of New York City, then Fordham is definitely worth considering!"
Freshman,4,I love Fordham! Came here with some doubts but since I’ve been here it’s been amazing. Campus food is improving too!
Junior,4,"Fordham University offers many strong majors, and provides a core that is diverse and lets you expand your education. Sometimes I wish the classes were more rigorous, but there are good people and good communities, and once you find them you will be so happy there."
Freshman,4,"Overall a good experience. Food is a weak point. Area is safe, and the campus is an oasis from the busy city."
Sophomore,4,"The Rose Hill campus is very beautiful. You are never bored while at school because you can always take the metro north train right to grand central station in NYC. If you want to head to the city it is easily accessible. Joining sports and clubs helps you meet many people and usually, those will be the people you go out with on weekend nights. Classes are great, and normally nobody has class on Wednesdays, but if you do it will probably just be in the morning. Overall I met great people at Fordham. I liked the school a lot however they tend to focus mostly on the Business school kids."
Sophomore,4,"Its definitely a nice school. Its expensive, doesn't have great food, and the STEM department doesn't have as many connections as Gabelli (which has a lot and people in business are looking to hire Fordham students). The campus is gorgeous, professors are so kind and engaging, free tutoring is offered for gen. ed. science classes."
Sophomore,4,"Fordham University is an excellent college. The professors help you if you need help, and the campus is aesthetically pleasing. The Lincoln Center does lack in the number of clubs, but you can always find something to do in New York City."
Sophomore,4,"The going out life is limited because of no Greek Life, however, I feel like this is not as big of a deal as I thought it would be. The people are amazingly sweet, everybody is dedicated and smart."
Freshman,4,The school is attractive in appearance and very welcoming. The school offers a variety of clubs and courses. There is some lack of diversity.
Sophomore,4,"There are some negative aspects of Fordham, as with any college. The university provides sub-par food, which is improving. The administration that claims to be opening and accepting often takes the agendas of the donors over the needs of the students. The cost of tuition is insane and there's a large divide between commuter students and residential students. That being said, the school provides a diverse, fun social scene. The academics are really awesome and encourage free thought, critical thinking, and moral consciousness. The city life fused with the original college experience at the Rose Hill campus gives students a lot to do and provides a really different experience than most colleges that rely on dismal, superficial greek life. All and all, Fordham University (while expensive and very institutionalized) offers students a stellar Jesuit education and the excitement of life in New York City,"
Sophomore,4,"Fordham's (LINCOLN CENTER) academics and college life are much different than what I expected from a university, but I'm not at all upset about it. Everyone is willing to learn new things and discuss them with each other and professors are always there to lend a hand and work one on one with students on specific concepts. They kind of screw the freshmen over with housing because they make you spend an exorbitant amount of money to live in these dorms with a mandatory meal plan for a terrible dining program and then kick the students out of the dorms every break without giving them access to their things."
Freshman,4,"Fordham is a great school academically, and a great community. The access to the city provides access to jobs, internships, volunteer work, and any activity one could need to keep busy. The school is a business, however, and I had a negative personal experience involving administration. Other than that an excellent school overall, with a beautiful, safe, and fun campus."
Junior,4,"I like the curriculum at Fordham. It is challenging and I feel like I am getting a good education. The events and alumni at Fordham are helpful as well. However, I wish the film program was more established and the faculty was more helpful. I like all of my professors, but the faculty in the other departments such as the transfer department, dean's, student accounts, etc. are not helpful."
Niche User,4,"I got the chance to be in Fordham in Lincoln center. Overall, it was a great experience. The people there are nice and polite. It has an amazing library and theatre stage."
Freshman,4,"Fordham University is a very diverse campus with an even more diverse environment. Being in the city is extremely helpful to a college student, as it allows them to become more open minded and free. There is a very strong sense of community and over a hundred clubs for any interest a student may have. The professors are also very approachable and are happy to help you with and concerns that you may have. Although the safety of the college may create some concerns, there is a very competent group of people working to create a safe atmosphere for the students and every other person on campus."
Alum,4,"Great connections and opportunities for internships in NYC. Professors are ok. No help in finding employment after graduation, you have to do that on your own."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, and so far I am liking it. Professors are great, most of them are very much available outside of class and ready to help. The campus is small, but diverse, we have a lot of international students. Food could have been better, printing could have been free, and elevators could have been functioning at all times."
Freshman,4,"I liked how there were lots of different activities on campus and how involved students were. Faculty from Fordham are also very welcoming and willing to help you. I appreciate how the school pushes to make not only residents, but also commuting students feel welcomed and recognized."
Freshman,4,"Fordham continues to impress and surprise me. I am going into my second semester of freshmen year, and I already feel completely integrated in the Fordham community. My classes are insightful and engaging, my clubs are active and exciting, and the facilities are clean and up to date. I was especially impressed by the friendliness of the faculty and upperclassmen. They take a sincere interest in the wellbeing of the underclassmen and love to share their own advice and experiences. I love how accessible Manhattan is from the Bronx campus. The on-campus food and sports scene are not good. Despite this, I would recommend this school to potential applicants."
Junior,4,"Fordham is truly a ""what you make of it"" school. Do you want to be in the heart of the business and cultural center of the world with everything you could imagine at your fingertips? Study at the Lincoln Center campus. Do you want a traditional college feel with the ability to experience city life, perform internships, and network with professionals? Study at the Rose Hill campus. Grounded in Jesuit values with a strong alumni network, Fordham is a beloved university across the New York metro area."
Senior,4,"It was primarily good. I am a transfer student, but still felt welcomed and included. The staff cares and does try to make the student's college experience as great as it can be. The administration could bee more efficient however."
Sophomore,4,Professors are great and very helpful. The science department needs more professors and classes to provide different various classes at different times.
Senior,4,I like Fordhams campus and the environment. However there is no diversity and there isn’t any party scene at all. To Fordham safety is very important and takes that matter very seriously.
Sophomore,2,"Fordham's education is amazing, however, the lack of diversity and the overall atmosphere of the school pales in comparison. It's an amazing academic experience, but a difficult living situation outside of the classroom."
Niche User,2,"Needs to really strive to diversify the institution. The school is located in the Bronx but the minute you step on campus, it's a whole different world. Diversity is something many students look for in a school, and Fordham doesn't check off that box."
Sophomore,2,"Fordham guarantees an authentic New York college experience yet nothing could be further from the truth; the student body consists of doomer white boys, wealthy international students, offbeat guys and girls from towns unheard of, and sometimes bitter NYU rejects which results in a school that lacks a New York-based core that it desperately tries to say it has. Fordham doesn't have the 
solid identity that NYU, Columbia, or even the New School hold and miserably tries to be something that it's not.


I would say going here is only worth it if you are planning to make the most out of the city while accepting that the effectiveness of making connections will be hindered by its less desirable location and student body compared to the downtown schools, and if you are truly cut out and willing to make connections with highly competent people off-campus."
Freshman,2,"TOTALLY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY AND TIME. Most people I talked to attend this school because they were offered a decent amount of financial aid. Other than that, there is no reason one would go here. Bad teachers, my history professor did not turn up for 2 weeks. Some very racist people; this one guy was very rude to my Asian friend. Most white kids don't care about academics and would let you do all the work in group projects. Clubs are mediocre, some good ones if you choose wisely. VERY UNSAFE. Beggars and weird people everywhere in the Bronx. I basically stay on campus 24/7 except for the weekend. Also, note that if you are an international student like me, you will be treated badly. They don't care about the international student and our office is a tiny abandoned house outside of campus. Basically, if you have better options, do not go here. You deserve better."
Junior,2,"Fordham academically speaking has wonderful courses and professors. However, it becomes difficult to fully immerse yourself without needing to pay attention to campus life. As a minority and a commuter you are likely to experience this PWI a lot differently than your majority peers on campus."
Freshman,2,"Total waste of your parents' blood money. 50+% of the professors are irresponsible unless ur lucky. The core program is a hassle and you will find it useless. So many part-time professors and some don't even speak English fluently. If you are coming to learn business I guess it is probably ok(but many business kids wanted to transfer out to NYU Stern or other places, based on my understanding). The rose hill neighborhood is so bad that we always get public safety alert. I was accosted by some weird people 3 times and I only walked outside twice. The campus is pretty nice but not that diverse. The majority of the students are white and I've heard some bad comments about Asians. I had many better choices of colleges but I came here because the guy talking on the admitted student day was too good at persuading people. I thought the college ranking isn't something important when I decided to come here but now I regret to death."
Freshman,2,"I am considering transferring. The school is all talk and I don't think you get your moneys worth. All money is put towards football so therefore the other sports aren't treated well. The athletic department is terrible and so is the training room. Athletically it's hard to feel valued. Academically, they grade deflate therefore its hard to do well on things that are pretty straightforward. Some teachers are fair and good but majority are grad students who don't have much experience."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It was great getting to know all the classmates, and the professors were helpful when needed. However, the administration, especially the dean, was not helpful throughout my four years of college life."
College Senior,2,We don't have greek life.
College Senior,2,"Our campus does have some ethnic diversity, and we do have a fairly significant amount of foreign students. However, the vast majority of the students at Fordham, particularly the Rose Hill area, are white, catholic, and from the tri-state area."
College Freshman,2,"Fordham Rose Hill has a very fratty and sporty vibe even though it doesn't officially have any fraternities. Fordham Lincoln Center has a very entitled and stuffy vibe, there is no sense of community there. If you like structure you won't mind the restrictions the core curriculum puts on class choice but if you're like me and which you could take whatever whenever, this isn't the school for you. The reslife policies are also such a drag and the food is horrible though we're told it's going to improve within the next few years. Overall I hear love it or hate it attitudes about Fordham so if you love it good for you but if you hate it, you hate it. Choose wisely."
College Junior,2,"We're getting better (the Homecoming football game turned students away due to the turnout), but athletics are just not as big here as some of our peer schools (BC, Villanova, Notre Dame). Games draw some students in football and men's basketball (especially homecoming), but they're not considered big-time events. Other sports may only draw a few handfuls of students."
College Freshman,2,I told mental health services that I was suicidal and needed to talk to someone right away and they told me to make an appointment and come back later.
College Freshman,2,It's not like there are soccer fields around Lincoln Center.
College Sophomore,2,"Since Fordham doesn't have fraternities or sororities, it's hard to say whether or not it is good. I do, however, like the idea behind Greek life because it brings people closer together and allows them to meet new people in an environment that is open and welcoming."
College Freshman,2,"As a Freshman living in Alumni Court South, it's not the worst. I'm in a forced triple, and luckily get along with my roommates so the cramped space isn't too bad. South has absolutely no community and is very cliquey. RHA loves to fine the entire building for stupid reasons, no one gets a say in getting fined unnecessarily. For around $17,000, campus housing is absolutely not a good deal. I'm moving off campus next semester, where not only will I have my own room, but also I'll be saving around $6,000."
College Freshman,2,"As a liberal student from a middle to lower class, Rose Hill is not my favorite. Everyone here is extremely white, narrow-minded, wealthy, unoriginal, and cliquey. I wish I had decided to stick with my original decision and go to Lincoln Center, where the kids are a lot more interesting and more open-minded. Core classes are typically taught by professors who don't care at all and make classes almost unbearable; you're lucky if you somehow get some good professors. The bars are crowded, repetitive, and are really only fun if you're a certain type of person. If you're liberal and like diversity, do not come here."
College Freshman,2,Finding work on campus is very difficult unless you recieve a work study offer with admission. If you can find work pay is pretty competitive though.
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is very very very cramped for your average freshman. It is difficult to find on campus housing as an upperclassman, and sometimes more expensive than living off campus. Unfortunately living off campus could mean living far away from your classes, which would be annoying in thw winter."
College Junior,2,"Small gym, sports teams aren't the best although womens teams are doing great usually"
College Freshman,2,The student body is almost all white but those few who are not white are still very accepted by the rest of the community.
College Freshman,2,We are provided high school bleachers and a baseball field that shares the same playing area as the football field
College Freshman,2,"Great business school, very stuck-up crowd"
College Sophomore,2,"There are many things wrong with Fordham. First of all, the tuition is grossly expensive, almost HARVARD expensive, yet you don't feel like you're getting what you paid for. The food at Fordham is disgusting, most people LOSE weight here because they refuse to eat. I've had more bad professors than good, almost all of them are super liberal, snooty, and use premade pearson education powerpoints. Also the values that Father McShane proclaims that Fordham stands by are completely ignored because they are more interested in your money here than standing up for their beliefs."
College Freshman,2,"Not enough variety. The quality of the food is terrible. In the Undergrad Dining Hall at Lincoln Center, the eggs were always soupy and undercooked, there was never enough staff so you were waiting forever to get something, the coffee was awful, the water sometimes didn't work, the waffles were like bricks, the food was bland, nothing was ever cooked properly, people got food poisoning off of salad, AMONGST OTHER THINGS. Very disappointing."
College Junior,2,Honestly I have nothing nice to say about the administration. They are behind the times.
College Junior,2,Eat off campus however you can. The meal plan is absolutely not worth it.
College Junior,2,"My experience with the financial aid office has been negative, overall. They are never pleasant to speak to on the phone or in person. I inquired about financial aid for a summer study abroad program I was going on and they told me that I had to completely fend for myself, that they could not help me with anything."
College Freshman,2,"I mean, only half of them are former crack houses."
College Sophomore,2,The prices for on-campus housing rise every year.
College Freshman,2,The food at Fordham is not great. To get a good meal you must go off campus and although there are many great options surrounding the campus it would be great to have better on campus dining.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of weird artsy kids at LC. A lot of acting and dance majors. Not a lot of ""normal"" people."
College Freshman,2,"Not a huge party scene, no greek life."
College Freshman,2,Residential Life does nothing for you.
College Freshman,2,Fordham does not give you much money.
College Freshman,2,In the winter there are not many options. It can become pretty competitive at the bar scene. House parties are okay.
College Senior,2,No free speech zone and guest policy is ridiculous
College Senior,2,"The people who work at the desk in FinAid are the nicest people ever, but Fordham requires you to jump through hoops to get what is promised to you.  It's a lot of paper work, and the lady I dealt with in the back was NASTY to me and told me I'd live in my parents' basement for years"
College Freshman,2,"The rules in on and off campus student housing are ridiculous. They let the faith of the school interfere with having visitors. Even if I were to have my cousin over, he would have to stay with one of my boy friends in my dorm. All on-campus visitors have to be signed out by 3 am and there are no last-minute sleepover decisions because of it. You need a guest pass 24 hours in advance no matter what. Their attendance policy is also ridiculous. If you're puking your guts out, you'll need to walk all the way across campus to go to the student health center that will just tell you to rest. But, it's necessary to get out of class."
College Sophomore,2,"Recently they just closed one of the gyms so now there is only one tiny gym for thousands of students. Therefore the gym is always crowded and people wait in line to use the equipment. All the fields and basketball courts are nice and fine, but the gym is too crowded and we desperately need another."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman dorms are extremely small and cramped, especially if you're living in a forced triple, which happens due to the number of housing needed. However, they did open an extremely nice freshman dorm called Loyola. The housing lottery is a complete. Everyone is given a time slot random throughout the day and must choose housing at their selected time. If all housing is filled up at that time, you are left in the horrible post lottery, in which they put you wherever they have space, which could be a freshman dorm again or a single. This happens every single year, even as an upperclassmen, and would hate to live with underclassmen. Upperclassmen dorms are nice if you can get them, they have a kitchen, living room, and bathroom."
College Freshman,2,"It is not terrible, but it is simply not good."
College Freshman,2,There are not many options for food on campus. After a while the food becomes distasteful because you eat it every day. The best option is to try food around campus and go into the city
College Freshman,2,"Though Fordham is D1, no one really cares about the sports here.  The athletes still walk around like they own the place, but at the end of the day games are rarely attended."
College Freshman,2,"I have no idea why we stick with Sodexo, tuition is too high to have such bad food.  There's not a lot of options, and the few options we have aren't great.  A lot of the food is unhealthy, but the healthy options they do offer are usually disgusting.  When eating on campus, you just eat because you need to, there's nothing enjoyable about it really."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly people say Keating and Eddies are beautiful and Keating is in a lot of tv shows and films, but honestly they're just average buildings. Nothing special about them. The campus is not overly beautiful or magestic. Most of this campus doesn't even look like a college, lacking many of the features a truly appealing campus. The campus honestly isn't great looking and is below average in my opinion."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of drugs and alcohol. Fumes is always busy for one reason or another. Be wary of the locals. They as a whole don't deserve the rep they get, but some can be dangerous. The area around campus in not safe at all. Those who attack students are not afraid to stalk and harass groups as well. Assaults at knife point are common. the only reason it's not such a huge issue here is because as the temperatures chill the crime stops, as it does everywhere. Women are especially targeted. Students have been forced to withdraw hundreds of dollars at a time. Don't get into any three card montee games. You have been warned. Never go off campus by yourself late at night."
College Freshman,2,"No one cares about the sports outside of Football. Men's basketball draws some crowds, but not a lot of students. Sports at Fordham either suck or are just ignored. It's really sad actually. All of the facilities are comparable to my high school. Again I say, comparable to my ILLINOIS PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. Really sad we don;t put more money into those."
College Freshman,2,"Incredibly overpriced for such crappy apartments and houses. Thankfully their so campus or there would be so many robberies and break ins. People say the Bronx is ok, but there has been multiple stretches with security alerts everyday. The longest such stretch was two weeks before Thanksgiving. The off campus housing is poor, so bad that it almost makes me want to live on campus. Freedom to drink and party is the reason most people move off. Move off campus when and if you can, but make sure you find a half way decent place."
College Freshman,2,"I had to eat panda everyday for two weeks during the winter, not because I wanted to, but because everything else is just SO BAD. Even so, the workers who prepare the food don't do a very good job. You can tell the difference between campus panda and another location. I don't get how people say Cosi is the best, it's terrible. Thieving  there tastes bad and you chew threw your dining dollars. The grille is ok, just ok. My high school had better food than this, my ILLINOIS PUBLIC high school had better food. Everything off campus is expensive given the location of the school (NYC). There is a small Compare food market, but I haven't gone in there often.  The only food option I believe to be underrated is Subco. It's very repetitive with a small menu, but I'm personally into the sandwhich/sub thing. Not by any means 5 star, but underrated."
College Freshman,2,"The ""Good housing options"" for freshman are just average. I live Martyrs so I could go on forever about how it suck. The only good freshman housing is Loyola, which as everyone says is a hotel. I walked into my room on move in day asking myself ""Am I sure this is a double?"". I even had  a room that was somehow built to be a few feet bigger than the others. The rooms themselves flat out blow. Quite a few students are forced into triples which makes it barely livable. You have to live on campus freshman year so you just gotta suck it up. The upperclassmen housing i've seen is only slightly better, most notably with bigger hallways. The first chance you get move off campus and stay there. Housing in general sucks and Fordham has no intent to update or improve. With the ever increasing admitted students there won't be enough housing for students even with all forced triples."
College Freshman,2,"It's bad. There is no getting around it. There aren't a lot of places on campus to eat and you will get sick of all the food within your first semester. However, eventually, you figure out ways to mix it up and make it bearable. For freshman, Cosi and Subco are both steps away. Subco is open until twelve and they serve subs, salads, soup and they have an Auntie Anne's in there. You can also get ice cream, soda, juice, candy, milkshakes(from a machine), and other random things like that. However, BEWARE THE SMELL. Subco has a very specific, very weird smell that will get in your clothes. Cosi is nice. They serve sandwiches, soups, salads, pizza and have good breakfast in the morning. I would say its like a worse version of Panera. A lot of people go to study in there; the atmosphere is nice. The caf is boring and repetitive. The food isn't necessarily bad, it is just bland. They have good dessert though! Dagger Johns is right under the caf and they have Panda Express, Jamba Juice and Starbucks(the coffee is nowhere as good as the real starbucks though so be warned). The Grille is probably the best place to eat on campus. It's open until 1. However, it's on the opposite side of campus from where the freshman dorms are, so its a little bit of a walk. Right off campus, you have Pugslies, the pizza place you go to when you're drunk(they also deliver until 3), Dunkin Donuts, Best Deli, Applebees, and Aruthur Ave which is filled with little Italian restaurants(very cute date spots). You figure out ways to eat."
College Sophomore,2,"Fordham gave me a good financial aid package my freshmen year, but then yanked it away from me once I became a sophomore. I guess they figured if I hadn't transfered yet, I wasn't going to even if they took all my money away. I guess they were right."
College Senior,2,"It was very difficult to get financial aid assistance, even though I have special circumstances and need."
College Senior,2,"There are only few off-campus restaurants near my school--the Lincoln Center Campus. Only several Japanese Ramen Restaurants with the fair price and proper distance. Or you can have your quick meal at Whole Foods which is in the time waned center, 5-minutes-walk from our campus. As for the restaurants on the broadway, the price is ""delicious"" as the food."
College Junior,2,There are more crime alerts than I would like to personally see...
College Junior,2,Way too expensive - tried it but went back to school apartment living as soon as I could
College Junior,2,No facilities at my campus as it is NYC on Manhattan - more at the Bronx campus
College Freshman,2,"They describe Fordham as being in the city, but it is in the Bronx, which limits the local attractions. You are a 20 minute train ride from Grand Central via Metro North or about an hour by subway. If you are looking for a true city experience, apply to the Lincoln Center campus. Rose Hill fits a more traditional college campus."
College Freshman,2,"Really spacious apartment with a kitchen and sometimes a great view, but everything is either old and/or breaks easily. There are only a few lounges throughout the entire building, and they always smell weird. AC/Heater is never normal."
Sophomore,1,They are so unhelpful it’s not even funny. I don’t know anyone that is confidently passing their classes.
Sophomore,1,"The faculty simply do not care about you. They are unhelpful and rude. The amount of work is unmanageable. Every single student I’ve talked to has said the same this. I hate it here. For 60,000$ a year go somewhere you’re going to be happy and I guarantee it’s not Fordham."
Alum,1,I did not have an online learning experience.  My attendance was in person. They did not offer online courses at the time i attended.
Junior,1,"I seriously didn't learn much online since it's hard to focus when doing everything online. The good thing is everyone cheats so we all get A for our grades. We'd all expect Fordham to issue a partial refund on our tuition but they never did; instead, they said they are kinda broke and need more money. Now they are asking us to pay for the fall semester while they don't even know if the school will be able to reopen, and the tuition just got more expensive. They make promises, and then tell you ""due to xxxx we are unable to xxx."" All they want is your money and please AVOID this college at all cost. If you are just coming to college for a diploma you can come here, but if you want to learn anything please go elsewhere. State universities are much better than Fordham."
Senior,1,Due to the current Covid19 all classes went on line. I am a theater major at Fordham LC. If you thought classroom learning was bad at Fordham. Then learning theater on line is even worst. Fordham has no respect for theater majors especial students of color. Fordham has been the end of my theater career. I should have left freshman year but I did not have the money and I did not want to loss a year of schooling. I should have left. Now they are cutting the theater program by 70%. I have learned nothing and now I am old and will not even get a senior showcase. Something they promised freshman year for all graduating classes. Do not come to this school. I should have gone to one of the many other schools I got into and just been in more debt.

Be in debt, go to a school that actually cares about the theater students."
Freshman,1,"I got food poisoning a total of seven times eating on campus. There are barely any options for food on campus, and unless you feel like buying from an expensive Italian restaurant, your food options off campus consist of Applebees and Chipotle-the latter of which I got food poisoning from. They don't do anything for their LGBT students, and consistently choose against helping them in favor of their donors. I am thankfully trasferring schools after only a year of attending."
Sophomore,1,"Going to Fordham was probably one of the worst decisions I've ever made. The academics are not challenging at all but the schools grading system is nonetheless arbitrarily difficult. There is absolutely no diversity here, with almost everyone hailing from a wealthy white background. The nightlife is repetitive as well, with everyone going to the same three bars every weekend. The only good thing I can say about Fordham is that it has a good alumni network and access to internships as a result of its location in NYC. Overall, don't waste your time and money on Fordham."
Senior,1,"Fordham cares very little about the student body. The administration matches its apathy only in its ineptitude. The social scene is boring and repetitive, students have few rights, grades are deflated, class requirements are arbitrary, attendance is always mandatory, living conditions are terrible, the student body is almost completely homogeneous, and the surrounding area is largely charmless. Do not go here and do not send your child here."
Sophomore,1,"Definitely not worth your time or money. I’m a transfer student and I must say I am way more miserable here thab at the other school. The facilities are beyond pathetic, the gym is literally a basement with an extremely messy and tiny weight lifting area. The showers were so small you can’t even turn sideways and the room is flooded every day. You have barely any options for food and none of them are healthy other than the tasteless cafeteria. I only had one professor that cared enough to help me out. In regards to the education, I learned nothing other than in my computer science class, and I’m an A student. As far as my transition went, they had many events but they were not well-organized at all and they separate the transfers from all other students. The social scene is mostly bars, you’re in the city. The campus is very nice, but the surrounding area is very dirty and not a great place to be. Overall, I am extremelty disappointed and regret transferring."
Sophomore,1,"Not the best place for science/pre-med. Impossible to study abroad and the core can be a waste of time. Nothing to do on campus unless you like to drink. Dead on the weekends otherwise. Basically only offer sandwiches and salads at most of the food places. Really bad hours of operations (unless you sleep in until 12). Awful place, generous scholarships"
College Sophomore,1,"I've had mostly very nice teachers, but I rarely learn much in class (not for lack of trying). I feel like I'm not getting a real education. Most teachers dumb down the material. Ready to leave!"
College Sophomore,1,"Gym at Lincoln Center is beyond awful. For all of last semester, there was only one 10 pound weight. Machines are always broken. All sports are at Rose Hill"
College Sophomore,1,"Great city, horrible school. Not worth the price tag. Core is a huge hassle. Very limited classes. Res Life is awful. Terrible food. There are a few good teachers, but most simply don't care. Not a great student body. No sense of school spirit or community."
College Freshman,1,No greek life which significantly worsens Fordham night life.
College Freshman,1,Only places to party are the bars on Arthur ave. House parties are very uncommon unless you are on or associated with a sports team.
College Sophomore,1,"Fordham University favors it's business students, so if that's what your interested in, then you should definitely consider it. Unfortunately for most other majors *cough cough sciences and mathematics* Fordham is literally the worst. By the end of the year, most of the science kids agreed that they were miserable and felt as though success was nearly impossible at this university. Some teachers were alright, but for the most part the ones that were most important to our major were awful. I often felt as though Fordham was a business just there to take as much money away from me and give back as little as possible, which is a horrible way to feel about a school that's supposed to be helping you succeed. Instead I constantly felt like I was being pushed down and told you cannot and will not succeed here. Aside from academics, social life was pretty bad too. There are a few bars around campus, but they are always overcrowded and not very enjoyable. Aaaand lastly the cherry on top of my Fordham experience was the food. Every day I got to choose between eating cardboard pizza and styrofoam fries."
College Freshman,1,Any financial aid received is akin to getting .5% off a new Ferrari.
College Freshman,1,It's a trainwreck.  I would gladly eat week-old MREs instead of going to the caf every day.
College Sophomore,1,Gets old quick. Mostly fried food and greasy stuff.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life at Fordham. However this is no reason to look past Fordham. There are still parties to go to and many things to do.
College Freshman,1,"No sports at LC, all at rose hill"
College Freshman,1,Truly awful. You will get sick at least once.
College Freshman,1,"I am among the students who moved into McKeon, the new the freshman hall. I have a lot to tell you about what you should know before deciding to come to Fordham Lincoln Center.

First of all, while the building is new, it is already falling apart. The building was not ready when we moved in. My shower was not finished and hadn't been routed--it flooded the entire bathroom floor whenever you used it. It took weeks to get it fixed. Maintanence is INCREDIBLY slow. There are only 10 washers and dryers for all of McKeon. At any point, 3-5 are broken. Good luck getting your laundry done! Ceilings have begun to crumble and fall apart. Many students have to get buckets in their because the ceilings are leaking so badly. The elevators break at least biweekly. The heating/ac wasn't working in 90% of people's rooms when we moved it. Housing is expensive, and you DO NOT get your money's worth. The residential life staff IS AWFUL, and will not advocate for you if you have room mate issues or what not (as I did). 

The food is truly horrific. This is the first year Fordham LC has had an actual dining hall, and half the time the food makes people sick. The baked goods are either stale or moldy. The food has exciting options like ""burger quesadilla"" and ""pizza panini"" (a slice of cheese and some pepporoni on wonderbread). There are not special stations like other schools (stirfry, sandwich) --the main dishes are pizza, pasta, and burgers. The hours are awful as well. I would strongly recommend getting a low meal plan if you get one at all. 

Fordham academics are good, but their housing is awful."
College Freshman,1,"If you're looking for a school with spirit, Fordham is not the place for you. Hardly anyone pays attention to sports."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are extremely strict compared to other schools. The visitation rules are probably the worst. You can not even go into another Fordham dorm (as a student) without being signed in, and must leave by 3 am."
College Freshman,1,We are rated so poorly for a reason. I often go off campus for food or order in.
College Freshman,1,"Compared to other schools, Fordham's housing is not great at all."
College Sophomore,1,"Fordham is extremely strict about everything. You have to be careful about drinking or drug use in dorms because they will catch you, and if you're caught too many times, they kick you off campus. Fordham does have kind of a free speech policy with things that conflict with Jesuit values. You have to apply for demonstrations and new clubs, which is a long and tedious process."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is absolutely terrible here. You can eat and they have some good food, but it is still horrible. They hardly have any healthy, good food options. Everything is small so lines are huge during normal eating hours, and everything closes super early. The cafeteria food is extremely unsanitary as well, and simply gross. I am excited to make my own food next year once I have a kitchen."
College Freshman,1,"One of the biggest complaints among students are the ridiculously strict policies.  Fordham can be incredibly rigid seeing as it is a Catholic school--no birth control on campus, no guest passes for people of the opposite sex, strict visitation policies, attendance taken on the regular, and the core, which is probably the worst part of the school.  However, what Fordham fails to recognize is that despite these policies, kids still manage to get around them."
Recent Alumnus,1,It was literally the most expensive and worst tasting food I ever had to eat on a regular basis.
College Freshman,1,"I can't wait to transfer. If I had $1,000 for every lie let alone half truth I was told on tour I could pay my tuition 3 times over. The people are so cliquey and trashy it isn't even funny. This schools lacks what I call ""between the week culture"". This schools lives for the weekends, but the nightlife is so terrible and repetitive I can't stand it. The food sucks and the amount of club don't even take up half of a page of paper. Most of the clubs are purely academic anyway. No school culture worth mentioning. You really do have to be a rich jersey kid to fit in here. As someone from Suburban Chicago I can honestly say that every single Jersey Stereotype I heard coming here was true. The number of schools I wouldn't like to transfer to I can fit on one hand. A better question than asking what is wrong with Fordham is asking what isn't wrong with Fordham. Also, the Bronx is a s dangerous and criminally active. We have had streaks where every single day someone gets robbed or held up at knife point. The worst part of it is the students just laugh it off like it's nothing. The two weeks before Thanksgiving break we had a security report email everyday. The bronx really isn't safe. If you do go here DON'T go off campus late at night by yourself. Even going to the Walgreen's can be risky. I have been stalked and followed to campus from Aurthur Avenue even in a group of students on the weekend. God help those who do go here. This really is a scummy school. One thing the University has right though is Global Outreach, great program. One of the few worthwhile things about this school besides the degree. See you never Fordham, I'm out!"
College Freshman,1,"I can't wait to transfer. There is no culture at this school, at least culture during the week, but even the weekend culture gets old and boring. Everyone seems miserable, but I guess that's just the culture of the school. Rarely do I see anyone smiling or having fun out in the open. Good academic reputation, but not much else. Athletics are pathetic, even our football team who plays in the peewee league of D1 football. Students hear say they want to get involved and experience the Bronx, but they don't join any clubs, do anything extra, and set limits to where the go outside the campus gates. A 5 block radius around the campus max. It's one giant bubble. There aren't too many places I rather not go. If you aren't rich and from Jersey, you will have a hard time fitting in. As an upper middle class kid from Chicago who didn't drink to excess and do every drug under the sun, I had problems fitting in."
College Freshman,1,No Greek life to speak of. That's a plus here
College Freshman,1,"""Let's go to the same place every single weekend with the exact same people and do the exact same thing every weekend"". The bars here are small, trashy and of little quality. Being sweaty to the point of passing out can be common if the alcohol doesn't do it for you.  The venues just aren't big enough. The Blend is the most spacious bar near campus, but it also it just as repetitive and boring as all the others. What little house parties happen are so cramped you can barely move and breath. Most people just stand around awkwardly and drink beer looking at each other. No diversity in parties or general nightlife. Simply miserable. I don't know how these people keep doing it every weekend with out losing their sanity.If you can go into the city on the weekends do it. The Village has some interesting options in bars and Hookah bars. Much better options there, even better if you know any NYU students."
College Sophomore,1,"I HATE Fordham Dining and Sodexo. There are zero healthy options except the salads at the Grille. Every time I walk into the caf, I look around and I have no clue what to eat because nothing is appealing. There are no healthy options, only over-processed crap. All I want when I go to the caf are some healthy fruits and vegetables, but they are very hard to find. Some of the workers can be very nice, but the majority of them are very unfriendly and do their jobs in the most inefficient way possible. It is very clear that Sodexo does not treat their employees with respect because they do not take pride in their work. It is obvious that corners have been cut every step of the way so that the cheapest food is produced, not the healthiest food. In fact, the largest section for food in the caf is the desert section. I gained my freshmen fifteen because there were no food options that were not carb infested. The system at the Grille (the only place to get passable food on campus) is extremely chaotic and inefficient. There is no way to know how long the wait to get your food will be because it is different every time. Overall, I try to cook my own meals as much as possible in my dorm's kitchen to avoid Sodexo's food and cannot wait until I have my own kitchen next year so I can be taken off my meal plan altogether so Sodexo can not have any more of my money."
College Freshman,1,"I feel that the campus is way too strict in many ways. Since we do not have many places to safely drink if we do not feel comfortable going to bars off campus, I feel that the dorms should be less strict about alcohol use. Also, the visitation policy is absolutely ridiculous. We pay so much to live in the dorms and should be allowed to have anyone we want to visit us be able to stay with us whenever we want them to, without getting fined for spending the night. We are in college and are capable of making our own decisions about who we want in our rooms and the security should not try to control that."
College Freshman,1,"people get food poisoning all the time. When I read this as a prospective I didn't believe it, but it is really true. Students get food poisoning regularly and the food here is really bad."
College Freshman,1,"they lie about policies, for example everyone was told the first time you get taken to the hospital for alcohol you wouldn't get in trouble. That's a lie, they call your house, make you write a letter, and attend group therapy meetings."
College Freshman,1,I'm leaving the school and I hate everyone in it and I'm transferring out.
College Freshman,1,"the guards that guard the entrance to campus don't care about anything but the guards in the dorms care about letting STUDENTS WITH ID's in! it's ridiculous and whoever put this in place was on crack...seriously. Everyone got mugged in September and october too, don't take our your phone off campus EVER!"
College Freshman,1,"Everyone got mugged in September and October, you can't leave campus alone"
College Freshman,1,"Unclean, small, old, forced triples most of the time"
College Junior,1,Have to sign people into dorms if they don't live there after 5. Enforce meaningless rules no one knows about. ResLife sucks
College Freshman,1,"Because we are in the city, the residential policy is very strict on most of these counts. There are many places one could go off-campus, though."
College Freshman,1,"At school, there is virtually no nightlife because we are a single/two buildings in the city and security in the dorms is strict. There is no campus or extra buildings in which to party. For fun parties, one must go off campus. New York City offers pretty great night life separately from school, though."
College Sophomore,1,I don't own a car so I wouldn't know. Most people just live on campus or take the train. 
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life. All the parties and stuff are always facebook but I don't attend parties. 
College Freshman,1,its so bad and its never open late and there are few to no options
College Freshman,1,Terrible. No other way to describe it but BAD.
College Student,1,Professors and advisors are not so helpful.
College Student,1,"Very awkward diversity on campus - although it is a LGBT community, there are far more LGBT than straight people. Fordham is against having overnight guests of the other gender, which makes no absolute sense..."
College Student,1,There is no current greek life
College Student,1,Terrible cafeteria. Whatever you do try to get the lowest possible food budget for on campus dining.
College Student,1,The costs for parking are ridiculous.
College Student,1,Student life at Fordham is absolutely terrible.
College Sophomore,1,They are stingy with money
College Sophomore,1,"It costs a ridiculous amount of money to keep a car on campus, if you're not commuting."
College Freshman,1,"Although there is Arthur Ave, which is very popular for tourists and has great italian food, it is still not safe area and you cant walk around by yourself, so you always need to leave with people and come back with people when you're going out"

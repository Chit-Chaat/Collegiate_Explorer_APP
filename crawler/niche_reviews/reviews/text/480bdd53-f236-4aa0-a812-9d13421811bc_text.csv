Senior,5,Madonna University is a very welcoming environment. I am taking a few classes through the university and have thoroughly enjoyed my professors' passion to teach.
Freshman,5,"I am taking classes online even though I rather take them in person, but the classes online are not that hard and the professors help students too."
Freshman,5,"Really good, I met new friends and I love my classes. All of the professors are nice and so are the staff as well."
Senior,5,Online learning at Madonna is easy to follow along. Many teachers post video lectures so you don’t have to teach yourself. There is still a great deal of interaction with discussion boards. Some classes even do zoom meetings so you still have the structure of an on campus classes without the need to actually drive to campus.
Senior,5,"Very small class sizes, you really get to know your teachers and they care about your entire college journey not just one class."
Senior,5,My online experiences have been amazing. The professors contact you back in a timely fashion and also make time for you to see them on campus if needed. I haven’t encountered any problems online and love it because it gives me flexibility because I work full time.
Senior,5,Madonna University is such a great school because that take the time to get to know each student and what their needs are. I have not encountered a professor who doesn’t take the time with their students if they need extra help or instruction. Overall I would recommend anyone who is looking for a more small intimate environment to apply to Madonna University.
Niche User,5,"It is a very nice place and that i liked it when i visited. the lacrosse coach is really cool and i'm going there to be a police officer and that's dope. They have very nice buildings, and fields.  They keep expanding so they only can get better."
Junior,5,"I have recently transferred to Madonna. They are one of the only schools in my area that have my program. I am a Forensic Science Major, and a Biology minor. The staff members have been helping me transition, making my transitions as easy as possible."
Junior,5,Madonna is a great college that is very personable. The class sizes were small enough that you pretty much get to know the students that are in your field. The professors are very helpful and you get to know many of them on a more personal level. My advisors were very helpful in helping me navigate through finding the right classes that fit my work schedule. Overall I would recommend Madonna University to anyone looking for a smaller campus.
Graduate Student,5,The experience to apply was easy. There were multiple points of contact through the entire process. They made sure my application was the best for my desires and situation.
Freshman,5,I loved everything about Madonna. Being a Madonna student is just great and everyone is so welcoming and will help with anything.
Graduate Student,5,Very professional and helpful with any student concerns. I was nervous to return back to school but the transition back was fantastic thanks to the professors.
Sophomore,5,"Small class sizes, attentive Professors who take the time with Students.  The University is in great area close to many things. Friendly and helpful staff in all departments."
Sophomore,5,"Love the atmosphere and classes here at Madonna. The professors really do help you understand the material well and encourage you to succeed by giving you great resources for learning. The SI that comes with certain classes is such a privilege that not most schools offer, especially for free! Madonna University strives to assist its students in being the best student that they can be in order to achieve their goals!"
Senior,5,I love the small class sizes and professors. The professors are there to help you succeed in any way that they can. Small class sizes are great because the professor gets to know you personally and you have the ability to keep getting to know them throughout your four years at Madonna. After class office hours are so useful and the professors are great at encouraging you as the student to use them.
Alum,5,"Fantastic university for developing young professionals who are focused on obtaining a degree and entering the job market with a notable alma mater on their resume. It is a private catholic college owned by the Felician sisters; i.e. not a party school, but is located in the suburbs so there are plenty of places to commute to for fun."
Senior,5,Madonna University is absolutely amazing. I love attending a small university where the professors know you and care about you.
Junior,5,The school really makes you feel like you belong there. It's great to study my major with others in the same field of study.
Junior,5,If you goal is nursing or business major then Madonna University is the school for you. You will learn what you need to know to succeed in life.
Junior,5,"The school is amazing because the student to faculty ratio is about 13:1. We are small, but sweet. Being an accounting student, this helps me understand the topics much better. Our faculty have office hours, and they know us well. This helps us gain a better relationship with them, especially since they are there for us. Everyone on campus is friendly. When you turn a corner, you can always count on someone smiling and saying hi. Great college."
Junior,5,"Madonna to me is like a bugger high school. I tend to have most of my classes with people I am in the same program with. So at this point, were more like family and the professors show us how much they care about our education and grades."
Junior,5,"Faculty has been extremely helpful so far, and I'm really enjoying the online Criminal Justice program. I feel I'll be very well prepared once I graduate."
Junior,5,Madonna is a private college but does not lack anything that other universities have. I love the fact that it’s small and everyone is very helpful.
Junior,5,Madonna provides small classrooms for better learning opportunities. The professors and staff are very helpful!
Alum,5,I received my Bachelor's Degree from Madonna University.  This school offers degree programs that many other colleges and universities don't.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone at the university is willing to help and wants to see you succeed, also being a student athlete it is great because not only is it a great way to meet people here on campus being a commuter but it helps you meet other students that are majoring in the same thing. There are so many other different programs and clubs that you could possibly join as well to either meet people or to help you academically or financially overall Madonna University is a great school and I would recommend it."
Junior,5,"Madonna is an amazing school for all kinds of students. I am in nursing program and have been blown away by the wonderful teachers, clinical instructors, and advisors who are there to help every step of the way. The campus is beautiful and the teachers are great!"
Junior,5,"Madonna University's excellent nursing faculty has allowed me to learn and grow, both as a future registered nurse and as a person."
Senior,5,Madonna has felt like home for the last 4 years! I plan to continue my graduate studies here as well!
Senior,5,I've been at Madonna but three years I have had a great experience there you keep connected to your professors you get to know them when I want to one on one level I graduate in May with my bachelor's but I will return  in the fall of 2018 for grad school
Sophomore,5,"Madonna is a great place. Every professor knows you by name. You are not just another face in the crowd. During midterms and finals weeks, the school provides a visit by a service/emotional support dog and free massages, coffee, and pencils and test forms you may need."
Sophomore,5,It's honestly great. My first semester I barely had any friends but once second semester rolled around I was reaching out to other people in my major and making friends.
Junior,5,Madonna University is a private institution where one can focus on their future and excel in many ares. Madonna's professors are there to not only teach you the material but also help you to get hands on experience in your future field. Madonna expectations for their student are high and that helps me to reach for the stars.
Alum,5,"Madonna University is one of the best Universities in Michigan. My experience has been great, the professors are helpful and the staff. There are programs to help so you do not fall behind and help if you do. The Criminal Justice program is awesome!"
Senior,5,"I am a paraplegic student so getting to campus was not easy for me. Madonna was very accommodating and allowed me to skye into my classes. Being a senior, this meant a lot to me. I am forever grateful."
Sophomore,5,"I love the friendliness of the faculty. The student life is great. The students and professors are working to help everyone strive to be better. The classes are long but they pay off at the end. Tuition is cheaper than most universities. The campus is beautiful in the winter and summer. It feels like home if your coming from out of state. Madonna is a catholic University but they do not influence your religion. Their goal is to help you become the better you! They provide easy services for any need you may have. They honestly prepare you for your career and when you graduate, you will see all your had work has finally paid off."
Freshman,5,I really like everything about Madonna University. The school is located in Livonia which is one of the safest areas around. The students and professors care about each other. This makes it possible to study in a very comfortable atmosphere. Because of the variety of sports there is always a game or event on campus. It is definitely a nice place to study and live.
Freshman,5,"I like how it's a small university.. People are very friendly and welcome. The professors are very nice and understanding. The classrooms are nice and small, which I like. The only thing I would change is the prices of each class. Wish there was more loans to apply for."
Graduate Student,5,I'm currently a graduate student at Madonna University where l have gotten so much more then what l'm paying for it's a great atmosphere with so many different groups of cultural diversity and the professionals are down to earth and willing to help you with your assignments on how you can get special attention in tutoring in so many different locations all over campus💕
Senior,5,Madonna University has professors that care and want to help students learn. The small class sizes help make sure every student understands the material and can get the help they need to succeed.
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity Madonna University provides for their students. Advisors and professors are also very helpful. I 'am a transfer student and I 'am very happy with my decision. Madonna has an excellent nursing and forensic science program I 'am a forensic science major.
Graduate Student,5,"Madonna is one of the greatest schools you could go to. Professors and staff are truly interested in your success, and will work with you to help get the job done! They are approachable and have convenient class hours for the working student. The campus is safe, there are plenty of organizations to be apart of, and the food is awesome too! If you like that small feel, intimate, one on one attention with a Christian background proudly displayed, Madonna is the place for you!"
Freshman,5,"Madonna University is a great college. I love all the teachers, they are very helpful. I also liked their ESL program. I learned a lot of new things and everyone was very helpful. All the faculty cares about the success of  their students which makes it interesting to go back and learn more."
Sophomore,5,"Great school with friendly staff and students. Everyone is extremely helpful and excited to see you succeed. Whether your a new freshman, transfer,  or soon to graduate senior, everyone is behind you to give support and watch you succeed. "
College Senior,5,I love this school best one I've been too.
College Senior,5,The made it feel welcoming.
College Senior,5,I love Madonna and the opportunity it has given me to grow within my career field. I love how it's small and close knit and he professors are amazing.
College Junior,5,Love the small class sizes.
College Junior,5,There are very helpful people on campus.
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,"Great sports, love going to watch them."
College Junior,5,I very much enjoy going to this school and I wouldn't change a thing!
College Junior,5,"Every since my first day, i've had nothing but good experiences."
College Freshman,5,Ive been here for 2 days and the experience has been great
College Junior,5,"It feels like family, the teachers are always willing to help you out."
College Junior,5,It's nice to have a well lit parking lot at night and it's also very comforting to see the campus security in the parking lots after night classes
College Junior,5,"I've had several conversations with family, friends, and total strangers. All of them are the same and they all agree, having a dagree from a repitable university such as Madonna is the best thing anyone could hope for in the professional world."
College Junior,5,"I was in a terrible accident several years ago that left me in a wheelchair. Since my accident I've had to deal with, and over come many obstacles. In addition to my physical limitations, I also have financial limitations. I live my life on a fixed income that prevents me from having and doing many things that I wish I could do. After exhausting all of my financial aide eligibility, Madonna has helped me in two separate instances when I was unable to pay my tuition. I've always done relivtivly well in my academics and have been on the deans list several times throughout my collegiate career. Being the best student I can be is very important to me. I'm really close to graduating and once again I'm faced with my inability to cover my tuition. I'll do whatever it takes to complete my degree at Madonna. Whenever anyone asks me how I feel about Madonna, my response is always the same. "" Their amazing in every way and I'm forever grateful for all that thave done for me."" I would recommend anyone who wants to send their child to a good school, to consider Madonna."
College Junior,5,"This school is expensive , however they really care about the students and go over and beyond to make sure you succeed in the classes you select."
Freshman,4,Madonna is a great place to learn. Small classroom sizes allow more one on one time with professors.
Junior,4,"Madonna University is a private catholic university located in Michigan. Madonna University is a small school allowing the school to focus more on each individual student. The school is great at offering online schools and accelerated programs. the only downside of attending madonna university is the high cost of tuition,"
Niche User,4,"Madonna university has a great Forensics course, and as a high school dual enrollment student, I find the courses manageable through studying and hard work. As a high school aged student, I was surprised to find the other students very welcoming to offering help, and I offering help to them. I found the professors to be very professional most of the time, and one has even assisted me greatly with a letter of recommendation! The food is enjoyable, though heading to the fried food grill too many times may leave you with a stomach ache. Luckily, they have a buffet style cafeteria, where they have a healthier selection of food. All in all, I find the entire aspect of Madonna University to be a very good one, with only a few flaws."
Freshman,4,"I really have enjoyed my experience so far, it has been very positive and a great learning environment."
Junior,4,"I love Madonna's student to professor ratio, it feels more one on one and learning is more student based compared to other larger universities. Not much of a campus life but the nursing program is top notch and I am proud to be a student here"
Junior,4,"I am a fairly new student to the university and have only completed one semester so far. So far, their have been some communication issues mostly related to my program being a new one at the school. Its still a little early to have formed a full opinion yet."
Freshman,4,"Madonna professors are kind, caring, compassionate, and they want their students to succeed.  The campus is clean, welcoming, and an enjoyable place to learn at.  The financial aid office is not the most helpful, so if I would change anything, I would advise for them to provide more support and guidance for students regarding what financial aid options are out there to help us in obtaining our degrees and achieving our goals."
Junior,4,I’ve had a great academic experience here. All of my professors have been able to challenge my abilities in each course and are always willing to meet one on one if I need any help. The school is easy to navigate around due to its size. A good location for many commuters as well.   The campus is continuing to grow as well as the different programs and degrees offered.
Junior,4,"Madonna University is a welcoming campus that allows everyone to prosper, and bloom like a flower. The professors and faculty are all very supportive to the students and each other as well. The environment stays safe with the campus and police patrol there. There hasn’t been any issues and it may be the best place for students to receive a degree."
Junior,4,"I have not started as of yet, but thus far the process and help has been wonderful.  I can not wait to begin my studies at Madonna for I hear they are for the student and whatever it takes to help the student graduate."
Alum,4,"Smaller University, but the student to teacher ratio is perfect. At Madonna you are not just a number as if you went to MSU, UofM, CMU, etc."
Freshman,4,"MY first semester went great! The campus is filled with nothing but really cool people, who are easy to talk too and willing to help with pretty much anything. The food is good majority of the time, and there are plenty of ways to eat around campus or the school. The teachers are also cooperative and are willing to help as long as they see you trying."
Junior,4,"My experience has been good so far. I like most of my professors, they are nice and very helpful when I need them. Two things I don't like is the tuition is higher than most school in metro Detroit. Also most of the classes I need start at 4pm or 7pm which is difficult because I work midnights. Other than that my experience at madonna has been good."
Freshman,4,I love the student life there it a lot of fun. I just want to see the safety and food change. the campus is very small I feel if these thing were better we would have more people coming from all over the world food could be changed by giving the students a survey to choose from and the increase of the campus safety will make things a lot safer. I don't mind it not being a party campus but it would be fun to have some party every now and then. I feel that by changing these one by one will help bring the campus up in a really great way.
Sophomore,4,"To be honest, I like Madonna, however I wish tuition wasn’t so high. It would be helpful if they wouldn’t think of us as bags of money but instead more like current leaders and future leaders."
Niche User,4,"has helped me grow as an individual, even though I really did not do too much I can still feel the changes it made to me and my everyday life. The only community service I've accomplished is volunteering as a tutor at Riverside Middle School and though it may not sound like much I feel that I have really helped the kids over there as much as they've helped me. For example, I know exactly what they’re feeling because I’ve been there, same classroom, same seats, same teachers and I know exactly what to expect for them and they understand that so they listen to me. They have also helped me grow because when they ask me questions I feel like I almost owe it to them to give them the most honest and complete answer."
Niche User,4,"I like the Catholic forum.   Easy to get to classrooms and the professor to student ratio. Close to home and close proximity to area cities. The track and field program is new and is on course. Great coaches. The athletic program is growing in many areas.  
The college and administrative offices are there to assist with any questions you have."
Freshman,4,I like that even though Madonna is a university it is still a pretty closeknit school and nothing is really overwhelming academically. I feel that attending Madonna was a great choice for me because I enjoy being able to recieve help from teachers and have one none time with them for better understanding of particular material. I think Madonna should  invest more in to their sports programs and look toward building more dorms and facilities for sports.
College Senior,4,If something happens in the surrounding area campus safety immediately notifies you to let you know what to be aware of and what to do in the event of something.
College Junior,4,I liked living there but it's a bit expensive.
College Junior,4,Not very popular within our school. There are academic sororities though!
College Junior,4,As a nurisng student there are plenty of job oppurtunities for me. my dream is to one day continue my education and work as a NP at University of Michigan Hospital
College Sophomore,4,"Madonna University is a school which i feel comfortable attending. Going into my second year i have gained multiple friends who chose the same major as me. Experiencing different teachers and their different ways of teaching, i have adapted to the college feel. Madonna University is a very welcoming university and is well-known for their nursing school. I chose Madonna University because the location is reasonable and the faculty and staff are great!"
College Junior,4,I'm a big baseball fan and I very much enjoy attending the men's and women's games. The home field where they play is beautiful and it's also wheelchair friendly which is important to me.
College Junior,4,They really do alot of things on campus to keep the student engaged
College Junior,4,The professors were very knowlegable and helpful when I asked questions.
College Junior,4,Madonna University provides a small learning environment where there are small class sizes which make it easy to learn. The professors are all approachable and try to help you as much as possible. It was beneficial to be put in a group of freshmen my first year who were pursuing similar majors. The grouping helped me to find friends/other students who I could study and learn with.
College Junior,4,I love my school and I'm happy I am here!
College Freshman,4,"There are rarely any crimes that I have seen or heard I'm the news about Madonna. Security drives around the campus. The Madonna has an emergency number for students to call for anything such as a car accident, just overall safety"
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are generally very knowledgeable and helpful, and the small class sizes make it easy to reach out for help."
College Freshman,4,"Each professor is different and they each have their own teaching styles. However, each professor is more than willing to work with you to ensure you're success."
College Junior,4,"This College is Very Interesting to me . I would really like classes NOT to be so Expensive. I feel Learning should be more accesible to working Adults and actually everyone , every stage in their life. So this being written, it is stressful to the learning process when I am also thinking about when the loans will be due and how much more do I need to work to make sure ,right now there's enough money for everything at this stage in the game."
College Junior,4,"I enjoy attending my college because it is nearby and I am able to commute. I like the smaller school environment, and I agree with many of the traditional values of the school. The class sizes are small, which allows for more interaction and relationships between individual students and professors. I am glad that I chose to stay home and commute to school, and I would not want to attend a large state school where I would have to live on campus."
College Senior,4,"Great school, COSTLY, but great school"
College Freshman,4,The administration pretty much lets you do what you want as long as you don't bother anybody
College Freshman,4,I got two very nice scholarships to go to Madonna for around 14000 dollars. If you have a 3.5 GPA they will make it practically free to go there
College Junior,4,Transferring was quick and easy
College Junior,4,I don't live on campus but I know they don't allow drugs or alcohol on campus
College Junior,4,It's easy to get financial aid.
College Junior,4,"Madonna was my first and only choice. Great professors and a friendly environment.  The library is a great place to study, with plenty of tables for students. Small class sizes so it makes it easier for you to get one  on one help from your professor"
College Senior,4,Greek life are only offered as honors organizations for specific majors.  This is a good way to do community service and find others in your major.
College Senior,4,School expects respectful behavior and students receive respectful treatment in return.
College Sophomore,4,They are very dedicated to tending to students needs and wants.
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of options available for food intake.
College Sophomore,4,On campus we don't have any security breaches far as sexual assault goes.
College Sophomore,4,"When students begin to apply for financial, they should do it in a timely fashion. Sometimes applying late jeopardizes the opportunity to receive certain types of grants and/or scholarships."
College Junior,4,"Most of the guys and girls at Madonna University look decent. Right now I am in night classes so they either tend to come from work or dress in sweats. However, looks aren't everything. I have found a lot of  common interests among my classmates."
College Junior,4,I can usually find a good spot to park and there are plenty of lights in the parking lot so you feel safe.
College Junior,4,I would rate Madonna University very high for Drug Safety. I do not notice any drug or alcohol abuse on campus.
College Junior,4,I've been at Madonna University for two years now and have only had one snow day! So no matter what the weather is Madonna is still open. Which in a way is good because you don't have to catch up on lectures etc.
College Freshman,4,Off campus dining is great! Lots of options for students and all within a few miles of the college.
College Junior,4,My school does well with financial aid. It is the FAFSA and the government that is no good.
College Junior,4,"Since, Madonna is so small there are no drugs or alcohol. Security vans are always driving around and the parking lot is always well lit at night. I have never had a problem or heard of anyone else having a problem."
College Student,4,I attend on line classes
College Student,4,I attend on line classes
College Student,4,I don't know was not an option on questions
College Student,4,I enrolled to an online program
College Freshman,4,My house is not very far from my school so I usually ride home with a friend or drive.
College Freshman,4,The school is very trict if any rule is broken there will be consequences.
College Freshman,4,"The sports management program at Madonna is not very good. However, I like the field and I plan on transferring to a better program to get my degree. Once I start my career I want to work in college athletics as a sports information director. The concerns I have about funding a job is based on how long will it take for me to find a good job."
Senior,2,"It is not the type of place you want to go to so you can get a Biology degree, but it has it charms at times. The Campus is small, although certain parts are very beautiful. Classes are small, which is a plus if you like that type of environment. Problem is, there is a limited selection of courses available at any given time. They only offer Calc III once every four years, so that may elude to something. Most profs know their material, however a few have also have communication problems with their students. Music department is great! Overall, feels like a very safe environment!"
Sophomore,2,The school was too small for me personally. The academics for my major were poor and I expected more overall.
Senior,2,"What really is disgusting is how every year they increase credit hours cost, when I first got here for one credit was $550 next year they increased to $650 and now they increased it to $750 a credit and you can’t take only one credit because classes have 2 or more and that’s not including tax which will boost the cost of that even higher. College has truly become more of a business. On the other hand classes that require transportation off campus you have to rely on driving yourself there because the school won’t provide a bus for the students and students pay all of this money and can’t even provide a bus."
Freshman,2,"Madonna is mostly made up of close-minded kids and professors, and not too much diversity. Theres about 20 clubs, and half of those are conservative. Hard to find like-minded people because classes are so incredibly small. Although I find that the teachers are intelligent and have a lot to offer."
College Junior,2,There was basically no fitness center for students until this past year when they moved everything from a dingy basement looking room to a larger windowed room where there was more space.
College Freshman,2,"Not too many people go to games, and there aren't any intramural sports. The gym is nice but the selection of weights and the number of machines is lacking"
College Junior,2,Madonna doesn't have much of a nightlife
Recent Alumnus,2,shopping is 2 miles away; restaurants are here in there; you do need a car to get around anything in any event
College Senior,2,Not many opportunities that I know of.  So...they aren't advertised very well if they exist.
College Sophomore,2,We have a food company that we go hand in hand with. They have some decent foods but not specialized enough to be excited to make a trip to the food lounge. What we have been trying for is getting a well known food organization that students good adapt to and may like very well. But it won't happen.
College Junior,2,Athletics is not huge to students except for the students who are involed in them. People do not go to the games. It just is not a big deal we are a small private school.
Recent Alumnus,2,The lady came for atest while not  sober she just slept the whole time and only indicated her name on the paper.
College Freshman,2,"All of my friends come from the same city and economic background as I. However, some of us do have different religious beliefs."
College Junior,2,"I lived in the dorms my first two years and chose not to my 3rd year. The food is terrible and very expensive and you have to buy the meal plan. The building (singular, there is only one) is very old and has no air conditioning and poor heating. The cleanliness is poor. The staff has it's share of good and bad members."
College Freshman,2,"Not many vegan and gluten free options!
Good fries though"
College Senior,2,"Most of these teachers work more than one job; some need to retire; overall, I never felt they cared as a unit and i have been laughed at by many teachers and student service guides."
College Junior,2,"I meant to give the atmosphere a D! Unfortunately I can't change this. Michigan is a dead state. The cost of living is very high. Taxes, gasoline, and home heating costs are quite expensive. I will leave Michigan after graduation and relocate to Arizona or Texas where taxes, homes, ect are more affordable. Also the gas tax is lower and there's no state taxes. Michigan is a state that is only concerned about taking your hard earned money. Car license tags are very expensive no matter how old your car is. Auto insurance prices are atrocious! This is a very high tax state-not a good place to work and raise a family. I advise all college grads to leave this state because how can you pay off your loans and buy a home with all the high taxes? And winter last forever so theres the high heating costs, light costs, high water/sewerage costs. This state will take all of your money! I'm leaving ASAP!"
Recent Alumnus,2,they could use better athletes and most the students there are only focused on getting their degree and moving on.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no real ""Greek Life"" at Madonna, in the Frat/Sorority sense. The only Greek system there is is the honors clubs for different departments and majors. There is only one real Sorority and they're a volunteering type group."
College Sophomore,2,Weather is very cold in the winter and sometimes very hot in the summer.
Senior,1,I have not taken an online course through this university. The class I am taking this semester requires to meet in person.
Sophomore,1,"Everything about this school sucks. Couldn’t name one good thing, don’t go here you’ll absolutely hate yourself for it"
Graduate Student,1,"I have had a terrible experience at this university from the disability department to professors.. DO NOT ATTEND this university, you are better off going to OCC or your local community for two years then transferring to a bigger school"
College Junior,1,There is no greek life and I wouldn't care for one anyways.
College Senior,1,The food is the worst. I don't eat it and it makes me loose weight.
College Sophomore,1,"Our institution does not believe in Greek organizations. Our Greek organization is inactive currently, but when we were on-campus we were limited to things that we could do and our establishment was hard to come by at first."
College Freshman,1,I don't have much information
College Junior,1,"Except bars, nightlife is nonexistent."
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife at Madonna. I usually attend other schools for parties.
College Freshman,1,"In Livonia, Michigan, which is not very far from Detroit, there is not much to do unless you travel to Detroit. In Livonia everything close at 11pm and there is nothing to do on the campus of Madonna."
College Freshman,1,There are few Fraternities at Madonna but none of the NPHC council which I am seeking membership for.
College Freshman,1,It is ridiculous sometimes. The students are adults an there is no need to be so strict on certain things.
College Junior,1,"Since the campus is near i275, M5, and i96, there are a lot of accidents when the weather is bad. This is especially an issue in the winter time here in Michigan. Living in Michigan my whole life, I know the weather gets really bad in the winter with snow and spring with rain. However, there are still a lot of accidents causing traffic to be horrible in that area."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have sororities at our school.
College Sophomore,1,I don't want to say it's the worst because we do not have any houses that are available for students outside of the dormitory. Everyone either stays on campus or commutes from home.
College Freshman,1,There really are no transportation options at school other than asking a friend for a ride. 
College Junior,1,A real nightmare. The lots are packed and there is a great distance to walk. Its not bad when the weather is warm but when its cold its just too much
College Junior,1,The winter seems to last forever! Its quite cold most years from late Sept.-Mid-May or sometimes longer. Parking isn't that good and sometimes its quite cold and I have to park a long distance and freeze walking to the building.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Vending machines, vending machines, and more vending machines."
College Freshman,1,Unless you are a nursing major do not expect any special treatment. Madonna is mainly a nursing school and that is what they're known for. You are  basically on your own otherwise unless you strike up a close relationship with a professor.

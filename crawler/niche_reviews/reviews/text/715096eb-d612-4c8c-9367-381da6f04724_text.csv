Freshman,5,"The people at Montana state are very understanding, welcoming, and friendly. right now because there is so much happening with students they are being great with keep all of the student up to day on the latest changes and activities."
Freshman,5,So many professors are figuring out a way to make the classes mixed so that students get online and in classes experiences. the online classes are in my opinion really nice because when the professors post there lecture you are able to pause and rewind the lectures so that you notes are accurate and details.
Sophomore,5,"Montana State University is a fantastic place to be, the faculty is wonderful and and people are great. Not only is this campus built around your educational success, but it is also there to see you succeed in every aspect of tour life. From having nutritionist, therapist, to physical trainers there is someone that can help you out in whatever you can think of. Also it is a great place to ensure that school is not everything, there is so much to do around campus and just a short ride away, some beautiful scenery and Yellowstone itself."
Junior,5,It has been a very welcoming school especially within the psychology program   . They have shown me that I can excel in school when I thought I was not very good. Attending Montana State University-Bozeman has been one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. I highly recommend the school to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and a welcoming atmosphere.
Freshman,5,"I have not currently attended Montana State so far as I am a college freshman and just graduated High school, but I will be attending in the fall."
Sophomore,5,I love Montana State University. The camaraderie is great and the student life is a lot of fun. Greek life is great and there are so many clubs to choose from! The football games are great and are my favorite part of the fall!
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit Bozeman for the first time with my intent being to choose whether or not I would decide to attend the school, I met the most kind and hard working people. Each student I talked with truly seemed devoted to their academics and pleased to be at Bozeman. After I applied and enrolled into the University, I was supported and welcomed into Montana State University by many counselors."
Niche User,5,"I have visited MSU twice and will be attending Aug 2020. So far, I like a lot of what i see and have experienced with tours and talking with students/staff."
Junior,5,It is overall pretty good. The engineering program is phenomenal! with the exception of one teacher I've always thus far had a good experience with the teachers and TAs.
Niche User,5,"The local area is unbeatable and there is always something going on on the campus. Tons of good sports and club teams you can participate in. Never a dull moment at MSU. Campus food can of course be a little iffy at times but you don't go in thinking it will be gourmet everyday. None the less, a very nice place to begin a career."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Montana State University and I have loved my time here so far. The university really wants its students to succeed and goes out of their way to help. Every professor I have had really loves their job and it shows. The amount of independence but also support is refreshing.
Freshman,5,Montana state university is a little heaven in the US. Everyone at MSU is fun and loving. The professors are all very passionate about what they do and are always willing to help.

Junior,5,So far I have loved the environment on MSU campus. They are always putting on events for their students which makes me feel more connected than my previous college.
Niche User,5,Montana State is a very pretty college with lots of activities and things going on. It is a large outdoor school with Bridger Bowl only 20 minutes off campus and big ski only an hour way you are for sure to have a great visit and experience in Montana.
Freshman,5,"I decided to attend Montana State University for three primary reasons. Firstly, the staff are helpful, understanding, and for lack of a better word, human. Where my interactions with other institutes, colleges, and universities has often been painfully bureaucratic, I have enjoyed working directly with the people here. Secondly, the university supports an excellent program for students who are not sure of their degree and career plans. Rather than blindly switching plans, I have been able to purposefully move forward with the help of countless advisers, professors, and fellow students. Thirdly, the university offers a unique set of opportunities to undergraduate students, including hands-on, research-oriented classes, and interdisciplinary academic options. I have learned a great deal from these classes, and currently intend to pursue an interdisciplinary academic career. Although not everything is perfect, this university lives up to all my hopes and expectations."
Freshman,5,The campus is very diverse and supports all of your endeavors. While the winters are snowy and chilly the people are heart-warming and kind.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the academics and the people here! The classes are very interactive and challenging but not too challenging that I cant do it

Junior,5,"Great professors and the learning atmosphere is fabulous. There are many clubs, fraternities, and other organizations to get involved with. Montana State has a large community support state wide and they are always looking to improve campus."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the culture surrounding MSU, it is a very Liberal place to learn but in a very conservative part of the country which makes for interesting talks in the lectures and the classes. I think more ideas coming from different sides of the aisle helps to better shape and round our community and our future."
Freshman,5,"Montana State University is a great place to call home. Everyone is friendly and the faculty and staff are extremely helpful. Here at Montana State, you don't just feel like a number. I have gotten the chance to know each of my professors personally, and they actually care about my future and success at MSU. As a music education major, I have already learned so much, and everything I have learned applies to my degree! Montana State University's campus is so beautiful. Everything is clean and well kept. There are plenty of activities to do on and off-campus. If you love the outdoors and are always down for an adventure, then this is the place for you!"
Sophomore,5,"Montana State University has all the resources you need to get through college. The professors hold you to high expectations, which is beneficial to your academic growth overall. There are several clubs, events, and organizations to take part in as well! I highly recommend MSU to anyone who loves nature and desires a connection with others."
Niche User,5,Beautiful school with an amazing campus! Very close to two major ski resorts and a great small town feel within a larger city. Food on campus is amazing and I would definitely recommend it!
Alum,5,The University is great! The town of Bozeman is beautiful and close to surrounding ski areas. The dorms are nicely sized and clean and the campus food is pretty good. There is fun nightlife in Bozeman as well
Senior,5,"What I love most about MSU is the community. Bozeman's community, and the community of Montana State University, is supportive and embracing."
Junior,5,I like that the school is building a Native American Building after 20+ years of the plans in the works. MSU puts on a great student led powwow every year that attracts people from all over Montana.
Sophomore,5,"Montana State University is a great place to go for any field of study. They have a great selection of degrees and so many resources to use to find the perfect degree for yourself. I love the campus and how it is set up, it is absolutely beautiful and easy to navigate. I highly recommend setting MSU as an option for your future."

Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere, the people there are very nice and the teachers are good. It is a beautiful place to live and a great place to go to school."

Freshman,5,"Montana State university is a wonderful school. It has a beautiful campus, town, and surrounding area. They provide a great education and community."

Freshman,5,Campus is such a great place to learn and to get to know people. Everone here is very friendly and a blast to be around. All of my professors are very understanding and interesting to learn from as well. Overall MSU is just a great place to be 😊.
Freshman,5,The campus was very welcoming and bloomed with prosperous and dedicated students. The scenery of the campus further stablished the intimate and beautiful nature of the school.
Freshman,5,"Montana State University is a very nice school, with the fact that they are always looking for ways to make their school better. They created webinars that help people stay connected with the school even when they can not be there. They also have very good undergraduate research opportunities, which are beneficial to getting a better learning experience."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at MSU. Not the most competitive program, but a great base for me to learn critical skills and do research. Now I am attending Johns Hopkins, and that would not be possible without my professors from MSU. I also got married and started a ton of out door hobbies while here."
Graduate Student,5,"It is a beautiful campus with excellent teaching staff. Big enough, but not too big. You have plenty of recreation with hiking and fishing in the spring and summer and skiing just 15 miles away at Bridger Bowl. Not to mention that you are also close to Big Sky Skiing Resort. There is a great downtown scene and campus is always thriving with something to do. Bozeman is a wonderful town and Montana State University has a lot to offer, academic and recreationally."
Niche User,5,I love the close proximity to mountains since I love to go snowboarding. The atmosphere around campus is the best that I've experienced compared to other ones I have visited.
Niche User,5,Great community with a lot of great people. This campus has a lot of opportunities for people who enjoy interacting and getting themselves out there to try new things. The class space isn't too big but also isn't too small. Housing opportunities vary and can fit anyone's needs and wants.
Niche User,5,"There are so many activities to do when you're not in class and so many cool aspects of the campus. There's a duck pond, soccer fields, and it's right across from the Museum of the Rockies! Then in the Brick Breeden Field House there are rodeos, basketball games, indoor track meets, and really cool bands that come into town for concerts like Imagine Dragons!"
Sophomore,5,I love going to MSU! It's a great campus with an outdoorsy community dedicated to the success of the students
Freshman,5,"I love Montana State University. Bozeman is very welcoming and an interesting town to be in, and everyone supports the university. Working on campus is a fantastic opportunity and it really feels like everyone wants me to succeed."
Sophomore,5,I would gather to say the secret might be out of the bag regarding Montana and Bozeman.  Both are fantastic places to live.  Montana State encompasses all the attributes of what makes a good choice for school.  Our president is the most involved leader and it trickles down from their.  They say its what you put into it....its easy to find your stride at Montana State.
Alum,5,"Great education.  Beautiful area full of outside activities.  Most teachers are extremely helpful and seem to welcome questions and appreciate students that are interested in their classes.  Not over the top liberal thinking like most colleges, although that mentality is represented."
Freshman,5,"Besides it being a beautiful campus there are amazing faculty members who work hard to improve campus life, students minds and further their own understandings of there specific research/studies."
Freshman,5,I think that the Honors College at MSU is amazing and full of challenging classes. The school is a great environment for learning. The teachers are very helpful and great at teaching. The campus is unique and Bozeman is a wonderful town. There is always something interesting going on. The only complaint that I have is that the school seems to send out a lot of unnecessary emails.
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at MSU. The professors are incredible and I am lucky to have an awesome advisor that takes time to help me create a plan towards graduation that keeps me on track. I like the atmosphere of the campus, and the campus itself is beautiful!"
Alum,5,Charming campus located in a beautiful valley that offers so many opportunities for adventure.  Valuable classes with friendly faculty. Excellent experience.
Junior,5,Parking is an issue if you have an E pass because they just give them out even if there are not anymore spots open. The campus life is nice.
Niche User,5,"Montana State University is an awesome college in an amazing area. On campus you are surrounded by great people and academics, and off campus the outdoors are incredible. You have skiing, hiking, snowmobiling, fishing, rafting, rock climbing, and more right at you fingertips!"
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly and there is SO much to do! You never have to be bored if you don’t want! The dining halls are fantastic and meal options change every day! The outdoor recreation program is amazing and has everything you might need for all your outdoor adventures! There is so so much this school has to offer you and help you succeed, it can be hard to remember it all! Ask the information desk in the sub, or the Allen yarnell center for student success and they’ll point you in the right direction:)"
Niche User,4,"Mostly online still, however it is nice that they separate everyone in in person classes and make it simple and steam line for everyone."
Niche User,4,Overall good vibe around campus and the town. While it still has some older factors and buildings they are always doing more to up and excel the overall stature of campus and live around town. Plus a great surrounding community
Junior,4,I like the location and the friendly feeling. This campus is very nice when it is not under construction. I like the Bozeman area a lot as well.
Junior,4,It is interesting. MSU tries their best to make sure we still get an education during these strange times. They truly do care about our learning.
Senior,4,Montana State has been a great opportunity for me to make friends and gain work experience. It has also allowed me to gain an education in becoming a future special education teacher.
Senior,4,"I have had a really good experience with my face to face classes and have met a lot of new people through classes. Also, having the face to face classes has improved my learning."
Junior,4,Taking courses during COVID-19 has been a challenge but the school made learning as easy as they could. Thankfully the faculty was willing to help the students when ever they could in a very hard situation.
Junior,4,My overall experience at Montana State University here in Bozeman has been very pleasant. I have met some very caring and great faculty. The professor have been great. I couldn't have asked for a better experience than the one I have received from MSU. Something I would like to see change is more programs for certain majors and maybe some more clubs
Junior,4,The online experience during coronavirus has been good. I have not personally taken an online course
Freshman,4,"The academics have been excellent! The campus is beautiful and provides a lot of great resources for academics and athletics. Advisors have been extremely helpful in figuring out paths for majors. Great tutoring options around campus when needed. Professors have been very knowledgeable in all classes. Really great clubs and activities all throughout the year. Bozeman provides all the amenities of city life, yet still keeps somewhat of a small town feel."
Junior,4,"I haven't begun yet, but so far they seem to be much more organized than their rival The University of Montana."
Sophomore,4,Montana State University is very welcoming. Everyone is super friendly and there is plenty to do in town. The college campus is very big and the professors love working with their students especially when you make an effort to know them personally.
Niche User,4,I love the environmental science options and the beautiful sight seeing and natural locations nearby.
Alum,4,"Montana State University offered great engineering courses and did a great job utilizing other departments to broaden my educational experience. The job placement was fantastic as well with their semester career fairs. I thoroughly enjoyed the location, because it allowed me to hit two major ski hills in the winter or go hiking, mountain biking, tubing, fishing, or swimming in the summer. It was a great overall experience with great faculty and peers helping you along the way."
Niche User,4,Very good campus with lots of opportunities. Campus is located in a very good position that allows students to explore new hobbies and continue their current hobbies.
Freshman,4,"I have been very pleased for the most part with my education at MSU. It provides ample opportunity in academics--especially when it comes to undergraduate research. What holds them back in my view is a lack of racial/ethnic/economic/thought diversity which seems frustratingly institutional, as well as underdeveloped humanities and social sciences departments. Overall, however, I am happy to give this school a positive review and only hope to see it keep growing."
Freshman,4,"The ability to learn so close to home and still feel like your away at college is amazing, The professors and fellow students all do the best they can to make sure you can succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I've been enrolled in the College of Business and I've had a great experience with my professors, the campus, student resources, and the staff. The facilities are well-kept and the buildings are easily accessible. The professors I've met have been knowledgeable and willing to help each individual student succeed. There are plenty of events happening on campus to engage the students and most students I've encountered have been friendly. It is an accepting environment and a great school."
Freshman,4,"This university is very great, most of the teachers are great. Only downfall is that it’s hard to communicate with certain departments in the university. People are really nice and we have a lot of opportunities to meet others."
Freshman,4,"Even though I have only been there for one semester, my overall experience was very good. My classes varied based on the teacher, but overall I feel like I learned a lot. As a pre-med undergrad student, we already had the opportunity to have a cadaver lab to learn about the anatomy and physiology of the human body while observing a real human body."
Junior,4,"This is a great school, with a lot to do. Bozeman has a lot to offer when it comes to life outside of school, and MSU provides a great education. The buildings are strange architecturally but outside of that, they are great. I have had mostly really great professors, with two brand new ones who seemed like they needed to find their footing and being their first group of students made it a little hard. However all my other professors have been amazing, caring, helpful and really want you to succeed. So far, I am thoroughly enjoying my experience."
Freshman,4,"It's a good school! All the staff is pretty nice, my RA is super cool and dorm life isn't as bad as I thought it would be, although it could be a lot better in some aspects, like the bathrooms aren't that great. Having floor games at least every other day is also really cool. All the teachers I have had so far are also very nice, but in a one on one situation seem less happy about helping. My advisor is nice but because there are so many students it seems like I am just another number with a face attached to it."
Freshman,4,"The area of Bozeman made me feel like i was at home. The college offers a lot of options for academics. The people make you feel very welcome , they make you feel like you belong."
Freshman,4,"I love attending Montana State University. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. All of the professors are helpful. You can email then anytime for help and they get back to you very quickly.  There is a ton of other great resources they offer to students as well. This includes free tutoring, the reading lab, and free counseling. To be part of something that is so great is an absolutely amazing feeling."
Freshman,4,"I personally love it here, the mountains are constantly in view. Also the people are so nice, while I don't really like the food the sweets they make are to die for. They have two gyms and tons of workout groups. Overall I love it here"
Alum,4,This university did a great job of challenging me. They provided innovative learning environments and techniques these now make me a better teacher. I'm competitive in the education world and I also have the ability to support other educators in bettering their own practice.
Freshman,4,It is a very clean campus with the most enthusiastic teachers who love their jobs. There are numerous help and tutoring opportunities because this school wants to help you succeed. There are endless campus event to attend and make new friends.
Freshman,4,"I must say all the staff is very welcoming when you are first arriving on campus. Most of the students understand where all the freshman are coming from when they first arrive on campus. If you get lost, you can easily find someone who knows where you should be heading to. They can accommodate any of the needs you need but to reason obviously. The campus is very beautiful and very easy to get around, the grocery store is a 10-15 min walk or the nearest gas station is about a 5 min walk. So right now my experience is great."
Sophomore,4,"Coming from a small town, Montana State was a huge leap as far as size of classes goes. I was discouraged about getting enough help from professors and intimidated about going to office hours. However, because MSU understands the difficulty of class material, there are many students available for one-on-one tutoring and are there to encourage you to go to office hours or seek additional help. Without the help of the support staff at MSU, there is no way that I could be as academically successful in the classroom. Not to mention the close-knit atmosphere on the campus itself. Nearly everyone is proud to be a bobcat and wants to get to know more bobcats. The numerous clubs allow students to connect with others from across the country and create even stronger support groups."
Senior,4,"MSU has a beautiful campus, great teachers, and lots of activities. If you like nature, hiking, skiing, climbing, and rafting then go to MSU. If you don't like snow go somewhere else."
Freshman,4,"Montana State really has everything I am looking for!  It has a friendly environment, colorful array of classes and personalized tutoring and help centers. Everyone there wants to help you and does care. I also love the beautiful landscape and the town, Bozeman. Overall, Montana State offers not only awesome classes but clubs, extracurriculars, sports and volunteer work options. Anyone who is looking for a college experience outside of the box should check out MSU! Go Bobcats!"
Junior,4,"I really do enjoy the school, I think that the location is perfect and makes it totally worth it, they don't give out a ton of scholarships themselves and the teachers in my college aren't the easiest to get along and take classes from. They need some instructors who care about the people and not about themselves."
Niche User,4,"When I was a senior in High School, back in 2013 I was made fun of because I was attending a Montana school. Being from Idaho I also thought of Montana as this beautiful gem state, where my family vacationed every summer. I ignored my friends and went. Saying it changed my life it did. I graduated from MSU May 2017 and entered the Marketing workforce. Despite loving my business education I decided to go back and pursue my passion in healthcare, becoming a Nurse. They have been so helpful in helping me get all my ducks in a row about going back Fall of 2019."
Sophomore,4,"Montana State University has high academic standards, great professors, and great student accommodations.  I would especially recommend it to people interested in engineering or agriculture degrees."
Niche User,4,"School is great! Awesome community involvement, great outdoor community, and campus life is always going on!"
Senior,4,"There is such a wide variety of majors, and even more options when it comes to electives. There is simply something for everyone!"
Freshman,4,"I absolutely loved the feeling I got when I was on campus and running around Bozeman. I felt like I never left home; and as though I was right where I needed to be. MSU's proximity to the outdoors was a constant reminder that no matter how big the mountain, the climb will be worth it when the other side is slopes to ski on. If I were to change one thing, I would add a tunnel system for the winters, that reach below negative thirty degrees Fahrenheit, to allow students to get to class without getting hypothermia."
Sophomore,4,"MSU offers a wide range of majors and classes that can be explored by students who know what they want to do, and by those who are still figuring it out. The campus makes the college experience that much better, with its wide range of resource and places to study, its easy to get work done. The only downside might be the snow during the winter. If your not prepared for it, the cold can really effect your approach to classes. Aside from that, MSU is a great environment for anyone looking to explore the outdoors, while also being part of a community of like minded students."
Freshman,4,MSU is great for people were love the outdoors! I am from Montana and I have always loved coming to Bozeman for activities that include all ages. There is always something to do in this town and the college is great. I never struggle to get enough help and socialize with others.
Freshman,4,"Montana State University has a beautiful, well-kept campus. The dining halls are exceptional. They have a wide range of majors and minors offered. The only thing I wish that was improved was Student Services."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and the amenities are great!...it's just VERY expensive compared to in-state tuition and you have to pay for EVERYTHING even if you don't use it all. There also isn't much to do in town unless you want to gradually spend all of your money. It's also very cold, ALL the time. It's March now and the sun is finally out again, although it is still less than 20 degrees."
Freshman,4,"MSU has expanded it's programs and now has a 2 year workforce program, called Gallatin College.  MSU has also expanded it's campus of new buildings, new degrees and has really stepped up it's Engineering program. MSU has always been known for their Nursing program and the campus is relaxing with it's stunning views of the Rocky Mountains, easy to navigate through."
Freshman,4,"Montana State University has been a positive experience as far as academics and student life! If I could change anything I would like to see more generic scholarships offered to students who are not in athletics or on an academic scholarship. Overall, the school offers nearly everything a student could want in a university setting: clubs, student engagement, great dining halls, living communities, and a beautiful surrounding area great for summer and winter activities. With a wide range of majors and minors offered students can customize their education or follow a plan made by the university. The campus only takes roughly 10 minutes to cross but there is space for everyone to do their own activities--small but spacious."
Alum,4,"Great University, especially for engineering and biology students. Something that needs to be addressed is the parking situation on campus is struggling to keep up with the University growth."
Sophomore,4,Montana State I a wonderful college to attend. With the view of the mountains in every direction you will always see beautiful things. The people in Bozeman are super nice and there is always something to do in and around town.
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of respect at MSU. The vibe of respecting the environment and each other is truly what sets MSU apart. Students hold doors open for each other, I can walk away from my laptop in the library knowing no one will steal it. Furthermore, the academics are rigorous, with an emphasis on lifestyle balance. Students come to MSU to excel in academics and play outdoors on the weekends. MSU holds a special place in my heart as my second home."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus, community, and classes. For a relatively small university, it has many opportunities!"
Sophomore,4,"Great campus and professors. Outstanding student research opportunities. Social life was not quite what I thought it would be; I personally found it hard to make lasting connections with people and find parties to go to. The surrounding area is awesome, with two large ski hills nearby, countless hiking and biking trails, world renowned fishing, a handful of natural hot-springs within driving distance, access to public lands for hunting, and more. Cost of living is higher than average (for Montana), expect to pay around $500-$600 for a 2+ bedroom apartment."
Niche User,4,After going to Bozeman many times to visit the campus. I have noticed that most people are very friendly and helpful. Which makes an overall good experience at the school.
Sophomore,4,"I appreciate being close to everything and knowing that most venues are only a (free) bustop away. Professors are open to working with you, but be prepared for all things to hit the fan when they mess up. For when your professor showcases consistent disorganization throughout the semester, it hurts all students big time. Every time that they do"
Sophomore,4,"Montana State University is a great school with an active student life. They offer many activates for students to get involved in.The school works to get students involved and engaged on campus.  They also offer great resources for homework study sessions such as learning centers and tutoring hours. There are various groups on campus, there is something for every one as they have a large diversity of groups. MSU has a great online system for registering for classes online"
Sophomore,4,"Montana State is greatly focused on students, with bunches of resources accessible by students. They should enable a way for students to understand what classes would benefit them and are required for their major easier, and reflect this in the software used for registration."
Senior,4,"I have switched majors five times now and I am so grateful for the amazing professors who have helped steer me in the right direction. The sociology program is amazing and the professors are all fantastic! Despite the occasional bear sightings on campus, MSU offers a very safe campus."
Sophomore,4,"Montana State University is definitely a ski school in all aspects. This attracts a 'whiter' and less diverse culture that doesn't really represent the diverse ideas that are happening in the universe student population. It takes awhile for many people to get really immersed into this university, but once they are the university is a strong helper in the success of the students."
Junior,4,"The college is big enough that it is easy to make new friends and have a nice variety. Campus is kept clean and tidy. Campus is absolutely beautiful when snow covered. Parking prices are too high for the amount of free space in the area, but parking is pretty close to campus. Most teachers are very good and explain information well. It is a slightly slower paced life than the west or east coast."
Senior,4,Professors are super supportive and campus staffs are so kind towards to students. There are lots of research labs which is perfect for engineering students.
Junior,4,"Montana State University has a great  location set in the Gallatin Valley.  Plenty of opportunities and community events. Friendly atmosphere, and beautiful campus."
Alum,4,Montana State University is the college to go to if you are entering into the sciences and also love the outdoors and an active lifestyle.
Sophomore,4,"I love it here! Fantastic food, you can always find something to eat that fits your diet and needs. There's always something to do or a cozy place to read or study. RAs are welcoming and helpful. Lots of clubs to take part in and there are fraternities and sororities to join if you want an even tighter knit community."
Freshman,4,Montana State University is a go to college for some looking to acquire an outstanding education while living in a town with endless outdoor adventures just minutes away.
Junior,2,"Many of the people here are extremely rude for no reason. My day is usually ruined by someone either flipping me off, mouthing off, judging, etc.

In general, there seems to be a lot of glam and self-indulegence. The class environments feel very impersonal as well."
Sophomore,2,The least enthusiastic teachers I've ever had. The dean is great but the rest of the teachers seem like they're only there to use the research facilities. Very apathetic staff and the campus has a lot of prejudices that do not seem to be adequately discouraged by staff. A disappointing experience that I would not recommend.
Freshman,2,"For what one pays for out of state, you should be getting a hell of a lot more. The academics are mediocre at best, you could be getting a lot better education for the money. The professors care at least, however, some of them aren't the best. As far as the students go, it's largely ""suh dudes"" and bros of the like. So no diversity. There are parties, and you never have to look far to find them. The local area is nice (but very remote and theres not a lot to do beyond the outdoors), campus by and large is nice, Miller dining hall is great but it gets old after a while. The housing.... yeesh. Yeah sure they have Yellowstone, but if you're not in there, Hannon, Hapner (both all girls), or Langford (all guys), good luck. I'm in North Hedges, and the dorms (and hallways/bathrooms alike) are absolutely atrocious. All in all, if you're not outdoorsy, and you're from a big city, I'd say avoid this place."
College Sophomore,2,"Way too expensive. Like, 5 times too expensive."
College Freshman,2,"My school experience was dull and not challenging in the slightest. It felt like it pretended to be one of the best schools, and yet not even half the senior class had 3.2 or higher GPA. We had a significant rate of drop outs compared to the norm and it didn't surprise me. Teachers were helpful enough but at the same time, even in advanced courses I felt more unchallenged than I did at my old high school. Overall, I disliked the school for its standard and its expectations of its students."
College Junior,2,Not very diverse in terms of race. There is a decently big LGBT group on campus. Fairly liberal campus.
College Freshman,2,The rooms in Roskie are very small and I don't have any room right now to even add a microwave or something. The showers are also a little sketchy even though the janitors do an amazing job of cleaning them up.
College Sophomore,2,Basically everyone who parties does drugs.
College Sophomore,2,"You're safe unless you're a lone female at night. And if anything happens to you, they don't really care."
College Freshman,2,"Not the best greek life here, in my opinion that is good."
College Freshman,2,"Some frats have been charged with trying to rape people, or beating people up. Not a big fan of frats in general, but they aren't a big deal around campus (luckily)."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people go out and drink, or even stay in and drink. I am not a drinker or partier by any means so i am very clueless to the nightlife that goes on since i am in a quiet dorm and if people want to drink, they are quiet about it or leave so i don't notice at all"
College Freshman,2,"I haven't really personally seen drugs be an issue, but i have heard great deals from residents in other halls saying that there is always problems with drugs and alcohol"
College Junior,2,I and very worried about getting a job when i'm done with school. I don't feel very prepared to get a job and I don't feel like the school is doing a very good job to prepare me.
College Junior,2,"Everyone cares about the football team, but they aren't that good so its just disappointing each year."
College Sophomore,2,"Traditional sorority rush week here, is a terrible idea. Talking to different members of sororities for only a minute or two, is no way to find out if its the right fit for you and judge if these are people you want to call your sisters. It's very superficial and only scratches the surface, so if you are into being fake and talking about how awesome it is that you both breathe air, and how exciting it is that you both have that in common, then great!

Fraternity rushing (from what I have experienced) is so much greater. They plan events where people who are interested in greek life can attend and not only have a good time, but talk with current members and ACTUALLY get to know them. It is much more meaningful."
College Sophomore,2,"The people that i have met that are in Greek are quite snobby and cliquey and arrogant. I met some of my friends before they joined a fraternity and they were great, but once they joined the fraternity, they became quite arrogant and snobby. All of the parties get shut down by the police soon after they begin and they dont really have much of a positive role on the community like they preach they do."
College Freshman,2,No one really likes the Greeks and they have gotten in a lot of trouble with the law recently
College Junior,2,"I personally found the experience not enjoyable. Most of the time it is very loud and the neighbors over the course of two years never were respectful when it came to quiet hours, especially at five in the morning. Plus, the RAs seemed helpful, but they and the desk clerks would never follow through."
College Junior,2,"Greek life might be great, but they do not advertise their involvement as much. The only news that reaches on-greek students are the parties they throw, which do not end up on the more positive side of outcomes."
College Junior,2,"There are 7 fraternities and 4 sororities at Montana State.  Greek members are often present on campus campaigning for their activities, but they're generally avoided by non-Greek students.  A big source of this is the recent sexual assaults that have occurred in the fraternities and this overshadows much of the good they do.  Every chapter except for one fraternity has a house."
College Junior,2,"I spent three semester at Montana State and am now transferring. My first year wasn't too bad by any means, but once I visited friends at other schools I realized what MSU was missing. 

Firstly, the education at Montana State is great. The research opportunities for undergrads are outstanding and not all that hard to obtain. Most of my professors were fantastic and made even the hardest classes enjoyable. By no means would I feel shameful having a degree from this institution, but other aspects drove me away. Secondly, if you love the outdoors, Bozeman is an absolute haven! Anything outside you can imagine, you can do around Bozeman. The skiing is top-notch, the hiking options are endless, great hunting, etc. Truly an outdoorsmen's paradise. The outdoors activities were certainly my favorite aspect of going to school here.

On the negative side, I found the social aspect of MSU to be atrocious. A large majority of students never leave their niche. Many are from small Montana towns, attending with all their friends from highschool, and they seldom venture out of this social circle. This conveys a level of ignorance the likes of which I've never seen. People of Bozeman and students alike are generally very unfriendly or uninterested in new people. When going out, either by myself, with friends, or on a date, service anywhere is mostly cold and unwelcoming. The diversity is almost nonexistent. The parties can be good, but are not near in the quantity many would expect, and MSU is having more and more issues with crime at parties. Despite being a ""humble Montana town,"" one can rarely feel safe walking alone at night. The amount of students struggling with depression is unacceptable. MSU is great if you you're going with a group of long term friends and care about nothing more than the outdoors and occasionally your studies. 

Since I've transferred, I've never been happier, and it was the best decision I think I've ever made."
College Sophomore,2,I have to live with my parents due to the high cost of off-campus housing.
College Junior,2,"Bozeman had a 0% vacancy rate last august. it's super difficult to find a place to live, and many landlords are realizing this and hiking up the prices. some of the rental companies are absolutely horrible and will rip you off wherever possible if you don't have your s**t together."
College Freshman,2,"Options are limited in all dining halls and nutrition content is bad. High fat,calorie, salt contents."
College Freshman,2,"Usually disappointing, menus don't match up often"
College Freshman,2,"Rooms are small, Miller is barely operational."
College Sophomore,2,"Most students involved in the Greek life on campus have a snobby attitude towards non-Greek students, especially if a non-Greek is a guest at a Greek event. Frat parties at MSU leave a lot to be desired-- namely, good beer, floors that aren't sticky from God-knows-what, and people who aren't complete a**holes. If you want to be uncomfortable, harassed every five-minutes about who you know at the frat house, and pay a dollar for shi**y Keystone beer, go to a frat party. Otherwise, save your time and money and party off-campus with the more relaxed, less douchey members of the MSU community."
College Sophomore,2,"Finding off-campus housing in Bozeman is an extremely competitive and stressful process. Landlords and property management companies know that it is a seller's market and price their rentals accordingly-- there are few cheap apartments available, and the cheap ones are usually garbage. If you are planning on moving from the dorms to an apartment during the summer, start looking AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! I cannot emphasize the need to look for a place during the earlier summer months (June & July). If you wait until August, you will have trouble finding a decent place at a fair price, and all of the few available options will be snatched up quickly by your fellow procrastinating peers. Save yourself the hassle, find a place early, and submit your application as soon as you can-- most rental companies work on a first-come, first-serve basis and will lease the property to whoever is willing to sign a lease first (and pay their deposit, of course). Keep this in mind when you begin your search, and snatch up the first nice place you find-- otherwise, you will end up living on campus for another year OR live out in Belgrade and have a 15+ minute daily commute to class."
College Sophomore,2,"If you have to get a meal plan AND you have to eat on campus, I would recommend eating at the Hannon Dining Hall. You actually get to eat off of real, non-plastic plates, and drink out of ""glass"" glasses (again, no plastic). This seems like a dumb thing to comment on, but after months of eating bad food on kiddie-looking blue and yellow plastic plates, it's nice to feel like you're eating at an adult dining hall. Hannon also tends to have better-quality food than Miller (this could be an imagined effect due to the classier dining atmosphere, though). Ultimately, all of the dining halls are pretty awful, but there is enough of a variety that you will find tolerable things to eat on a daily basis. You will survive if you get the five-day meal plan and eat decent food on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"I first lived in the dorms on campus where a sexual assault occurred in the bathroom on my floor, making me feel very unsafe. I proceeded to move out of the dorms and into the Freshman Apartments, where I continually got sick because of a suspected mold problem. Living on campus did not treat me well."
College Freshman,2,"Hannon dinning hall is has the best quality of food out of the three. Obviously most people eat the same amount of food they would if they were eating somewhere else because they're hungry, and there's food available. The costliness of having a meal plan is to great to not take as much advantage of it as possible. There are no organic food options, and besides the occasional soy milk option no gluten or dairy free options. In order to eat gluten, nut, dairy, egg, or lactose free foods, one must meet with the campus nutritionist and gain enough favor to be allowed access to the special diet fridge in some of the meal halls. Most of the foods provided have some sort of wheat in them, and are usually sugar carbs such as fructose, glucose, or lactose, instead of starchy carbs. Be careful what you're eating, because chances are everything on your plate has some sort of gluten or dairy in it, making it extremely easy to gain that freshman 15 fast. The salads, fruits, and vegetables come processed or from a bag, but at least have better nutrition in them."
College Freshman,2,"Living in the dorms on MSU campus is at best cozy. However, I do feel that the amount students pay to live in the dorms is well beyond the quality of the offered living. The rooms are meant for not one, but two people to be able to sleep, eat, have an office, a kitchen, changing area, and be able to relax and hang out. The size of these rooms is perhaps adequate for ONE person to be able to live in with all those. 

The dining hall is also less than satisfactory for the amount students are required to pay. The food is typically not friendly to those with food allergies such as gluten intolerant allergies. For another reason, one of the dining halls has been slowly closing off during the course of the year from construction, forcing the resident students into smaller and smaller dining areas."
College Freshman,2,There are a few house parties around but too many people for me.
College Sophomore,2,I work in Miller. It could be worse.
College Freshman,2,"It's overpriced, poor buildings, unenforced quiet hours, pretty much a shit show. Pardon my french. I do enjoy it though."
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares for Greek life here and it's a very small scene.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school does not assist students whatsoever in finding off campus housing. We are required to live on campus for our freshman year then it is up to us where we live. Parking is horrible and has on,y gotten worse since student enrollment has increased. There are many fields around campus where a parking garage could be built."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life never appealed to me and I do not know much about it. On a campus like mine Greek life is pretty minute, I don't hear much about it. I have no idea what they do in the community, if anything."
College Freshman,2,way cheaper than dorms for sure but pretty expensive area and terrible rental agencies
College Freshman,2,If you're outdoorsy and have transportation and/or funding for skiing or snowboarding there is plenty to do other than that be 21 or older as most local concerts are 21+ and there are plenty of bars
College Senior,2,Housing is expensive and the real estate companies are difficult to deal with. People hate to rent to college students. There are some neighborhoods that college students cannot live in at all.
College Junior,2,Nothing special. Partiers and rude who think they're better than everyone else. No signs of community service or special projects from them.
College Junior,2,Too strict on stupid things & don't pay attention to important stuff.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are filled with alcoholics
College Freshman,2,res life is out to ruin your day they are jerks who dont actually care about the students
College Sophomore,2,i got no aid this year and now im probably not goin to be able to continue school
College Sophomore,2,"no parking space, and its hard for residents to find parking during the day because off campus people have to get a different permit that will allow them to park in resident areas"
College Sophomore,2,"To get a parking pass to the most lots (SB) it is $169 and it seems to go up every year.  That said, there are rarely spots open in the lots that are even relatively close to campus unless you get there before 8 in the morning.  If you don't, leave early and basically drive the lots until you find a spot.  I usually can find a spot in the far lot behind the fieldhouse halfway to Kagy.  There are also many events throughout the year, such as gamedays and MSU Fridays where they either block off parts of certain lots or there are so many people that parking is virtually impossible.  My advice would be to carpool, ride your bike, or walk whenever possible.  If you basically need to drive most of the time, leave early and try not to get too frustrated with the situation.  It might even be worth it to just get an F pass (I think this is the cheapest) and walk the extra distance.  This normally wouldn't be an issue, but it gets pretty cold here and most days that extra bit will freeze you."
College Freshman,2,"It is really cold here. If you are not a fan of the bitter cold, find a different school then."
College Freshman,2,"Many students smoke and do drugs and, once again, there is not a lot done about it."
College Junior,2,its not good at all
College Freshman,2,"I lived in the dorms my first semester then moved out. I thought they were over priced, dirty, old, run down, and it wasn't worth my time or money. I also became sick of the food very quickly. Not only did i hate everything about the housing, but moving out was such a struggle. I couldn't get anyone to help me, i talked to my RA, wrote letters to the board, talked to the desk staff, and i really had to fight to get out of the dorms. When i was finally heard and released the staff was very rude and unhelpful about me leaving. The worst part of it all was the bad housing really brought down my entire first semester and it wasn't the freshman year i had wanted. (I also know of many other who tried or did move out of the dorms for the same reasons)"
College Freshman,2,"We have had multiple issues with the connection.  It is only available in certain spots on campus and even then, can be very slow.   Although they do offer many computers on school property, most students have their own laptop as many classes use an online database."
College Freshman,2,"I've lived in Montana for years, and the weather here is off and on. It can be all 4 seasons in less than 1 hour."
College Freshman,2,"I know Montana State University would like more diversity, but it is hard since it is Montana. Most students want to leave Montana to be in a more diverse area, and since Montana is pretty rural, a person either has to live in Montana to go to school here or they absolutely love Montana and the school."
College Freshman,2,Montana is a conservative state full of white people.
College Sophomore,2,We have a dorm actually known widely throughout town that it's the 'druggie dorm.' Even my dad remembers druggie people inhabiting that place when he went to college here!
College Sophomore,2,Not the best across campus. They need work!
College Freshman,2,"Guy to Girl ratio is ridiculous, More guys then girls! that sucks. "
Alum,1,"Yes, Bozeman is a nice place. Especially coming from rural California, it provides a new setting. However, do be warned- only native Montanan's are accepted here. If you are a Californian, stay away- you will be outcasted, shamed, and bullied relentlessly throughout your time here. The academics are tailored towards native Montanan's, whose academic standards are one of the lowest in the nation. This leads to a boring, repetitive first year. Post-graduation, you will have extreme difficulty finding a job in the poor, agricultural Montana unless you are native Montanan, and any job you may find will be fast food or a crappy retail job. Outside of Montana, as the Montana State isn't well known, most employers will hire someone from a more well known school than you. Tuition is cheap, but still more expensive than what you will receive out of here. Bozeman is also one of the least diverse places in the country. Stay away, Californians."

Alum,1,"In my opinion, women and minorities should avoid MSU. I was a victim of a crime on campus and needed help dealing with fear. MSU could not offer me services. While going through this I had to take an exam to enter the grad program. I received an MS pass but later found out a white man who scored lower than me was given a PhD pass. The exam committee stated their reason for it was, ""He suffered from testing anxiety and she needed to work harder."" The Dean disclosed that is no mechanism on campus to ensure academic honesty for exams. One of the most important things I've learned about MSU is that when something bad happened to me on their campus, they overwhelmingly demonstrated that they don't care. What happened to me at MSU could happen to anyone."
Alum,1,admissions is misleading transfer students to believe that they have accepted all of their credits.  After they take your money they will let you in on the fact that they were all electives or that you need to complete classes that are not currently offered before you can continue with your area of study.. This is a ploy to generate more money for MSU and should be illegal.
Graduate Student,1,"While the atmosphere and the outdoors is great this has got to be the WORST university for helping students. Especially international students. The International Department does not care about students and does nothing to help them and instead because of how monumentally they screw up, end up causing nothing but additional stress to their students. 
The History Department is also a giant joke, with the ""world-renown"" Professors having no interest in helping students who want to expand their boundaries and study topics that are not directly related to the professors research."
College Freshman,1,"My dorm is the same as it was in the 70's, they just build new dorms but it's hard to get in and what you pay for isn't what you get."
College Freshman,1,"WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A TICKET TO A FOOTBALL GAME, THAT'S BAD"
College Freshman,1,Greek life isn't really a thing here
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone is basically the same. If you're at all different, especially regarding LGBTQ+ or religion, you will be harassed at some point"
College Sophomore,1,"This school is only good for a few majors: engineering and sometimes business. Otherwise, they don't give a crap about you. The advisors are unhelpful and would rather get you out of their offices quickly than help, particularly in University Studies. This school just wants your money, so they promote engineering, the crappy football team, and the nearby skiing to get you hooked."
College Freshman,1,"There are so many parties and drinking activities that students take a part in. Roskie and North are the party capital resident halls, as well as Pike and other greek life fraternities."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is just an excuse to party, do drugs, and have sex. THey do zero good to the community and don't do anything positive for the school. IT is just an expensive social group."
College Freshman,1,"There are campus police that are always willing to escort anyone to any place, but there are never seen on campus. you have to call them and they will drive to campus, yes they are right down the road, but they are never seen just walking around campus to make sure things are safe. There have been rapes and attacks already, which the police would have been able to prevent if they actually patrolled the campus grounds regularly."
College Sophomore,1,"Had a terrible experience in the dorms. Was bullied out, and nobody tried to help. Will never live there again. Plus, housing around campus is cheaper and nicer."
College Freshman,1,It is nearly impossible to find a good party
College Student,1,"my parents collectively do not make enough to help me through college, and if I keep ahead at this school I will end up really in debt. I'm on this site to look for a new school where I can get the same campus feel but way better financial aid."
College Freshman,1,On multiple occasions the food in Miller Dining Hall has been charred to a crisp or moldy. The food upsets my stomach and never tastes good.
College Sophomore,1,Get here at 6am or don't park. Your choice.
College Junior,1,"Difficult to find, too expensive, too far from campus."
College Sophomore,1,Tired of the need option not everyone's parents who have money pay for the schooling
College Freshman,1,it snows so much! winter is the worst. its great if you like to ski but other than that it sucks
College Freshman,1,THE INTERNET IN THE RESIDENCE HALLS IS ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. IT IS ALWAYS KICKING YOU OFF AND IS ALWAYS EXTREMELY SLOW.
College Freshman,1,"The greek life at MSU is horrendous. There are constantly reports of rape, drug abuse, etc. that come from the greek parties."
College Freshman,1,There is a ton of alcohol and drug problems in the residence halls and there is very little action taken to stop this generally.
College Sophomore,1,"This is by far the worst thing about MSU, bar none. No spots, everyone paid ridiculous amounts of money for no spot to be found..EVER. Girls are in danger of having to walk clear across campus at night after work to their dormitories. Parking enforcement people here are the worst, most rude people I encountered in the entirety of my life."
College Sophomore,1,"The people here to help have some problem with, go figure, helping."
College Freshman,1,"I've had SO many issues with the dining. I was put in a freshman apartment because there was no more room in the typical freshman dorms. The apartments are meant for families and married couples so they have kitchens. However, I was not allowed to get out of the meal plan even after meeting with a nutritionist and explaining that the food in the dining hall nearest me was making me sick and I should be able to fix my own food. "
College Freshman,1,there is no parking unless you live in the dorms just a warning.
College Freshman,1,Food pretty much sucks on campus... but no surprise here...
College Sophomore,1,"Our parking is awful, its so hard to find a spot, and if you do its usually across campus from where you want to be. "
College Sophomore,1,"Wear sunglasses when you arrive at MSU because all you will see are skinny white kids.  One of the least diverse places I have ever seen.  It feels that a large majority of the students are white, middle income, Montanains. If you are black, Muslim, gay, or any other minority, be prepared to fell out of place."
College Junior,1,"All of the students at MSU have been bent over and screwed by the dean in order for her to fill her pockets with the money of record enrollment. MSU use to be a good school to attend but now it sucks. It is so overcrowded and overfull that you can not even get a seat in the classroom you paid for. If you're a new student or transfer student good luck getting into the classes you need to take for your major. Every class is so over booked that you can not register for the classes you need to take. 

Have fun trying to park, you'll be circling the parking lots with several other people trying to find a spot. 

Its mostly an engineering school and would you want to learn about technology from a place that still can't figure out how to have a reliable wireless internet connection?

All of MSU's resources are put into marketing and nothing is put into expanding the capacity of the facility in order to handle the increase in students. 

The only reason this place is able to stay in business is its location and its location only. They sell the idea to all of the people from big cities to think they are coming to some magical mystical place in the mountains.  

You'll be better off at a more professionally ran school who cares about the well being of their students closer to home verses coming to some place that is going to take your money and then screw you when it comes time for the education."
College Junior,1,"There can be diversity, but there isn't much. We try with a diversity fair but there is mostly Caucasian."
College Junior,1,They sell way more parking permits than there are spaces and keep adding new buildings taking up precious parking lot space and then they don't add any more parking space. There needs to be a parking garage with multiple levels of parking so students don't have to pay to walk a mile from their parking space. One of the biggest complaints on campus is parking.
College Junior,1,"Bozeman is not very diverse, so the locals are still ignorant towards things they dont understand."
College Sophomore,1,Limited on campus parking. Not enough spaces and it always seems to be a problem.
College Freshman,1,"It is awful! It's a huge long process and you have to fill out tons of forms and in the end you get nothing. It's really upsetting, because I really need the help."
College Sophomore,1,permits are very expensive. tickets are very expensive. it is helpful to have a car on campus. poor parking selection.
College Freshman,1,"If you're under 21, good luck. Your only option is Frats and house parties. And if you're on the quiet side of campus, good luck finding even that. Over 21 has a much better selection. There are tons of bars downtown."
College Freshman,1,Parking is horrible. The only time there's open parking is on the weekends when all the in-state students leave.
College Sophomore,1,They seem very difficult to receive or apply for. Either you're over qualified or under qualified.
College Freshman,1,"The campus dining will really make you appreciate the food you get anywhere else.  That's about the only good thing I can say about it. On the plus side, you can eat as many times per day as you want, but that does not make the food taste any better."
College Junior,1,"Way more passes issued than there are places to park, takes like 20 minutes to find a spot unless you have class super early or super late in the afternoon"
College Sophomore,1,Here at MSU i think we are not too diverse. The problem is that Montana is still such a small population state and not many people choose to come here. It is a mostly white campus and there are plenty of in staters. The diversity is growing every year but it still needs work. i hope that it gets more diverse over the amount of time i am here. This causes for some stereotypes to rule in the minds of plenty of people on campus.
College Senior,1,"Artwork on Campus – the artwork on campus appears as if someone in the engineering department had a catastrophic accident once upon a time. Since the giant piece of scrap medal couldn't fit into the trash can let alone the garbage truck they left it in one of the fields on campus too decide what to do with it. Here comes the president moseying on through mind his/her own business when she sees what is the most magnificent piece of artwork on campus.

I think something like this must have happenned to allow all the rather useless and sparse artwork spread out around campus."
College Junior,1,Doesn't Really Exist – There are fraternities and there is some greek life but they throw a few parties and other than that are barely seen or heard about on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Good Luck – permits are expensive and you're lucky if you find a spot
College Sophomore,1,Better to Have a Friend With Car or Get One Yourself – parking is bad but its better than having to wait for the bus which is always late.  things are far away so have a car is a must and the school knows that so they make permits really expensive.
College Junior,1,"The parking on campus is horrible. There are never enough parking spots, so a person has to park all the way on the other side of the campus. It is a pain!"
College Freshman,1,"Greek Isn't Too Important – I am a member of the football team but not a part of Greek Life. However I do know that most of my friends would prefer not to hang out around the fraternities as they are seen as ""uncool"" or ""stupid"". This is only what the people I have come into contact think at the moment though. I remember at the beginning of the year the frats were the place to be because no one knew of anywhere else to hangout on the weekends. I'd say Greek Life probably receives a C+ for the first semester of Freshman year, but only a D+ for second semester and I only imagine this going down over the years."
College Freshman,1,Not Good – I was in the library everywaking hour studying even on weekends.  One class required an average of 6 hours a day of outside studying and work and the class as a whole failed each exam.  This is typical for MSU.  It's sad.  They forget many students are going to school because they WANT to be there not because mom's and dad's are paying for them to go.
College Freshman,1,"Need a Lot of Roommates – Bozeman is now LA, or Aspen.  expect to pay a lot even for a 1 bedroom.  And remember it's a minimum wage town so the job may not meet all the rent expenses."
College Freshman,1,Drink and Do Drugs – MSU was rated as one of the top party schools and it shows.
College Freshman,1,"Profs Are for Research – While there are some really outstanding professors, the majority at least in BS degree programs or for CORE classes have no desire to teach, lack teaching skills and frankly care little about the students.  The profs can have consistently low - D average scores on exams and don't really care.  The schools has forgotton the students are paying a large tuition to learn.  Even with end of year ratings that are poor, the same profs, are allowed to conitnue teaching and that is not a good sign.  The focus here is research and how many grant dollars that employee brings in, not how many students the professor was able to help succeed."
College Freshman,1,"Depending on the major - Many BS degrees have very difficult classes that requires students to retake them 2 or 3 times to get the required grade needed for specific programs.  If you want to stay in Bozeman for certain upper division program requirements, you must have a 4.0.  Students with all A's and B's are told to retake the B's for A's. So plan on being moved to a different area if you can't get the grades they require for staying here.   If you want a degree from here , other than an agriculture degree, expect a long hard experience and increased expenses repeating courses.  (note MSU does not graduate Half of the students who start) The students at MSU are intellegent, it's that many professors on this campus do not care to teach and find it ""funny"" (as one prof said) to wager which students will pass his test and which ones will flunk it.  When the Science classes tend to have a class of average of 58% or 60% - F's and D's, wouldn't upper management think something was wrong.  Research and grant money is first for this university.  Students who are paying to learn is very low for a majority of the professors.  It is very sad.  So why attend?  I am here because it is in state tuition and I am still trying to see if I can even afford other options.  I'm feeling stuck."
College Freshman,1,"Snows a Ton, Rains, Snows.. If you commute it's slow moving traffic and can be dangerous.  The campus does a great job of polishing the sidewalks when it snows.  This makes the sidewalks perfect for iceskating.  I have seen lots of students over the years have hard falls on the ice trying to get to classes."
College Junior,1,"There Are Police? I've only ever seen parked campus police cars, never an actual policeman or security guard."
College Senior,1,"Only Come If You Are Going Into Engineering – I have been at MSU for 5 years now.  I started in the Civil Engineering program which is renowned for producing valuable results.  Any other program is essentially a let down.  Classes are frequently canceled because not enough people enrolled in it causing students to have to stay extra semesters and shell out more cash.  I thought I would be graduating next fall but now I am going to have to stay for an extra year, yes two extra semesters.  First they changed the registration process.  In almost every school in the country students with the highest standing (i.e. closest to graduating) get priority when registering for classes. &nbsp;Dumb...  I could not get into classes because they all filled up and one of the few classes I got in was dropped due to lacking enrollment. so I get to give this s****y establishment another 12 grand."
College Junior,1,"I have been struggling with financial aid since I began going to college.  My parents make an adequate amount of money however most of their funds go to paying medical bills.  My mom went through cancer twice and that's just the beginning of the medical problems we've faced.  I filled out a medical case for FAFSA but I still received nothing but loans.  I am already in debt more than I would like to be, so I am trying everything I can to receive scholarships to help me get through school and not have to have a lot of financial debt after I graduate."
Recent Alumnus,1,This school is a complete crap hole – Avoid this school at all costs. I spent 2 years majoring in chemistry here and it was a huge mistake. I later transferred to Washington State which was much better

Freshman,5,"Is Great here, everyone is so friendly. Because of the pandemic they make sure to you wear your mask. Most of students' classes are on online, but they let us walk around campus with safe distance of each other. The school got a system to make sure the students are safe from the virus. Also Because the school is located on the mountain, the view is amazingly beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Young Harris College, located in North Georgia, has a very serene setting. Being in the middle of the mountains gives an isolated experience that brings you closer to interact with your peers. This college has a lot to offer, plus the food here is SPECTACULAR! This school is filled with so much Mountain Lion  pride. From sporting events, to clubs, to random activities, YHC has it all!"
Freshman,5,"Young Harris is very inclusive on different learning styles. Our professors go out of their way to make sure that people feel comfortable with online learning. If we have any questions at all, they are always happy to help us. Our campus is also very small so our student to teacher ratio is very small. This allows us to have more time with our professors to ask questions if we do not understand."
Junior,5,"During the COVID-19 quarantine, Young Harris College acted quickly and efficiently to keep their students from missing any course content. I was able to attend lectures virtually and interact with classmates and the instructors in real time. Not only that, but professors made sure that we were accommodated in our unique situations."
Alum,5,"My time at Young Harris College will forever be cherished. The culture is like family, and you can't beat that."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved the small school environment! I felt like the professors were invested in their students and you were not treated like ""just a number"""
Freshman,5,Young Harris College is a small private school located in the mountains of Towns County.  Getting to know new faces is very easy to do at YHC due to the size.  The professors are very personable and willing to work with every student.
Alum,5,"Attending Young Harris College was one of the best decisions that I made. Young Harris is a very small private school, which was a big issue for some students there. The school had about 1,500 students. There was not a whole lot to do in Young Harris unless you really liked being outdoors so you had to get creative, but for me that made the experience that much better. I liked that it was such a small school. Professors were always ready to help and you were able to get one-on-one time if you were struggling in a class something you might not get with a bigger school. There was a strong sense of community at Young Harris and you really do become like family. I never walk somewhere without seeing a friendly face. One of the biggest downfalls of Young Harris is it on the expensive side, which I wish could be changed."
Freshman,5,"Young Harris College is a very friendly campus in a very pretty area in the mountains. Due to its small size, most people recognize each other, even if they do not know each other as friends. The school also has a focus on academics, which is nice to see."
Freshman,5,Young Harris College is the most beautiful campus I have ever seen ! it is located in the mountains and its kind of it's own little comunity. The Students and Staff that attend Young Harris are extremly sweet and are always ready to help and answer any questions you may have !
Freshman,5,Young Harris is a spectacular school. The teachers are very open to communication and the fact that the classes tend to be smaller leads to more opportunity to more bonding and learning. The community is very open to receiving students and making them feel at home.
Niche User,5,"I am a former dual-enrolled student at Young Harris. Their staff, professors, etc are absolutely amazing! Everyone has their best interest in the students."
Sophomore,5,"Great experience. The atmosphere is phenomenal and would highly recommend this college. The student life is impeccable, professors are extremely helpful and caring about you as well as your grades. The small class sizes help out even more when it comes to learning."
Senior,5,What I like most about Young Harris College is the academics and professors. They are very engaged with you and are more than happy to help you if you need it. I feel as if I learned more because of the one on experience you get with professors. At Young Harris receive a more influential way of type of teaching and learning that you wouldn’t receive at a big university.
Junior,5,Young Harris College is a small but very beautiful campus full of engaging professors ready to help you learn. With such a small size it is easy to build connections with professors and it isn't rare to find yourself catching lunch together. It's highly encouraging atmosphere full of friendly faces makes you consider YHC as a second home.

Sophomore,5,"I love the welcoming feeling you get when you're here! Friendly professors and staff! This school has been a total blessing for my family. I sent applications with lots of schools and this one just felt like home. It has a great learning environment and great School leadership, this is truly a wonderful institution"
Niche User,5,It is a beautiful campus and it is a peaceful place to live and be. It is overall a lovely campus and school to attend.
Sophomore,5,"Young Harris College is amazing. The campus is small, yes, but beautiful. The only thing I would change is how the dorm room doors lock. Some of them lock automatically and are opened with the appropriate student ID, and the others are locked with an old-fashioned key. It would be nice if all the doors could be opened with the student IDs."
Niche User,5,"YHC is a wonderful college. The campus is small and beautiful and the staff is dedicated to help you achieve maximum success in all aspects of life. There is a recreation center with health specialists, the dining hall has only large tables to make sure that you make the most of friendships, and there is a huge study center that is open twenty-four hours a day and has three levels with three different rules about talking such as first level: talking permitted, second level: only group study sessions are allowed to talk, and third level: no talking."
Junior,5,"My experience thus far at YHC has been some of the best times of my life. I have made so many great relationships here, with my peers and the faculty ans staff. Because YHC is such a small school,  you never walk around campus without talking to someone you know. The community experience you have here is like none other."
Junior,5,YHC is great! I have enjoyed my time here! There's always something to to or get involved in and everyone is so friendly!
Freshman,5,"I love that this is a small campus. There are many great people, wonderful environment and the professors are willing to do everything they can to help you if you are struggling. Everyone here is friendly, and it is an open and safe place to be."
Freshman,5,Young Harris College was an amazing experience as a college freshman. It is a small community nestled in the North Georgia Mountains with amazing outdoor activities.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this college. The students, teachers, and staff are all amazing and friendly! The small classes make it so much easier to achieve the grades I want. Also, the residence life is well taken care of and feels like home. My pod is my family."
College Sophomore,5,short and quick survey. VERY EASY!
College Freshman,5,"i love it, the full college experience."
College Freshman,5,"I love the professors, being at a small school helps connect better with them. There is large variety in courses is offer yet a lot of people transfer because they do not have certain important majors. Class sizes are small, never more than 30 students in each class."
College Freshman,5,I love my school and the education I am earning. Being an athlete has given me great opportunity! The mountains has made it so much fun to go adventure on free time!
College Sophomore,5,They are constantly looking and helping you find new opportunities to spring into the next phase.
College Sophomore,5,"Wonderful professors. Very interesting classes. Small class room sizes, this increases quality."
College Sophomore,5,(Most) of the professors are incredible people who genuinely care.
College Sophomore,5,I know that what I am learning in the classroom will remain as part of my identity forever.
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are very friendly and understanding. If you have to go home early for something or you are needed at work for something, they will work with you on what needs to be done."
College Freshman,5,My classes are not larger than 25 people in it and sometimes it is less than that. We have many types of courses you can take and some you may not even think to put in college. The class styles varies on who the professor is and what they want to do that day.
College Freshman,5,My specific major is unique considering it is Media Communication. There are so many great professors and classes for my major that I am not worried about the future at all.
College Freshman,5,"Young Harris College has been such a blessing in my life. I love everything about this school like: hiking, hammocking, reliable teachers, reasonable course loads, and school spirit."
College Sophomore,5,"I've mainly only taken general education classes but the few classes that I have taken in my major, business management, I have loved so far. I've especailly enjoyed accounting with Professor Rismiller because you learn so much from him and he understands the everyday problems that students face and is really understanding. Currently I am in microeconomics with Professor Buser and I already love her class, she's smart and funny and overall is a really great teacher."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Young Harris College for multiple different reasons: the campus, the professors and classes, and the activities. The campus is absolutely gorgegous and it is what made me fall in love with Young Harris. No matter what season it is there is always something to do on campus and the views are amazing. Also, all of the teachers are super friendly and care about you and your personal goals and education; they are willing to help you anytime. Lastly, there is always something happening  on campus; we have movie nights, game nights, dance, etc. Plus there are plenty of job opportunities on and around campus."
College Freshman,5,"Even though college is difficult, everything is still manageable."
College Freshman,5,The alumni here are so friendly and love to see new faces on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Even though biology is rated the hardest program on campus, the professors understand and are ready to give you that one-on-one help that you need."
College Freshman,5,"The experience here is amazing! The atmosphere is a positive vibe, even when you are stressed."
College Freshman,5,"The trustees are actively involved with the school (two of their children are students on campus). The alumni that I have had contact with have been very involved in on-campus activities. They also give an enormous amount of financial support to the school. There are a lot of people who believe in this school, which can be seen in their superior reputation with Georgia employers. There are many many networking opportunities to take advantage of, but I am not sure about employers recruiting on campus. I know that it may take place, but I have not researched this aspect of the student resources yet."
College Sophomore,5,Since I'm a Sophomore I haven't had a chance  but the alumni are very active in the school. There are always functions for them.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are always available and willing to take time. The classes are small and lots of one on one.
College Sophomore,5,I haven't been able to do job intern yet but hope to in the next year. The alumni are very active in the school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Young Harris faculty and staff do a superb job of orienting the students to not only college life in general, but the ""YHC experience."" While going to a small school isn't the perfect fit for everyone, it is a great example of a caring environment where everyone is genuinely interactive and after each other's success."
College Freshman,5,I've had wonderful experiences with all of my professors. The class sizes are very small so you get the connection and help that you need in classroom.
College Freshman,5,"I am currently a Music Education Major. When you decide you want to be involved in this major, you need to make sure it is truly what you want to do as a career. This major is in no way easy or a breeze through college. My major is quite possibly the busiest major. You have many hours of observation and your music classes will challenge you. With this being said, every single one of the music faculty professors will go above and beyond their duties to help you. You are their top priority and they will be here for you every step of the way. We currently to not have necessarily the best music facilities, but a new building is being built just for us. Almost all of the music faculty have work study students that work for them, so there are opportunities for you to work for someone in the department."
College Freshman,5,The campus centers for academics including the library and centers such as the athletic department are way above average. The students are given numerous campus availabilities within reach.
College Sophomore,5,The student body comes together all the time and it's really cool. We have students from all walks of life and it's great getting to know them an learning from them about where they are from
College Sophomore,5,"The fact that yes our school is small but it's the student body and faculty that make it worth while. There's always something fun going on, on campus"
College Sophomore,5,Students at YHC are all so friendly and I love it! Everyone there is easy to talk to and I really feel like we are all a part of one giant family!
College Sophomore,5,This experience will finishing a dream...  I truly look forward to it.
College Sophomore,5,I follow and will all of their rules and policies and adhere to conforming to them... I have no reasons to challenge them.
College Sophomore,5,"I will look forward to getting them well in one year's time to investigate and check my opportunities for a summer outdoor or business internship and, then, again, in two years for graduation... I think they will have an ample amount of chances and opportunities to succeed and be happy."
College Sophomore,5,The body is large and growing... Many open minded fun friendly diverse people from all types of backgrounds form all of the world... Everyone has their own interesting personality...
College Sophomore,5,"There currently is construction improving the grounds, and a new dining hall and other general classrooms... Go the flow and see what happens next..."
Freshman,4,"Young Harris College, located in North Georgia, has a great scene around the college with the mountains at every corner. Being in the middle of the mountains gives an isolated experience that brings you closer to interact with your peers which has been great for me to grow more. This college has a lot to offer with financial aid opportunities and just the accommodations they give for new students. This school is so dedicated to its students even if they aren't perfect they do what they can."
Freshman,4,"My freshman year has been in the midst of the Covid pandemic which caused many challenges, but Young Harris acted quickly and efficiently to keep their students from missing any course content. I was able to attend lectures virtually and interact with classmates and the instructors in real time. Not only that, but professors made sure that we were accommodated in our unique situations."
Freshman,4,"I have some classes that are online. Some teachers pre record their lesson and others have video chat. They give many resources to help us pass the class. I don't really like online class, is very different from in person class. I don't learn well but the teachers are always available to help."
Junior,4,"Young Harris is a small school with big opportunities for community. There are amazing professors, insightful and caring staff/administration, and a multitude of scholarships specific to the school. 95% of students receive financial aid and/or scholarships! I wish Young Harris's diversity was stronger; however, there is a vibrant campus culture in which anyone can find groups that share their interests, hobbies, beliefs, and skill sets! Students know nearly all of the faculty and staff by name (and visa-versa)!"
Alum,4,"I did not get an online experience, but I do believe they would have done well with it. They weren't afraid of new tech."
Senior,4,"online can get inconsistent, some professors did wonderful work in the online setting while others struggled to do the bare minimum"
Senior,4,"the atmosphere (physical and social) of young harris is so powerful. the people there (faculty, staff, and students) truly make you fall in love with this little mountain town."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Young Harris College has been very enlightening experience that has taught many things while having fun at the same time. Loved that it was a small campus located in the Appalachian mountains of Northern Georgia, where there were many outdoor activities to do around the surrounding areas of campus."
Freshman,4,"It has been great, they try to involve the students in many events. I wouldn't change much just some of the teaching styles."
Freshman,4,"The work you put into the academics here really is what you get out of it. This can be a C- in Academics if you don’t care; it could also be an A+, all depending on how much effort goes into the classes and extracurriculars."
Alum,4,Young Harris is a good school for someone who enjoys the mountain life and also a small school.  They also have the basic food needs( Starbucks and Chick-fil-A
Freshman,4,"Young Harris provides and healthy learning environment, with great attention to student success, both academically and socially. The campus community and surrounding community is very active and supportive of the students. However, diversity on campus is minimal. There is little diversity in the student population as well as faculty/staff, and there seems to not be an rush in changing that."
Niche User,4,I like that Young Harris has allowed me and many other high school students save money by taking Dual Enrollment courses. I will be able to graduate high school with most of mg freshman year completed. Others will have their associates degree.
Senior,4,"My experience in the last three years have been great for me. I've met some great people and have been given an opportunity to figure out who I am not only as a student but as a person. Although I've always been level-headed, Young Harris gave me a chance to take risk and explore my options. Even though it’s a small campus, the scenery is lovely and it takes my breath away every time I go to class. Young Harris provides every student the leeway to make their own choices for classes that fits their needs and/or requirements and payments for financial aid. Yes, its expensive, but the relationships and the bonds that you make on campus will forever be with you even when you graduate because of the closeness and the late nights that you spend together. There are stressful moments and times that you just want to give up but there are a lot of resources and faculty on campus that've been a constant motivation and support whether we are aware or not."
Sophomore,4,"Overall the college is really nice, the small size makes you feel more at home and it is easier to learn the college and get from place to place."
Sophomore,4,"Young Harris is a beautiful school tucked in the mountains. We, Young Harris students, often refer to it to the valley because we are literally tucked away within the mountains. It is a small school which does take away from the college experience a little bit but it also provides a great opportunity to really connect with your peers and even your professors. There is not a ""college town"" or anything  but there are plenty of trails to explore, mountains to hike, and lakes to jump into. If you enjoy out door activities, this school is probably a good fit for you."
Alum,4,"Personal professors and faculty are great and make for a comfortable learning environment. The area is beautiful and nice for those who love the outdoors, but may be boring for those who are used to city life. The list of majors covers most general studies, but still has plenty of room to grow."
College Sophomore,4,Young Harris is great if you like parties with only dudes! but they are fun guys
College Freshman,4,The professors will help and guide you but also make sure you do the work by yourself. It is important to understand that you have to do the work in order to succeed.
College Freshman,4,I really haven't had any difficulty with anything academic-related.
College Freshman,4,I haven't personally used the career services. I've only heard great things about them.
College Freshman,4,"All of my classes have been high quality so far, as well as the professors. I've only had maybe one or two teachers that I didn't really care for. The variety of classes is great, and the class sizes are small, which I love."
College Freshman,4,"My classes are challenging enough for me to learn new things, but not too difficult. The workload hasn't been bad at all so far - probably just the right amount of work. Facilities are great. There are plenty of resources to help students find internships and job opportunities."
College Freshman,4,I love pretty much everyone here. It's easy to get along with other students as well as faculty members. The teachers truly care and make themselves available to you. The campus is wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,"I've never taken online classes but this survey will not let me move on without answering. 

We do have many assignments that are all turned in online and it's very efficient for checking grades and assignments."
College Sophomore,4,"Registering for classes will always be a hassle due to the competition for seats, but teachers always sign a waiver to add you anyways. Everything always runs smoothly and works out. I don't have anything to work around other than school, the rest revolves around that."
College Sophomore,4,I'm only a sophomore therefore I haven't experienced this department yet.
College Freshman,4,"I have not really looked into the post-grad stuff just because I am a freshman, but I have heard that it is pretty good."
College Freshman,4,We have opportunities to go and participate internships with people. We have employers come up sometimes and recruit people to come work or even  give us advice on what to do .
College Freshman,4,"The way the professor talk to you in class they want you to do very well. They clearly tell you want they want and how they want it , so you don't fail anything."
College Freshman,4,It's been a great experience here. YHC has become my home away from home. The professors have cared about my progress in class and they see me as who I am and not as a number.
College Freshman,4,Had a few things happen but it's been okay
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small, allowing for professors to really get to know their students and help them succeed. Because it's a small school, classes often fill up very quickly, making registration extremely stressful and uncertain; some classes are only offered for one time period a week, and it is difficult to fill my schedule with classes I need for my major. However, most classes are oriented as a conversation based style, so students are able to talk freely and in a more comfortable manner than if they had to raise their hands formally."
College Sophomore,4,"I love how the professors have an interest in who you are as a person, not a number. Professors are often willing to drop everything to help students, and if not they're willing to work around their schedules. Classes are challenging and professors do not allow for too much ""wiggle room,"" making students respect them."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as transfer credits, I took AP classes in high school and anything I made over a 4 on the exam transferred over. Making class schedules is hard as a freshman and sophmore because everyone else registers before you but you still get into classes that you need to graduate."
College Sophomore,4,With any college there are going to be a few professors that aren't that great but overall all of the professors are super friendly and are willing to help. They are very educated in their field of study and know how to get really big concepts into smaller ones that are easier to understand. There are a lot of different courses at YHC and it's easy to change majors or minors to find something that fits you best. Classes are usually fairly small; my current spanish class has 4 students in it but then I also have a class that has about 30 students in it. The general education tends to have more students in it but as you get further along in your major the class sizes get smaller.
College Freshman,4,I have not had any experiences with online programs.
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are small and my professors have designated office hours. They are literally waiting for students to come visit them. They respond readily to emails, and are very welcoming of drop-in visits. Also, if their office hours are during a students' classes then they will work with the student, which is awesome!"
College Freshman,4,"I am not a declared psychology major yet. However, with my VAST arsenal of one full semester of classes to pull from I must say that young harris expects a lot from their students. Every class seems to have a decently heavy workload (this feels like the general consensus, but it may not be fully true)."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school. I am still figuring things out, and I still have a lot to learn about Young Harris. I am in the process of soaking up all their is to know and love about this school, but I will have to brag on them by noting that the school really has made my transition to college almost seamless. Welcome week was a pivotal time in my life. I had to make friends, so I did, and I am very pleased that I was pushed to establish relationships quickly!"
College Sophomore,4,There are many classes that work around your schedule. The problem I have found as a freshman you pick classes last so you may need a class that is full so you have to take it at a time you wouldn't normally. I do feel that everyone works with you. Being that circus a small school everyone knows your name.
College Sophomore,4,The online courses are very flexible. I love that I can stay in my PJs. It is very relaxed. The down side is you can always pickup extra pointers in class when questions are asked and that is missed. The professors always keep you on course but it's usually in emails. So if someone has to have the one on one to get the best learning experience then these classes are not for you.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the campus is so small, there is not much hassle when it comes to the academic flexibility. However, I did take one college course in highschool and it never transferred over."
College Sophomore,4,I love all of the teachers and the class sizes here are perfect! I do believe that there should be an even better variety of classes. I am not going to be able to take any classes for my minor (dance) this upcoming semester because of the small variety of classes and the faults with the rest of my schedule.
College Sophomore,4,"Once again, the academic experience at YHC has been one of my favorites. Almost all of the teachers I have had so far have been extremely helpful and they are all very personable which helps me out a lot since I have ADD."
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love Young Harris College! Especially all of the friends I have made and the overall academic experience. I am majoring in psychology and every class I have taken so far has been great!
College Freshman,4,"YHC does the best it can to give its students the best opportunities they can, so that their students will be prepared for the real world."
College Freshman,4,The area is beautiful and the classes are mostly small so they can be more discussion based.
College Freshman,4,I have not had to worry about transferring any credits yet. So I do not know how easy or difficult that process is.
College Freshman,4,I love all of the opportunities I have been given with my major.
College Freshman,4,"I truly love the student body here at Young Harris. Everyone that I am around is always extremely friendly and helpful. There are many opportunities to get involved, and the campus is stunning."
College Freshman,4,"All of my academic teachers have been willing to work with me, and are very flexible with my busy schedule and their own. Registration is simple and easy. There are tutoring sessions offered for all subjects throughout the week and people are here to help."
College Freshman,4,"In this 2014-2015 school year we have gotten a new Student Center built on our campus. It includes a dining hall, Chic-fil-a, Starbucks and a 3 story library all in the same building. We have a very well equipped gym with a track around it and also a basketball court. And of course work out machinery."
College Freshman,4,"I love the friends I've made. I love the theatre program. The campus is beautiful, I just wish there was more to do off campus."
College Freshman,4,"The student body is very diverse, you can find people of all types to hang out with. Very easy to make friends which was very difficult for me in middle and high school."
College Freshman,4,My experience in my classes and with my professors has been very good.
College Freshman,4,My classes are very flexible and my overall experience has been very good.
College Freshman,4,The classes I am required to take for my major very much pertain to my major and are not just random. The classes I feel are preparing me for the job I intend to pursue when I receive my degree.
College Freshman,4,There are numerous opportunities to achieve success in academics.
College Junior,4,"There are many clubs, organization, career groups, and societies that students can join."
Senior,2,"The campus is beautiful, but it seems that all of our money goes to the gardeners or the abyss. The food is not cooked well, with very little variety, budget cuts got rid of some of the best professors on campus because they were overly qualified and got laid too much, our money goes to nothing beneficial to the students, but some of the faculty and staff are the sweetest, smartest, and most pationate people you will ever meet, as long as they don't get paid off soon..."
College Sophomore,2,I'm frustrated with the lack of interest the advisors seem to have as well as their unwillingness to spend the time to offer me help when I specifically ask for it.
College Freshman,2,"It is so hard to get flexible classes, so few are offered and it is hard to get the classes needed for your major and there are often times up to four hour gaps in between class times"
College Freshman,2,"I have not taken an online course here, because it is way more expensive than something I can take back home and pay a lot less for."
College Freshman,2,Young Harris College is an undergraduate school and does not offer any post grad opportunities.
College Junior,2,"I understand private schools are expensive, but I feel as though student's do not get what they pay for. The dorms are far too expensive to live in. The school needs to offer an option for off campus living for any student. The dining hall and food are mediocre. Tuition seems to rise every year which isn't fair to any student. They need to have the tuition locked in at the same price for each class that comes in."
College Sophomore,1,no online classes during the schoolyear which is a bummer
College Senior,1,"School's Network and Computer Labs Are Very Poor – YHC's Network is wireless only for access from residence halls and the wireless signal is barely detectable from almost any point on campus. It is very slow. There are only about 5 computer labs and only 2 are accessible after 10pm and on weekends. Basically, EPIC FAIL!"
College Sophomore,1,"Library Is Great, but Old & Wireless Internet SUCKS! Our library facility is great with its computers, electronic books and catalogs, but the books are only on selected topics. Most good for the majors offered there. A lot of religion, theater, and outdoor books; which are the most popular majors at this school. Otherwise if there is not a book you can find there there is another one down the street that trades books with the college constantly so what you need is probably there. 
Wireless internet is the most hard to come by here on campus. The location is in the mountains and most of the dorms except for the two newer ones, are all cinder block. So those two factors make the signal very weak. Ethernet is offered in all the dorms though, and the 24-hour study room has internet access as well as the student center seeing how both locations are so close to the I.T. building where the wireless signal is coming from. Also you can get access on the lawn and outside. Internet access in the dinning hall and in classrooms are spotty as well as the lobbies of most dorms. Also the tower goes down because of the winds up there, just tell your professor or go to the library and they will understand. EVERYONE HATES THE WIRELESS up here."
College Sophomore,1,"great teachers and great scenery... that's it – the good reviews posted on this site were written by students bribed with trivial prizes. also when i posted a review that was critical of the school it was removed. the scenery is great, teachers are awesome. but you have to live on campus and they treat you like you're 12. if you party or drink they WILL try to harass you. when you go to this school you are just another fish in a barrel for the school, school cops, and bordering county cops to target. and they love to take your money. if you decide to go there buy plenty of susan rogers repellant and go ahead and have a lawyer on retainer... you'll need it. get your fourth amendment rights ready to get violated. "

"
College Senior,1,Campus Activities – Campus activities are awful here. They are not age appropriate and lack creativity. There are also very few events to attend throughout the year.

Senior,5,The school employees and administration  will work with you to help you complete your experience with higher education.
Senior,5,The school is wonderful and the staff professor are excellent. I like that you can talk with your professor or email to get a quick response to all of your needs.
Junior,5,I like the teachers they are their when you need them. If I have a problem my advisor will help me solve my problem.
Sophomore,5,Southern University is an amazing school. The teachers are full of inspiration and hope for us students. The fatality treat us like family and are always honest with us about how we are doing in school. The administrators take the time out their busy schedules to accommodate us students in our time of need and make sure we are at the top of our game the whole school semester.
Senior,5,"Best university ever and very known in the community.  Extremely productive classroom experience and motivating.



The dynamic of the college is impeccable amongst all others in the state. Internationally known and accredited."
Freshman,5,What I like about Southern University at New Orleans is that the administration is very helpful; they welcome you with open arms. The teachers are willing to help you if your confused on the lesson. The environment at Southern University at New Orleans is safe.
Freshman,5,Freshman year was pretty great . I feel like my high school has prepared me for this college. What I like the most about this college is when I walk in I immediately get help with anything . I love the Athletics program and all the athletics directors and staff .
Junior,5,"The one thing I like the most is how my adviser we always take the time out his busy schedule and help me prepare my schedule for each semester and also giving me insight on why he choose the profession he is in and which direction I should take with a psychology degree. The only thing I dislike the reconstruction that is going on right now, but other then that I love it!"
Junior,5,Everyone was so helpful and understanding! They made me feel wanted and accepted there! The encouraged me to go higher.
Freshman,5,I believe that Southern University at New Orleans is one of the greatest things to ever happen to me.  It has given me the opportunity to gain a wealth of experience as well as great education.
Senior,5,"The advisors are very helpful and want to see you succeed. The TRIO Program is awesome! As an older student, my experience is different from the younger students. However, I've had a good experience."
Freshman,5,"I love the classes. Each class is about 30-40 people and it makes it more one on one with the professor. Housing is really nice, I meet new people everyday. I would like suno to put up bigger signs or add more signs on campus, I always get lost looking for the brown building, but the brown building is really the old science building."
Freshman,5,There is always something for you to do there. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help you. All the teacher want to see you suceed. There's nothing better than that. Also a lot of scholarship opportunities.
Sophomore,5,My overall experience has been awesome. I love how the professors really care about the course they are teaching. They also offer extra help and one on one with students that need help. The only thing i would like to change is that everyone who does not live on campus has to purchase $125 in cafe cash. It is not beneficial to someone who takes online classes or off campus classes.
College Sophomore,5,Suno is the working person University
College Junior,5,A lot of alumni come back and work there to us students like my self succeed just like they did
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is watched by police, and teachers. Drugs are not used or allowed in this campus. School is very strict about alcohol, and drugs. "
College Sophomore,5,"The computer labs is available mostly all day long. I am able to print out my work, do work, and even ask questions if I have some. People at the computer rooms are very nice, and friendly. I always like to spend my time by doing my work at the computer rooms."
College Sophomore,5,"Local weather is fine to me. I like windy, and cold. You never know what weather is going to be today or tomorrow, or any other day. "
College Sophomore,5,"The Social Work Department is AMAZING. Dr. Favre, our Dean, is accessible and our advisers are the same. We have a strong network and we are family!!"
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone is unique in their own way, and I love it. More often than not, you can attend a fashion show in the Knight's Castle (gym). Greek life is extremely popular and for the most part, everyone gets along."
College Junior,5,"There are quite a few good off campus dining places, for those who don't have transportation there is a bus stop in the area."
College Junior,5,I haven't seen or heard about any abuse of drugs nor alcohol.
College Junior,5,I love the fact that security be out at night to protect those students who have night classes. They have sports for both sexes. And they also have a grocery store near the campus.
College Senior,5,"Along with police present, there are active students involved in making the school."
College Junior,5,Financial aid has been very useful to me as a student.
College Freshman,5,"every department at southern of the athletics teams are very good i am  one of the royal jewel dancers i support and encourage joining all day they work hard, the coaches are very good and firm trainers.. that's why they are the best"
College Freshman,5,at southern there is a enormous amount of foreign students but everyone is opening and accepting.
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy being a management major at the college of business at SUNO. We have a brand new building with an awesome dean of students.
College Sophomore,5,"Some parties are on campus and some are at local night clubs, but the ones that are on campus are help at the apartments on campus and are over a 1AM. Theres no drinking or smoking and security is heavy."
College Sophomore,5,I never feel unsafe on campus because we have so many officers on foot and in vehicles riding around both sides of the campus. They are just like NOPD and they dont dont allow smoking weed or drinking anywhere on campus and especially in the dorms.
College Junior,5,I came to SUNO because it has a good mathematics program which is good for me to transfer for engineering.
College Junior,5,They help minorities with scholarships and even other students.
College Senior,5,Management Information Systems – The world of today uses technology for just about everything.
College Senior,5,"Off campus dining is affordable,  you have various restaurants to chose from."
College Senior,5,"Festival City – New Orleans is known worldwide for its many festivals and events. All year long festivals filled with food, music, and fun are held across the city. Many tourists come for Mardi Gras, the Essence Festival, the Jazz Fest, and many others. There isn't a month that goes by in which a festival is not held in New Orleans. New Orleans also has great historical sites, like the World War II Museum, the African American arts Museum, which is located on an actual plantation, and Congo Square, a place where slaves would go to play music and dance in their free time. New Orleans, or the Big Easy, is filled with fun-loving people living life,and taking it easy. People enjoy the many beautiful parks all around the city. There is so much to do in New Orleans, it is easy to fall in love."
College Sophomore,5,"Encouraging Professors, New Facilities, Bright Future Ahead! My major is the absoloute best! Within my college, which is in the newest building on campus (under 6 months old) everyone holds either an MBA or a PhD. There are many international professors who often share their years of insight and encourage us to pursue any opportunites that their associates may have for college students. 
My major consists of a traditional business curriculum, the addition of goverment classes and a mandatory internship. My dean is a master at attaining internships for his students. From the VA Hospital, to the Army Corps of engineers, and even the FBI (who happens to have a branch right next to my school) students in this field have many opportunities ahead of them."
College Sophomore,5,"New Orleans Baby – its new orleans baby,,the whole city is an attraction"
College Junior,5,"From Disaster to Possibilities – Southern University at new Orleans suffered great loss due to hurricane Katrina, but this did not dampen the determination of its students and staff. they all returned in full force and even though all the facilities are not fully running students are pulling through as determined as ever. We are because SUNO is!"
Junior,4,I took must of my classes online and when a problem came the teachers would get the problem resolve quickly or give us extra time on assignments.
Junior,4,"SUNO overall is a great institution. They have come a long way, but have even further to go.
It need to start with a strong team of Administrators."
Freshman,4,I love that SUNO has faculty that shows love toward students but the teachers for suno or not the same.
Senior,4,My overall experience was great I love my professors and there is a great criminal justice program that I have loved to be apart of it. The administration is horrible they are never on the same page other than that SUNO is a great school.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very helpful. They definitely want you to succeed. The one thing I would change would be the financial aid process. They can be more helpful and return your calls and emails in a timely manner. Overall, it's a great school in a great city."
Sophomore,4,"My experience here at Southern University has actually been really good. It's all about what you make of it. The ball is in your hands. Help is always available, and im glad to be here in the mist of them improving. Some days may be rough but overall it's a great University to attend. I am a work study student in the financial aid office so I feel more like family even though I felt like that when I first came here. Somethings I would like to see a change is more students attending this school !"
Sophomore,4,"If you want a true HBCU experience, SUNO is the place for you! We’re a small campus community and it is easy to contact your teachers and advisors. Everyone you come into contact with will want to see you win!"
Senior,4,"My Experience here had its up and downs just as any other institution.There are multiple programs and funding that would help throughout the years you are there such as Student Support Services, Upwardbound, and more. The downs are the process in which it took for the recovery process of buildings and so that the students are aware of the funding but overall a great college."
Sophomore,4,"I love my SUNO. When you get to know the staff, you feel like it’s a family. I can’t wait to see the new buildings open up in the upcoming semesters!"
Senior,4,"The atmosphere is great!  The administrators are more like family. The institution is more concerned with you understanding the information in which you are being taught. The classes are small, which makes each class more engaging and personal. Instructors are available during their office hours to assist you if need be. The instructors are SUPER helpful. As long as you put forth effort as a student you will do well at the institution. I recommend anyone going to this university or any others to stay at one institution all four years. They say transferring an Associate's degree is easy, but it's not. Staying at one institution will help the student become molded with the proper mindset of one institution. I enjoy the people and am excited about my future upon graduation from SUNO! "
College Junior,4,I have encountered some great professors at this university. I have also learn a lot in the courses I have taken. I just wish they were more courses offered during the semesters. The class styles are mainly small it's rare you have a large class. The style of the class are great m.
College Senior,4,Police always around safety isn't an issue here
College Junior,4,Police emergency phones are set up almost over the entire campus. Push the button and the police is there
College Junior,4,Diverse teachers from all over the world
College Sophomore,4,I love the housing. This is the only school I know of that gives you a queen size bed if you live alone.
College Freshman,4,"Basketball and Track are the dominate sports for the school. The team works excellent together, the school shows great school spirit."
College Junior,4,Campus police are always on campus
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy my time while I am in my college campus. I stay in two bedroom apartment with my teammate, each of us have separate bathroom. Also, outside park is very beautiful. We have chairs where we can sit and enjoy the view of the lake. Many of my peers like to be outside to socialize and share our experience."
College Senior,4,Im not sure of the living aspect but I hear its a nice place to stay and it's reasonable.
College Senior,4,Our internships are the best part of the curriculum because we get to apply what we leant to the field.
College Senior,4,There is really no problem with sexual assault in campus. The problem is the lack of light around the campus at night.
College Sophomore,4,the food at southern university is not the best but definitely not the worst I've had
College Junior,4,Public bus transport ion runs right in front of the school. 
College Junior,4,I did not have any difficulties getting into my program. 
College Junior,4,The computers at SUNO are in great condition.  Availability of this computers and computer labs are above average.  
College Junior,4,The bus runs right in front the school.
College Senior,4,I think overall the girls and guys are down to earth. They are very friendly and hardworking. The guys that play sports are very great at it. The girls love to laugh and have a good time. The  girls are laid back with their work . They take school class with a breeze. They guys work a little hard in there classes then the females. The guys and girls love to dress nice. Most student come looking very professional. There is not a lot of thing to do at all on campus. Our student life building was destroyed from hurricane Katrina. So there is limited things to  and places   to hangout on campus. The guys and girl get along very will at school.
College Senior,4,There are not many clubs near the campus so the night life is good.
College Freshman,4,"This campus is a typical HBCU.  I attend night class, so I am unsure of what the actual population looks like.  My assumption however is that the racial makeup for the student population is 99% Africian American."
College Junior,4,"I give Southern University at New Orleans an A when it comes down to student academics. Southern is very strict about students dooing their best to maintain decent GPA's. If students fail to maintain this requirement they are put on probation, suspened, and/or lose their financial aid. However, I can not grade the campus strictness on student social lives because you cannot always control peoples actions."
College Junior,4,I give security an A because sometimes students tend to get to get out of control at times.  Security can not always be there to prevent these problems.
College Freshman,4,ive never really felt unsafe but people around say things life about break ins and fights things of that nature.. but i personally want EVERYONE to feel safe
College Junior,4,They professors teach very well and i am always confident to take tests after a lecture.
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on campus because i know even if i get sick, i can always be taken care of."
College Sophomore,4,Very Good – The computers are very fast. The labs are never crowded you can always walk in and get on a computer.
College Senior,4,"City Bus and School Shuttle – Southern University has its very own shuttle that transports students to various locations around the campus. Students find it to be very convenient, as trekking the area of the campus on foot can be exhausting. Also, attaining public transportation from the campus couldn't be more simple. There is a bus route that has our school as one of its main stop points, and it frequently passes by."
College Senior,4,"Off-campus dining is great around the area. There are many places to choose from. I know some of them give student discounts. The best place to check out in my opinion, is Popeyes."
College Senior,4,Parking Permits are available but not totally necessary. There is plenty available street parking but if you want to park on campus and don't want to be ticketed or booted then you should invest in the permit.
College Senior,4,Drug Usage – Those who partake in substance use are around but not out in the open. You have to know who to talk to and for what. Drinking occurs but there aren't people walking around wasted out of their mind.
College Senior,4,"I am currently in a social work program that host monthly meeting concerning outreach activities inreference to feeding the homeless, handing out thanksgiving basket, and issuing school supplies."
Freshman,2,At Southern University of New Orleans they need to get better teachers who care more about students.
Niche User,2,"I attended this college 2011-2012, i didn't really like it. It was very unorganized, and alot of the professors didn't teach. The on campus housing was over priced,i was moved from dorm to dorm the whole semester because of pest controll issues. It just seem liked everything was thrown together. The only thing i enjoy was the extracurricular activities, you know, the fun stuff. Thats the only things they seemed to have been organized."
College Junior,2,I rarely see campus police visible. If something would happened or take place they are not around to help.
College Junior,2,"No Greek housing is available to Greek students.

Their is so social empowerment because it is hard to find a Greek on campus. I'm looking to pledge and I don't know how to go about it because I never encounter any Greek students. I don't even know how to begin or have anyone to speak with on how to go about on how to pledging to the sorority I'm looking forward to pledging with in the future."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't seen any alumni networks associated with the school or any employers recruiting on campus
College Freshman,2,The dorms are by the lake so there is no off campus housing. it's either you live at home or on campus.
College Freshman,2,Off campus dinning is basically like your going to a fast food place. if its not on campus than u won't get a discount and things like that. It's only fast food places around the campus.
College Freshman,2,"I never went to any parties, but from what i've heard they are not cool at all."
College Junior,2,Most of the scholarship are not open to international students
College Junior,2,"I am personally not satisfied with my meal plan. I am an college athlete on full scholarship. Our meal plan consist of two meals a day. One is at 11pm and other at 5pm. We are only available to spend $8 per meal, which I consider as a low for one athlete. Also, we are limited on only hot or cold meals, we can have for example yogurt and chicken at the same time. One more thing I am not satisfied with is the almost every day we are eating the same food."
College Senior,2,Because of a natural disaster Hurricane Katrina the school is still trying to rebuild its self.
College Junior,2,"The safety level on campus can be a lot better. Anyone can enter our apartments without question of who they are or why they are there. I haven't heard much about crime being on campus, but crime in the living quarters is often frequent. I feel pretty safe on campus, but as far as my living quarters is concerned,"
College Junior,2,"Although at the moment it's pretty bad,things are starting to look up. They are re-building, trying to create a very student friendly campus. In the next few years it should make a great comeback for universities in this area."
College Junior,2,No type of party life on campus for the drug alcohol to be noticed. 
College Junior,2,Dining options near my school is very slim to none.  
College Junior,2,"Ever since hurricane Katrina, SUNO housing dorms have been a wreck.  No current updates to the dorms have been made since 2006. The lighting that leads to the dorms from the classrooms, are very poor, dark, and unsafe for students walking to and from class at night. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is almost no night life at the school. Yes, people get together, do something fun, but not all of the people who want to join can join. You actually have to own a car or drive the bus to enjoy the nightlife."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only campus dining is the cafeteria. It usually have the typical average meals such as: pizza, hamburgers, hotdogs, and a salad bar. There are always other options but the food isn't the best."
Recent Alumnus,2,"In the event it rains too hard, there is major flooding in the area. It can get difficult trying to walk to class with puddles of water everywhere. Even if a person opt to drive there is still a great distance to travel."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of our buildings are being renovated, but there's hope. Our school isn't all that bad; however, we could use improvement. The library is pretty small, but we're talking expansion and the student hangouts are basic."
Sophomore,1,"I was in the computer information systems program at SUNO but will immediately be transferring to SUBR. I love my HBCU! BUT the professor over the computer information systems program at SUNO is awful. He is rude, condescending, and inappropriately dismissive to students. His behavior towards us is the reason why the program is barely afloat. Who wants to pay all this money to enroll in a program with someone so awful as the chair? His horrible attitude towards everyone around him will not keep me from loving my HBCU. Do a survey from the students enrolled in the program and you'll see. He needs to resign otherwise the retention in that program will continue to dwindle as it already is. I STILL love my HBCU!"
Junior,1,"Absolutely the worst experience I’ve had in education. The program chair/graduate advisor for the CISP is relentlessly rude, condescending, and dismissive to many students. The retention rate continues to dwindle in that program because of his blatant demotivation. Students are miserable and it is because of his poor leadership of the CIS Program along with his constant disregard for students around him."
College Senior,1,"Lack of communication, they take things personally to me and hold grudges. I'm a student but we're all adults, be a teacher, leader and professional and do your job so I can do mine affectivly"
College Senior,1,This is by far the worst experience I have ever had dealing with adults. If it wasn't for self motivation I would have gave up a long time ago
College Senior,1,"Nothing to say, there trash"
College Junior,1,the food is never fresh
College Junior,1,The volleyball and basketball court is old and damaged. The gym is extremely small with not enough equipments. The school also needs a track
College Junior,1,They cook the same thing every week and it's awful majority of the time
College Junior,1,I like to stay inside
College Sophomore,1,in new Orleans it goes from beaming hot sun to a storm in an instant
College Junior,1,Parties? The campus life or unity of student life is very poor.  
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any Greek students at my school
College Sophomore,1,"Its mostly rainy or extremely hot. Due to the lack of renovation, the campus is still spaced out. The shuttle schedule is not set in stone, and parking is limited, so many times we're forced to take long walks in these harsh conditions."
College Senior,1,The van service run anytime. It does not have a set schedule to run. It will have you late going to class. The driver on the bus have music loud. the driver is not friendly at all. Student do better walking to class then riding the van service at school.
College Senior,1,The financial aid process aid horrible. They are letting students take out the max loan when they don't need it and need explaining to them that is is debt and you will have to pay it back with interest. I myself had a problem with the financial process. I was checking on my financial aid for three months and when I finally went down there a week before school they told me I had to pay. I received no letter or anything. I also have a friend who they gave financial aid too ( fund check and all) and then took it back.
College Senior,1,"They have bad attitudes, and short patience towards the student body.  You have to hound them for information, and in the process they become very short with you.  Overall not very helpful."
College Senior,1,"There aren't many labs, and the two or three that exist are hidden.  You have to know someone who has been to one to know about them or hear someone talking about them in conversation to find where they are. I just found the second of three this semester, after being here a year."
College Junior,1,"There was not alot of parking on the campus and the took more away to put up two new buildings, not sure if they are planning on making more parking available."

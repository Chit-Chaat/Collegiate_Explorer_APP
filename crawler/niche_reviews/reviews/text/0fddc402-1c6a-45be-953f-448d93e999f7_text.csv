Senior,5,"I have taken many online classes throughout my four years at LTU. I have learned that Professors are quite clear with what their requirements are for classes. They usually post most of the important grades, or homework assignment work on Canvas and then send announcements for the class throughout emails on google. I have learned so much about how the online classes are run and am glad that the professors are willing to help out in anyway that they can. Online classes typically are much harder than in-person classes due to the lack of engagement outside of class. There tends to be t a lot of use of technology due to the fact that everything is due online. The online classes that I took during Covid-19 have really challenged recently and have taught me how to bee the master of technology. I am quite glad that I have had the opportunity to take online classes during my college academic experience. The way that LTU has taught Online classes is truly exemplary."
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my college experience it has been filled with lots of learning and making great friends while pursuing my professional career. I have learned that it takes a lot perserverance to continue through College and it has taught me that no matter how hard it is it can always get better. I have enjoyed the LTU campus and community so much during my 4 years there. There have been many amazing students and professors that have helped me to become a more responsible and independent person. This has impacted me in the sense that I have pushed myself to become the person that I was truly meant to be. I have made many friends while studying, relaxing, and taking classes with others on campus and it has really given me a much more humble attitude on life. I have learned how to ask for help whenever I am doubting myself or my abilities and to figure it out sooner. Further, asking for help has allowed me to get to know students and professors better. I am blessed to be at LTU."
Freshman,5,Lawerence Technological University is a wonderful college to attend. The professor actually work in the field that they teach. They care for us and will do whatever it takes to see us succeed. There are plenty of tutoring opportunities. The college is diversity and everyone is so nice to each other. It is as if everyone is a big family and you will feel at home.
Niche User,5,I loved the environment of Lawrence tech while I was there to see for a moment and looked to be a terrific college to jumpstart a career
Niche User,5,"When I visited the campus during my senior year of high school, it was an amazing place to be with a small campus having it very easy place to feel like home."
Freshman,5,I was there for campus connections for about a week. It was awesome! I got to learn more about the campus and the student body as well. Amazing students and dorms. Though it was really cold. But other than that everything was great.
Niche User,5,It was a great college for engineering. I would change nothing about it. It is a great college for anyone who wants to go into an engineering  program.
Freshman,5,"What a place! The comfort and enjoyment I have attending this college is beyond measurable. One thing I enjoy the most about Lawrence Tech is how nice everyone is. If I'm lost or need assistance with anything, I always find someone to help. The proffesors are the best and the way they teach helps us students understand the material causing us to have little to no stress. The small class sizes gives us more of an opportunity to seek help from the proffesor without having to stay after school and talk to them during office hours. There isn't anywhere else I'd go and that just tells you how much I enjoy in here! I hope new students in the future experience the same  positive outlooks Ive had here at Lawrence Tech!"
Freshman,5,"LTU is more than just a university. I knew I made the right decision coming to Lawrence Tech when everyone around me wanted the same things. We have smaller class sizes, more hands-on experience, and better connection with our faculty. The one-on-one attention is great for learning. Also theory and practice are huge here. I love it!"
Junior,5,Excellent professors and advisors. Everyone seems dedicated to helping students succeed. Rigorous and challenging curriculum. Would like to see more options for dining on campus.

Freshman,5,"Great professors all around! Academics are well planned out and campus is very enjoyable.

Moreover, the campus id also getting some renovations improving the look and feel of being at uni."
Sophomore,5,Great school if youâ€™re looking for small class sizes and a community of students who are driven and passionate about their education.
Freshman,5,Everyone is very kind and connected. I can easily talk to other students and professors with out any fright. The campus is beautiful and keeps expanding. I also was able to pretty much jump right into my degree which was amazing.
Graduate Student,5,I love the Master of Architecture 3+ Program. The professors I've has so far has been very knowledge and easy to work with.
Senior,5,Lawrence tech. is a small niche school that has the ability to make a personal connection with each student. By doing this you get a more immersive education and create life long connections that are helpful to the future.
Sophomore,5,Lawrence Technological University is a great school with small classes sizes. With smaller class sizes you are able to interact with the class and professors a lot easier. The professors are caring and want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,"the thing i like about lawrence technological university it is the amazing student and teacher the campus look great, dorms are good the academics."
Junior,5,Wonderful staff. Great help from professors during and after hours.  There is a great student/staff ratio as well. There is plenty of time for the professor to get around to your questions whether its in the classroom or in the office.
Junior,5,"Lawrence Tech is the best school I have ever been a part of! The tuition is a little pricey but the experience and the environment make it all worth it. When I go to Lawrence Tech I do not feel like I am going to school, I feel like I am going to a learning environment where everybody wants everybody to succeed! The culture is amazing and the faculty is like family. I would recomend Lawrence Technological University to any potential engineering or architecture student!"
Freshman,5,"Lawrence Technological University is a small school with a big impact. The students and teachers alike can be described as simply: driven. The students are driven to work hard and achieve their careers. The teachers are driven to give students the best higher education that they can provide. With the smaller campus, students also find it easier to feel at home because they are not lost in the crowds of tens of thousands of students."
Freshman,5,"Lawrence tech is very diverse and is all about research. The professors are very helpful and care for the students. They are awesome about tutoring with subjects you may need help on. The campus life is warm and welcoming, this school makes you think, and think about things outside the box."
Senior,5,"It has been a great experience at LTU because it is a small, close community.  The classes are small and it is easier to meet other students."
Freshman,5,"My experience was excellent and fun, they have free tutoring for every student and are expanding there athletics, clubs, and academic programs.  They need a pool and a hot tubs though."
Niche User,5,"As an incoming Freshman my tour was amazing! The academics and student to teacher ratio were great; 12:1. They are building new dorms which look amazing! The Athletics are growing Baseball is on it's second season and Football will start next year. They are building a new baseball stadium and athletic dorms also. All-in-all my experience touring, meeting with teachers and coaches exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to start my future here at LTU! Possible is EVERYTHING!"
Sophomore,5,"It was my first time experiencing college life last year, and I wasn't sure how I was going to fit in. Meeting new people was not my strong suit, but immediately I felt welcomed. It's so much diversity here, but everyone is treated like family. The professors and students really want to see you succeed. Their is never a moment of being on campus thats dull, or boring because theres always something going on. Rather it be Greek Week or a Stress release event. And although the cafeteria food can use some work, they make up for it by having an Einsteins Bagel shop right across from it. I love LTU and I highly recommend anyone to enroll here."
College Freshman,5,"Lawrence Tech is like no other school in the country. Everyone who attends LTU is driven, passionate, and determined to be the best they can be in their major. Team work is exceptional, and resources are endless. I could not have picked a better institution to further my education at."
College Freshman,5,"Its an awesome college, amazing campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Courses are appropriately challenging and demand critical thinking that benefits the student greatly. Professors want to see each student succeed and are willing to get any student to where they want to be. Some class formats may not jive well with some people, but if you are one who is able to adapt, most all classes are run very well."
College Junior,5,There are students from around the world with varying beliefs
College Freshman,5,This school has great diversity. Many students are from all over the world and local and we are all ever accepting of everyone.
College Freshman,5,There are many opportunists for jobs on campus and internships and they are very accessible.
College Freshman,5,Courses are hard but the professors are professional and knowledgeable. They know the courses they are teaching because they work in the field they teach.
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of student involvement and school spirit when it comes to sports
College Freshman,5,"I love the college I'm going to, even though the school is expensive and the workload is tough I wouldn't imagine wanting to do anything else."
College Junior,5,Campus security can always be seen on patrol. Security emails are sent if a issue arises.
College Junior,5,"Being in the Architecture/Architectural Engineering program at LTU is fantastic.  Working with real architects and engineers, hearing what they have to say about a field that they actually participate and work in is unparalleled.  The curriculum itself is set up to give students the most information, experience, and support that can be given.  Professors and advisors help with getting internships and becoming involved in the actual field one is going into."
College Junior,5,"The Greek life at LTU is very different from that of any other school.  The Greek life at LTU is very welcoming, open, and supportive, helping the community as a whole.  There is no hazing or discriminatory acceptances--in fact, the Greek life at LTU is very against hazing and such.  The Greek life at LTU is the way Greek life should be everywhere--a family that does great things for the whole of LTU, not just those in each fraternity."
College Junior,5,"Nothing is better than knowing that you are spending money learning in school, and then being able to use that knowledge at your workplace."
College Junior,5,I absolutely enjoy pursuing my Bachelors in Science in Electrical Engineering degree at LTU. Professors hold close relationships to students in their small lecture classes. Having a close relationship with Electrical Engineering professors give students the comfort in asking more questions and learning outside the box.
College Junior,5,"I currently have an internship at DTE Energy located in Downtown Detroit. I've been working here for almost three years now, and looking back I wouldn't of changed it to go anywhere else. I have learned so many different things DTE Energy. Not just about the our electrical distributional system but how to work so many people for such different backgrounds. LTU's motto is ""Leaders In the Making"", and I must say that working here definitely put my leadership skills to work. I am currently the first student lead taking over a full time employee's position, and lead over 26 students last summer. I appreciate everything I've learned and accomplished here, and hope that I will be hired in sometime in the future."
College Sophomore,5,The school offers a free shuttle that will take you to any building on campus during the week. On the weekends they will drive you anywhere you need to go between 10 mile and 12 mile roads. (Ex. Meijer or  local restaurants)
College Freshman,5,"The diversity is great, but the guy to girl ratio is a bit upsetting"
College Freshman,5,"Easy to get in, hard to stay in. Work intensive"
College Freshman,5,"The academics here are great, very strong minded people."
College Student,5,I think that all of the engineering and architectural majors and very challenging and provide you with the best way to gain the knowledge that you would need to succeed in a job environment.
College Freshman,5,"One of the best things about the school, Free laptop and software"
College Freshman,5,New and just starting out
College Freshman,5,Its an amazing school and the name says it all
College Freshman,5,All of my classes pertain to my major. It is a small program so you get to know the professors and your peers very well.
Recent Alumnus,5,North dorms are great and both dorms have a full kitchen so you dont have to make trips to the RFOC.
College Junior,5,The campus location is strategically safe and accessible to students. 
College Junior,5,Small campus accessible to everything.
College Sophomore,5,the buildings on the campus of lawrence tech are new and beautiful. I sometimes wonder though for being a technological school that some of the stuff designed in the our buildings are not really the most thought out design
College Sophomore,5,There aren't that many different programs at lawrence tech. 
College Sophomore,5,the architecture program at lawrence tech is very tough but amazing. the work load is a lot but it is all hands on and you learn so much. 
College Sophomore,5,typical internships are very good. we have job fairs at our school every couple months and the jobs come with insurance benefits and good pay. they also work around your school schedule.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with the architecture program. all of the professors are currently or once worked in the field and the ones that have their own firm help students out by getting them experience. 
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience was well thought out and fairly well done. There were certain bumps in the road, however. For example the professors did an amazing job of teaching concepts, but when it came to remotely helping students with their projects, they were all over the place. Some said this and some said that."
Sophomore,4,"It has a phenomenal education with great teachers and students; however, the cost of tuition alone is ridiculous especially when your paying for college on your own."
Freshman,4,My experience so far has been great. There is great communication between staff and students. Im looking forward to continue my great experience in the years to come.
Freshman,4,Ltu is an excellent college and in SOUTHFIELD were diversity with local and international students is very rich for both culture and learning.  Some more sport events to bon a spirit of college together may be reinforced
Junior,4,Lawrence tech is known to be a great school. It is very challenging and diverse. Some of the teachers do a very good job at making sure their students receive all the knowledge they pay for. The school promotes internships along with alot of hands on & group activities.
Senior,4,"I am a commuter student at LTU majoring in IT.  The campus is nothing special, although everything is fairly close to each other which makes it easy to traverse the area.  The professors and class size are the best part of LTU.  Having smaller class sizes and professors that care makes the learning experience hands-on and rewarding."
Sophomore,4,LTU offers a variety of programs in many areas some of which have concentrations to select from. The campus is very welcoming and well kept.
Freshman,4,I like that Lawrence tech has a small campus that makes it easy to navigate. The staff is very nice and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are engaged and interested in teaching, and all have experience working in their field. Job/internship fairs multiple times a year, invested in making sure you complete all requirements and are placed in a good position. Only allows companies that offer paid internships to come to campus."
Senior,4,"Love the small school feel, but definitely not too small! My professors have been great and our curriculum is very engaging. I feel prepared to enter my field once I graduate. I love having small class sizes, where professors can answer questions individually and have time to help each student if necessary. The upperclassmen dorms at LTU are apartment style, which is really nice. You get your own full kitchen and laundry room."
Niche User,4,"The professors are great, the food is outstanding, all of the buildings are connected so when it is snowing and cold outside you can just walk through the buildings, and the one thing that I would change would to have more athletic complexes on campus."
Senior,4,"Lawrence Tech is a great private school for engineering and architecture majors. The school is continually expanding which unfortunately means increase in cost, but the return on investment is outstanding. Campus life is good, not great. Expanding the university will likely lead to a better campus life however. The university is also adding more sports, including football in an effort to expand the campus. The professors are great and very caring as well as understanding. Class sizes are very small, and the professors will get to know you personally which can lead to job opportunities. Class sizes being small also allows you to easily make friends, as you will share many classes with those in your major."
Junior,4,"I have just transferred to Lawrence Technological University and will be starting my first semester this Fall (2018). I have yet to experience much other than orientation, registration and counseling, however I hear the small class sizes provide much more individual attention for students."
Sophomore,4,One thing about my university that resonates with me is the community. The friends you meet around campus could easily be in your math or masterpieces classes. The same thing goes for students in a similar major. Everyone can know everybody and this is a good opportunity to make friends that will be in your life for a long time.
Freshman,4,"Lawrence Tech is a wonderful university when it comes to academics. However, the food isn't good and the party life is pretty sad."
Senior,4,"I have been at Lawrence Tech for the past 5 years, It has its ups and downs but overall its a great school. The campus is small, so in turn, the classroom sizes are really manageable. Many professors are willing to work with you to help ensure your money is well spent."
Freshman,4,As a college I really enjoy the small community feeling this school offers. It is a very challenging school however. I am able to participate in a lot of student organizations as well.
Freshman,4,"Currently attending the school, although it has its rough edges, it is a beneficial school to be in. I am a mechanical engineering student, and the classes are geared for fast paced, strong minds. There are a ton of activities to further improve yourself and all the Teachers i have run across so far have been more than helpful. Their academics are hard to match else where, allowing one to retain the information presented in the school."
Junior,4,"Lawrence Technological University has excellent staff. They are always willing to help you achieve your goals. Since this school is a private university, the classes are small, and getting help is easier here than at other schools. This way students have a better chance of being successful in the class."
Sophomore,4,"Lawrence Tech is an interesting university. I believe it is a great university with huge potential but its been stumbling in the last year.  Im an architecture student and I can comfortably say that the program is great. As a matter a fact I believe the college of architecture and design is by far the best on campus. But lately the university has adopted a football team, im not against it but im against the choices it has made by doing so. Funding for our college is drastically down meanwhile many football players are riding on huge scholarships and minimum credits. For a small technological university, I doubt this is the correct path to take. Instead, I would encourage the university to focus more on academics and broadening its credibility further than the state of Michigan. Overall I think its a very good university but the way its been conducting business lately it makes it look like a cheap and underperforming colleg."
Sophomore,4,"Great courses that cater directly to the major. Kind of expensive, they force you to get a mediocre meal plan and live in the dorms if you are an athlete."
Graduate Student,4,"Great college experience for students in the field of Math, Science, and of Engineering the atmosphere is makes you feel like your on a NASA Space base the University is so down to earth..."
Freshman,4,"Good school, definitely worth the price. Campus is small, but the growth of the school is picking up speed."
Junior,4,"Love the small college.  This is an extremely hard college, but the school staff is very helpful.  They want you to succeed.  I have had 3 internships and home to have a great job at graduation.  I play hockey for the college and have made some great friends.  The only thing I wish they would change is more scholarship money for average kids like me."
Junior,4,"In my experience with LTU as a design major, I've met some great fellow designers and professors who actually care about their students' success. The food isn't amazing, but it is something. Being it's a small, private university, it's relatively boring if you're looking for a real party scene. But as far as academics are concerned, I give an A-."
College Freshman,4,"Career services worked on opening work study at the city library, a mile from campus. I am so glad they did because it is an awesome opportunity and I really enjoy the atmosphere the library provides."
College Sophomore,4,LTU provides many oppritunities to acquire a co-op or internship during your years at the school and finding a career after schooling is fairly easy. Many companies know the name and understand the work that goes into getting a degree from LTU.
College Sophomore,4,Campus safety is taken very seriously and not too many problems occur. Those that do are rectified in an appropriate manner.
College Sophomore,4,Lawrence Tech offers a great experience in a small class size environment that allows for  individual focus to take the main stage. I love how this type of environment allows me to have access to more resources than I would at a public university and allows me to learn and participate in more projects to get hands on experience. It also helps that the campus has access to a lot of high quality technology for use in my learning which I highly appreciate.
College Freshman,4,"There is great opportunity for internships, jobs and networking."
College Freshman,4,The classes are usually ran well with good and passionate professors.  There are also small class sizes so you get more attention when you need it so I enjoy that.
College Freshman,4,The campus is very safe and I have never experienced any issues with safety at all.
College Freshman,4,They just built a lot of new housing and there are rumors of expanding and building more!
College Freshman,4,Many professors are great and passionate but I've had a few that were terrible teachers and did not want to help the students at all.  At least they normally give curves.
College Junior,4,The classes needed will be important but hard work is needed
College Junior,4,There are always campus security cars patrolling no matter the time of day
College Junior,4,"The people are friendly and diverse, the teachers are knowledgeable, and  the campus is beautiful"
College Junior,4,The majority of students are involved in internships and are able to network early on
College Junior,4,"Dorms are big with bathroom, kitchen, and tv space within the main room"
College Junior,4,"There is a decent amount of school spirit, even though sports aren't very important to the majority of the student body"
College Junior,4,class sizes are 10-15 students. classes are difficult and very time demanding
College Sophomore,4,I believe that the past 4 years total there has only been one crime on campus. I do remember a couple of fights in housing last year but they were taken care of quickly and appropriately.
College Sophomore,4,"This school is right next to the big 3, if you're going for any engineering here, they can find you a job before you graduate."
College Junior,4,I always feel safe on campus
College Junior,4,There are many job/internship opportunities
College Junior,4,Professors interact with you and are experienced
College Junior,4,Dorms in north/south housing are apartment style
College Junior,4,Teams have improved a lot over the past few years
College Junior,4,Enjoy interaction that I have with studio profs
College Freshman,4,The curriculum at the school is very hard to get A's at.
College Freshman,4,"There was one sexual assault on campus this year and it was the first one anyone had heard of before. I feel safe on campus walking around at night, the buildings are close so you don't have much time to walk around alone. You always see campus safety around at any time of day."
College Freshman,4,"I can't really say much about living on campus since I am a commuter but I have seen the dorms and they are very nice and the social atmosphere is very friendly, its like a family."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a big part of the school, the promoted it for an entire week and lots of people get involved."
College Freshman,4,Great playing sports and all that. I love being on the bowling team. So far sports at campus is really cool. The school spirit is fantastic.
College Junior,4,I like that LTU give students laptops to use
College Junior,4,I do not play sports.
College Freshman,4,Professors are able to focus on each student. The studios have about 12 students and most have dedicated desks so you can set up with a specific area. It takes about 5 minutes to walk across campus and the gym is open until around midnight.
College Student,4,School is open to exploring new opportunities.
College Student,4,I like the small class sizes and having faculty available.
College Senior,4,The staff are good at enforcing policies. Most classes require a signed honor code.
College Junior,2,students receive no help for internships or jobs. If you are looking for jobs outside of this area there isn't much help you have to do it your self.
College Sophomore,2,"Some housing is good, then there's South housing, where I live. All that needs to be said is that this building was a ""remodeled"" old person's home."
College Sophomore,2,"Student involvement is horrendous, team performance is so-so, fan support is mostly parents, and school spirit is significantly worse than the high-school I went to."
College Freshman,2,nobody is pressured to do anything
College Senior,2,Very rarely does RFoC produce what I would call quality food. It's ridiculous that meal plans are mandatory when the dorms have full kitchens.
College Senior,2,South Housing is awful. The building is basically falling apart and desperately needs to be renovated. North housing is ok when the residents take care of the rooms.
College Freshman,2,There aren't a lot of healthy options besides salads. I personally don't like pizza and burgers every day. Everything is extremely processed. I hardly ever go to the rFoc.
College Junior,2,housing charges through the roof for every thing!!
College Junior,2,summer housing costs are terrible.
College Senior,2,"Campus crime is horrible! My first year in the dorms, there was a giant break in and everything was stolen my my dorm (not to mention dozens of others). Police did absolutely nothing and housing basically said it was my fault ugh. Watch out for those catalytic converter thieves that hit all the parking lots. Campus security is a total joke. I mean there are articles about the main guy Driving drunk and arresting a nonstudent, it's ridiculus. There is no health clinic like other colleges which is stupid, but at least Beaumont hospital is close by."
College Junior,2,I am not involved with greek life at my college but they seem to only hang around other greeks.
College Freshman,2,There is not much of a selection at the campus dining hall.
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of academic programs or student organizations.  I am a member of the theater group at Lawrence Tech and it isn't even viewed as an organization.
College Junior,2,"Security cars are there for show only. There are numerous times I've walked across a pedestrian walkway to where cars purposing zoom pass stop signs in order to beat me. With security parked right down the driveway, never have they stopped and warned cars of their dangerous driving habits... The only time I notice them is only at night anyways when you see there visible green and blue lights shining."
College Junior,2,"If you do not own a car or know anyone else that has a car, granted your only option left is the bus. Now if the bus's schedule do not match with your open schedule, then there is no option left for transportation."
College Junior,2,"The campus is a very diverse university. However there are not many convenience stores located near by within walking distances. The campus is located between two very busy highways, thus traffic occurs everyday. You are constantly stuck with the same food choice if you want to go anywhere within a 2 mile driving radius. Students with tight schedules are not able to find time to grab anything to eat between classes, therefore having to fall back on vending machine food."
College Junior,2,"There are apartment and house leasing posters listed on different bullentin boards throughout the school, but none that catches the eye. The campus is located in very isolated area, with not many or any convenience stores within walking distance. The school is located at the intersection of Northwestern Highway and The Lodge so walking anywhere would not be considered safe for students of any age."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of scholarships offered if you're just the average student
College Freshman,2,"Drinking is a big part, Everyone knows what to do and what not to do"
College Freshman,2,"It is a very small college, and many of the students here are introverts and anti-social. The greeks and the athletes have the best time."
Freshman,1,Professors donâ€™t know how to operate laptops. This school is a waste of money and time. Class time wasted. Youâ€™ll only like this school if youâ€™re a white person.
Alum,1,"Labs are old, equipment is outdated, services are bare minimum and student life barely exists at all. Campus is boring with just dorms, and south housing is in disastrous shape. For food you need to drive outside of campus because there is nothing in walking distance.

Some professors are okay but some are terrible. Many of the professors also teach the same courses at community colleges, where they charge you less than 10% of LTU tuition. Unbelievable! For such high tuition and fees it should have been much better quality of education. The ""core-curriculum"" courses that cost so much money are not relevant to anything, and you need to pay over $3000 for courses in poetry which is a complete waste of time."
College Junior,1,There are almost no parties at or around the college.
College Freshman,1,Theres a jimmy johns down the road
College Freshman,1,Well there's a jimmy johns down the street
College Freshman,1,Paying to be friends with dick heads
College Freshman,1,"the Rfoc is terrible. there are two stations that change everyday, but the rest is the same everyday. The quality of the food is gross. Einstein Bagel is pretty good but it gets tiring if you eat it every day."
College Sophomore,1,The off campus dining is very limited. the cheapest things we have is fast food and all the quality food places cost a little too much. there are student discounts but is only $1 or so. When it comes to variety well not so much. after a few weeks its get to be very old and repetitive. 
College Sophomore,1,We are in the middle of Southfield and don't really have and public transportation.
College Freshman,1,"When I first came to LTU, I could tolerate the food. It's all low-quality food that you can get by for the first few months. But after being here for 2 years, I can't eat it any more. The only thing I eat now are their hot dogs, because you can't really screw up hot dogs. Everything else is cheap, gross, and the same thing everyday. Go ahead and ask me about specific entrees and I will rip them apart."
College Sophomore,1,"There are close to no athletic programs at Lawrence Tech.  There are a few, but that only includes the very common sports such as track."
College Sophomore,1,"...You're Going to Need a Car. Being a Chicago native, where public transportation is actually good, the first time I tried Detroit public transport taught me something: I'm going to need to learn how to drive. Getting around with buses in Detroit is about as smooth as a cat's tongue against sandpaper.
tl;dr  - lrn2drive cuz Detroit buses suck"
College Freshman,1,"To those who aim for this school...you better know how to drive. Everything is within driving distance, emphasis on DRIVING. And when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. If you so much as need to buy a case of Twinkies for whatever reason, walking will get you NOWHERE to a store. You get a C...which is for cookie.

Then there's the students. Yeah, you're better off figuring that one out on your own. I don't really associate much outside of my circle. So no effect on the final grade.

Report card: C, indifferent symbol. Final grade: F-, on the grounds of extreme bias because I can't drive/lack a car so I certainly can't give a deserving grade of what's around because I DON'T KNOW."

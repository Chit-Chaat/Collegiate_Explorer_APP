Freshman,5,I like that they still keep us engaged virtually and there are still opportunities for extra help if need be.
Freshman,5,I like the welcoming community and I like the amount of leadership opportunities that they have. I also like that they enjoy helping the community and that they care a lot about each and every student.
Junior,5,Online learning was great at Daemen College especially now during this pandemic. The professors did a great job adjusting into the new circumstances and the students well if I say for myself continued to learn at a high level.
Junior,5,"I love Daemen because it felt like a new beginning it felt like my new home. One thing I would tell a prospective student is to always stay confident and to not be afraid to adjust to new things. Just be yourself because Daemen will always except you for who you are.
    I have many favorite professors however I would have to say Professors Niland, Roland, and Flint. These inspiring women are my favorite professors because they’ve given me so much advice not just for school but also in life. They have made the process to adjusting to college way easier.
    My most memorable moment at Daemen College getting on deans list 2 straight semesters. Daemen College has matured me a lot I’ve learned about the business perspective in life as well as the living perspective. I’ve grown into a young man being here at Daemen College."
Senior,5,The classes that I took online all went well! The professors are still able to meet if you need to on campus and they have all been fair and equally good learning experiences you just have to stay focused like with any class and make sure not to get behind.
Works Here,5,"Nice sized campus that allows you to run into a new face everyday but can still not get overwhelmed with mass amounts of students. Good student to teacher ratios to get the opportunity to connect more with your professor, etc."
Senior,5,"Daemen's diverse atmosphere and focus on a rigorous, yet doable curriculum, allows for students of all majors and walks of life to find their niche. I had the most positive experiences and career opportunities that I wouldn't have necessarily had without them. The smaller class sizes provided more one on one instruction and the array of clubs and activities made for an inclusive atmosphere. I am a proud Wildcat and look forward to hopefully teaching there someday."
Junior,5,Daemen College is a very small campus and a great community to be involved in. The professors all know you by name and the class sizes are 20-30 students.
Sophomore,5,I am only an upcoming sophmore but I love the community at the school. The faculty is also very considerate. It is very easy to talk to your professors about some problems you're having and get it worked out.
Niche User,5,"This campus is super inviting and makes you feel right at home! Everyone there is super friendly, and has an open hands and heart feeling. The campus overall is super inviting as well. Overall, I cannot wait to finally be part of this family in the fall."
Sophomore,5,"I am so glad that I chose Daemen College for my undergraduate studies. The small campus and class sizes are perfect for trying to make friends and strong connections. The faculty and staff are beyond kind, and they truly want to see you succeed in life. Great recommendation letters can be written from the professors at the school. In addition, there is always some event or activity going on around campus, so you are never bored! The academics at Daemen are rigorous, but it will most certaintly prepare you for your future."
Sophomore,5,"Ever since I visited the small campus, I knew it was where I wanted to be. Faculty and staff are very welcoming and ensure you get the help you need in order to succeed in their classes. The college is known to be rigorous, but it's actually an advantage in my eyes. You learn more material in greater detail, making you better prepared for your future. If you are looking for a college who recognizes you by name, not by number, this is the college for you!"
Freshman,5,"Daemen is an excellent private college.  The professors are all genuine, and know all of their students.  They are flexible when it comes to needing them for help.  The campus architecture is pretty, while the campus itself  is small and simple."
Freshman,5,I love this college it's nice and small and I really get all the help that I could possibly ask for!
Junior,5,"If you are looking for a small, quiet campus in a city setting, then Daemen is the place for you.  The main thing I like about Daemen is how small it is, I feel like this allows for more personal interaction with many different people on campus.  Also I have not met one mean or nasty person at Daemen, everyone comes into work and has a positive attitude everyday."
Niche User,5,"I love the tight nit community and the professors.The school is 100% worth your time, attention, and schooling responsibilities. The people are friendly and happy all the time, they are not rude or snotty. I have made many friends by going to this college and love it."
Niche User,5,I will be attending Daemen in the fall of 2018. I am very excited about this next step in my life and I feel like at Daemen I will be able to step outside of my comfort zone and explore new things.
Junior,5,"I decided to go to Daemen College since it was very far away from my hometown . I wanted a new scenery and Daemen was perfect for it! It's a small campus fit for introverts and extroverts . No one is judged , everyone is fully accepted and I was able to be an Orientation Leader for it ! I absolutely adore Daemen and the professors . The professors are splendid and care for each of their students . Daemen tries their best to make everyone happy and I appreciate it . Plus , the food is pretty good ."
College Freshman,5,If you're in to PT or PA program you're in a few good spot. The classes are far harder than the boards.
College Freshman,5,"Besides alcohol, there aren't a whole lot of drugs that are present here."
College Freshman,5,"It's the perfect school for those that desire a class where 60 people are considered an extremely large class. Also, as a result there aren't any TA's or post docs either, leaving the professors the only people which are lecturing. Also, since the research at Daemen is minimal, all the professors are there to teach because they want to."
College Freshman,5,"Daemen is a very secure campus in a fairly secure area. I have never personally felt like I was in any danger whatsoever. Sexual assault is taken extremely seriously, as college policy is to interrogate anybody without any legal counsel if they are accused."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my sisters , I do not know what I'd do without them. Going great was by far one of my best decisions at Daemen!"
College Student,5,This is a highly accredited program and I am only in my first year and have already been told I have 2 possible jobs lined up when I graduate. The training is great and its a masters in 5 years. Pretty good bang for your buck
College Student,5,Daemen is ver safe! I've never felt in danger
College Freshman,5,I feel totally safe on campus
College Freshman,5,"I feel that I am getting a great school based on their academics. I am positive that after completing my degree, I will get a job."
College Freshman,5,All greek activities are fun and bring spirit into the campus. No hazing happens with is great
College Student,5,The apartments are great! Students get their own room and live with four other students. The apartments are close to all the academic buildings which is awesome.
College Sophomore,5,"Security around campus has grown since I began a year ago and the campus feels much more safe, even though I've never personally felt threatened on campus. Amherst police department is also great too and help with any altercation that happens on or around campus."
College Sophomore,5,Students who graduate at Daemen typically excell in their fields after graduating
College Sophomore,5,Daemen has been an excellent experience. The faculty has been incredibly helpful helping me pursue my major along with future career possiblities.
College Sophomore,5,"Dorms are incredibly close to the main academic buildings, maybe the most a 5 minute walk. Upperclassmen dorms are spacious and clean, the freshman dorms are a bit cramp but overall are nice."
College Sophomore,5,"Daemen College, while a small school, has an incredible teaching faculty along with the administrators. In my personal experience, my academic advisor has shown great interest in helping me pursue my major, the head of my department is incredibly friendly and willing to meet students any time. The faculty there actually treat you as a human being and not as a number like at other major schools. My experience at Daemen has opened new worlds for me to explore including giving me a once in a life time trip to study abroad in a country I never thought I'd step foot in. Overall, Daemen is a wonderful and if I were given a chance to do it all over again, I would pick Daemen."
College Junior,5,"The natural science and healthcare programs are great at Daemen. They are difficult, but the classes prepare you much better than any other classes that I've taken at any other school. The faculty are great and are always available to help with anything - school or non-school related."
College Junior,5,My professors take a personal interest in my success and makes sure they provide me with the best help to make it.
College Student,5,Living in Canavan for my first year at Daemen was awesome! The only difficulty is that you live with 4 other people (2 in one room and three in another) and if you don't get along with your suite mates...things can get pretty awkward. Thankfully the RAs are super helpful to assist in any ways they can!
College Freshman,5,I would never chose any other school. Everyone is so nice and caring. Faculty and students are always willing to help and very understanding.
College Freshman,5,"Got offered a job on campus within my first semester. Programs offered here give you the experience needed to work in your field. I am in a smaller major than normal, under 10 people in my program, but I know without a doubt that I will find a job after college. They are really good about helping with that, especially if it's a job in WNY."
College Freshman,5,"So many places within walking distance. Dennys across the street (24 hours), Manhattan Bagel is like a block away, there is an Indian place and few other dining locations within walking distance.

Buses come every 15-20 minutes at the main street entrance to campus. These take you to the metro station where you can transfer to any bus or use the subway to get virtually anywhere in the buffalo area. Really food options are unlimited as long as you are willing to spend the $5 on a day pass for the metro or have a car. 

Weekends have free buses that go to the mall. There is a Wegmans right next door that offers a HUGE variety of meal options, both prepared and wholesale. 

Basically you could eat at a different location every day for an entire semester and never have the same thing twice."
College Freshman,5,"They are very concerned with the well being of each and every student. Not only are there free counceling sessions for anyone who needs them, but there are people available to help with studying and reinforcing materials. Parking passes are technically required, but I went an entire semester without one and had nothing happen. I have also parked in handicapped spaces many times. The only time this is an issue is when there are no handicap spaces for people who actually need them. Since there aren't many people on campus who use them, I have yet to see anyone get in trouble for this. 

There are generally no issues on campus whatsoever. I cannot think of a single time administration has done something that negatively affected anyone on campus. Even if for some reason there is something wrong, someone finds you in the class you are in and informs you. There is definitely an effort to fix a problem without punishment."
College Freshman,5,"Not only did they give me all the financial aid I needed, but they gave me an $8,000 scholarship. I am by no means the ideal student; I am older than most and transferred in, so I was extremely surprised when I saw how big of a scholarship I got. Especially since the cost of tuition is less than $30k a year!

There is also a program that allows students to use their financial aid to buy books in the bookstore. This is extremely helpful for anyone who relies on financial aid to purchase books.

Another thing worth mentioning is how friendly and helpful the financial aid staff is. I have gone into their offices a few times with questions about increased income affecting my financial aid. They are always able to answer any questions and seem very friendly. The only instance where they didn't have a definite answer, they were able to direct me to someone who did."
College Freshman,5,"I have gone to 2 other colleges, one was Brockport which supposedly has the best food in the state of NY. Well I can honestly say Daemens is far better. The food is always fresh and healthy and they always have unique takes on classics, such as the toasted pb&j. Amazing food for such a small campus.The only thing that would be better is having the ability to use DC bucks at other establishments. Most schools in Buffalo have a campus cash system that allows you to buy groceries or take out, it'd be a wonderful idea and very helpful to those students who rely on their refund checks for food."
College Junior,5,They are friendly and always around. Nothing major has happened on campus
College Student,5,I feel I am in a very safe environment.
College Freshman,5,I love Daemen a lot!
College Freshman,5,I feel so safe on campus!
College Freshman,5,"Best teachers, coaching services, mentors.  Everyone is there to help you."
College Freshman,5,"Amherst, NY has all the attractions and food options you can imagine.  As long as you have a car or know someone with one you will be able to reach them.  Or you can take the famous late night walk to Dennys."
College Sophomore,5,"There are always security officers on duty, it is very safe. There are few crimes."
College Sophomore,5,"Physical therapy as a program is known to be a difficult area of study at Daemen. It includes undergraduate studies, reapplication into the graduate program, and then three years of graduate school. Graduate school is very difficult, as was the initial part of the schooling, but its for the best with regards to the students and the school, this way the students are more prepared for the boards, and the college will have a higher job placement rate."
College Sophomore,5,Drugs are rarely seen or even heard of on campus!
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with my current career goals.
College Sophomore,5,"I can still walk from my off-campus apartment, it takes me less than 10 minutes to walk to Daemen and I'm paying less than half the price of dorming, although I loved living on campus my first two years."
College Sophomore,5,"Canavan Hall is the freshman dorm, it is a community style building, the rooms are set up in suites, and it's really easy to meet your floormates and make a lot of friends. The apartments are for any year after you're a freshman, and they're excellent. They have 4 single rooms, a kitchen, and a living room."
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the PT program, there is a great sense of community. It is rigorous, but the professors encourage study groups and visiting their office hours."
College Sophomore,5,"As a PT major, I will be doing 4 clinical internships before graduation, 9 weeks each. Daemen has great connections, and they can even set up new clinical internship sites if you have an interest in a particular clinic."
College Sophomore,5,"very good for a drug free alcohol free campus, good security as well"
College Student,5,"I've never felt unsafe, but I'll never feel 100% safe anywhere."
College Senior,5,"At Daemen College, there are certain things you can not do which is fight, trespass on school property and discriminate against others."
Sophomore,4,"After experiencing a complete shift to online classes, I found that all of my professors quickly adapted to the new learning situation and were able to provide quality educations despite a lack of in-person classes."
Junior,4,Campus is nice and small and reminds me of home. The professors and classes are great. The only downside of being a small school is that there isn't that much stuff to do on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I was a transfer student that came to Daemen college at the beginning of 2020.  I like the small college atmosphere.  The professors and staff have been very helpful getting me acclimated to the school. It is a great community and the students that I have met have all been very nice and helpful. One thing that I would like to see changed, is updating housing on the campus. The dorms and apartments are somewhat outdated and need some updating."
Senior,4,"Daemen has been a great experience ! All the professors in the science department are amazing. They was to see you succeed and the small class sizes allow for close relationships and a lot of one on one time if needed. It also helps to ask for recommendation letters when you have a relationship. It would be cool if they expanded the courses they offer / the type of research you could participate in there. Overall, the school is cute and fun- I commute- but I have seen some of the apartments and they are decent. The experience you get is worth it though. I have learned so much and grown so much and met wonderful people."
Junior,4,"The best thing about Daemen is its warm community. Lecturers, administrators and staff interact freely with students. There are many on-campus events so it is perfect to get an introvert out of their shell."
Niche User,4,"Daemen college isn’t a huge campus, so walking from class to class wont be a daily struggle. The professors and staff members are extremely understanding and nice to their students, but most importantly the education is beyond other colleges."
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently in the public health program at Daemen College with an average class size of about ten people. I transferred from a bigger school where this small class format was not the norm. This allowed me to have a better relationship with classmates as well as my professors. At my previous college, most professors did not know your name and were difficult to reach. At Daemen, all my professors were able to know me personally and office hours were perfect times to meet with them. I would like to see a more diverse group of students and faculty at Daemen College. In several of my classes, I was the only African American. This shows a need for more minorities on campus."
Freshman,4,It was very nice and wholesome experience. I got to meet different students individually hear their different stories and how Daemen College brought them together.
Senior,4,"Three years in Daemen College and I cannot get enough. As I face my upcoming senior year, I can only think about my first time arriving to Daemen and getting to know the campus. Although the campus may not be as big as other colleges and universities, student life makes up for it by providing different sorts of activities to do around campus. Class average is decent size as well as professors are very warm and welcoming. Though diversity is average in Daemen, clubs such as Hispanos y Latinos Unidos and the African Student Association welcome students to learn more about the culture and plan student events and fundraisers. The city of Amherst is very quiet, a friendly neighborhood, and filled with activities to do. I would definitely recommend for high school students to look at this college as a consideration seeing as the school does cater to a wide range of majors and minors as well as sports and clubs for students to have a great time!"
Niche User,4,"The campus is small, everyone knows everyone. The ratio of staff to students is excellent. I love the small community feel, and there isn't many parties which is good! I love it!"
Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience with Daemen. The majority of the professors care about you and your work and will go the extra mile to assist you. The location is superb, close to the city of Buffalo for easy access to restaurants and cafes, but being far enough away that the campus always feels safe. I have never felt as if I was in danger while walking back to my dorm at night. I know many people look for the typical college experience with parties and if this is what your heart is set on Daemen may not be right for you. But if you’re looking for a body of hardworking students then you would fit right in. One downside of Daemen is that most of the students are commuters so during the weekends the school feels like empty since no one is around. Sometimes however, having a desolate campus during the weekend is a saving grace, and you can focus more on work. Despite some flaws, I would recommend Daemen to someone looking to have a more intimate experience during their college career."
Freshman,4,"Daemen College is a small private college that is located in Amherst NY. The business building where most of my class are, is a fairly new building with a great interior. The athletic facility such as main basketball court is in a terrible place and is located where some of the offices are, the library, and some classroom. The teacher have a unique way of teaching you but they have all experience what they are teaching."
Senior,4,I like that the professors get to know you by name and that they try to help you as much as possible. More parking would be great. Better food should be provided for students!
Senior,4,"It is a very academic focused school, and the classes are very challenging. The departments are small, and faculty focus on helping you understand concepts. That being said, social life is boring and the food is awful. Also because coursework is so rigorous, you really have to apply yourself otherwise you will find it very difficult to succeed here."
Junior,4,"Daemen has great faculty and staff who are committed towards your education and future success. With small class sizes, professors are able to give you the attention you deserve. The campus is quite small and has a very modern feel. Daemen has a family element that most college/universities simply can't offer due to size and scope of students."
Sophomore,4,"Daemen has incredible educational programs that prepare students very well for their future. However, this campus is not very large and does not have the best food, student life, or opportunities to get involved with clubs and activities. This is overall a good school, I would just like to see more opportunities created for students to engage in extracurricular activities."
Graduate Student,4,"D.C has a nice student to professor ratio. The student center helped me out a lot  throughout my college career. The cost of attendance  is high, still left with high debt after financial aid and scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"Daemen College is a very safe, small, friendly campus. Although there are not a lot of scholarship options for art students. Under an art degree, academics are on the more challenging side for me. Keeping an academic scholarship is a struggle since there are limited art scholarships available."
Freshman,4,"I believe Daemen College is a fantastic school, I personally like that it is smaller, and close to home. One of the best things about Daemen is the Diversity and the assortment of activities on campus every day. As a physical therapy student, the available resources at the library are a great convince."
College Freshman,4,nothing has happened so far
College Freshman,4,The career services is fairly helpful in obtaining a job.
College Freshman,4,"Very good housing, if you're not a first year. Otherwise, the dorms are tiny and expensive. The apartments are a much different story, for the most part, they're fairly quiet."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the best part about this school is that most of the people here place their academic achievement beyond anything else."
College Sophomore,4,"I love hot the campus apartments are set up, it' really makes you feel at home"
College Sophomore,4,"It makes me feel at home, I love it at Daemen. I've met so many great people already and would definitely pick this school again if i started over"
College Sophomore,4,"If I could do it all over, I would choose Daemen again.  Not only have I made many wonderful friends, but I have also built relationships with some of the most caring, compassionate, and intelligent professors.  They are always willing to provide additional assistance and have greatly influenced my success thus far."
College Student,4,"My initial experience was rocky but I have really felt that the teachers and everyone was there to help. There are so many resources for me to use to further my schooling, also the teachers make it clear that they have office hours and that we should be using them. I have really enjoyed the atmosphere, even thought it is kind of hard because Daemen has so many commuters but also have so many dormers, I feel that it is sometimes hard to mix the two while providing the best experience for both."
College Freshman,4,They have an awesome basketball team and they club sports are really fun too
College Student,4,"Amazing academics, great professors; I am really learning a lot and there are many resources available to make sure that I succeed in my courses. The food and living situation is not satisfactory."
College Student,4,Daemen makes sure that we are aware of the options available
College Student,4,The courses are challenging but the professors are helpful while dealing with the stress of college
College Student,4,Daemen makes sure student athletes are students before they are athletes. Fans come out to support usually and the athletics department makes it fun for everyone on campus
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of opportunities for sports on campus and the new gym is wonderfull
College Junior,4,The drug scene is little to none. People can enjoy college experience without it .
College Junior,4,We have a campus full of security. All the security guards are friendly and respectful. They are always willing to help and be of support to anyone who needs it.
College Junior,4,My experience at my school has been a challenge. But it has also been reward as well. Being in my school gave me the opportunity to grow as an individual. It has allowed me to gain more independence since I am living away from home.  My school offers a diverse population for a small school and it also has different clubs that you can be apart of to meet new people. My favorite part of my college experience so far would have to be service learning. Service learning is a form of giving back to our local community (volunteer work). My school is the only school in Buffalo who is required to do volunteer hours in order to graduate. I love my college experience because I am able to figure our what I want to do in my future even more. I am grateful for my college experience at my school.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Daemen is a great college"
College Freshman,4,"Daemen wasn't my top pick, but overall I am glad I am attending this college. The professors are very helpful. Also, for me the small class sizes help in my learning experience due to the rigorous academics."
College Student,4,We have great security on campus. Although we do not have good health services on campus.They refer students to Urgent care for any health needs.
College Student,4,"Like any other college, you will have great or awful professors.  The classes sizes are small which is nice because some of the professors will get to know you and be a great help to students future success."
College Student,4,The Greeks plan a lot of events on campus that include a lot of activities that non-Greeks can be involved in. I believe they put some more life to the campus as a whole.
College Student,4,"Although some classes can be very rigorous, the teachers do their best to prepare their students for grad school, with classes that are important for students future success."
College Junior,4,As an athlete there are rooms available for studying. For all students there are computer labs that anyone can use.
College Junior,4,There is always campus safety available to the students anytime of the day
College Junior,4,Class size is good and most of the professors are very interested in the well-being of their students
College Sophomore,4,Not part of a Greek fraternity but I hear that they are great
College Sophomore,4,"Haven't personally been part of the sports programs at Daemen or the intramurals but hearing from friends who do take part, Daemen has an great athletics program that is ever progressing."
College Freshman,4,"the housing on campus is really great. I like living on campus. Everything is close by for classes, if want to eat food, or just going to the library. The buildings are fairly close to one another. Since the campus is small almost everyone knows each other. If you want to make friends it's easy to do that around here. The only thing I'm not so fond of is the pricing of the dorms. I feel like it should be cheaper than it actually is but overall I enjoy being on campus"
College Junior,4,"Coming from New York City, the price for off-campus housing in Buffalo is very affordable but the landlords could be nicer sometimes and I do not like my year long contract."
College Junior,4,I am in need of extra financial help but the process to obtain aid was definitely smooth and easy.
College Junior,4,"You can relax at the Cyber, do homework or watch TV while eating their better quality food. The curly fries are pretty good and offered at a decent price."
College Student,4,Everyone gets some sort of scholarship as well as grants!
College Freshman,4,i dont care for athletics but many ppl say they are great here
College Freshman,4,"Off campus is nice if you can find the roommates to share a place with. There are places from as little as $200/month to $500/month, all still cheaper than living on campus. Public transportation goes everywhere so that is never an issue. Some places are cheaper than others and usually those that are cheaper are not in the best neighborhoods.  Even the worst neighborhoods in Buffalo are livable though. I live in University Heights which is supposed to be the worst place to live. It's definitely all college students and very high poverty level families, but most people are friendly and willing to help. Community events are a big thing everywhere in Buffalo. Everyone is friendly and participation is encouraged. Each street in University Heights has a community garden project. In the 3 years I have lived here there has been one instance where safety was a concern, and the police responded so quickly that I feel any potential threat is nothing. I would not reccommend walking around late at night and doing suspicious things though, cops are everywhere and Buffalo is starting to really crack down on underage drinking. Basically if you don't party super hard and you are over 21, you should never have any issue living off campus.

Also, landlords don't run credit checks for most places so students can easily find a place."
College Junior,4,"Since the school is small they have an offcampus but on campus housing at collegiate village. You can live off campus but still be cosnidered a resident. I love living here. You can do a four bedroom. two bedroom, or two bedroom shared."
College Student,4,Quite suburban neighborhood but everything is within 20-25 mins
College Freshman,4,I love housing at Daemen
College Freshman,4,It's not too bad but its not the greatest ever.
College Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Daemen. It's a small campus though so if you don't hit it off with the professors in your program you're going to have a tough time of it."
College Senior,4,We don't have a lot of crime on campus and I always feel safe.
Sophomore,2,Lack of communication was a big issue. There was total lack of support through the tough times of 2020.
College Freshman,2,"1. They stuck roomates together by majors and not by using the survays that they had instructed us to take.

2. The rooms are so little, many rooms are cramped and hot"
College Freshman,2,The greek life here has like 5 members in each group
College Freshman,2,"There is no football team, no school spirit whatsoever"
College Student,2,Not a lot of selection
College Junior,2,"I don't believe there are any Greek houses, I wish they were more involved in school activities."
College Freshman,2,It's bad because everything around here closes early. Some restaurants close at 9 or 10pm for some people thats really early especially if they aren't done with class until 9:30 or 9:45pm. It kind of expensive especially if you order everyday.
College Junior,2,We don't value the athletic life much but the athletes seem to all enjoy being a student athlete. I have been to a few games and the stands are never filled.
College Freshman,2,It's Buffalo do it is always snowing.
College Senior,2,"Buffalo is snowy and cold. Speaking as a native Buffalonian, you get used to it. You might have to wade through multiple feet of snow and zero visibility conditions to get to class, but don't count on getting snow days off from class."
College Freshman,2,Shuttles have a limited time schedule and only takes you to collegiate village or walmart/mall on weekends.
College Sophomore,2,"snow, snow, and more snow in Buffalo NY!"
College Sophomore,2,we are by no means blessed by the location of our campus!
College Freshman,2,I only received one main scholarship from the school and when I went to look for more they didn't even show me where I could get more. They said they could no further help me.
College Sophomore,2,Daemen offers shuttles only on the weekends. Sometimes the shuttles are unreliable and only run from about 12 to 4pm. Amherst has a bus system that you can utilize. Also cabs run 24/7 and are very reliable. In order to get around you can either rely on the shuttles or a friend who has a car.
College Sophomore,2,I always have an hassle. You have to keep calling or nothing will get done
College Sophomore,2,Campus shuttle run on Saturday and Sunday only. there is a public transportation but you have to pay for it.
College Sophomore,2,"The fraternities and sororities are not a big part of the college life at Daemen...it's actually a joke. There are not parties and there are only some events that are ran by them; however, they aren't very open to people not in the frats or sororities."
College Junior,2,Nightlife aids to students who are 21 or older however there are some clubs in Buffalo that let 18 year olds and older come in. On campus doesn't have many parties but there are schools near by that students can go to in order to party.
College Junior,2,You can find mostly boys who enjoy to work out at Daemen College along with boys who enjoy video games. Typically people who go to Daemen College are from New York State. I wouldn't say any boys are particularly handsome but they are also not unattractive.
College Freshman,2,Daemen College has a shuttle bus that will take you where you need/want to go but only on the weekends. the shuttle however is often unreliable considering there s no schedule and people are often waiting one or two hours for the bus.
College Junior,2,"Tickets and fines are reasonable because campus police give you a wanring first then you get a 30 dollar ticket from local police if you have another violation.  The availability of parking thought is slim and commuters are always battling for parking spots, it is rather ridiculous. There is not a need for a car, there is a bus stop right at the front gate."
College Freshman,2,There are not Greek housing for females. In Amherst if four or more girls live together in a house it is considered a brothel. School is small so people will find out if you are a Greek. Not much that people say about them
College Freshman,2,Public transportation is horrible around buffalo but like Daemen has a van that   can take to mall & stuff but only works weekends ..
College Freshman,2,The school is close to the city of Buffalo where all the attractions are available but if you dont have a car they are hard to get to. Daemen does offer a shuttle but it isnt big enough for alot of people so either get there early or don't bother.
College Junior,2,The food selection is very limited. There is a lack of vegetarian options. Often unclean.
College Freshman,2,"Daemen is not a school that is defined by sports. The college has just joined Division 2 sports, so this might help to increase the social life around campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is impossible after reaching a certain hour of the day. Classes start at 8am and if you do not have an 8am class but have a 9 or 10am class you are forced to park on the road or even across Main street down a side road. Teachers have their own selected spots that as students, we are not allowed to touch until later in the day. Daemen college has also failed to use all its available space, utilizing some of this space for patches of grass or trees. Students still park on these spots and it is hit or miss whether they get ticketed or not. The only good thing about parking here is that it is completely free."
College Junior,2,"Due to the amounts of students that go to college, the majority of students are PA or PT majors so most of the time, students are studying and dont have time to participate or join any Greek activities. Daemen Colllege Greek Life is known on campus but people tend to go innactive."
College Sophomore,2,"Aside from flyers and e-mails, the school doesn't really have an ""announcement"" system. Unless your friends with the athletes, you don't hear much about their successes and/or failures until you get the quarterly newsletters."
College Student,2,"Parking can fill up really quickly, so make sure you get to class early enough so you can find a spot easily. And as a freshman, you usually get the worst parking."
College Freshman,2,"Not Enough Spots – Anytime after 8am there are no spots.  Many people don't want to leave for lunch even if they hate the food because they know they will not be able to find a parking spot when they return.  All the faulty have told the students that it has been proven that Daemen does not have as much parking as permits they give out.  I gave it a C- and no lower because the permits are free, which is always nice, but when there are no spots, students often park on side streets, and then they get a ticket.  Also the overnight parking from December to April is HORRIBLE! There are never enough spots, so many try to not leave the campus unless its an emergency!  Most of us have enough stress with school work and could really do without the extra stress of parking."
College Freshman,2,Drinking Within Campus Premises – Drinking is not allowed which can force students to illegally drink within the campus premises. They are aware of this rule but their carefree attitude lead them to take such action. this is also underage drinking which can have bad affect in their health.
College Freshman,2,It Needs Work – There aren't enough computers for everybody on campus.  The computers and network have also slowed considerably during the past year.
College Student,2,"Males Only. This school has one fraternity. This is a review upon males only. Everybody who is not in the fraternity for some reason hates them. What is worse is that they force you to ""dress up"" on a certain day to brand you; therefore, everybody in the school will know you are in the fraternity. They are pretty good in academics and they do not party a lot. If you are looking to party in a fraternity, this is not it."
College Student,2,"Physical Therapist Major – It is cold and very boring, unless if you have a car. There are these shuttles that take you from and out of the dorms in the weekends; however the amount of these shuttles and the time the come to college is questionable. There are many fantastic art attractions. There are not much sports/recreation; however, there are a few activities, and cultural events from time to time; however, there can be improvements. The local attitude towards the students is good. The safety of the students are fine as well. Beware: the housing department is horrible for freshmen (especially if you are a freshman and wants to dorm). No one in freshman year likes the person in charge of housing."
College Freshman,2,"Wireless Internet Access Not Steady – The internet at Daemen is awful. It's slower than dial-up, especially if you have a laptop. Unless you're at a computer provided by the school in the computer labs, you're not going to have good internet access. Also, good luck finding a computer in the library."
College Senior,2,Based on Parents – I don't receive a lot of financial help based on my parents income.  It is tough to get through and of course now I have student loans.  I worked hard through college to graduate a semester early and save some money but now this last semester it is hard to come up with the final tuition.
College Junior,2,"The workload for biochem at daemen is average, as long as you start there as a freshman, which I didn't. Now I am stuck taking so many irrelevant core electives that I may have to stay an extra year. The classes and teachers are either great or horrible, there's now middle. Half of the professors are amazing and half of them shouldn't even be allowed to teach."
College Student,2,"Punishments Are Enforced – The RA's keep a pretty close watch over the college scene. I'm sure they know when parties are going down, but if you keep it quiet and in small groups, you will be fine."
Sophomore,1,"Reasons this place sucks: 
1) food is bad to the point I have liquid poops after 30 mins of eating (same thing happened to a few of my friends as well). Spent $$$ on groceries.
2) wall dorms in Canavan and the apartments are so thin to the point you have to whisper/text to communicate.
3) laundry machines are broken.
4) parking is a huge problem. I cannot find any parking at all.
5) they try really hard to promote campus activities but fail to do so.
6) library is always filled up during the day.
7) some professors do not even know how to teach/even know the material they have to teach.
8) the fitness center in the AWC is so small.
9) the demographics online is a lie.

Have fun if you plan on going here!!"
Sophomore,1,"This school is horrible. They don't care about you, they just want your money. Food is horrible, dorms are horrible, classes are too hot or too cold, so many of the professors are terrible t explaining the material, and then act like it is your fault for not understanding. They stick you with people you have nothing in common with in dorms, which are broken down and tiny."
College Freshman,1,They offer no help at all
College Freshman,1,"Daemen college is absolutely terrible! There is nothing to do to keep students active, the school is significantly small. Everybody has class in the same building, and they put effort into the PA and PT majors but disregard anybody else. They will find anything that they can to reduce financial aid. The school is very disorganized and small. Many people end up transferring outof there because it is not a college that students should be in. Just a terrible school"
College Freshman,1,Anything louder than indoor voices will get shut down fast
College Freshman,1,What night life? At most it's a few groups of people that leave campus to party at UB or Buff state.
College Freshman,1,"Diversity is a joke if you look to your left and then to your right, chances are you'll see a white, middle-class girl. If you see a black or Hispanic student, chances are they're from New York City. There's a director of diversity that periodically sends out emails ensuring Daemen is a diverse college, that is until the dining has a ""theme night"" which serves stereotypical ethnic food."
College Freshman,1,"Most of the Greek life is not well highlighted, partially because of the small campus preventing any greek housing. If it weren't for the occasional event hosted by a greek, most people wouldn't know about them. They're all more akin to a club than an actual greek."
College Freshman,1,Daemen doesn't have a lot of sports
College Freshman,1,Not a lot of people do drugs at Daemen.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few spots available, at any time during the day. The best time to find a spot in the lot is before ANY classes begin."
College Sophomore,1,There really is not a nightlife at this school. Everyone leaves to go to other places such as the University at Buffalo.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible in the Fall semester. Unless you get there super early in the morning, it is unlikely you will find a spot on campus. I have parked about half a mile away from class a few times, usually on the side streets. It's a bit better in the Spring semester, since people have dropped out, transferred, etc. I was at least able to find a spot on campus the entire Spring semester."
College Freshman,1,Only the shuttles which run tot he mall on the weekend
College Freshman,1,Buses run every hour if that. Campus provided very limited shuttle.
College Freshman,1,"If you dont have a car, you're basically screwed. The closest dining area to us is Dennys and you get tired of that food quickly. Mc donalds is about a half hour walk and anything actually healthy is even farther."
College Junior,1,"The parking lots are small, there is a LARGE commuter population so spots fill up very quickly. Off campus parking is very limited."
College Freshman,1,"In my two years at Daemen so far, I have only heard of one party. If students go out on the weekends, they normally go to UB or downtown Buffalo. Most students are more into their studies than partying."
College Freshman,1,"Because social life is minimal at Daemen College, students are focused mainly on their education. As in any college, their level of education, the looks, interests, and dress vary from student to student. I find that I am able to define the type of major a student is, by the way they dress. i.e. Physical Therapy students are usually dressed in work out clothes."
College Freshman,1,"Repetitive and Not Quality – All the food is very processed and unhealthy.  I always get the vegetables; however, they usually are steamed to the point where no flavor or nutrients is left!  I must say the new salad bar is a huge improvement for Daemen.  But it is apparent when a break is coming up or if it is the weekend because the quality of the food drastically declines, many of us have cereal, salad, or the same meal that we did at lunch."

Freshman,5,"It has great programs that connect you with a wide network of professors educators, and special minds within any field. If you are attending, I would highly encourage you to take classes outside your preferred area of study."
Freshman,5,The school is great I am in the School of Computer Science and it is one of the best schools in the world!
Freshman,5,They have a very accessible website that helps a lot and is very easy to use. Signing up for classes was easy.
Graduate Student,5,"CMU is one of the most respected universities in the world. CMU is one of the few prestigious institutions that rely solely on merit and not family wealth and connections. For some prestigious schools, the hardest part is getting in. However, for CMU students the hardest part in finishing. At CMU, students can expect to truly earn their degrees."
Graduate Student,5,Online classes are rare but the business school has the number one online MBA program. Other schools have started to move courses online due to Covid.
Alum,5,"My time at CMU was great. My advisor was really caring and helped me do more than plan my schedule. The school acknowledges the stress culture is pretty bad and has taken steps to provide stress relievers (eg: mindfulness room, paws to relax, the petting zoo, etc). The campus food wasn't bad and the staff was friendly. Professors were, for the most part, understanding when things came up. I was able to make a few lifelong friends too! The campus is pretty diverse, with a majority of students being internationals!"
Alum,5,"The only class  I took online was C@CM, basically, a pre-campus course on the computing norms on campus. My year, the course wasn't that entertaining and I flew through it in a few days. By the time I graduated however, the course had evolved a lot, even offering virtual proctoring for the final exam."
Freshman,5,"I love Carnegie Mellon University. It has become a new home for me and I felt that I had an amazing 3/4ths of my freshman year in college! sadly because of the pandemic, the last half of the second semester was moved online but I am excited to go back (whenever that may be)"
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at CMU - I had a lot of friends, grew as a person, go to try interesting clubs, take cool classes, and I felt supported by professors and staff. If I had to change some things, I would urge the school to try to build up a global brand by not over-emphasizing STEM in the way that it has before. I would also like to see it become a more politically active campus, and I would like to see diversity get stronger."
Niche User,5,"I really want to go to this school in the future. In terms of neighborhood, it is in a great location and it is surrounded by synagogues, perfect for students coming from Jewish communities. Great theater program, great academics. This school opens doors for you folks."
Alum,5,"Carnegie Mellon is a breeding ground for geniuses, future leaders, engineers and business personnel. If you like being immersed in a population of extremely hardworking and passionate people who love what they do, then Carnegie Mellon is for you. Located in a great college town, I have many fond memories of Pittsburgh, and I am well-positioned to succeed in my career."
Freshman,5,"Wrote out a long review but forgot niche has a small character cap.....

Ultimately, I love CMU and am proud to be a Tartan."
Freshman,5,"I like the professors the best, they helped me even in off times and are really good at replying to emails. In addition, the on campus wi fi is excellent, even in the middle of the field, I am able to get 20 mbps of wi fi.  The buildings are also very high tech and comfortable, especially the Gates center"
Sophomore,5,"Carnegie Mellon has great campus, dorm and the professors are absolutely dedicated and top class. Absolute love the college life and great from academics. Expensive and would help if more aid is available."
Niche User,5,"So far I can safely say that I have had a good experience with Carnegie Mellon. I had the opportunity to visit the school during their Celebration of Diversity weekend. The school invited me to their campus for an overnight visit, and my airplane travel was paid for by the school itself. Overall it was a really good experience, and I learned that this school could benefit me if I were to attend."
Freshman,5,"I would describe Carnegie Mellon as a sandbox school; it is probably THE best school in the country, topping Harvard, MIT–the entire HYPSM complex, if you tailor your experience carefully. However CMU can seem underwhelming compared to the price tag if you have no idea what you're doing. Rating this school out of five stars is preposterous, as it can be either SUPER fantastic, or SUPER disappointing, depending on where you look (more than your typical college/university)."
Freshman,5,I am excited to attend this university and pursue an education with one of the best set design colleges in the country!
Freshman,5,Carnegie Mellon truly knows how to push all their students. It's a very difficult but extremely rewarding feeling attending class every day. All the lectures are about real-world scenarios. Overall it's very cool to attend a college that is at the forefront of technology and so many future industries.
Alum,5,I loved the campus and the Enrollment Services staff! We need more resources into how to improve having a balanced (fun and education) student life.
Senior,5,"CMU is hard and can be very stressful. Student life is what you make of it. If you get through, you can be set for life with a highly-regarded degree, amazing job offers and an expensive network of high-profile individuals."
Niche User,5,"Its computer science program is good, student to faculty ratio is also very less.
Their campus is mid size and clean, they have integrated programs that's a plus."
Niche User,5,I thuroughlyenjoyed the campus and the life that the students create there. I wish for Carnegie Mellon to stand out than most colleges because of their great campus and connection to the city that they have.
Graduate Student,5,"I have had a wonderful time at Carnegie Mellon University so far. I am pursuing a masters of human computer interaction, and the only draw back to the program is the price tag attached. Other than that, the program is a dream come true"
Freshman,5,"Carnegie Mellon is a very rigorous school, but that doesn't mean success is impossible. With a lot of hard work, you can edge out a 4.0 and still have time for social life."
Niche User,5,Carnegie Mellon emphasizes the importance of real world experience in your chosen field of study. The university is extremely highly regarded and many large companies are on campus to offer summer internship and job opportunities to Carnegie Mellon students. They offer many services to their students and value offering a well rounded and academically challenging but enlightening education.
Freshman,5,The school offers an excellent education and the ability to grow not only as a student but also as a person. The campus is not very big and you are able to meet many people who come from different backgrounds than you. This will help you see the world in a completely new light than few other colleges can offer. The city of Pittsburgh is also welcoming and an excellent college city.
Senior,5,I love the open area and the community. The engineering program seems really developed and professors are very understanding.
Niche User,5,"I love the focus on community at CMU and the strength of the programs. While other universities may offer a huge variety of majors, CMU has superior quality despite not having as many, so you know you're getting the best education possible."
Freshman,5,Great University.  Wonderful administrative and academic staff. My application and audition experience was positive.  They have a great preparatory process for incoming freshman.
Niche User,5,"Carnegie Mellon excels in the field of Computer Science. Furthermore, it promotes research in Artificial Intelligence by being the only university that offers a Bachelor's degree in AI."
Niche User,5,"great school, can't wait to attend in the fall. I'll be majoring in math. I need to have 100 characters"
Senior,5,"Carnegie Mellon fosters the most diverse collegiate environment where you can pursue anything you want to, academically and extracurricular-wise. It is home to 7 distinct colleges undergraduates can choose from including engineering, science, CS, business, fine arts, humanities, and information systems. I belong with the Mellon College of Science (MCS). The cool thing is that I am majoring in Neuroscience through MCS but am also minoring in biomedical engineering through the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT - engineering school), so I am experiencing the best of both colleges. This is only one example of the many interdisciplinary paths you can take here at CMU. Finally, CMU provides its students numerous opportunities to make an impact outside the classroom whether that is through travel-abroad service organizations, athletics, and so much more. The main takeaway is the CMU-experience is yours to design and there are endless possibilities."
Graduate Student,5,"So far it is a very nice school. The campus is rather small, but Pittsburgh is very friendly and nice. The transportation system is also very good."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at CMU is so rewarding because I am surrounded by some of the greatest minds of the world, without exaggeration. As I sit in class I'm sitting among kids who code apps in their free time, run their own businesses, or build robots for fun. You cannot find this kind of enthusiasm anywhere else for academics!"
Sophomore,5,It's a great school that will push one to his/her limits but also provide a rewarding and fun college life.
Freshman,5,"What I like about Carnegie Mellon is the general atmosphere of the school as a whole. Having a campus separate from the surrounding city allows the community within CMU to flourish, and I feel like that was a major factor in why I enjoyed my time here. The coursework is difficult to an extent, especially with certain classes, but the payoffs of what you are able to gain and learn from these classes really outweighs the drawbacks. With so many various groups on campus, there's always somewhere for people to fit in."
Works Here,5,"As a volunteer working to help translate an application software used by the university, I have had a rather good experience. The campus is beautiful and located just at the intersection of the hubs in Pittsburgh. In addition, the academics are top-notch and help students get into many prestigious companies that include large technology firms such as Facebook and Amazon."
Niche User,5,The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama has a remarkable program that encourages collaboration between various theatrical positions. It prepares you for the performing arts industry as it ensures opportunities for musical theatre majors and designers alike to gain real life experience.
Alum,5,Very challenging and oriented towards skills you will use on the job.  Very high tech and analytical.  Awesome school.
Sophomore,5,I really liked the people and culture and the fact that most classes are very well supported. Professors are usually very helpful and help students professionally and academically.
Alum,5,"Carnegie Mellon was the best decision I made -- the community is collaborative, warm, and supportive. Your professors are invested in you for life."
Sophomore,5,"Carnegie Mellon is a very academically challenging school, I have struggled a bit but maintained a good GPA through sophomore year. I love the campus and the surrounding local community. This is NOT a party school but has Pitt close enough to enjoy some party life and I am a SigEp member and currently live in the frat house. Most of the professors are great and I look forward to the next two years here."
Freshman,5,"While I'm definitely not the brightest students at CMU, I have met some of the most amazing and talented people here from my classes and clubs. The workload does get heavy at times, but once you learn to develop a good work habit, it's not as bad. CMU also offers a lot of extracurricular activities for you to explore."
Freshman,5,"The academics are intensive, but with the amount of student organizations, its hard not to find a balance between social and academic life."
Junior,5,"I have had the most profoundly wonderful experience attending CMU. While you will not have the ""traditional"" experience here, it will be for the better. CMU challenges you to grow both in your chosen career path, and as a person. Living with and attending school with people as passionate about both their extracurricular activities and their career path as you are pushes you to be even better, allowing you to do things you never though imaginable. I feel like CMU has made me a more complete, worldly, and well-rounded human being, having been exposed to an incredibly broad variety of ideas, passions, cultures, backgrounds, and stories. CMU is truly a remarkable place."
Niche User,5,I loved the environment. I visited and it was easy to live a city life as well as a peaceful natural life as well all within walking distance.
Graduate Student,5,"World class intersection of world class programs.  Tech, science, art, business on one compact campus.  Involvement at the undergrad and graduate level is excellent.  Not for the faint of heart.  Definitely need a sturdy heart and mind."
Graduate Student,5,"Carnegie Mellon allows for great work/life balance. While academics are intense and you will be pushed beyond your imagination, the GSA organizes social events pretty much every month providing good opportunities to socialize with graduate students in other departments."
Junior,5,"I love this school. You get a great mix of career, academics, social life, and city life. I think your experience here is what you make of it. Sometimes, it can be a little stressful but that good times are definitely worth it."
Sophomore,5,"Carnegie Mellon is awesome, and there are a lot of great opportunities to explore into whatever realm of education that you see fit."
Freshman,5,"Carnegie Mellon University is an exciting, world-renowned school that gives its students a wide variety of opportunities and resources."
Freshman,5,CMU is a great school; it is very accommodative in terms of financial aid and the professors are very attentive. The only downside is the athletics - there aren't as many varsity sports that others of its first-class name do.
Freshman,5,"It is a great technical university for anyone that is really passionate about his/her field because opportunities and challenges are many. Professors really push you, and you'll always be satisfied of the work you have put in. Socially-wise there is not much to do on campus because people are not that into socializing and the athletics are very bad. However, Pitt and Duquesne are good places to hang out and the city is really great for everyone. I have met many great people from everywhere around the world. It is just the beginning and I'm having a truly great life experience."
Niche User,5,"I attended a summer program at CMU called the Summer Academy for Math and Science in July and August of 2016. This program was one of the best experiences of my life. It allowed me to grow profoundly as a student, taking college-level courses the summer before my senior year of high school. It gave me my first opportunity to live away from home and navigate dorm life, well preparing me to go away to college. The staff and professors involved in this program were excellent. The program is targeted for minority students and does a great job showing how welcoming an environment CMU can be."
Freshman,5,The perfect place for nerds. An extremely demanding curriculum. Best university to study Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering
Sophomore,5,"I guess it goes without saying, but this school is very tough. From beginning to end of each semester, it's a LOT of work. However, it's great preparation for the real world and I don't regret choosing to go here."
Alum,5,"Carnegie Mellon is a great school, and it will only get better as time goes on because it is uniquely suited for educating the 21st century worker. This said, the work in the quantitative disciplines is absolutely brutal. Most nights are spent working and a lot of socialization happens through working on schoolwork with your classmates.  It costs upwards of $70,000/year to attend CMU if you have no aid, which is a lot of money. So, you work your tail off, but that's kind of what you would expect to get your money's worth. 

The campus is building hundreds of millions of dollars of buildings right now and the business school on the undergraduate level will be second to none in the coming years with its emphasis on quantitative discipline and the ability to overlap with CS courses. 

People attending CMU need to be self-driven to explore Pittsburgh. It is quite an interesting city once you explore it--particularly for food."
Freshman,5,"Carnegie Mellon is an unconventional school. Extremely smart and nerdy CS kids study at Gates while incredibly talented musicians and actors perform in CFA. In between, you find students concentrating in all sorts of fields: engineering, business, statistics, math, psychology... The strength of this school lies within this observation. Carnegie Mellon is great in various fields, so no matter what you study here you will be learning a great deal. In addition, the network you can build here is immense. Despite being a relatively small school, CMU offers plenty of interesting people who are enthusiastic, friendly, and passionate about their fields of study.

Finally, as we move towards the age of Artificial Intelligence (think Uber's self-driving cars in Pittsburgh) and the Internet of Things, there is no better place to be than CMU if you want to be on the cutting edge."
Freshman,5,"Carnegie Mellon University is a great school. The academics are very high quality, and the coursework is challenging and interesting. There are a variety of people from all backgrounds and walks of life. Pittsburgh is a wonderful city, with activities of all kind in the surrounding neighborhoods."
Freshman,5,Carnegie Mellon University is a truly diverse community with highly intelligent people who strive to achieve realistic goals that enhance the quality of life. The school is especially well known for its majors related to science and technology.
Freshman,4,"I have been taking classes online, and I find a lot of fulfillment from engaging with professors. However, there are still quite a few introverts within my classes that do not help, but that is to be expected with online learning."
Sophomore,4,"CMU did a solid job transitioning to online learning. It definitely depended on the class, but the professors demonstrated real interest in helping navigate online learning across the board."
Sophomore,4,"CMU is an intense but rewarding institution. It has a reputation for being a pressure cooker, and it definitely is to some extent. But the school understands this and has taken steps to improve the overall mental health on campus, such as our new wellness room and Tartan Community Day. The one aspect of CMU I dislike most is that many students arrive a little bitter that they didn’t get accepted to some other school- usually MIT, Stanford, or some other similar school. However, since I’ve only finished one year here, I figure that fades with time. Regardless, I love CMU for its super smart students and faculty, medium-sized campus, and amazing academics. I couldn’t see myself anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"While I did not take an classes at CMU online, there were some lectures that took place online. For instance, both my biology and elementary computer science course had some lessons on the Online Learning Initiative (OLI). These were quite useful and interactive. And made excellent study material as well for the finals."
Sophomore,4,"Carnegie Mellon University is a primarily pre-professional university that focuses on channeling students to Silicon Valley. The return of investment is significant, and most students attend the university with the explicit intention of working in the tech industry. Carnegie Mellon's emphasis on tech and the sciences exudes in all disciplines, even those who study the humanities and fine arts. I appreciate this about CMU, as it truly sets up individual students for lucrative careers, with rational 21st-century skills that push students into the front."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty is great, the size is great, and the people are great! I love my school, however, I do wish that the administration spent its money in a way that benefitted its students more."
Freshman,4,"Carnegie Mellon is a great private institution. In the major that I am in, you can really tell that the professors care about your education as much as you do. Diversity is an issue, as there are few Latinx and African American students and many, many Asian and Caucasian students. Athletics are not really a priority at this school because everyone puts their academics as their first priority. Everyone at this university takes their work very seriously. Those that don't are the ones who don't perform well. The facilities are great, and so are the people. You really won't regret coming here. Your experience is what you put into it, so work hard and play even harder when you get the chance."
Alum,4,"The experience you get largely depends on what school you are in. It is predominately a research school, so you may not have very enthusiastic professors."
Freshman,4,"Carnegie Mellon is very competitive, but fosters a strong sense of collaboration and curiosity, as students are very passionate about the things they study. There is not much of a sports or party culture here, but the students are very competent, and very focused on their studies. There are many options for clubs and extracurricular activities."
Niche User,4,"I spent 6 weeks here for a Pre-college program, sadly no AC at my dorm. I really liked my professor and I took classes with graduate students who seemed to enjoy the school. The students seemed very close together overall which was nice and very welcoming."
Freshman,4,"Carnegie Mellon has very great academics and is a great school to continue high level classes in a small campus setting.  While the on campus food is not the best, there are many great restaurants in Pittsburgh to eat at instead."
Senior,4,It's ok.  The housing isn't great but its about the connections that you make on campus and how you deal with obstacles in your way.
Sophomore,4,"Carnegie Mellon has a multitude of opportunities for almost every student. Any idea you have or thing you want to pursue, you likely can. However, their CAPS program requires a complete overhaul, as everyone on campus knows that if you need actual help, you find care elsewhere."
Freshman,4,"As a computer science major, you will have a lot of work from homework, extracirriculars, etc. But you learn a lot and there are a lot of opportunities to get connections with companies, research, and other projects that you might be interested in."
Alum,4,"Challenging environment, support if you seek it and use it, and lots of student activities to join. Fast-paced classes but large return on investment"
Freshman,4,"I haven't been yet, but I am excited to learn all about the campus. So far, I have only met a few engineering professors, but everyone I meet is very capable of teaching and very passionate about the subject."
Freshman,4,I loved the people that I met. The unique experiences that I have been able to have with such a diverse group of people who are all very passionate about what they do. I have been able to make friends with people with polar opposite career goals and hobbies but with the same drive and ambition as me.
Sophomore,4,"This school is amazing for academics and sets its students on track to succeed in their careers, however that all comes at a price (both literally and metaphorically). This school is very expensive without scholarships or financial aid, which puts burdens on its students and their families, and also adds to the already stressful environment of the school itself."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Carnegie Mellon University was very outstanding. The environment was very nice and welcoming. The upperclassmen were very understanding and willing to help the freshmen.
Sophomore,4,"Carnegie Mellon definitely pushes you hard to develop an excellent work ethic and a genuine passion in your field. The student body is plenty diverse enough that anyone can find their group, and the amazing research and campus opportunities are definitely more than you would find at your average college. Only poor aspects are probably the intense stress culture, and food and campus are pretty average (it's a small school)."
Graduate Student,4,It's hard to understand some professors. They don't speak fluently and in the end you end up studying on your own.
Freshman,4,"Carnegie Mellon is a very academically challenging school, however, I feel there is a pretty good balance between academics and social activities. Compared to larger, public schools, the community is much more close-knit and you don't feel like just a number. CMU provides a lot of good opportunities for its students."
Sophomore,4,"From my first year of Carnegie Mellon, I liked how I met a wide variety of people that were passionate about their career and interests."
Senior,4,"Carnegie Mellon is a champion in the academics and no doubt anyone who comes here will be challenged to their limit. The one thing I would like to see changed is that the school should spend less on academics and related resources and more on student life like more fitness facilities, better eateries, and more recreational spaces."
Sophomore,4,"The theater world that CMU offers is like no other, if you're lucky enough to see into this world you'll learn so much. Unfortunately, CMU is very compartmentalized and  it is hard to crossover disciplines."
Junior,4,Carnegie Mellon University is a very challenging school with a high stress culture surrounding it. The school in general is very good at academics from a global standpoint which generally provides a good return on the investment. The school is very small and tight knit so there is a strong sense of community and culture that is present daily throughout campus. Student life in some aspects is great but in some is lacking; such as below average dorms and campus foods. You should be prepared to work hard in a stressful environment in whatever field you decide on if you plan on attending this school.
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school overall, and its suburban location just minutes away from downtown proves useful often. For anybody pursuing any form of sciences or mathematics, I can't recommend a better school. This school is focused on preparing its students for whatever problem they may face in the future. Very diverse culture as well."
Sophomore,4,"Carnegie Mellon University is a great place to foster your interests and passions. While it is strong in computer science, engineering, and other related technical fields, it is still a great place for other majors such as business and the arts. Professors seem to be quite caring, lots of workload but definitely manageable if time is managed correctly."
Junior,4,"Great school if you are interested in Research, Science and Engineering. Also, an up and coming undergraduate Business School. Graduates across the board conisistently leave with great, high-paying jobs."
Junior,4,"I think choices of available foods should be healthier with more choices for vegans and or vegetarians .In general ,it should be foods that increase stamina for the exigencies of studying ."
Freshman,4,"Tight-knit community, great professors. You have to work hard to do well but it’s all the more rewarding for it"
Junior,4,"Despite the workload, my overall experience is very good. CMU students are very nice and smart, always passionate about what they do."
Junior,4,"Carnegie Mellon does a great job at offering various resources to students, whether these resources be related to academics, professional development, or well-being. I especially appreciate my school's efforts in promoting health these past two years."
Senior,4,"Carnegie Mellon University is a great university because it has a lot of interdisciplinary programs you can join or make to create the ultimate college experience. Also, you can even create your own major to help you find your career path. I give it a 4/5 star rating though because classes can be really tough, and you feel overwhelmed. However, that also pushes you to learn more. Not only that, you can easily make friends who are very willing to help you with your assignments. The advisors here are helpful to a certain degree. Like any college, this school has good and bad professors. You just learn from upperclassmen which professor's class you should take."
Alum,4,"Carnegie Mellon University is a really tough school, especially for computer science. You will find that the schoolwork is quite heavy and there is a ton of homework. However, I've met some of the smartest people here at school. Everyone is really bright and motivated. The career services here are quite good as well. CMU attracts some of the top companies, especially in tech, so hopefully you will be able to find internships and full time positions easily."
Alum,4,"Carnegie Mellon is tough, no doubt about it. But it's also a place where you'll be pushed and surrounded by other talented and passionate people working hard too. You bond over that and I made awesome friends who will always be close no matter the years and distance. It can be very stressful, but making it through did convince me that I could persevere through anything, something that has benefitted me a lot out in the working world. I'll always prefer to hire CMU graduates because I of this.

Sports? Nah. Don't go there for sports. Campus? A lot better now then when I was there! Dorms? They're OK but moved off campus after 1st year. Parties? Well my group of friends had a lot of house parties but this was more Art, Design, Drama and random stragglers group ;) Pittsburgh? Wasn't convinced at the time (wanted to be in NYC) but it's a good place to go to school - enough to do, fairly safe, pretty cheap to live, plenty of arts and culture if you want it, decent food, etc."
Alum,4,"CMU students tend to be workaholics, but I think the school does a decent job of offering plenty of activities to diffuse that."
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity among the student population.  There are people of all different cultures and backgrounds.  One truly gains insight about people from all over the world!  One setback of the university is its lack of sufficient tutoring.  To receive individualized help, one must unfortunately do poorly on a quiz or exam before getting the proper help."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time so far at Carnegie Mellon. The university itself is very challenging with brilliant professors and researchers. While many students that attend Carnegie Mellon are culturally diverse, a lot of people are motivated through high pressure situations. At times this could mean that students care more about their major and completing assignments and projects that socializing. However, being involved in one of the 200+ clubs is the best way to open up and meet others."
Freshman,4,Im in the business school and first semester was pretty tough. It's very nonstop and you need good timemanaging skills. You meet a lot of people and will learn a lot about yourself.
Freshman,4,"Carnegie Mellon is a great place, full of really talented and smart MIT rejects. Although it's a bit too career oriented for my tastes (ie. everyone is all about jobs, no one really cares about grad school), the jobs kids at CMU get are great. The professors are wonderful, and because of the small size, you can expect to get a lot of individualized attention and care if you seek it out. Also wish CMU had an aerospace engineering program or more classes in theoretical math."
Freshman,4,"You won't be getting much out of your social life at CMU (the party scene is nonexistent, but you can still find parties if you really want to go out) because everyone is awkward and a hermit. However, the academics are stellar: extremely rigorous and tough. Students here are also ridiculously smart. It's both inspiring and intimidating, but so far I am enjoying myself, despite the sleep deprivation and constant stress. "
Alum,4,"Incredibly challenging academic environment. Regardless of your program, you will be pushed to your limits here; however, the sheer scale and reach of groundbreaking research and innovation that happens here will make it all worthwhile. By taking advantage of the incredible opportunities that are available here, you can race to the head of your field and will graduate prepared to take on just about any challenge."
Recent Alumnus,4,They provide escort services at night which is really great!
College Sophomore,4,"All my professors have been very smart and care a lot about their students, however, not all have been great teachers. That has more to do with teaching style and what works best for you, I definitely recommend going to review sessions with the TA's since they've taken the course before and know what can help you."
College Sophomore,4,Literally just search professors within your desired field and ask to meet with them to talk about their work and job opportunities. They're very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on campus and all the incidents I've heard of occurred within the community but off-campus. There are emergency phones located on the outskirts of campus just in case and Pittsburgh is actually considered one of the safest cities.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm in a sorority - which was totally unexpected by friends and family - and I wouldn't have it any other way. I personally love greek life and am very grateful for all the people I've met through it. However, I do recognize issues with some frats being too big and not having the best brother/sisterhood. You don't have to join greek life to have fun at school, but if it's something you're at least considering or curious about I definitely recommend that you go to some of the rush/pre-rush events to get a feel for the community."
College Sophomore,4,Their is no pressure to drink even though it is common practice at CMU.
College Sophomore,4,Many students are given job/internship opportunities after graduating from CMU.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I feel CMU does a good job of informing/protecting students from sexual assault."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, there is little crime near campus. I have never felt unsafe. We have campus police always patrolling campus and in the library at night."
College Sophomore,4,"CMU Greek Life is very different from other schools. Their is not the typical stereotypes about frats, everyone in Greek life is very inclusive of those not in Greek life. A lot of the social events are mainly Greek though."
College Sophomore,4,"Carnegie Mellon has a vast amount of resources that students can take advantage of. In addition, professors are very supportive and peers are always willing to help. The classes are difficult, but this challenge better prepares students for the workforce. Pittsburgh is a great city as well."
College Sophomore,4,"CMU has a place for everybody. There is no pressure to drink or do drugs, but if you want, you can always get access to them."
College Freshman,4,"From what I've heard or already know of the school, it's great for academia."
College Sophomore,4,"Not many people are into drugs at all, even for parties. There are a couple who use prescription drugs to study more but no one judges or pressures you when you want to say no."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at CMU are beyond adequate for the student population. It's a smaller school that doesn't want to focus all of its funds on nice lockers. The priorities are correct for the student population.
College Junior,4,"The only thing CMU can boast is that their students will stick together and commiserate as productively as possible, including alumni. Some degrees have an easier time with job prospects, that's for sure, but overall having a piece of paper that says Carnegie Mellon University will help open some doors. Maybe its because people know by now that if you made it out of CMU, you're tough enough for the real world. Or maybe they pity us. As long as I get a job, I don't really care. We have a couple of big job fairs every year which invite big companies, as well as a few networking events. If you're looking for opportunities, you will eventually find them. These are usually student-planned events, not university-hosted, so they are actually executed well and with students' interests in mind."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are all great and very qualified. Registration process can be a bit stressful because you're randomly assigned a time to register and waitlists suck, but people forget to use their academic advisers and they are incredibly helpful. Workload gets very heavy so time management is crucial. The first few weeks of classes are light then midterm season hits and it doesn't really end until finals. Most people study in Hunt or Wean library, and the school just put up some new study spaces in the university extension. Other students study in empty classrooms, which I like. I prefer to have more private rooms (because classrooms are taken during the day), but the school doesn't have many of those."
Sophomore,2,"What I like: Environment that pushes the students to work harder and study harder.
What I do not like: 1. An excessive workload that does not really help. 2. Food 3. An excessive tuition 4. Lack of quality school events."
Freshman,2,"The professors at Carnegie Mellon feel that they're above teaching. The food is subpar, the atmosphere is harsh, and the whole place is very gray. It's very hard to be happy here."
Niche User,2,"What is very interesting about Carnegie Mellons theatre program is that, yes they do put out professionals. But the thing is you become a very cruel human being that is only in it for themselves. Theater isn't about that. It is about the entire process and everyone involved. You have to be able to work with everyone and by doing so create relationships that could potentially get you more work. That doesn't necessarily have to just do with the theatre department. That could go go for whatever career interest you go into. Yes they have a great reputation but there is a difference from someone who Major's in Musical Theatre and an artist who truly appreciates it."
College Junior,2,"There are parties, but they usually suck (bad music, bad alcohol, sometimes bad people), and they are constantly being shut down by the campus police who apparently have nothing better to do. If you're old enough, you can go to bars, where they'll have none of the aforementioned nonsense."
College Junior,2,"Parties are usually in houses, unless you bother to count frat house parties, which will always suck to some degree. The best parties usually turn out to be medium sized ones with people you know. The party scene would have a better impact if it didn't consistently suck and if campus police didn't shut down anything remotely fun-sounding."
College Junior,2,"The professors here don't care about their students. Sure, they all want us to theoretically learn the material, but they don't really try to help. They think that a 'C' is okay to give to a hardworking student because ""it's passing"", but they fail to realize what we're all really here for: TO GET JOBS. News flash! Getting a job is hard to do when your GPA makes you look like an idiot."
College Junior,2,"These shoeboxes they stacked in the 1600's aren't top-notch on any front. I've seen dorms at other schools with swimming pools and tennis courts, meanwhile ours boast being mouse-free for a full month! Keeping on-campus housing is simpler than renting off campus, but considering how limited and how terrible it is, some students (who have money, or rather, whose parents have money) can afford to live in houses and apartments off campus instead."
College Junior,2,"Sometimes I wish I had never chosen CMU. Everyday is a living hell, with professors who are experts in their field but certainly not expert teachers, and a stress culture that would scare any sane person away if they knew about it beforehand. I'm only halfway through, and I'm already planning my new life after CMU. I can't wait for the day that I make tons of money with my CMU degree, just so that I can donate to MIT instead. I hope it makes it to the news, so that Carnegie Mellon can feel the shame of all the students they stole time and money from to give them the worst four years of their lives."
College Sophomore,2,"Workload is really intense, stress levels super high. Wouldn't recommend it unless you like the topics you're working on or whatever. I'm sure it'll get better after I clear the core classes I'm not interested in, but sometimes I think I chose the wrong school and major."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sports aren't that important.  People participate in them for fun, but they aren't close to being a part of campus life."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not into the class styles. I think they focus too intensely and rigidly on the technique of writing and not enough on analysis. Literature is overly oriented towards political, historical and career-oriented perspectives rather than from a thematic one. Some of my professors are amazing, kind and helpful, while others are awkward during discussion, not to mention many students are robotic and unenthusiastic during discussion, which makes me kind of sad."
College Freshman,2,"I just don't necessarily fit in with the culture at CMU, and I'm not really enjoying my classes either. Discussion falls flat."
College Freshman,2,Not very much attendance at any sporting events.
College Sophomore,2,There are literally only a hand-full of merit-based scholarships. I know many people who do not come to CMU because they do not get enough financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"What can I say... it's a nerdy school. The stereotypes are pretty much true. I don't particularly notice the Guy/Girl ratio to be a problem unless you're in a high level robotics or ECE class. The guys are mostly unattractive. That being said, they are all nice and most people are friendly and kind. Everyone is intense and competitive and that serious culture carries over to dating. Girls tend to be more attractive then guys, but almost all attractive girls join sororities (there's a pretty stark contrast). Some girls care about their appearance and some don't, but girls be warned that although they may be nice, CMU guys are generally not that attractive."
Recent Alumnus,2,I wasnt a aprt of it so i really havent the slightest idea.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It was prerry consistently bad, i ate out like allllll the time"
College Junior,2,"No variety, and the better options are closer to Pitt."
College Junior,2,"Carnegie Mellon highly discourages living off campus and does not really value or assist students who do, except for some financial aid exceptions."
College Sophomore,2,"For as much as this school costs, there is little financial aid available. There are no academic or athletic (Div. III) scholarships available."
Recent Alumnus,2,Coaching staffs are  typically reviewed as worse than the staff of  most students' high schools. Track was particularly bad. Football also not great. Nobody cared.
College Sophomore,2,This is just not an athletic school. Division three and football games are occasionally attended but basically nothing else is.
College Junior,2,"The biggest party goers attend parties at a different, neighboring college."
College Junior,2,"As far as eating healthily and for a good price, there really is no place that is good for both, excepting The Exchange."
College Sophomore,2,No one really cares about sports except for those who participate in them.
College Senior,2,"The weather is generally always against you. It can look beautiful outside, but it will be -12 degrees. In the winter, the snow is very heavy, so invest in a pair of decent boots. The weather affects all the students' moods, I believe. The Cut is abandoned in the winter and in the spring, everyone is out playing. When the weather is bad, it's terrible. However, Pittsburgh can also have very nice weather in the spring, and Schenley Park is a wonderful place for a walk. Overall, I feel like Pittsburgh is a city of extremes when it comes to temperature."
College Sophomore,2,The clubs in Pittsburgh suck. If you're under 21 you probably won't get into bars or be able to go to clubs. Buses stop at 2 am. House parties can be fun.
College Sophomore,2,More people attend intramural games than varsity games. No one cares about sports here.
College Junior,2,Yeah...sports. They might exist here.
College Freshman,2,CMU doesn't offer international students ANY financial aids.
College Junior,2,High costs of permits and few amount of spots make having a car more difficult than it should be
College Freshman,2,It gets to be way too cold to go out sometimes. 
College Junior,2,Make your own food when possible.
College Sophomore,2,"Pittsburgh weather leads some out of town students to refer to it as ""Shitsburgh"". Summer feels like it extends into mid October, at which point there will be a week where Pittsburgh decides to go from 70 degrees to 30. Western Pennsylvania weather is very volatile, so there are times where it will literally go from 65 and sunny to 25, windy and snowing overnight. The winters are tough, especially on students from warmer climates. So bundle up, scurry between buildings, and/or 'penguin' (walk in a huddled group for shared warmth). Phipps Conservatory, the botanical gardens right next to campus which grant free admission with a student ID, are a nice escape from Pittsburgh weather and schoolwork during the winter, as it maintains temperatures around 70 degrees year round."
College Freshman,2,"I've heard it's bad, but I""m a Freshman and we can't have cars. "
College Junior,2,It's hard to find healthy things to eat on campus. Most of the dining halls close before midnight so a late-night snack is hard to find. Skibo Cafe in the UC is the latest and it's open most nights until 2am. Meal plans are a waste of money; it's much better to go grocery shopping and cook your own meals.
College Freshman,2,I dont know about guys but the girls here are not very pretty
College Freshman,2,There are several opportunities but not many people are interested because of a heavy workload
College Freshman,2,the computer lab computers are slow and old and often get hung while in use
College Freshman,2,"there isnt much to do off campus, mostly just decent restraunts"
College Freshman,2,"It can be very cold some days, making the walk to classes somewhat difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"Pittsburgh is an ""ok"" night life, a lot of things are just a bus-ride away, which would be great if the buses got there on time...
Most of the time I wouldn't bother with the hassle and stayed around the campus area."
College Sophomore,2,"I was too busy studying and figuring out my major to think about greek-life, and i never planned on joining anyway! Greek-life starts to really matter around carnival however, when getting funds from their organizations help them to build bigger and better booths compared to the less-funded clubs/organizations. For me, Greek-life was known more for its charity events than it's parties,though there were parties I never bothered with them."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many permits available, and for those without permits, it is nearly impossible to find a decent spot.  The alternative methods of transportation, Port Authority buses, are just as bad. Very unreliable."
College Junior,2,"Solid weeks of sun in the early Fall and late Spring, but far too much gray during the rest of the year. When juggling four massive assignments while rain pours outside your window, it can sometimes be hard to stay optimistic."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the students here are more academic oriented, so there are not much drug activities going on as some other universities. However, there are still plenty of people that have access to it."
College Sophomore,2,"Carnegie Mellon is not a place you come to for its athletic programs. That being said, I still think athletes find enough to do here, and if you don't want to devote your college career to sports, you can still get your exercise in through club sports, or through our well-equipped gyms."
College Sophomore,2,"It's often rainy or snowy, but classes are almost never cancelled (not even for MLK Day!)
When the hurricane hit last year, we trekked to class despite the 50mph wind and pummeling rains. 
Bring an umbrella - it'll be your best friend."
College Freshman,2,cmu is terrible at giving money. i got some and lost it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are plenty if parking spaces during the later hours in the day between 4pm onward, however in recent months Pittsburgh has installed parking meters which has greatly deterred the willingness to use the spaces on Margaret Morrison and Tech Streets. You often have to arrive at campus early in order to grab the limited spaces that there are in the peak hours of the day. A car is necessary unless you live far off campus, however Pittsburgh public transportation is often difficult and a car makes it easier tour around the city."
College Freshman,2,"Students rarely known about varsity games unless they are on the sports team. There is a strong IM on campus, but do not apply to everyone."
College Freshman,2,"The dining plan is the biggest scam since bottled water! If you're a freshman, you have to use it (you don't really have a way to make your own food). Get the lowest number of ""blocks"", and more dine-x. The food is not bad, but it's not particularity healthy. However, there are a good number of options on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There are always CMU police cars driving around. The campus is pretty small- they circulate around the neighborhood constantly. It's kind of unfortunate because they're always prowling around on the street where all the house parties are, but in the end, they're really only there to keep us safe. They won't stop you if you're stumbling down the sidewalk with a group of friends, but if you're alone and in the middle of the street, they'll stop and get you back home. In the end, it keeps the campus safe. There's also a great amnesty policy."
College Sophomore,2,"CMU has an ""amnesty"" policy meaning if you or your friends are drinking and someone gets sick, you can call EMS for help and no one will officially be written up. This leads to abusive drinking amongst students, because the threat of getting in trouble is minimized. The drug scene is not very large but alcohol use is rampant, despite the university's propaganda stating otherwise. It is less of an issue freshmen year but becomes more apparent as an upperclassmen, as classes become excessively challenging."
College Senior,2,"The weather is about normal for the north Atlantic region.  It is very warm in the early fall and late spring, and gets very cold in the winter. Wear plenty of layers and you can never go wrong."
Recent Alumnus,2,"No a Lot of Sun – Pittsburgh has fewwer sunny days than most cities, but the temperature is actually pretty good for a majority of the year if you are used to the Mid-west."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is very little free street parking around Carnegie Mellon.  Many of the streets require that you have a resident parking sticker which you can get if you are living in an off-campus house.  The parking garage almost always has space but is a bit on the expensive side for college students.  Since the campus is in the city, it is best to make use of your student ID for unlimited bus rides."
College Junior,2,It's not worth paying to park on campus so i park at my place and walk to class.
College Sophomore,2,"One Big Hassle. The school's endowment is absolutely tiny compared to other schools of similar prestige, so don't expect too much grant money. There are also so many papers to fill out - it sometimes gets extremely annoying. But the financial aid office does answer questions pretty efficiently, which is good, because you'll have a lot of questions regarding your aid."
College Freshman,2,"Slim Pickins – Pickings are slim, and those that there are can be a little too into themselves"
Alum,1,Poor name recognition. Poor student life. Students don't present as adults. Awful dorms. Not recruiting from upper crust.
College Junior,1,"The professors here don't care about the students, they just teach so that they can do research here. I've gone through too many classes here, too many sleepless nights, too many fits of rage and misery to ever think that this school cares about its students' well being. I've seen students struggle and fight through classes, only to be laughed at and stepped on. I've had teachers tell me that ""a 'D' is still passing"", but then expect me to somehow get a job with those grades. Professors will throw away all of your hard work just so that their curve looks better on paper. They will make sure that the ""right"" number of students get A's, B's, C's, and D's, instead of allowing us to all do well. It doesn't make us any better - we won't use most of this after we graduate! So just let us learn in peace. Is that so much to ask?"
College Sophomore,1,"Literally there might be negative fan support in general for our teams. Students definitely take advantage of the gyms and a lot of people go to work out, but no one really cares about our teams. Most of them are mediocre at best. Students would definitely rather go out to dinner or just hang out with their friends than go see a game, mainly because the students aren't particularly athletic. I myself am a huge college basketball fan, but the DIII quality makes me not want to go."
College Junior,1,"More marching band members show up to football games than actual audience members. To be honest, the marching band is more entertaining."
College Sophomore,1,They are very lame at CMU and everyone not in the system makes fun of them religiously.
College Sophomore,1,"It's not worth your money, but you have to be on a meal plan freshman year. However, improvements have been made from last year."
College Sophomore,1,The weather here sucks in the winter. It rains and snows A LOT and CMU will never ever cancel class for snow even when all other area schools have.
College Sophomore,1,You have to pay so much money for it
College Junior,1,"They do not give an appropriate amount of Financial aid. They continue to increase tuition costs, but do not increase financial aid. They take away what they promised for no reason. Such an expensive school needs to give more financial aid to middle class students"
College Junior,1,"Very few sunny days in Pittsburgh and most of them are in the summer when you aren't there. Cold for half the time you are in school, winter just lasts forever. Not as cold as some places, but still very cold.  Rain will just come out of nowhere"
College Sophomore,1,"I know that CMU values it's students and the education it provides, but I (and I'm not alone when I say this) just don't feel as though they do everything they can to make sure that students can really afford the education of their dreams. I know it's a private institution and that they need to make money, but, more often than not, it just seems like our school has so much money and yet so many students (myself included) have to struggle each semester to scrape together enough money to continue our education. Now, I got an okay amount of financial assistance from my school and took out student loans, but my mother lost her job and I'm barely making enough to cover our groceries. I've been selling a bunch of  my stuff, but we still have just over $6000 that we need to pay before I can start school. I just feel like trying to get an education shouldn't be so painful."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is terrible, not just on campus, but through out the city. You are better off leaving your car behind. You can get around easily with public transit."
College Student,1,"There are very few parties. If there are parties, they're going to be mediocre AT BEST.   Mostly, CMU students study or catch up on sleep, or get ahead on the next project over the weekends.  We study hard and don't party. It's unfortunate for some, but for most, we expect it'll be worth it after we graduate."
College Sophomore,1,"Most dorms are old, not well kept, and overpriced compared to off campus options. The problem is, it is very difficult to get an off campus apartment that is close by, since CMU is a bit of ways outside downtown Pittsburgh. CMU really needs to build more dorms and renovate the existing ones, but Housing & Dining operations are not very well run here. As an upperclassmen, you have priority choice in dorms but many upperclassmen leave the campus housing system since options are poor."
College Senior,1,"The serving size decreases every year. The food is very unhealthy and can take some adjusting to (read upset stomach). The biggest downside is the cost. To get a filling meal, you can expect to pay ~$10. It's really not worth it."
College Junior,1,"The cost of parking increases almost annually and the lots fill up really quickly. They're only free after 4pm(ish?) and weekends, and even then it's hard to find a spot."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible Library – The library at CMU is smaller than my high school library. I went to Phillips Exeter, where the library was one of the most renowned in the world, but CMU's library is absolutely dismal. There is hardly enough research material for anything, so we need to get things on an inter-library loan. I think this is a waste of valuable time for students!"
College Freshman,1,"I don't have a car, but my friends say that parking is very expensive. Parking is also limited. It's not really worth having a car, because it's cost isn't worth the convenience unless you're willing to pay. Buses are free with our ID cards."
College Sophomore,1,"CMU has a lot of variety, but not really a lot of options. There are a lot of places to go, but after 10PM or on weekends, you're pretty limited. Additionally, for what you are paying the food is not that great at all. It's pretty expensive and not that healthy."
College Freshman,1,"While there is a large variety of foods, the quality and quantity is terrible. Everyone wants to get off the meal plan ASAP. The block system is rather rigid, I'm unable to eat twice on a block in the same time period."

Niche User,5,"I did an college tour there it was a wonderful experience I recommend anyone to go there.

Freshman,5,"My favorite part of Agnes Scott, and why I chose to go there, is the people. It wasn't hard at all to find friends, not to mention the extremely helpful, kind and friendly professors. Everyone makes an effort to make you feel included and you make personal and professional connections for life."
Alum,5,"Agnes Scott is a beautiful, nurturing place that empowers global women leaders. The new program, SUMMIT, provides every first-year student with a trip abroad.

Agnes Scott College has been ranked the #1 Most Innovative College for the second consecutive year by U.S. News and World Report. Agnes Scott has also ranked #1 for First-Year Experience, #3 Learning Communities and is in the Top 5 for Best Undergraduate Teaching!"
Freshman,5,"From my first experience at Agnes Scott, I immediately fell in love with it's campus and wonderful staff.  I had already done a few college tours around the state, but none of them drew me in like Agnes. I had never considered going to an all women's college before visiting it's campus. I felt so welcome and empowered by it's environment. Everyone I had met was so kind and inviting; and even more so I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to have a conversation with the president of the school.  I only hear good things about Agnes Scott, and I am so glad that I chose to attend."
Freshman,5,"Agnes Scott College is such a beautiful, small, and diverse school that empowers women of all backgrounds to find their own voice and succeed in any pathway."
Sophomore,5,"Agnes Scott College is a small but open-hearted school. There are several majors to choose from and the professors truly care about their students. We celebrate everything from pride to National Hijab Day to International Pancake Day! There are several clubs for student involvement as well, so you are sure to find something that piques your interest."
Sophomore,5,"The community and student life is incredible, but dining options aren’t the best and some housing could use some work."
Freshman,5,"Agnes is exactly what I dreamed it would be: small in size, welcoming environment, close to home and overall very cozy."
Niche User,5,Agnes Scott offered the best all women opportunity that I have come to know. It has a fantastic campus and excellent dorms. All students take part in a foreign internship after their freshmen year at school. All departments are leading in educational curriculum and research opportunities are plentiful. Agnes Scott will offer you a degree that is respected throughout the country and the world.
Freshman,5,"Agnes is a community and a family. Once you enter, every resource is at your disposal. From the second you step foot onto campus as a student, you are guaranteed an education and an experience you will never forget. I have loved every minute here. I can't wait to continue in my Agnes Scott journey."
Freshman,5,Agnes Scott make sure to include everyone in all situations. The school and people are very welcoming and I have already recommended this school to rising seniors.
Sophomore,5,I LOVE my school!! Agnes is one of the best if not the best school ever. I love that my professors genuinely want me to succeed and they're geniuses. The students are lovely and I've met so many wonderful people there. The campus is breathtaking. I couldn't have picked a better place to spent my undergrad years!!!
Sophomore,5,Agnes has been the most amazing thing to happen to me. Each and every day of class is a blessing. The professors really care about you and they are amazing with financial aid.
Sophomore,5,"As a private liberal arts women's college, Agnes Scott strives to empower and educate women to ""think deeply and live honorably and engage in the social and intellectual challenges of our time."" As a sophomore, I will have to say that Agnes does live up to this mission statement. My experience so far at Agnes Scott has been extraordinary. It allowed me to think deeper about social issues such as women's rights. At Agnes, I was able to make unique friendships and bonds with my peers. The environment, campus, faculty, and students are all extremely welcoming and will help you do your best not just academically, but will also make sure you are growing and fostering into a strong woman who defeats every challenge and battles that might come through her way. I am able to reach out to my professors with every little concern that I have. The professors really do make sure that your experience at Agnes is life-changing."
Niche User,5,Agnes Scott has the Summit program which is valuable because it not only provides ample opportunities to travel abroad but also it values leadership development and global learning. These things create a well-rounded graduate ready for the working world.
Alum,5,"Agnes Scott is a great place for young thinkers to grow their mind, their confidence, and their strengths as a young leader. The close knit community offers unparalleled attention and opportunity for students to achieve their educational and career goals. I was so happy here, and even sent my sister!"
Sophomore,5,"Agnes Scott College is an institution that inspires women to conquer every obstacle, work hard to obtain every opportunity, and strive not only for our own success but to reach back and support and uplift our communities."
Alum,5,"I'm not sure that I fully appreciated my ASC education at the time, but 15 years later I can see with 20/20 hindsight. That liberal arts foundation has made me successful and adaptable in the working world, with strong written communication skills (more rare than I would have suspected). The courage of my diverse peers continues to inspire me and give me strength through life's challenges. I now know I had 4 glorious years of a glimpse at a more ideal world, one which I now work to create in the spaces around me."
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, as well as the many friendly faces you'll encounter. Its like walking into a movie scene every time you scroll campus. Grab a cup of coffee and a good book to sit out on the grass, you'll leave very well studied and relaxed. Honestly like heaven on Earth for me."
Sophomore,5,Agnes Scott has great professors who really want to engage with their students and make sure they succeed. Everyone I have worked with has done their best to make sure I learn to the best of my ability.
Sophomore,5,Agnes Scott College has become my second home. The people here are exceptional and I have no doubt that every single student that comes here will be able to find their niche. The SUMMIT experience has allowed me to view the world from a different angle as well as see the world through my own eyes on my Journey's experience. The faculty are so caring and really want every student to succeed. Every professor I have has known me by name and has put individual attention towards me and my education.
Freshman,5,Great college the application process was very easy and every admissions councelor greets you with excitement. The teachers are all very educated and willing to help their students with certain issues. The food on campus is really great I highly reccomend eating at Evan's.
Alum,5,"A women's college that will nurture you into becoming the determined, strong, poised, well-rounded, smart, kind and community-oriented woman you want to be. Scottie women are known to do incredible things for the transformation of society and for the betterment of the world!"
Niche User,5,Agnes Scott had such a beautiful campus! It was very clean and well kept. It was a very welcoming environment and made you feel very comfortable. Just walking around with our tour guide showed us how well connected everyone was with each other.  Since it is such a small intimate campus everyone is pretty much a familiar face.
Sophomore,5,"A SAFE, INTERACTIVE, BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS DEDICATED TO LEARNING, LEADERSHIP, AND A GLOBAL EDUCATION.  PROVIDES  VENUES FOR FRIENDSHIP, FELLOWSHIP, COMMUNITY AND GLOBAL ACTION WITHOUT FORGETTING TO HAVE FUN!"
Sophomore,5,"I love how close I've gotten to some of my professors. It's a small campus, so you actually get the opportunity to know them as more than a face by the board. On the other hand, it's a small school, which means a small faculty and smaller selection of courses. Many departments are working to expand their programs and offer a broader range of courses, and we partner with other colleges to allow students to take classes Agnes Scott doesn't offer."
Alum,5,"I attended Agnes Scott College for one academic year, 2014-2015. It was easily, undoubtedly, the best year of my life. The academics are top notch, but not intimidatingly so. The professors, adjuncts included, are very knowledgeable. They make themselves accessible by their students and really care to help how they can, so long as you are willing to put in effort. Overall, Agnes Scott places high value on their students, and all faculty and staff exemplify that. The sense of community throughout the campus is strong, and one of the most significant reasons it hurt me so deeply to leave. I had an unforeseen financial burden come up and had to transfer out of Agnes Scott because of it. If I had the financial means, I would transfer back to Agnes Scott without a second thought."
Niche User,5,"I toured Agnes Scott because I am considering applying there. I want to play soccer at ASC, but I also want that academic vigor. Agnes Scott has both! The academic side is what really attracted me, it had so many opportunities to explore studies outside of my comfort tone. I was blown away by the vast amount of options to choose from. The only downside was the party scene. Which I don't care for, but I understand that it is a factor for some people when they are deciding if they should go to that college or not. Overall, I give Agnes Scott College a 5 out of 5 stars. Beautiful campus, great diversity in people, rigorous academic load, and a well maintained athletic program!"
College Freshman,5,Awesome atmosphere. Very friendly. They really want you to succeed:)
College Sophomore,5,99% of graduates find a job in their field coming out of Agnes Scott. The people that work with internships and setting up careers are great and friendly. There are multiple career fairs on campus and plenty of opportunities to be successful.
College Sophomore,5,Campus security does a great job of making all of the girls on campus feel safe. There are special call buttons all over campus that way if we feel unsafe walking across campus one of the officers will come and walk us across campus.
College Freshman,5,"One thing that I love about Agnes is that you really feel inspired to try something different while you're here. Our gen ed requirements are minimal, which allows you to broaden your horizons, and take classes that at other schools you might not have gotten the chance to do. The professors are also very welcoming, and are understanding if you are taking something because it is for your major, or if you're taking it to see how you enjoy the subject."
College Freshman,5,"I don't think I could ever find a college I like better than Agnes. I'm sure there are better job opportunities for theatre and music majors at bigger schools in bigger cities, but the overall environment and the amazing level of support I receive at Agnes is unlike any other. The level of diversity at such a small school is a wonderful change from my high school, and I can make honest connections with my professors, and I am given amazing flexibility to explore different paths to study, and I don't feel like I'm wasting my time taking tons of gen eds."
College Junior,5,It's the most diverse college in Georgia and the SE
College Junior,5,The academics are intense due to the small classes and the interaction with the professors. The classes are filled with rich discussion and debate. The professors encourage. The advisement process is great as the professors tailor requirements around the student's goals.
College Sophomore,5,I am enjoying my classes and building relationships at Agnes Scott.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is awesome. This school really has a sense of community that you get by living here and the rooms are spacious!
College Sophomore,5,"ASC is located in downtown Decatur. As a whole downtown Decatur was listed in the top 10 places to eat at in Atlanta. They had to make it into a collective group because of all the good restaurants located in downtown. There is a range from cheap to classy, but you can almost always find a place to fill your craving."
College Sophomore,5,I love ASC because of the personalization I get. Teachers and staff know me by my name and take time to talk to me and listen to me if I need them.
College Sophomore,5,"ASC has a collectively open mind and is very accepting of diversity. Over 100 countries are represented by the student population and the school sponsors the local refugee school's lunch where young girls come to campus and eat and can talk to the students. Some of the college students volunteer to teach English to the girls at this school and to the students on campus who don't speak English as their first language. The LGBT community is also very active on our campus. We have ""safe zones"" and safe zone trainings which are free and open to everyone where students can come and open up about their thoughts and opinions without judgement. This is very helpful for the LGBT community as well as one of the reasons that the school has such an accepting atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love living on campus.
College Freshman,5,The off- campus dining is amazing there is everything you want within walking distance.
College Freshman,5,The local weather is not all that bad it is never too hot or too cold. The only time it is really cold is when it snows.
College Freshman,5,The academics are amazing with a degree from Agnes you'll be sure to get a job.
College Freshman,5,"In Atlanta there is the Marta, there are buses and a bus line that is cheap."
College Freshman,5,Downtown Decatur is the best. It is just five minutes away from Atlanta and there is always something to do.
College Freshman,5,"The school is very accepting and judge free. They encourage diversity and promote it. Through clubs and different organizations, everything is accepted."
College Freshman,5,There are many internships around. Being in Atlanta there is an internship for everyone. The advisers are very helpful in getting internships for the students.
College Freshman,5,The school is very strict adn if you break any rules you get a j board case where you could potentially be kicked out.
College Freshman,5,I love my classes and the professors are phenomenal
College Freshman,5,The campus looks beautiful in any weather!
College Freshman,5,"Agnes is probably the most accepting school around, everyone is welcome"
College Freshman,5,Literally everywhere you look in Decatur there is food
College Freshman,5,If drugs exists on campus I am not aware of the use.
College Freshman,5,My school has a friendly and cozy atmosphere. The classes are challenging and the Professors are really nice and helpful. They really make an afford to get to know you and help you understand the material. The campus is beautiful and is hosting wedding almost every weekend.  
College Freshman,5,The campus is small so weather does not affect us.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Agnes Scott was the fact that we have a very tight-knit community and that everyone is so caring and nice. I really enjoyed my first year on campus. However, I did wish there were more diversity when it came to food. Sometimes, I would eat out in Decatur Square if it was getting too repetitive. I do like how we are nearby to the MARTA station (train). Makes it easier to get to shopping malls or around the city.

The first year dorm rooms were quite nice. Very spacious and cozy; however, the lift (elevator) would need some work. Sometimes it wouldn’t work, and it was a bit of a hassle, especially during move in day when I had to bring everything up the stairs onto the third floor.

Other than that, I do enjoy my academics. The professors are kind and understanding and also very supportive, especially when everything moved online. My professors were willing to give extensions when I was struggling, which is a plus

Overall, a great experience, despite COVID."
Sophomore,4,"I loved my classes online, the professors were very accommodating. I was so happy that my advisor was also there to help me too. As I mentioned, I was very happy that everyone was so supportive and accommodating."
Junior,4,Agnes made a lot of effort in order to facilitate online learning. They really did the best they could with the time they had. It wasn't perfect but it was a very good way of transitioning. They reached out and communicated a lot.
Freshman,4,The sense of community at Agnes Scoitt is honestly one of the best aspects of the school. Trust me if you have never attended a college a university before this little small detail is important or else you may feel as though you are being washed out in a see of your peers.
Niche User,4,"It is a very good campus with an amazing environment. They are very friendly and very open but if you are going to go here, you need to bank on scholarships, your parent's pockets and other forms of money because its very expensive to live on campus. $13,000+ to live on campus."
Freshman,4,I'm only a freshman going into my second semester and I think my experience so far has been pretty decent. I think the school choice was best for my personality and interest which is can be best described as interdisciplinary. The people here are eclectic and the staff/ faculty are relatively nice. Only short coming so far would be the difficulty to change dissatisfactory conditions/policies and some overselling of accommodations advertised to incoming students.
Freshman,4,"Agnes Scott is a good school, but many facilities are outdated and could use repair. 
Although the education you will receive at Agnes is amazing and it does set you up well for life experiences, the actual fact of living on campus is difficult. 
The expenses of housing are great, the facilities are sub par, and the food is somewhat edible on a good day. 
At Agnes, you'll likely have classes you love in a room with no A/C."
Sophomore,4,"Agnes is great! They really personalize your learning experience and you never felt left behind by the community. Some teachers and classes are more difficult than your average class however, that just comes with the territory. It's truly a great place both academically and socially."
Sophomore,4,Agnes Scott College is such a different environment than anywhere else. The sisterhood we share is amazing and everywhere you look there is somewhere there to help you and understand. I absolutely love the teachers and the learning environment Agnes provides. All teachers are so easy to come talk to and always a short email away to answer or solve any questions/problems you have.
Sophomore,4,"Agnes Scott is such a fantastic college! Everyone is super nice and try their best to help you achieve the goals you have set forth for yourself. The only concern I have with Agnes is financial accessibility. The tuition is a lot to handle and since it is a private school, grants and aid are a little less than that for public schools."
Freshman,4,Agnes is a really nice place. It's a small and cozy campus and everyone really about each other especially your professors and advisers. They will always go out of their way to ensure that you are happy and comfortable. The classes are really rigorous and you have to study a lot including during the weekends to get good grades. I wish Agnes Scott had a larger international student body.
Sophomore,4,Agnes Scott is the ideal school for a student who wants an immersive liberal arts education in a small learning environment
Sophomore,4,"Agnes makes me have hope for the future, so many people from different backgrounds, places and lives, there not only to learn but educate one another and make an impact on the world around them."
Graduate Student,4,This school is so remarkable! There is so much you can learn about yourself from enrolling into a liberal arts college. The professors and classes are challenging. There is so much room for academic fluidity in the college with respect to courses.
Freshman,4,I am an incoming freshman but the student life is very interactive and the professors nurture you as an individual.
Junior,4,Agnes Scott is a great academic environment. Most of my professors are Ivy League scholars and have high expectations for their students. The campus is a very safe space and is quite accepting.
Freshman,4,"This is a great school! The professors really do care about each individual student. Since class sizes are much smaller, professors are able to have a one on one experience with students and they are able to get better help. Everyone at the school is so friendly and welcoming and allows everyone to be themselves without being judged. We all work together to fight issues, whether they be on campus or out in the world. It is right next to downtown Decatur, which is a great place for college students to hang out or to study. There are very few parties on campus so you have to go off campus to get to any, but this is helpful for anyone who is not looking for the party scene."
Alum,4,"I loved the atmosphere of Agnes, it was the reason I chose to go in the first place. But while I was there, no one prepared us for what would come after and that's been a real struggle."
Niche User,4,"Agnes Scott College is a lovely college residing in beautiful downtown Decatur, Georgia. The sports program is great and competitive; I was a former basketball player there. The academics are good as well. Overall, Agnes Scott College encourages women to strive to be the best that they can be."
Freshman,4,"Agnes Scott is a really tradition school that everyone is together. The school reached out to the students which allow students to feel like home at a new campus. Agnes Scott has it so the staff is really welcoming, and makes the campus feel alive. The students all seem to be involved, and they also have a lot of good connections which allows their students to succeed to the next step of their life."
Freshman,4,Agnes Scott College is a welcoming school filled with professors that care how their students and want them to succeed in their goals. 
College Freshman,4,Professors are friendly and are excited to teach
College Freshman,4,Plenty of connections with alumni.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, it's a good experience. I love my professors and advisers and I never have to worry about the grass becoming uncontrollably high or dead-looking."
College Sophomore,4,"Networking is a huge aspect in campus life. Alumnis are usually very outgoing, friendly, and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,I feel fairly safe around campus. We can always contact public safety if we feel we are in danger.
College Sophomore,4,Agnes is great for academics. Each professor is an expert in his/her field. They are extremely helpful and genuinely care about each students success.
College Sophomore,4,"Agnes Scott doesn't have as many major/minor options as larger schools, but the existing programs are strong. Professors and advisors are genuinely interested in and care about students. Most professors are reasonable enough to talk about rescheduling exams or extending due dates, and they encourage students to come to office hours and seek tutoring options. Advisors and professors are also willing to discuss self-designed majors with students."
College Junior,4,"Student career prospects are great. A degree from Agnes will give you plenty of opportunities after college. The Career and Internship Development Department is great. We can have our resumes updated and fixed, have mock interviews, and match internships to your major. They even offer outfits to wear to your interview. Alumni also offer jobs and internships. Agnes will prepare you for life after college."
College Junior,4,The courses are great and very diverse. I had fun. All of the class sizes are small and the environment is so open. You can say anything within its limit without being judged or feeling overwhelmed. The professors are great. All the professors have Masters and Doctors making them experts in their field. They encourage the students to speak their mind and stand up for what they believe in.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus. Campus security is great and very friendly
College Junior,4,Agnes Scott College is a great school. It has wonderful professors who will help you become successful in your specific field and you will definitely feel ready to enter into the adult world after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are rigorous but not unmanageable. Most professors are very helpful, but you have to ask for it. In most classes, professors would prefer students join in the conversation and discuss topics and readings instead of simply lecturing, especially in humanities and social science courses."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are vigorous and challenging, but some professors aren't as helpful as I wish they would be. Most professors though are willing to do whatever it takes for their students to be successful. The class size range from about 15-30 and are manageable."
College Sophomore,4,I am an athlete so a lot of my student life revolves around athletics. I wish there was some more support of the athletics but with this being an all girls school I understand that not everybody is interested in sports.
College Sophomore,4,Other than continuously struggling financially I love this school. I just often have trouble covering the expenses that are required to attend Agnes Scott.
College Freshman,4,"Campus is pretty safe. It's small, so you don't have to spend a lot of time outside where things could get sketchy. Campus security service is really friendly, easy to contact, and genuinely interested in the safety and well-being of the students."
College Senior,4,It's a great school where you can truly grow into the optimal version of yourself.
College Senior,4,I definitely feel safe at Agnes Scott and I know they will help in anyway they can if something happens off campus.
College Senior,4,It's a great place to live as a student and they are planning lots of renovation for the halls that need to be updated.
College Senior,4,"I love it academically, but socially it can be a little different than the average college. I feel like I will thrive when I graduate though and that is what is important."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the time it's good. Some resident halls don't have A/C due to age, but the school is working on this. Wi-Fi can be spotty sometimes. Bathrooms and kitchenettes are generally kept clean; cleanliness drops on the weekends when custodial staff don't come in, and students don't always clean up after themselves in common areas."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, athletes are nice, friendly students, and coaches and other athletic staff are generally approachable and easy to talk to. Most student-athletes juggle school and sports fairly well. Academic success is always given priority over athletic success."
College Freshman,4,"On any given day, you can look in your inbox and see some kind of email related to job fairs or internships or different programs being hosted at the school. My personal study (music and theatre) just by nature doesn't really lend to a whole lot of open opportunities, but I am still able to make connections with my professors that could eventually lead to job possibilities."
College Junior,4,The safety department treats each female student as each student is their daughter. That's why the safety is so good.
College Junior,4,I love ASC! The professors empower and engage the students to go beyond their comfort zone. No one has never told me no when I ask to try  new things or approaches. All my professors have been great. We have become friends.
College Junior,4,"The alumni network is called the Black Ring Mafia. These ladies are very active and supportive in helping students. They are great. In my interactions, these ladies have been very helpful. The career planning and placement office is very hard working. We are constantly given info about opportunities."
College Junior,4,Best college for educating and developing female leaders. Best fit for me!
College Freshman,4,"I love the fact that my school is very small and the campus is easily accessible. It only takes me five minutes to get to each class and I'm very happy that this gives me a chance to get some extra sleep. I also like the personal attention I receive from professors and the fact that it is easy for me to build connections and stand out among everyone else. I also enjoy the fact that my school is very quiet and allows me to focus on my studies. Even though this school is not for everyone, if I could go through the college application process again, I would make the same choice. I think this school is a great fit for me, since it allows me to focus on classes during the week and explore a great city - Atlanta - on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,Great school. I love it. Not much bad to say about it.
College Freshman,4,Agnes is beautiful.  The financial aid I received was quite helpful and overall everyone is friendly.
College Freshman,4,Everyone at Agnes is super helpful and contribute to great experience.
College Freshman,4,"While the stereotypical view of college food is bad, Agnes Scott provides great food."
College Freshman,4,While unfortunately money is still an issue for me the financial aid I received is helpful.
College Freshman,4,The housing options are all great and beautiful. There are no bad options.
College Freshman,4,"All the restaurants around campus are good, there's a lot of options to choose from. The costs are reasonable and the area around campus is definitely a foodie's paradise."
College Freshman,4,"For the most part I enjoyed the food/dining options. The food was definitely healthier than what most college cafeterias serve. The food however was a bit generic, either it had no taste at all or it tried too hard to have flavor."
College Freshman,4,Only off-campus housing aside from staying home is Avery Glen.
College Freshman,4,"Many different options, kinda pricey but not too expensive."
College Freshman,4,"Good financial aid amount, easy to receive"
Alum,2,"In the admissions process this school acts like it is inclusive and supportive of all walks of life but in reality they are supportive of gay and African American students. They marginalize all others and are particularly discriminative towards non-traditional students. Very few classes are available and you will end up taking classes elsewhere. Transfers can't bring their GPAs. If you are not a young African American or LGBTQ, go someplace that will accept you as you are and save yourself a ton of money in the process."
Sophomore,2,"All of my classes were transferred online due to coronavirus. While a few of my professors were understanding of current circumstances and the state of the world, many were non-lenient and unforgiving with grading."
Sophomore,2,I believe that the college is too expensive and they do not provide what they promise. When I was at the college for my first month I was sick because of there being a black mold in my air vent. When I requested for a new air vent I never got it and ended up having to buy a makeshift AC unit.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of a night life on campus itself, but it's pretty easy to get to other universities, houses, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only two or three major parties on campus throughout the year. It's easy to get to off campus parties though, and it's nice to be able to escape the parties and noise."
College Freshman,2,"In terms of being close to your classes, it can't be better. But first year housing is a nightmare. The bathrooms (particularly the showers) are not well maintained. The hot water is constantly going out, and the tiles and paint have been getting worse and worse over time. Also, the washer-dryer situation in Winship is horrendous, we are constantly having to go to the other dorm buildings to finish our laundry. The only nice dorm building is Campbell, but that has very few suits, and is far too expensive for most to afford. Main, Inman, and Rebekah to not have proper heating/AC situations, and lack a proper kitchen."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much variety, the meal plan is limited, the hours are ridiculous and inconvenient"
College Sophomore,2,"ASC has a policy where students who don't live within 30 miles of the campus are required to live on-campus. There is only one off-campus housing opition and that is located at the apartment complex next to the school. The only reason this rating got a ""it's bad"" is because it is the only off-campus housing option. Other than that, everything is very good about these apartments. They come fully furnished and with a kitchen. There is ample parking and you can choose who lives in the apaartment with you. There are options for 2 people, 3 people (share a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment), and 4 people (share a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment). I'm not sure if there is an option for a single person apartment. There probably is though."
College Freshman,2,wifi is terrible & slow & barely works
College Freshman,2,Our wifi on campus goes in and out regularly.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a total of 3 notable on-campus parties throughout the whole year. To party, a student will more likely have to get off campus and make their own fun. Transportation is annoying whether you have a car or not; nothing is close by or convenient. "
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of options of what to do, but it takes a while to find out what you like."
College Freshman,2,There is only one apartment complex that upper class students can live in and it is literally 5 minutes walking distance from the school. You must live there or on campus.
College Junior,2,"Athletics, the student center, and the dining hall are the three major areas on campus that need improvement. We have a new fitness center, but the main gym and the track and field need some improvement. The dining hall sucks! There are very few and poor vegetarian studies. The student center is okay, but no one can hang out there really because of all of the offices. "
College Junior,2,Our campus isn't very strict. The only thing that our campus is pretty strict about is the honor code. 
College Junior,2,"You can always find something if you really want to, but you actually have to try and find things to do. "
College Junior,2,"If people do drugs, which I'm sure they do, no one really knows about it. Alcohol is much more widely used though. Our school does a lot of alcohol awareness and safety training. "
College Junior,2,Things are always breaking in the dorms. 
College Junior,2,We only have girls and they're okay. Kind of ugly
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is okay, but a constant battle"
College Junior,2,"Parking is okay, but it's too expensive. "
College Sophomore,2,There are no guys at Agnes Scott. You have to go to events at other campuses to meet them.
College Sophomore,2,The school encourages everyone to live on campus for all four years. Almost no one commutes.
College Junior,2,"So many student on campus have cars so getting the perfect spot is not ideal. With that being said, there is always a spot in the parking deck and since the campus isn't that huge you won't have to walk that far from the parking deck to your destination."
College Freshman,2,Wireless Network Mediorcre – The computer labs are okay but you are better off with personal computer unless you wish to spend most of your time in the library.
College Freshman,2,On the MARTA  Bus – there is little to no nightlife unless you love movie nights with your friends. However there are plenty of school within a train ride which will gladly accommodate girls from Agnes Scott
College Freshman,2,"Southern Comfort – The food is very greasy and very southern style. There isn't much change in day to day food. After freshman year, save your money on the meal plan so you can eat out as there are many affordable places off and around campus to eat."
College Senior,2,Most of the drug problems at ASC involve misuse of prescription drugs or marijuana.
College Senior,2,No Off-Campus – Living off-campus is very expensive unless you are living with your parents. ASC is a residential community so I doubt that many students opt to live off-campus for cost reasons.
College Freshman,2,"Overpriced Crap – Salty, bland, and repetitive.
I stick to the salad bar everyday because I can't stand the stuff they cook. There's fried chicken every Wednesday and tacos every Friday. Blech. The coffee sucks and they always run out of lactaid. The cereal selection sucks, it's all sugary junk. They also need to diversify their fruit selection."
College Freshman,2,"Fitness room is small, but adequate. Library is gorgeous and spacious. Dorms? NOT like palaces by any means. Walter's is disgusting. The tiled floors remind me of cafeterias/bathrooms. The walls are gross with all of the paint peeling off. The showers and bathrooms are so disgusting and everything is old, old, old. The lounge is so gross you'll never want to hang out in it."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a small pocket of women that regularly smoke weed and get high using whatever other drugs.  But overall, if you don't ask around you would never know people at Agnes Scott knew what weed was.
The judicial and honor court scare most people into going off campus for anything drug related."
College Junior,2,"The City of Decatur – Decatur is a fun place to be, but it's extremely family-friendly, so no ragers will be found here. Atlanta, a few miles further, has lots to offer, but you have to have a car!"
College Junior,2,"My Education Counts – While Agnes Scott has a good education, we are currently losing money and classes are being cut. What fun this time is for all of us."
College Senior,2,"Policy can be pretty strict at Agnes, and the consequences of underage drinking/substance abuse/rule-breaking can get serious. Most of the time a slap on the wrist is granted to first-time offenders, as long as no illegal drugs were involved, but that's you're only strike.

There are a few crowds who'd rat you out, but if you keep to the right people and practice, it's also pretty easy not to get caught. And most of the time, no one really WANTS to get you in trouble...so just beware of the dorms!"
College Junior,2,"Don't Bother – The people at Agnes emphasize that the school is a residential one. Correspondingly, I am told by students who have tried that the administration will be A PAIN IN THE ASS, if you want to try and live off campus. IMHO, don't bother- the dorms here are pretty damn good, and you have the option for apartment living as an upperclassman."
College Junior,2,"The Library has many many computers, but unfortunately they all fill up rather quickly.  Most of your classes post the reading materials online that you have to read for class, and communication only occurs through email. You have to write many, many papers. Having a computer makes life much easier.   The internet is really good, and is always available, and is accessible from anywhere on campus. Printing is not that important because most of the time you submit your essays via email."
College Junior,2,"The Night Life at Agnes Scott and in Downtown Decatur is quiet and great for anyone who wants a quiet evening. The school will have activities such as movie showings and student fun nights.  Most students go to Georgia Tech for parties and downtown Atlanta to drink. Getting there is very easy, due to the proximity of MARTA to Agnes Scott."
College Junior,2,"The Housing Process is fair and simple.  The dorms really need improvement. Many of them have mold and some of them, such as Hopkins Hall, are in very poor shape. The nicer dorms do not have air conditioning. The atmosphere is fine, but the cost of housing is much too high for dorms of this quality."
College Senior,2,"Guest Sign-In? First-years are not allowed overnight guests during the week.  No guest is allowed to stay more than three nights in a two-week period. I understand the ""guest on the hall"" notification policy, (with community bathrooms and kitchens it's only considerate), but student and guest must sign the guest onto and off of a hall at the RA's room."
Freshman,1,"I wouldn't recommend going to Agnes Scott College. When you go on the campus for a tour, they make the school seem better than what it is and it's not. This school has a lot of underlying issues that need to be fixed. I thought when I got to school, ALL the professors would want their students to succeed. If you get a bad professor, you're guaranteed to get a C or below in the course. I had problems with my financial aid and the financial aid office told me to ""reconsider my options or drop out"". The athletic department couldn't help me as their best athlete either. My advisor tried to change my major because she believed I needed to change my career from medicine to ""something else"". I ended up leaving ASC because the school couldn't help me with my financial aid. If your parents have money, then you will succeed in this university. If not, please reconsider a cheaper and better school."
College Sophomore,1,"some buildings are very old, have no air conditioning"
College Sophomore,1,We don't really have a Greek life. We have a few academic Greek chapters but no social ones. We have this motto that we're all sisters so we don't need Greek life....
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Junior,1,We have no greek life unless a student wants to join at either Ga Tech or Emory
College Freshman,1,"The party scene at my school is pretty much dead. Aside from the big dances, no one from other colleges go to Agnes. Everyone at Agnes has to go off campus for a good party/social scene. I hope in the future Agnes changes this."
College Freshman,1,I feel like we really do need a lot more vibrant social life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek Life
College Freshman,1,"There is one ""fraternity"" and it is a music group. You have to go to another campus for Greek life."
College Freshman,1,The MARTA is available and you will probably need it to go off campus unless you have a car.
College Freshman,1,There is only one apartment that is off campus.  If you want to live off campus and not in that apartment its pretty hard to do so.  Decatur is pretty expensive and Agnes does not allow it.
College Junior,1,"There is no nightlife at Agnes Scott. Everyone who enjoys partying usually ends up at one of the other schools nearby-- Georgia Tech, Morehouse, etc."
College Sophomore,1,students are only allowed to live off campus with parents or husbands.
College Junior,1,I have never seen someone do drugs at Agnes. I'm sure it exists but I have never seen or heard someone talk about doing drugs.
College Freshman,1,"Evans Dining Hall Vs Mollies – Evans dining hall is pitiful. Never consistent in the amount  of for, this place is a last recruit for most students. The food itself,  is always too salty and the health options are never actually tasteful."
College Freshman,1,"All Girls School – It's all an girls school. Guys are here in your Senior level classes, but other than that you'll have all girl classes. Great for non distractions, but if you are a lesbian you still have that distraction."
College Senior,1,"Diverse and Exclusive – Agnes Scott is extremely diverse in some ways more than others. For example, ethnically, there are a lot of cultures represented amongst international students--and this is truly the only diversity you can count on. Almost everyone is liberal and EVERYONE is FEMALE. I found myself on the ""outside"" of many social groups because I am just a white, straight female and most students classify themselves as ""gay"" or ""christian"" or ""a member of such-and-such club/group"". Look no further than the Agnes Scott Dining Hall. The exclusive rich girls (colonnade club) hang with other exclusive rich girls, the asians stick together, the black girls often sit in groups, the lesbians usually band together in various love triangles, the christian girls often sit away from everyone else to pray for them. It's outrageously polarized and everyone is ready to be offended at the drop of a hat. If you go to Agnes Scott, expect to make a very small group of friends (if you're lucky!) and rarely venture outside of that group. This is not necessarily a positive thing because you will likely form your group early on and if you have issues with them down the road, other groups have already formed and they won't want to let you ""in"". Ask yourself if that cattiness and exclusivity sounds like a ""diverse and honorable"" experience to you!"
College Junior,1,Very difficult to live off campus.  The closest thing the college offers is Apartments that they own.
College Sophomore,1,"Oh, My Goodness. Dorms Like Palaces? Um, No. The rooms are a good size.... and that is the only good thing about them. Most of these dorms, located down in the deep south of Georgia, don't even have air conditioning! The buildings are very old and full of mold- I've known several people who left campus because of it. My roommate and I both got infections related to mold and had to move out of our dorm after a leaking roof created mold and water damage on our walls and ceilings. The dorms are about five minutes walking distance from the classes."

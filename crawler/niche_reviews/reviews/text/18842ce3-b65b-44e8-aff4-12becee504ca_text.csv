Freshman,5,I like online classes. The professors all are great both online and in person. The professors make it seem you are in the actual classroom.
Freshman,5,"I like Babson overall. I enjoy the campus environment, the classes, and the people. I like living in the dorm  and going to their fitness center"
Sophomore,5,"Babson helps you build connections and networks that will help launch your career paths. 

Additionally, the professors truly want you to succeed. The support you get t Babson cannot be matched by any other university."
Sophomore,5,The professors were extremely considerate and tried to make online classes the most convenient for their students.
Sophomore,5,"Babson College is well known for entrepreneurship. The classes and students are all business focused and through these classes you truly learn how to be a successful entrepreneur. The classes are challenging and the professors are amazing. Through office hours you can establish relationships with professors which may help you if you plan to create a business or need help with a class. There are multitudes of other resources on campus to help you if you plan to create a business and resources/tutoring for classes. Overall, the academics are the best part of the Babson experience. Honestly, the going out scene is not great because the school is so small and the students are so diverse. The people that go out on campus are mostly on sports teams and in fraternities and sororities. Through this, you get close to a smaller group of people and have a good time because you can always see someone you know on campus. The food has gotten better in recent years."
Sophomore,5,"I took classes online when they moved online because of the corona virus. Overall, Babson did a very good job of accommodating for the new class structure and I was pleased with my experience."
Junior,5,"I think Babson has been the best decision I have made. Regardless of some up and down experiences with professors(which is normal), the over experience has been very ->diverse, international-friendly, open, and encouraging.  You feel supported on the campus by the faculty and professors. The ambitiousness of your fellow students keeps you moving forward as well. And housing and dining have been improving over the years. Highly recommended!"
Senior,5,"I loved the community, it's so unique. I feel like the people you meet at Babson are ones you want to stick around for all your life. They're supportive and create a really nice environment. Since the campus is really small you get to really make a lot of meaningful friendships with the faculty and students."
Senior,5,"Amazing experience at Babson College. Although Academics wasn't rated the best, there are some amazing professors and I love that basically each class had a group project or presentation. I had most of my learning though in opportunities outside of class."
Niche User,5,Babson College is unique and teaches in a business-oriented setting. It is small and a connected community and allows students for a high quality business education.
Alum,5,Great place to go to school. Professors care about you and every course helps your personal and career development. I'm 8 months post-grad and can't believe how much I learned at Babo has come up in my work. Being close to Boston opens a ton of doors as well.
Freshman,5,"So far, Babson has been incredible. Faculty are dedicated to the success of their students in the classroom, and the administration seems set on making the student living experience as enjoyable as possible. Everyone is driven to succeed, and although the course load often seems overwhelming the environment created by the student body is encouraging. I just wish more people would attend athletic events! The teams here are amazing! I will note that a few if the buildings feel  a little out dated."
Junior,5,The new President of the college is changing the campus with a vision of the future. The college is improving tremendously!
Sophomore,5,"I am amazed at how ethically focused the business education is. It's also is the safest setting I have seen adolescents indulge in partying irresponsibly. The safety department holds true to their title, they really prove to be our friends in the cause for safety. The campus is small and comfortable, and is currently finalizing the finishing touches on its renovations celebratory of its centennial. Greater racial diversity within the staff is encouraged."
Niche User,5,The academics were great and you can major in whatever field you wish to. Babson lets you follow your dreams and the campus is great!
Alum,5,Babson College is a very special school. Only come here if you know you want to do business thought.
Freshman,5,"I am loving the college so far. The campus is gorgeous, the classes are manageable, and there is a good atmosphere to the school."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and people here. Everyone is really nice and teachers are very supportive and helpful.
Junior,5,"Babson is a beautiful campus with fantastic opportunities. There are so many ways to be connected on campus that your network will become one of your biggest assets with a Babson degree. The student and faculty base is made up of very successful entrepreneurs, and if you have any desire to start a business at some point in the future, Babson is the place for you."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful and inclusive atmosphere that caters to people with a wide variety of interests. Notorious for its academics and very promising of a high Return on Investment following graduation.
Sophomore,5,"Such an inspiring school! While it is considered a business school, so many different people with varying backgrounds combine their personal interests with their passion for business to create unique careers and opportunities for themselves and others. The school often promotes diversity and inclusion, but they could work a little harder on the inclusion portion!"
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely amazing! Good Professors that have tons of business experience. The alumni association is supportive. We recently held our centennial and that is changing up the campus a lot in a better positive way. We are building a new recreational center, library, and park. The location is priceless if you love the suburban vibe. We are right across the Wellesley Country Club. The food is dramatically improving."
Senior,5,"Babson is a great school with many resources and great professors with real-world experience. It is a good place to get your hands dirty if you put the effort in. They could definitely work on the food and housing, considering the tuition."
Freshman,5,"Babson is unlike any other institution. If you are at all interested in Business and want to make money with a great career, go here. Every person here is unique and amazing. The small school dynamic is special, and we are all fondled here by the staff unlike state schools which have automated systems. Small, personal classes with hands on learning define this school. If you want to party, you can join greek life or an org, or go out in Boston. A car on campus helps but if you don't have one, your friend probably will. A LOT of international students as well, definitely a plus."
Freshman,5,Babson has a very small undergraduate student population. I love it because it forms a tight community for the students. The dorms are amazing and cozy. All the dorms are on campus so it is easy to commute to class and back. The classes are also small so you can really connect with the professors and learn more. There are many student resources on campus to help you land internships or study abroad.
Sophomore,5,"Very good academics unlike other schools which have big lecture halls. At Babson, you are expected to be very engaged in class and do your work. Everything is perfect at Babson except the location. On weekends, a lot of people go to Boston which is about a 20-30 minute drive. Babson is definitely worth it if you plan on pursuing a business career. The people you make connections here are worth it alone. We don't get much attention college rankings since its a school that only has business as a major but the academic environment here is definitely top tier."
Junior,5,Love Babson. Professors and community really care about their students and are dedicated to helping you find your path.
Sophomore,5,"So far, my experience has been great! The school gave me the opportunity to network with people from all around the world. It has truly opened the doors to many opportunities."
Freshman,5,"Amazing experience so far. At first I was nervous about the social life and strength of academics, but so far I could not have made a better decision. My classes are challenging, but manageable and I've already made a great group of friends."
College Freshman,5,So I got lucky in the lottery and got Park Manor West. I might be biased but it is the best residence hall here. The rooms are way bigger than the ones in Forest Hall and PMW is located quite near all the classroom halls. A lot of activities are also held in proximity to PMW. There's barely any party in PMW which suits me perfectly.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"The career opportunities if you have a degree from this school are endless. The top places in business around the world, LOVE Babson students. We're just better, ranked number 1 for Return on Investment actually!"
College Sophomore,5,"Top rated for return on investment, and a great atmosphere."
College Senior,5,"Because of the brand, many companies hire Babson grads"
College Senior,5,"Amazing professors, great camp[us location and well known brand"
College Senior,5,The school really cares about the well being of each student
College Senior,5,"Very straight forward and included an in person interview, which was nice"
College Sophomore,5,Love the environment and community. The professors know what they are talking about and have experience in their respective fields. The college does a lot for their students and the opportunities afterwards are awesome.
College Junior,5,Everyone on campus is very nice and willing to help me when i need it.
College Freshman,5,Very safe campus overall. You never feel unsafe at Babson.
College Freshman,5,"Babson gives out a lot of money in financial aid. Many different types of scholarships, and the scholars retreat is so much fun! Not to worry about aid if you can not completely afford babson, some type of aid is generally common unless your parents can afford Babson out of pocket."
College Sophomore,5,School is very generous with financial aid and goes the extra mile to accommodate most students.
College Sophomore,5,"A hands on education that is very centered around student success in the real world, fantastic education. Very unique curriculum and plenty of internship opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,"Only one major offered, but the college offers ways to broaden your education beyond just entrepreneurship."
College Freshman,5,Babson is known for being the most diverse college in the U.S. More than 30% of the student population come from areas outside of the U.S.
College Freshman,5,Babson specializes in entrepreneurship- they encourage students to apply entrepreneurial thought and action to every situation they encounter in life- be it starting their own business or simply trying to solve  a problem.
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of opinions. If you go here, be ready to work. Hard."
College Freshman,5,iF YOU NEED IT YOU WILL GET MONEY.
College Freshman,5,there is only one major
College Freshman,5,"They're really good teachers, all with degrees from great universities. "
College Junior,5,"We have a lot of Diversity, due to the fact of the high international presence. Also there is a lot of diversity when it comes to economical background because the school is able to award funds to students who show promise. There is a little bit of everything here but things do tend to get very cliquey"
College Sophomore,5,I love the business education that can be used at babson. its extremely useful and up to date
College Student,5,Delicious food and variety! love the pizza and pasta
College Student,5,Campus police are always around to make sure everyone is safe. Health services is convenient and available for the most part
College Freshman,5,"Babson is an amazingly diverse community, and one that I am proud to say I am apart of. It is almost a mini United Nations on our campus the way so many countries, states, and cultures are represented. If you can think of a country, odds are there is a Babson student on campus from that country."
College Senior,5,Babson has provided me all the financial aid I've needed. It's been an easy process. The people who work in the financial aid office are super helpful.
College Freshman,5,So much diversity at Babson. About 35 to 40% of the school is international students and there is a ton of diversity in the school.
College Freshman,5,All Babson students are issued their own laptops freshman year for four years of their education.  These computers have all of the programs on them that they will need in classes.
College Freshman,5,I can't say the words to describe my college experience up here. Not enough room to do that. If you want to know info about my college experience email me at mwilkerson1@babson.edu or friend me on facebook. Too many emotions and amazing things to sum up on College Prowler. All I can say though is that Babson has CHANGED my life in every positive way possible.
College Freshman,5,"Best people. I love the ""I don't give a f***"" mentality that is on campus. This makes people way less judgemental and chill unlike many other colleges. I respect that people do their own thing and don't try to impress (which they end up doing because they are themselves). I have tapped into endless creativity becuase of it becuase I don't fear rejection. Inspriring open-minded folks who take action. Met some of my best friends here already. My suggestion is to not only chill with your inner circles, but move outside them as people are open to seeing new people. Also, don't make it a habit to get drunk with frats every other night lol (but they are cool too)."
Freshman,4,Phenomenal experiences. Classes are great and get a lot out of it. Social life can be a bit better though.
Sophomore,4,I like the close-knit community and small class sizes. Professors are very good with a lot of experience. High level of diversity with a big percentage of international students.
Senior,4,Babson is a great school. I very much enjoyed my time here. Don't come in expecting a party school: the scene can get kind of dry after 4 years. The academics are top notch and provide a holistic view of the business world.
Alum,4,"Babson is cool but very niche and focused (on business vs a liberal arts college).  But out of most of the ""B"" schools, Babson is the best."
Senior,4,"My experience at Babson college has been fantastic from an educational perspective. The course work has been tremendous for anyone who wants a future career in business and the large majority of professors I have had have been fantastic. The school is very diverse, located in a great area, and feels safe at all times. I would strongly recommend Babson to anyone who knows that they want to pursue a business related career."
Freshman,4,"Babson College has amazing professor and motivated students. The courses are difficult but manageable. Babson emphasizes entrepreneurial mindset in almost all of its classes and even clubs and organizations. The dining hall on campus is very average, but not terrible. The surrounding Wellesley area is very nice and surburban. Boston is about 30 mins away."
Works Here,4,"Great and engaging community, great setting rural setting just outside of Boston.  A beautiful campus and challenging academic program."
Graduate Student,4,The professors are outstanding - always willing to help and are incredibly experienced in their respective fields. Great school for aspiring entrepreneurs!
Freshman,4,"Babson has been a phenomenal experience thus far. The professors genuinely care and push you to be your best, and the courses are pleasingly challenging. Campus is gorgeous and the people the populate it are great. If I were to change anything about it, I would want it to be a bit bigger (maybe 3,000 students) so that you have the small campus feel and community but see more faces around."
College Freshman,4,Babson wasn't my number one choice to be honest. I thought I would hate it here but I find myself liking it. The people here are really nice. Mostly anyone would be friends with you if you just reach out and say hi. I've seen some of students asking other students (strangers) to sit with them when they are alone. The professors are generally nice and willing to help.
College Freshman,4,The professors are pretty qualified. Take Fetters.
College Freshman,4,"Dorms are pretty nice, and pretty specious."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is safe, I've never felt uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,4,"Babson gets an A+ in academics: great professors, great advisors, small intimate class settings."
College Sophomore,4,"They've been re-doing a lot of the housing options on campus, and they're great. Lots of spacious rooms."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of greeks are dedicated to it, but hold no prejudice towards non-greeks."
College Senior,4,I have not seen the inside of campus houseing
College Freshman,4,"Everything here is good so far. It's not what I expected to go coming out of high school as I wanted to go to a larger university with a better social life and with nice sports teams. However I did want to study business and this was one of the best business schools in the Northeast and I got a lot of financial aid so I considered here. After coming here, it was one of the best decisions I have made so far and I really enjoy it here. It's small but a good size and I love the professors, subjects, atmosphere and most things about it."
College Junior,4,"Greek life isn't like big southern schools, but its my favorite part of Babson. People are committed and loyal their chapters, but still have non-Greek friends."
College Junior,4,"Wellesley has plenty of restaurants for everyone, though pricey. Boston is only 30 min away."
College Junior,4,"The administration is easy to get along with, though they have strict rules that are enforced inconsistently. You have to be really stupid and/or drunk to get in trouble."
College Junior,4,"Babson has many merit scholarships, one thing that attracted me in the first place. I was able to receive a half-tuition merit scholarship through a simple essay application and interview overnight trip. The financial aid office is responsive, but it's up to the student to take responsibility for submitting the appropriate documents."
Recent Alumnus,4,The dorms are clean. The cost is high but it is worth it in the quality of education.
College Freshman,4,Babson requires the CSS Profile which makes the FAFSA feel like a breeze.
College Freshman,4,I am very close to everything on campus. My dorm room is spacious even as a triple. I have suite style bathrooms that are cleaned weekly.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of recruitment on Babson campus for jobs and internships, just be good at Networking!"
College Freshman,4,"Babson is beautiful, they like to update many facilities as the years go by."
College Freshman,4,Rigorous course load. Keep checking your syllabus for each class!
College Freshman,4,"Health and safety is a priority for Babson, it really is a safe campus. I walk alone at around 1-4am across campus safely."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus police could take a more proactive approach to alcohol abuse versus focusing on parking violations, but over all the campus police do a good job."
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms vary old to new. Some lack A/C, but that is not a huge problem. Overall the dorms are nice, the living learning communities promote a great family atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,Babson college's financial aid assistance was one of the main reasons I went to this school.
College Freshman,4,There's an available Roche & whole foods store that you can shop at. There are also some very good restaurants.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a great way to stay involved socially on campus.
College Freshman,4,I'm confident that Babson will push me to attain great things through its connections.
College Freshman,4,Babson is flexible with whatever students want to pursue. The resources and connection this school has is incredible.
College Freshman,4,Wellesley is a very expensive town to live in & as such it's often hard to find off campus living that close enough to commute to Babson for classes.
College Freshman,4,"Babson is located in the wealthy town of Wellesley Massachusettes, as such dining & shopping is often very expensive, however it is a beautiful and well kept town in which joggers such as me simply love."
College Freshman,4,Babson police & faculty is very aware of the prevalent use of alcohol and drugs and does its best to take precautions in order to keep the student body safe.
College Sophomore,4,"I love that they provide us with our own laptop, I think it makes IT easier for the entire campus to manage."
College Sophomore,4,"Babson is one of the most diverse campuses that I have seen. People from nearly any country, background, culture you can think of. It's shocking at first but when you adjust it is a blessing."
College Sophomore,4,"Other than the mandatory liberal arts that most business students hate to take, it is worth it and interesting."
College Sophomore,4,Career services is always there and the alumni network is strong.
College Sophomore,4,Babson is what it is advertised to be if you make the most of it.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a ton of restaurants and dining options in the area, my only complaint is that being in the town of Wellesley, prices can run pretty steep if you don't do your research."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a large campus so there is plenty of space for parking near the dorms. It's cheap too, but they make you pay heavily elsewhere."
College Freshman,4,It is great and I am very excited to join.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very accepting and very kind.
College Freshman,4,It is completely safe with the Babson police there.
College Freshman,4,There aren't much drug use
College Freshman,4,We have nicest dorms in the state.
College Freshman,4,Yeah they care about drugs.
College Freshman,4,you cna't really get any
College Freshman,4,We get to start our own company from the FME curriculum. 
College Freshman,4,I've never really been in the gym.
College Freshman,4,Don't really know you have to go into Boston.
College Freshman,4,"There is a 0.0% crime rate. I don't lock my doors, nothing happens here."
College Freshman,4,"It's good, it was really good when i first starte dnow it's tedious. "
College Sophomore,4,Generally health services and BABO (the campus police) are there when you need them. Health services you need to have an appointment which can get kind of annoying.
College Senior,4,Varsity Sports are encouraged though not a large part of school activity.
College Freshman,2,"Let's be real, I have never gone to a sporting event here, nor have I ever heard of anyone going ti a sporting event. My high school have more spirit."
College Sophomore,2,"No indoor tennis courts, exclusive facilities for varsity athletes only, very disappointed with not being able to access these facilities. I pay $60k+ and don't get to use them? Come on, what is that..."
College Sophomore,2,"Terrible course selection process, professors are unhelpful, the administration is atrocious and corrupt, I was assaulted and the school did nothing, left him in the same classes as me, and left me traumatized. The lack of action is because the student was on a full scholarship and the school didn't want to ruin their relationship with the scholarship association. This is the most corrupt school I have ever discovered."
College Junior,2,"Babson has its own distinct party culture. Campus police shut down any large scale parties, so drinking usually happens in dorm rooms in the beginning of the night. Upperclassmen suites will open up for dancing (though they are not roomy at all), especially during the spring for SODA season (Seniors out drinking again). After spring break, there is a party in a senior suite every night until finals, each one a different theme. About a third of the school regularly goes out on campus, and drinks pretty heavily. Another third goes clubbing in Boston, and the rest don't really go out. Many people find it hard to manage the courseload and party extensively."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much partying and Babo break up the few parties that happen.
Recent Alumnus,2,I applied but did not get any.
College Freshman,2,The coaching structure here at Babson is poor. The varsity gym shouldn't even be considered a gym due to their lack of necessary workout equipment.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many options close to Babson. The only housing available is usually at least 15 or 20 minutes away, unless you're going to live in Wellesley which is extremely expensive."
College Freshman,2,There are many good options available locally. However there aren't any late night places except for Domino's.During other hours there are dining options but they're all very expensive.
College Freshman,2,All places close early and far and few in between.
College Freshman,2,"Wellesley is expensive, so off campus housing is not feasible on a college budget."
College Sophomore,2,"ugly campus, too many trees"
College Junior,2,There is no Babson Spirit and this directly effecting campus life and the lack of support to athletic events.
College Junior,2,Within the past 4 years there have been two fraternities kick-ed off campus and student life happiness has overall decreased in huge steps. 
College Freshman,2,There should be more variety with the food.
College Freshman,2,You can smell the alcohol and drugs in the residential halls.
College Freshman,2,There isn't a lot of nightlife on my campus because many of the events tend to occur off campus and in the city.
College Freshman,2,There are supposed to be big snow storms.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do because the town is remote and the towns people do not tend to interact with the students on campus.
College Junior,2,"It all depends on who you know and what you consider to be fun, the college doesn't put on too many parties but there are plenty of students who will throw them in their dorms or suites"
Alum,1,"Academics, Babson is great.  Everything else, not so much.  If you live on campus, you'd have a terrible time.  Dorms / Housing, heat only comes on randomly during the winter, and at weird hours.  Residence life is the worst office on campus; they're too preoccupied with petty nonsense, and make life miserable for all residents.  Public safety isn't the greatest either; they will randomly give parking violations, even if you parked in the correct parking lot."
Sophomore,1,"This school has a great ROI. That is about all that it has. Campus life is terrible, housing is sub-par, food is horrible. If you are looking for a school to have a good time at, I highly recommend you look elsewhere. This school truly is not a college, rather it is a glorified boarding school. It is VERY diverse and to the point where certain groups only hang out with themselves. Sports teams are not good and no one attends their games. Parties are only thrown in ""the suites"" which are basically dorm rooms.  Other than that this school does everything it can to hinder students from having a true college experience. I cannot stress this enough; This school is not fun and I only recommend going here if you just want to get an education and do not care about your social life."
College Freshman,1,DO NOT COME TO BABSON. IT IS A TRAP!!!
College Freshman,1,The professors at this school are hit or miss. Some are really good and others are horrible. Unfortunately there is much variability in teaching guidelines and difficulties for the same classes. Some teachers don't care about students whatsoever and also dislike entrepreneurship and what it stands for. The liberal arts teachers here give a ridiculous amount of unnecessary work that does not help us as students. The only business class I took freshman year was a complete joke.
College Freshman,1,"The administration here is horrible. They are the most fake group of people I've ever had to interact with. They appear to care about the students, and want to act like they care, but when students reach out to them they don't help and don't care."
College Freshman,1,The night life here is depressing and pathetic. Every weekend people get their hopes up that there will be good parties but every time we are let down one weekend after another. People don't like to enjoy themselves here and criticize those that do. The only way to have a real good time is to go into Boston. The ONLY parties at Babson are in the suites in Mccollough which are always overcrowded and not enjoyable.
College Freshman,1,"The food here is absolutely disgusting. Being gluten free they run out of gluten free food most of the time. There were many instances where I had absolutely 0 dining options and had to order from local restaurants to deliver to me. This schools food is so gross. They serve rice just about every day, and not one time was the rice somewhat decent. It is always crunchy and poorly cooked. Everyone here hates trim food, and Reynolds is slightly better, but being gluten free is hard because the people who work here usually can't speak English or understand what I'm saying when I tell them there can't be gluten in my food. Trim not to mention is just one disappointment after another with few options and poor food to begin with."
College Freshman,1,"The campus housing experience I had was horrible. I was put in a forced triple even though the school claimed it was a regular triple. It was a substance free dorm even though I didn't apply to live there. There was another room in my dorm where two people lived and it was bigger than my triple. Not to mention that whenever we filed work orders for the maintenance people to fix something it either took weeks or they just didn't show up. The microwave was broken for 3 months despite the RA filing several work orders. And even when the maintenance people did come, they wouldn't tell you when they were coming so they just showed up and if you weren't there at the time they just left. Not to mention the bathrooms get disgusting over the weekends because they don't clean them from Friday to Sunday."
College Senior,1,Admin doesn't care about students. It's an oligarchy
College Sophomore,1,no reason to be scared
College Sophomore,1,not really big in this school
College Freshman,1,Recieved no financial aid and the financial aid department was not willing to  change financial aid packages.
College Junior,1,"Honor code violations, drug possession, and underage alcohol possession can get you into a lot of trouble"
College Sophomore,1,"Trim SUCKS – The food at Trim is horrible, repetitive selection and early hours"
College Senior,1,sometimes they cancel the shuttle and don't even tell us

Senior,5,I took online classes for prerequisite courses and flight classes in class. The professors level of work are good and manageable.
Senior,5,Vaughn College has a great staff and faculty. They try their very best to get students involved in career fairs and different activities.
Sophomore,5,It was awesome college i been in this for like two years everything for me is perfect. I like the education system. On campus lot of activities a lot of equipment of study such as big beautiful resourceful library and many more.
Sophomore,5,Online classes in vaughn college similar as on campus classes. Personally i had math on line class. It is great class and professor come prepared on line gives every information. Lot of knowledge and work for better understanding.
Freshman,5,Vaughn has paved the way for my future by giving me direct access and training to my career. It trains me to be the best pilot I can be and allows me to have future opportunities that could benefit my life forever
Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student and am in my first semester at Vaughn College. My dream is to be a pilot and at Vaughn College, I know that I will accomplish my dream. Vaughn College is a small school, but the professors are all great and willing to help anyone in need. I feel confident at Vaughn College and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Aviation Field or flying in general."
Senior,5,"I came to Vaughn to study Mechanical Engineering. Being  relatively a new offering, the curriculum proved to be one of the greatest  planned out engineering courses. The professors here are excellent. You learn a lot of information and go more in depth than other schools. The great thing about the college is its small class size. You can really ask questions and understand the topics. Speaking from industry experience the Engineering professors at Vaughn helped me truly understand core principles that aided me in distinguishing myself from other candidates from other schools in the same degree.  This is an excellent school and has created a very strong foundation for my professional career."
Sophomore,5,The main reason that Vaughn College has as a difference from the other college is that it is located south of runway 4 of La Guardia Airport and its staff is excellent. I just want it to change in the parking lot because I think it's not enough for the students.
Freshman,5,"I'm an incoming freshman , but have had a tour and attended the orientation. It's a very diverse community and the campus has an easy going feel to it."
Niche User,5,"I go to school online. Very good program. Most of the professors are very helpful.  It is very relevant to what I am studying. If you get a chance check them out. Call the distance learning department for information. They are very helpful. Also, check out their reviews."
Niche User,5,"It a small campus with culturally diverse students.  Its a college based on math and science majors .  Vaughn focuses on students interest in aviation.  Since its a small school, students have closer contact with the professors and the help they need.  Usually classes have up to 25 students or less.  Professors get to know their students better when its a small class.  Classes are very close to each other and are only in one building so you don't get lost.  Student life is key to be successful since working together will help you accomplish goals better.  Since its an FAA regulated school there is no parties which makes the campus quiet."
Freshman,5,This college is amazing. the staffing is a 10. professors and colleagues are a 10. Amazing view and close to LaGuardia Airport. we even have a small tower area where you can hear the ATC and observe take offs and arrivals. Oh and the cafeteria is awesome. must try the breakfast here. you'll definitely love this college. So far I have no complains and I am very satisfied with my education here.
Niche User,5,I find the in campus experience to be very resourceful. The amount of courses are helpful in finding a career in the aviation field and le dan itself to many other possible careers. The extracurricular activities are very intriguing and come in a variety to choose from.
Freshman,5,one thing I really like about my school is their aviation program it is the best in New York City and its close to home.
Freshman,5,"When I visited Vaughn College a few weeks ago for an open house, it was a simple and to the point presentation of what the school has to offer. Great, simple and direct presentation which was very well done. The tour of the campus was awesome, the faculty was simply awesome and informative, and the student volunteers were on their A game. It was by far a better experience than the other colleges I visited. Thanks guys and see you in the upcoming semester as a freshman."

College Sophomore,5,Small classroom sizes and strong faculty.
College Sophomore,5,The career center is great. Career fairs help a lot to have an idea of which job a student would like to work at after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,Every semester there is an internship fair and a career fair. It motivates students to do great in school and become successful.
College Senior,5,It helps you to know what your life is going to be like after you have completed.
College Senior,5,Their classes are small and all the teachers makes sure that you do understanding what you have taught.
College Freshman,5,"With the people i have study with, i can say they work hard to get what they want."
College Freshman,5,"when you request for finantial Aid, if you have all the papers a day, you won't have problems."
College Freshman,5,"Vaughn college offers many thing to your carrier, it depends  of you if take advantage of that."
College Freshman,5,Vaughn college has really good persons teachin and in the administration too.
Sophomore,4,"The classes online was about as in-depth as the classes live. The momentum never really stopped in transition, and teachers grew accustomed to the new changes as did students. Overall, about the same in that regard."
Sophomore,4,"The college is filled with the late seat in aeronautics technology, from airplane simulation to mechanical equipment with a heavy dose on the importance of the latest software and technology. The classes are made convenient and simple as possible, even if it’s complicated, but there are many tutors and opportunities for postential jobs."
Freshman,4,"I like Vaughn College because it's good school for aviation, I have perfect instructors who helping students whenever they need help and they trying to improve students' level so they can meet their academic goals."
Freshman,4,Overall its a good college but its too expensive. They have excellent professors. Campus is small in size but adequate.  Campus food can be a little better.
Freshman,4,Vaughn College is an excellent option to choose when looking upon the aeronautics fields. It has diverse opportunities with very renown flight and engineering companies. Its faculty is always there to help out and lend a hand when in need of orientation in your interests such as being part of a club or applying for internships. The overall experience is very good and will shape you to be an adequate professional in the near future.
Sophomore,4,"In general Vaughn College is a small school, but it has a great learning environment. Its a type of school that you want to go to if you want to finish quick and get a lot of hands-on experience with people who are extremely experieced. If there’s anything i would love to see it changed are the school doorms to at least make them bedroom bigger and more spacious. All in all, it’s still a great school and I would recommend it 100% to anyone."
Freshman,4,"Although it is very expensive, because it’s a specialized college, everyone attending is planning on being in the field of aviation so being surrounded by people with the same interests, keep students motivated"
Freshman,4,"Very involved and handon learning environment. The college isnt huge so you get to see and meet many people who you can forge great friendships with. Learning is made fun, becuase proffesors are coming from the industry of aviation to teach students."
Sophomore,4,I like the small student to teacher ratio which allows for more hands on assistance. Professors are available to speak to during their office hours and provide more one on one help. Tutoring is free so plenty of aid is offered for a student to achieve to the best of their ability.
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Vaughn College is great, most professors are great and the students are nice. The staff is always there to help you with your needs and questions. The campus is in a great spot especially for the pilots because it's right next to the airport. The one thing that can change would probably be the priceing of the school one semester will run you about $30,000 that's way more than the average college."
College Freshman,4,Transferring credits was an easy process especially since I have received credits from another college because of the early college high school I attended. I have a class that some of my classmates don't have and I don't have to retake any classes the were credited.
College Freshman,4,"There are several career fairs and internship fairs that happen throughout the year. The school has and boasts about their connections to Laguardia Airport, several airline companies, and big transportation companies."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers and student s are quite friendly. they know what they are doing and use real life scenarios to prep our lectures. Very helpful in that context
College Junior,4,First thing i like to point out is the class sizes i think that the class size are small however i think its good to have it that way because student would get more time from the professor if they need any help with their work. The professors at Vaughn college are great they learn your name pretty fast and if they see you in the halls they'll say hello and recognize. Every professor have their own class styles i think this is what makes each individual unique and many of them were really creative.
College Junior,4,"Electrical engineer technology of Avionics was my school major. what's awsome about this major is that as a electrical engineer everything about the plane is in your hand. Such as, the safety of the passanger, the aircraft electricity, the engine, the wings, the radars everything. When an electrical engineer is working on an aircraft his work has to be immaculate because if something goes wrong with that aircraft we would suffer the consequences. One thing i love about the workload it has a lot of math involved. There is this course called electrical engineering 1 and 2 it teaches you about the basic of ohms law and one thing that fascinates me about this law. In order for you to find the voltage, the amps, current etc everything is invlove with math and its kind of like a puzzel if you find an answer than your anwers will help figure out the other answers."
College Student,4,You can adjust your schedule to fit your daily routine. It takes me two hours to get to school so I can't really adjust anything. But so far so good. If you did courses that have transferable credits they will have no reason transfering them.
College Student,4,"Online course are more like self tought programs. I highly prefer the class room, that way I get more integrated and hands on, on what I am doing."
College Student,4,My experience with my courses and professors have been great. My professors are very easy to work with and also friendly. As for courses you can adjust and change if you fins it too difficult or get tutored (free of charge). As for me I don't need any adjustments or tutor.
College Student,4,"It's a very fun and interactive school, knowing there's a lot of clubs and programs that offer different experiences to advance you towards your career goals. Also, it's located just across from La Guardia Airport, and if you're in aviation it's an amazing experience to up to the tower and watch the planes take off and land. Even though I've been going there for over a month. I never get tired of going up to the tower."
College Sophomore,4,Everything has been great so far both academically and extra-curricular wise
College Sophomore,4,Classes and teachers know what they are doing. Great experience
College Freshman,4,Teachers are truly there for their students.
College Freshman,4,"Sure management isn't the biggest major at Vaughn, but it is still valued."
College Freshman,4,"Vaughn over all is a great school. However, don't come here if you are looking for a party school. This school focusses on academics and less on parties. The school is small and hands on which is great if you learn from first hand experiences. Located near LaGuardia it is the perfect location for Aviation majors."
College Junior,4,I have no difficulty in transfering my credits. The admissions ifficers were super friendly and hard working people. The transsaction was as smooth as a piece of cake!
College Junior,4,It is a developing school and the number of graduates are increasing highly everyday. It carries a big potential and easy access to the industry.
College Junior,4,"Small classrooms at Vaughn allows you to build relationships with your professors and this is a very big plus, of course if you are interested in your studies."
College Junior,4,Very specific! You will most likely get an aviation related career as soon as you complete your studies.
College Junior,4,"To learn about the industry you want to get in is really crucial. If you have no aviation backgroung, it is a good start in starting your education career in an instittuion such as Vaughn."
College Junior,4,"During the admissions process, i have been taken care of ver nicely. It is the only Aviation focused in New York City and if you stay focus you can accimplish great things in the aviation field."
College Freshman,4,Online course are the best here
College Freshman,4,I know some people who graduated from this college and got job right away.
College Senior,4,I would recommend Vaughn to other Aviation students
College Sophomore,4,"Not many class time options, but can't expect much from a small college"
College Sophomore,4,I have taken a few online courses and I would rate it a 4 out of 5. There is no peer to peer interaction nor tutoring but the teachers are pretty straight forward with the grading policy and the work.
College Sophomore,4,"When there are career fairs and internship fairs, there are lots of opportunities for engineers and for all other majors. There's a lack of teachers and attention for engineers. The school needs improvement."
College Freshman,4,they hv a lot of options
College Freshman,4,no problems so far. all is great
College Senior,4,Mercy college actually do have a very large soccer filed and a very nice students which you will get all the help you will surly need.
College Freshman,4,"So far, I am enjoying my experience at this college. Classes are satisfactory, I can handle the workload. My only major issue is paying for my flight training to earn my license in order to advance in my major, Aircraft Operations. That is why I didn't give it the full five circle rating. Other than that, I have made new friends and hope to benefit from this experience from this college."
College Freshman,4,"Even though at initially, I have not received a full scholarship to this college, taking the ACT and passing it with a 22 has sealed the deal and is the reason why I am attending this college."
College Freshman,4,"I am fine learning the material, the only issue is paying for money to earn my licenses. Other than that it's alright."
College Freshman,4,Workload is fairly sufficient for me as I have experienced rigorous workload in high school. I am prepared to handle the workload received at the college.
College Freshman,4,"So far, this is my first year at this college so I'll progress through this semester before making a full review."
College Senior,4,I'm in an aviations school so most the student are going out for the same jobs so your have to be on your A game at all time. We always have recruiter at our school and the quality of the career center is great always available to talk to and help out.
College Senior,4,The teacher at Vaughn are very mush involved with there student. If u schedule with them 90% of the time they are available to help and easy to approach. Class size varies but not over whelming.
College Senior,4,"Like is said earlier, I'm on the basketball team so I'm alway in the athletic center and have a great relationship with my coach. Campus life is ok they always have something going on like free food, different contest and trips plans."
College Senior,4,I feel like the Tuitions is fair and the financial aid office try their best to help out.
College Junior,4,i have been taking hand on courses
College Junior,4,teachers are helpful and they teach what i need to learn for my career
College Freshman,4,i just really wish i had gone out of state but it isn't the schools fault it is a great school
College Freshman,4,"we have computers, a GREAT flight simulator lab"
College Freshman,4,It's great you feel like you're getting your bang for your buck
College Freshman,4,It's a great school everything is neat and staff are very friendly
College Junior,4,The computer labs are all up to date.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is always holding job fairs, and giving opportunities at internship for companies"
College Sophomore,4,I like the hands on labs that my major requires gives you the real experience you need out in the field
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on the professor, the workload varies but overall the workload is manageable "
College Freshman,4,Different classes its very good.
College Freshman,4,"Since we in NYC somethings are Deep, but no more than 2 blocks deep so is a good exercise."
College Junior,2,"The only reason why i say its bad is because one of my first and last online course i failed. The reason why i failed was because i couldn't afford a laptop or a computer at home. I did have a computer at home but during that time when i was taking the online course i didn't have any wifi at home, so what was good about having a computer at home when i didn't have any wifi to use it and do my work. I used to work in the morning have classes in the evening and by the time i finished with my clases it'll be too late to use the school's computer to do my work. It used to frustrate me knowing that i was going to fail that class because i could afford a laptop or not having enough time to use the school computer after 10:30 PM."
College Freshman,2,After last semester I was held up for 3 hours before I could leave. They were trying to get me onto a payment plan when I pay in full via a college fund.
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not enjoy it. My roommate does not enjoy it. And our friends aren't fond of it either. Bad location, it takes an hour via public transit to get into the city but that's not that bad. There's nothing to do around the college."
College Freshman,2,"Half of my professors don't even show up to class half the time. They expect the students to be on time always, but they never are."
College Freshman,2,"The professors never show up on time, nor do some of them even show up to class half the time. Due to this and some other reasons, I'm transferring out, which is why I plan on taking out a huge student loan and feeling more satisfied with how my money is being spent."
College Junior,2,my mom is taking loans in her job and struggling to get me through college. we are considered middle claa and i am eligible for very little help
College Junior,2,"The only things that are unique is it's the only aeronautical school in the area, and the only one along the coast that offers AT-CTI program."
College Junior,2,"Some important classes are only offered during some semesters; the summer class schedule is a mystery that no one can find clues to. God forbid you need to drop a class; the school does not allow you to simply do it your self, you have to drive to school, fill out a form and get it approved. i think this is a waste of time coming from somone who has to drive an hour to get to school"
College Sophomore,2,For a new high school graduate it was had for me cause the finical aid didn't really care or explain the options that i had.
College Student,2,My experience has not been so well and there are a lot of problems the school needs to fix 
College Student,2,its a hassle to get financial aid and  you have to keep going to their office. The tuition is a lot 17-18 thousands a year and the school don't have much stuff to do.
College Senior,2,"Private School = a Lot of Money – I know that when I finally have my degree and my future job it will definitely be worth it, however because it is a private college I am paying for aleast half of my tuition of out pocket. They do offer financial aid (thank god) but even that isn't enough, since I refuse to take out loans I am stuck paying for it now because I don't want to be paying them in the future where the interest will end up sky high."
College Sophomore,2,"Not up to Par – Average tuition at Vaughn amounts to $9000. For $9000, one would expect more dedicated professors, an unchanging class schedule, and more intensive courses."
College Sophomore,2,"Smoke and Mirrors – Vaughn College is great at enticing new students to come to their school. They accommodate personal tours in which they showcase the hangar, the tower (which has a one way connection with LaGuardia Airport's tower, the library and all the other facilities on campus. The administration is sloppy. Most professors are unprofessional and boring. Flight students should NOT come to Vaughn. It is a waste of time and money. Engineers and mechanics are welcome however."
Freshman,1,"Too Expensive, Too expensive, Too expensive, Too expensive , Too expensive , Too expensive, low graduation rate , not worth the money , little financial aid , scholarship is a bait"
Sophomore,1,"i had military aircraft experience and wanted to become an a&p mechanic, received my Airframe and was 1 semester away from powerplant, But by that time this school had me hating this industry as a whole, luckily i was able to join one of the construction unions in the city.the teachers often let us know how lucky we will be to get a job at an airline and how you dont get an A&P for the $$ , cause there is none.what kind of teachers say this?. Most teachers there just did not care at all. one teacher consistanly reminded us ""im not the instructor on record of this class"" so voice any concerns to the some other teacher whom wasnt teaching the class!"
College Freshman,1,They claim that they are trying to be diverse but after one day of attending the college you realize its not that divers at all.
College Senior,1,i didn't see anything like workload but i do like the size of their classes.
College Junior,1,I have to pay almost 3000 out of my pocket per semester and that's not including the loans i'm reciving as well.
College Senior,1,"There is always some sort of issue that is being fixed, it is very unreliable."
College Senior,1,"Online Classes- Not Worth It – Online classes are a joke. No lectures provided at all, the only expectation is that you answer questions for tests based upon the text book. No learning takes place and the instructors do not seem to care. I have taken online classes at another school where they were actually informational and educational- here it is nothing but busy work for a grade"

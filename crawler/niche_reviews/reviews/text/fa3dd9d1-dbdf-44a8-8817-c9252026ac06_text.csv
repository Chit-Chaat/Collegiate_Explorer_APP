Freshman,5,I have not taken any courses online yet but if I do I'm sure Niagara will handle it well and make sure their students are getting the help they need.
Freshman,5,Niagara University was my very first choice when deciding to go to college. The smaller class sizes and the wonderful stories I've heard about professors is what made NU stand out to me.
Graduate Student,5,Campus has excellent atmosphere.  The teachers are very caring and there are many new renovations and programs. Small classes. Was affordable with financial aid and scholarships.  Took all of my community college credits towards my program.
Sophomore,5,Niagara is a place to make connections with people and gives opportunities beyond the classroom that I feel cannot be achieved from another university
Niche User,5,I absolutely loved my experience at Niagara University.  I was completing my BSN.  I did not feel like a number.  The advisors and professors encouraged professional growth as well as goal setting rather than simply pushing through to finish a degree.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and recommend it to everyone!
Sophomore,5,I like the size of the campus at Niagara University. It's not too big where I get lost and it's not too small where I feel that it is crowded with too many students. The campus grounds are well maintained and remain beautiful all year round. The teachers are very professional and are always willing to help when needed.
Graduate Student,5,Loved having many opportunities to engage with students and faculty on an academic and an extracurricular level.
Niche User,5,Small campus with very involved teachers.  Very active student life.  Everyone is very kind and helpful. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"I love the professors, they are so kind and they care about you. The campus is small and private, very easy to get around. There is not anything that I would think to change."
Niche User,5,Love the campus.  Love the people.  Love the location and loved the athletic scene.   I also love being able to hop into a car with my friends and be in Canada to experience that countries culture in less than 5 minutes.
Senior,5,"Attending NU was the best decision I've made. Since it's a smaller school, the sense of community is extremely prevalent and important. The teachers are all top notch and will do anything to help their students. We offer many opportunities within all of our colleges, especially the College of  Hospitality and Tourism Management where I am enrolled as a senior now. We offer numerous opportunities to go abroad, whether it's to study or work. I would recommend NU to anyone."
Alum,5,"Small campus with a friendly atmosphere. The professors are there to help you and class size are not big. Lots of activities always going on around campus, and  campus is located between Niagara Falls, NY and Lewiston, NY wiht plenty of stuff to do. Bonus: The campus is beautiful, it's only a few minutes drive from Canada, a half hour drive from Buffalo, NY, and walking distance from trails that led to places such as Devil's hole, and Niagara Falls."
Senior,5,"I went to Niagara University 8 years ago, and ended up dropping out in my last semester for personal reasons. I recently got in contact with my old professor, who not only remembered  who I was but immediately began seeing what he could do to help me finish my bachelor's degree. Everyone at the university has been incredibly helpful throughout the entire processes."
Sophomore,5,i have never met more loving and motivated professors . they make sure you are as ready as you can be after every class and before every test or exam
Freshman,5,"I love it there, feels just like a second home and Iâ€™m so excited that I had the ability to attend. All of the different programs that are offered are so individualized and creative compared to other universities. Having it be a smaller campus, it is extremely easy to make friends and find fun things to do. The surrounding area has a bunch of restaurants and shopping places as well as being so close to Buffalo and Canada which is awesome! I love this school and would recommend it to anyone looking for a close knit school."
Senior,5,"Niagara University is a wonderful school! I never realized how much people can inspire you until I came here. The teachers are so attentive to each student, and they truly do care about your future and what you have to offer the world. They bring out the best in each of their students, care deeply about good morals and community, and are very well-educated individuals. The programs here are also challenging but fun! Each program is very unique and is presented in such a way that all types of learners are able to thrive. There is never a dull day, even in the general education courses! Even better, you are always surrounded by great people with profound ideas that will influence the world someday. Believe me when I say that you can be ANYTHING after coming here!"
Freshman,5,"Niagara University is a diverse experience. It's such a lively place. When I first stepped foot on campus, i knew it was home. Everyone is so caring and kind. It's astonishing. I love all my professors as well. They are all so lenient."
Graduate Student,5,I love it at NU. It is a great school. I love the faculty and staff. My only issue is that there isn't much parking for commuters and what is available is the farthest away from everything.
Junior,5,I love going to school here! Professors are extremely knowledgeable in their field and are there for you. They want you to succeed and care about your future.
Junior,5,I love Niagara University. It has provided me with the opportunity to succeed. The staff is wonderful and the atmosphere and academics are great. I am very happy with my decision to attend Niagara University.
Freshman,5,Everything about Niagara University is amazing. The atmosphere is very homey and it everyone you meet makes you feel welcomed! The classroom are an amazing size so you have a better chances to have a one on one learning experience with the professor.
Sophomore,5,"I am going into my sophomore year of college here at Niagara University, and it is amazing! The professors and students were so kind and helpful while i struggled through my first year of college. I dont plan on transferring and I will definitely recommend this school to anyone looking for a 4 year degree."
Junior,5,"It was the best place for me, and quickly became my first choice after visiting the school. In my first two years here, I learned so much about myself and the world around me."
Graduate Student,5,Love the school! I would recommend it to any high school student looking at colleges. The faculty go out of their way to help you. At Niagara you are not just another number.
Sophomore,5,I love Niagara University. The programs are nationally and internationally accredited and there is an endless amount of ways of getting involved on campus. Everyone is really accommodating and will help you in any way.
Freshman,5,"I am an African american female attending Niagara University and I can honestly say it was a great decision to attend this college. As any senior in high school, I was afraid of choosing where I would spend my life for the next 4 years as an actual adult but the second I walked on campus the energy was extremely welcoming! I thought I wouldn't fit in much with the color of my skin and the lack of ethic people attending but they treat everyone with the exact same dignity and respect. There are also Black Student Union programs as well which is cool too! If you aren't considering Niagara University as one of your college choices, please reconsider because I guarantee you won't regret coming here."
College Sophomore,5,"My father went here and he's been working in the same industry that he got his degree in for 20 years which I think is extremely successful. Also, NU has an amazing reputation which helps with getting internships and other job opportunities because employers know the credibility of this institution."
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved all of my professors. They really care about not only how you're doing in the class, but also your well being. Also, theres a huge variety of class options to make for very interesting elective choices."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love NU. I've met some of the best people and professors here. It's so small that you do recognize most faces on campus and everyone is just so friendly. Its definitely my home away from home and if I had the chance to choose it again, I would do it in a heartbeat."
College Senior,5,I moved from FL to attend Niagara. I have been very pleased with my experience so far. The professors really care and genuinely want you to do well. They will go out of their way to help you achieve your goals.
College Freshman,5,Nothing has ever happened on campus that shouldnt have.
College Freshman,5,Getting a degree from Niagara University in my area is a great honor.
College Freshman,5,This is a very beautiful campus and makes your social experience just as great as the educational.
College Sophomore,5,"There may not be a lot of Greek life on campus, but Phi Sigma Sigma is a wonderful organization and does wonderful things!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love Niagara University. The professors are great, especially the nursing faculty. I love the atmosphere of it all. The only down fall, parking can be a real pain!"
College Freshman,5,"I love the people and the environment here, love this place"
College Junior,5,People are nice and accepting
College Junior,5,My teachers have been helpful
College Freshman,5,I've never felt unsafe walking on campus. They have blue lights everywhere. You can call campus safety for a ride if you feel unsafe. I usually call a friend to talk
College Freshman,5,"Niagara University is a great campus. The professors truly care about their students and want them to succeed. The environment at the school is good, very friendly. I absolutely love it there. My only complaint is that it is a little smaller than I would've liked and other than partying, there isn't always that much to do. There are usually programs during the week but on weekends things are less exciting, which is usually good to catch up on sleep and studying. I do love it there and would make the same choice again"
College Freshman,5,I love the campus and my program is great. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
College Junior,5,Niagara University has very effective ways to keep its students safe. There is campus police on duty at all times and they are always willing to help if someone is in need of anything. They will also pick you up at night if you are afraid to walk across campus alone in the dark. Campus safety makes rounds throughout all the buildings and every building has security cameras.
College Junior,5,Niagara University has a large amount of diversity on campus. It accepts people of all race and ethnicity. It also welcomes students from other countries as well as gays and lesbians.
College Freshman,5,The professors and heads of departments are great at what they do.
College Freshman,5,The classes are really small with a 11:1 ratio. Teachers actually care about their students and are flexible as long as students are willing to work hard and show the drive.
College Sophomore,5,"I'm personally in a sorority. I am in Alpha Sigma Alpha, and we do a lot for the community, however we are not very well known on campus. We are in the process of trying to increase our voice on campus and hoping that after the next year or so we will be very well known on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"I LOVE my major. I love the professors, and the fact that I am in a classroom for AT LEAST 2 hours every week since Fall freshman year. The professors are very helpful, and the workload is very manageable. The simulation classrooms are very helpful when designing a classroom of your own one day. The whole concept of the major is one of the best in the area."
College Sophomore,5,When I applied for school I was automatically placed in my major. However during the process we go through Learn and Serve (I'm an education major) and they review our performance. If we get bad reviews they will have meetings with us to discuss if this major is really right for us.
College Sophomore,5,There are the CUTEST restaurants in Lewiston that are inexpensive and are SO fun to go to with a group of friends.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the little town it is right near by, it's very small and has many cute restaurants. On the other side, there is Niagara Falls, which is nice because it is a bigger city, and there is stuff going on. It is the best of both worlds."
College Sophomore,5,"I believe that being a Catholic school, our campus wide community is very diverse."
College Sophomore,5,"I have a very nice scholarship based on academics, and I have not really had a problem with financial aid."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the academics at this university. It is the reason I chose it. The education program here (the one I am in) is one of the best in the area. At Niagara professors really care about each and every student and they really are trying to make sure that the students get the most out of the class. The class sizes are small, and that also allows for great successes. The professors want to make sure that every student does their best, and it really is motivating for everyone else."
College Sophomore,5,Two bars where NU students bartend make it more friendly environment
College Junior,5,"I am very happy with my program (sociology, psychology and sign language) I would do it all again. I am going to grad school when I graduate next year for school counseling. I don't really have concerns about finding a job in my field."
College Freshman,5,so much fun every night
College Freshman,5,Honestly i hired a private person do to my financial aid because i had no idea what i was doing.
College Freshman,5,I have a great internship and the workload was not too bad.
College Sophomore,5,"Student faculty interaction is almost impossible and you almost have to try to not become friendly with your teachers who all know you personally.  My largest class is a lecture with about 50 people in it, my smallest class last semester had just 18students in it (as a 100 level course) so class discussion occurred every class and it made it easier to approach the professors.  As a biology student i am already participating in undergraduate research with a professor in which we are isolating bacteria from animals and testing their resistance to antibiotics, and due to a question about a fruit tree I have started growing and starting this semester as a personal side project he is going to assist me in growing apple trees using grafts from his own personal trees.  "
College Sophomore,5,An NU degree is one of the best degrees you can get in the world and companies worldwide know about it.
Junior,4,The teachers are super helpful and welcoming. The campus  is just the right size. Everyone is very friendly to each other and willing to help.
Junior,4,I took CIS 232 online and it was a bit challenging  but the course helps you kind of learn on your own with the access to ask your teachers questions.
Sophomore,4,"Niagara is about more than getting a degree. It's about becoming a better you. From the ground up they work on molding you to be a kind, caring, and helpful person and want that to stick with you for life."
Freshman,4,"Niagara University from the moment I stepped foot on campus was welcoming and compassionate. I have visited countless schools and not one was as genuine as Niagara. Each and every member of their staff is 100% open and willing to help you in every aspect which makes the college exper A lot less daunting. It is in a geographically exceptional area with the Falls less than 10 minutes away and the campus is stunning with its Vincentian architecture. Though I may just be a freshman, I have no complaints with the Niagara University family and campus."
Junior,4,So far college has been a great experience for me! Iâ€™ve became independent and have been working hard. The professors are super helpful and students are super nice. I made the right choice coming to Niagara University.
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at Niagara University was one of a kind and would love to do it all over AGAIN! The staff is amazingly nice and cares about the students, whether they are your professor or not, anyone will help you with any issue or concern and even question. The campus is always clean, easy to travel and usually safe."
Junior,4,Niagara University has a very diverse student body and staff. The local area may be a little difficult to adjust to because the school is in session when the tourist season is over.
Freshman,4,My experience with Niagara University has been very good. I make this judgement on the fact that someone is always available to answer my questions and also because they have aided me in several ways during my admission process so that it would be successful.
Junior,4,"I love Niagara University for it's 12:1 student to faculty ratio. It really provides the professor's to get to know the students names and character. The professor's are really good, and most excel at what they teach. The only issues I may have is the technology issues, and the dining could improve. Parking may improve as well, but overall is good. There are many great opportunities to reach out and do many activities at NU. I truly love it."
Senior,4,"Pros: close proximity to my hometown, had my desired major, offered opportunities to conduct research and volunteer in the community, is a relatively diverse campus, small campus size allows for quality relationships with professors, offered decent scholarships/aid  

Cons: smaller campus size makes it feel slightly like high school, not much to do on campus, area surrounding school is not that exciting, kind of a poorer neighborhood 

Because I weight academics, price, and proximity as major factors in choosing a college it's an overal great experience"
Sophomore,4,"The faculty are amazing and very helpful. It is a school where you are not just a number, but a name and a face and an actual person. Amazing school with an amazing education."
Sophomore,4,"small campus
not too hard curriculums
good professors
active activities in campus
I am an international student from Viet Nam. I just started to study in NU from spring 2017 and I had great experiences here. The professors here are very great, friendly and take care students really well, because of small-size classes.
althoug small campus, there are so my activities on campus and It is not boring anymore."
Freshman,4,What I love about Niagara University is the campus and the professors. The professors are very understanding and supportive and they are willing to work with you because they see the potential. The buildings on campus look like castles personally. The campus is in the perfect place at sunset and it is the perfect place to take phenomenal pictures. I know I made the right chose in coming to Niagara University.
Junior,4,"I love the small, familial feel of Niagara. Their strong focus on Vincentian values is also a huge plus-however the living situations here are somewhat difficult."
Junior,4,"Thus far, the students have had a strong impact in the changes that have been implemented since my freshman year, beginning in the Fall of 2014.  Niagara University is a family friendly, and community involving University with a strong Vincentian heritage.  The dining hall has been recently renovated and will be completed next month.  The food quality and variety has improved tremendously.  I am a Community Advisor (CA) which is similar to an RA at most schools.  Being a CA has positively impacted my experience here.  Housing at Niagara University is very highly priced especially for the limited housing options.  Yes, there are several housing options as far as buildings, but the most recent addition has been the apartments across campus, but that is also the only housing offered that is constantly full.  Our housing occupancy has been down, and that has forced us to finally consider allocating money towards updating our residence halls."
Senior,4,"Small school so you can connect with your professors compared to larger state schools. Programs every Friday that include free food and fun entertainment like escape rooms, hypnotists, comedians, laser tag etc. Campus is surrounded by nature, 5 min walk from the gorge, 20 min walk to the whirlpool and if you have a car you can visit the falls or go to Canada. I would like to see more diversity with the staff and faculty members. And I would like to see more programs about different cultures including Spanish heritage, African culture, Middle Easern Culture and Asiatic Heritage."
Junior,4,"It is a great and comfortable environment on campus. Everyone is friendly and welcoming and the food is pretty good too. Also, you're right near the border to Canada so it's a pretty area. The downside is that some parts around the campus are bad areas too, and students need to be aware of where they're going when they go off campus. "
College Sophomore,4,"I always feel very safe on campus. Honestly, it's so small that it's hard to feel like something bad is going to happen to you. This is especially true at night when campus safety does rounds through the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"Our dorms are very old and you can clearly tell when you walk into them. However, they are very clean at the same time. I live in O'Shea and I would definitely say that the bathrooms need work but the rooms are a good size."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a lot of school spirit at NU, therefore sports, the basketball games in particular, are filled with purple pride!"
College Senior,4,"The gym/rec center is well maintained and has good hours and availability. There is a tremendous amount of school spirit. It's been said that we ""bleed purple"""
College Sophomore,4,"I love all of the classes I have taken so far including, lectures and regular classes. Lectures tend to have more than 35 people and regular classes have 35 or less. Both are effective for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Each college within Niagara University holds alumni gatherings so that students can work on networking. They seem to only be effective for juniors, seniors, and graduates."
College Sophomore,4,"The whole school supports the sports teams, even if they aren't your typical sports fans. The basketball games are always full with students and staff. Hockey has a good amount of people thay come to the games as well."
College Sophomore,4,"Throughout my first year at Niagara University, I realized that I picked the right college. The professors are very helpful and nice. The classes are very interesting and the campus is beautiful, even in the winter when its freezing. I would choose Niagara again and again because of the staff and many friends I have made. Also, the postivie job outlook for my major."
College Freshman,4,The professors and curriculum are amazing at Niagara University. I'm very proud to be a student there. The only real problem I have is in regards to the food. More healthy options would be wonderful.
College Freshman,4,"Niagara University is in a wonderful spot. It has wonderful professors and wonderful academic opportunities. The students could be a lot more accepting and driven, but it isn't the schools fault that everyone wants to get drunk all of the time."
College Senior,4,There are a lot of different majors offered.  If you go to class the work isn't hard.  It's a small school so your professors will know you by name.  They take attendance.  If you go on ratemyprofessor most of the reviews are true about the teachers.
College Senior,4,"I have had no problem with safety on campus.  Being a male, I cannot comment on the female perspective.  Niagara Falls isn't a college town and isn't the safest area.  The bars people go to aren't in the best areas either.  Nothing really ever happens though.  If you mind your business you'll be alright."
College Freshman,4,"There is not much campus crime her at NU, and our safety is a big thing on campus. About two times a week I see a town police car patrolling the campus. I feel very safe here on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Every class I have taken so far the professors were very reasonable. The test we received didn't just come out of no where, they prepared us for them. Some professors were unprepared for class and would cancel because of it, others didn't care to teach properly. Mostly all professors know what they are doing and we receive decent grades."
College Freshman,4,"Yes, our campus is small so we can only have so many sororities and fraternities. For instance, we have 3 choices of greek life, 2 which are sororities and 1 which is a fraternity. the greek life on campus do amazing community service on and around campus. Non greeks on campus are very care free about the greek life. There isn't any ""beef"" between greeks and non greeks. Housing is not available on campus which is kind of lame but the greeks learn to deal with it."
College Freshman,4,"The size is just right, you have the ability to speak to your professors and get the help you need. It is amazing how much they want to help you and the environment at the school is very uplifting. You feel as if you can succeed at anything that you try. If you are struggling the tutoring center is amazing, its student taught and they really help you get a better understanding."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school, i would pick it over and over again, the entire experience so far has been great."
College Freshman,4,"Not a big part of campus life, but they do help you keep grades up and strive to better yourself."
College Freshman,4,State of the art technology and great athletic diversity!
College Freshman,4,Its an extremely good school with good courses with much diversity and small class sizes.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorming is wonderful, the staff is very kind and easy to live with"
College Junior,4,Excited for the attention to practicum experience offered and career assistance prospects.
College Junior,4,"Because I am in a cohort graduate program, I do not have a choice for course selection (which, in a way, would be nice.) The professors however are very engaging and excited to teach."
College Junior,4,Security is always available to assist students if they need help or escorts.
College Junior,4,Professors seem invested in student's academics and future career prospects. Administrative assistants in all departments have also been very helpful and are concerned with answering individual needs or questions.
College Junior,4,Basketball team is great and games are well attended! More attention could be placed on other sports.
College Junior,4,Niagara University has a lot of connections to the professional world. It makes it easier to find jobs after graduation.
College Junior,4,I enjoy the classes offered. The professors are skilled in their fields and have a passion for teaching the younger generations.
College Junior,4,The Athletic department is very impressive. It is geared for both student athletes and for the varsity athletes.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy my school. The environment is nice.
College Freshman,4,"Facilities are on the smaller side, but still really good"
College Junior,4,NU works hard to make well rounded students and the programs they offer are intensive and valuable.
College Junior,4,"The gym is incredible, and I love the track they set up for students to walk safely to a huge local park."
College Junior,4,I liked my teachers and classes
College Junior,4,I'm in one of the sororities and it actually has helped me have a better experience. People don't care for us but we do our thing and have fun.
College Junior,4,"There isn't a wide school spirit towards the sport teams, but athletes support the others and attend."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus. Their aren't many crimes that happen on campus and campus safety is always driving around if you ever need anything.
College Sophomore,4,"Their is always something that can help you get a job. They have job fairs, alumni advantage, and the advisors are helpful with getting internships."
College Sophomore,4,I've had good professors and bad professors but overall they are pretty good and helpful. I wish their were more cool elective classes to take but other than that the courses are good.
College Sophomore,4,Their is a sense of community but they are not the most modern buildings.
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are nice but not really enough room.
College Sophomore,4,My school is a small school do their is definitely a sense of community. Teachers know your name and are genuinely concerned about not only your grade in their class put also you. Everyone in administration is so nice and helpful all the time.
College Freshman,4,"I love Niagara and would definitely make the same choice again. Small class sizes are nice. My largest lecture is 65 students. The professors are great, truly care, and fair graders."
Freshman,2,"At Niagara, you are just a statistic, especially with covid. They do not care about your mental or physical health until it affects their income. They are extremely rude dealing with covid situations. The dorms do not have a/c and have not been updated for decades. You get stuck in the elevators, not to mention the food is not good whatsoever. The school is over priced and could care less about their residence halls and dining halls. Do not go here unless you want to be disappointed."
Freshman,2,"The campus and atmosphere is great but the academics were very disappointing. I was not being challenged into the courses I was placed into, I was not able to chose my classes. My classes were often canceled, leaving me feeling that my money was being wasted by not being taught to the full extent which I should have been. "
College Sophomore,2,Greek life isn't really a big thing at Niagara University. They don't affect non-greek life members directly but they are good for the school.
College Senior,2,The parties are not good.  The off campus houses are mixed with residents so if a party is loud cops usually come.  Nobody gets in trouble they just break it up.  There would be a good one here and there but the house party scene isn't that live.
College Senior,2,"The nightlife isn't great.  The options are limited.  There are two bars people go to.  You have to be 21 to enter but the bouncers aren't as strict as other places.  It's not easy if your underage but not impossible either.  People usually go to the bars on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday night.  There is one club that is 18 to enter.  People usually go to the club Thursday-Saturday.  The bars and club are not walking different from campus.  Usually a 5-10 minute drive."
College Junior,2,Campus safety is more concerned with giving out parking tickets than addressing serious issues such as rape or sexual assault.
College Sophomore,2,No one really participates so it is not a huge part of the campus life.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is very low key at Niagara. Some people are in it but not many and no one really cares at all. If you're into Greek life, Niagara probably isn't the place for you."
College Junior,2,"Dorming life is awful, there is very limited space. If you pay $500 extra a semester you can get a single room to yourself which is the equivalent of living in a closet. If you live with a roommate the rooms are somewhat spacious, however, you have to deal with someone being there with you all the time and that can get a bit overwhelming. Apartment living is a little better because you have living room and kitchen space to move about, but is still quite small."
College Freshman,2,"Since it's such a small school, Greek life isn't that big. There are 2 Sororities and 2 Fraternities. Their parties are decent and everyone can get in but their presence on campus can go unnoticed."
College Junior,2,"It is constantly super windy on campus since we are right next to the gorge. This winter was insane. We had so many days that were below 10 degrees with wind chills below zero. It was unbearable. Last winter was not as bad, but this one was awful. Even when it isnt frigid it's windy and rainy...not good weather here at all."
College Sophomore,2,"I am used to the Western New York Weather so i adjust accordingly.  However, this does not make it easier to get to and from class on a day to day basis."
College Sophomore,2,I havent had a chance to have much off campus dining. I mean they have restaurants but the only thing that I have tried is chinese mall food and it wasn't that great.
College Sophomore,2,The school is diverse in the sense that there are alot of people that go here with different opinions and perspectives however it is 90% white.
College Freshman,2,"I am not really a huge fan of living on campus at Niagara University. The best furniture is in O'shea Hall. the nicest people are in Clet and Seton Hall. The social atmosphere is non-existant. The weekends here are a ghost town. Every one pretty much goes home. I don't blame them either, because there is nothing to do here."
College Student,2,"I received very little financial aid, I feel the financila aid office should meet with students to better direct them and inform them exactly how it works."
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation at NU is hardly convenient. The shuttle doesn't stop at many locations. On top of that, the bus comes every few hours - if you miss it, you're completely out of luck. Unfortunately, the university is also isolated. So if you don't have a car, and miss the shuttle, and like many students, don't have money for the bus or a taxi, you're in a very bad position."
College Senior,2,The region of Niagara Falls is both bad and good. There is the natural wonder Niagara Falls. Only issue is that the region is very struck with poverty and crime. Sometimes Niagara Students are targeted for crimes
College Freshman,2,"I have heard about them a few times, and I have a guy friend in a frat. He loves it and they have tons of events they attend. I personally I have to interest in the Greek Life though."
College Sophomore,2,The Greek life does not really affect the campus. They do a lot of great things for our community but they don't stand out at NU. They aren't big on parties which is fine with me since I don't really like that scene but others complain sometimes. They didn't even have recruitment until midterm week in the fall.
Freshman,1,"DO NOT EVER THINK YOUR ACHEIVING ANYTHING OUT OF ONLINE LEARNING.
IT SUCKS TO HIGHEST LEVEL..SO IF ANY OF YOU FEEL THIS IS THE BEST WAY OF LEARNING PLEASE THINK THIS THROUGH."
College Senior,1,There are like to sororities and one frat.  I don't even know if there nationally recognized.  If your looking for the frat scene niagara isn't for you.  Being in a sorority or frat has no effect on the social life scene.  They accepted basically anybody.  If you want to be in greek life without having to deal the selection process or hazing this is the school for you.
College Freshman,1,Clet is awful. They are changing food provider though. Gally is good but very expensive. There is zero dining options past 10 pm on weekdays. Weekends are worse.
College Junior,1,"Coming to college you think you are going to gain a lot of freedom. However, Niagara University is very strict on the amount  of freedom you are allowed to have. You are very limited on how much of a social life you have as you must sign in everyone you bring into your dorm building. If you have a significant other of the opposite sex when you join college, it is very hard to have them stay over unless you know someone of the same sex to sign them in on an overnight pass. I also understand the importance of attendance, but most rules are if you miss more than three classes you fail. Therefore, if you are sick and they do not excuse you it is very easy to fail. It also does not give people a lot of freedom to make their own decisions."
College Junior,1,"Dealing with financial aide is a headache. They are very unorganized and do not seem to really know the best way to deal with situations. The amount of financial aide given is very helpful, however, dealing with ongoing financial aide is a hassle."
College Sophomore,1,"It is always so windy, and so rainy, and so freezing! However, because the campus is small, you're never outside for more then 10 minutes at a time so its really not that bad. A lot of us walk through other buildings to get to father away ones so we don't have to be outside that long when its that cold. It is because of lake effect being right next to the Niagara River."
College Junior,1,Parking costs are rather high and there is limited parking.
College Junior,1,I am always cold so Niagara's campus is not ideal for me. During the winter it is extremely cold and the wind can be unbearable.
College Junior,1,They removed most of the parking for a new building. Now the students park in the Power Authority parking lot. It is so aggravating. It is a nightmare. The parking is the worst for commuters. Get there early if at all possible. It is the same for freshman-seniors...no special parking. They love giving tickets too.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Really, not much diversity at all. Most people come from Western New York and have grown up together. If you're looking for a change, don't waste your time."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Niagara Falls often experiences the same weather as Buffalo, NY and pretty much everyone across the country refers to Buffalo as the snow capital of the world, so you do the math. Add the constant wind to that and you have Niagara University. I recommend taking scarves and wearing jackets with high necks during the winter - you'll need it. Also, invest in a wind-breaker or something."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Most of the food in the dining hall will make you sick. Not to mention they rarely change the menu. However, it's convenient and relatively fast."
Recent Alumnus,1,"You often have to park in the Power Authority lot simply because there is not enough parking on campus for commuters. Plus, the Power Authority has NO problem giving tickets, which stinks if you're a theater major and have rehearsals until 11pm."
College Freshman,1,There are very few frats and sororities. 
College Freshman,1,"Unlike other schools, the party scene is very depressed, unless you know someone, parties tend to be extremely scarce for some people. If you want a REAL college experience when parties are every weekday, don't go here. They do happen from time to time, but going to nightclubs and bars are consistent, but taxi, and cover charges add up. This horrible nightlife is one of the BIG reasons why many people I know are transferring far far away with no second thoughts. I can see this University hurting for students in the upcoming years, and will have no choice but to lower their standards with less cash flow.  Many say it's the Dean is the cause of this, do to the crackdown. I'm indifferent about this, but I'm just telling you how I see/hear it. "
College Junior,1,There is not much Greek life on campus and they do not have their own houses
College Sophomore,1,they try but there is not really much unless you go to canada
College Senior,1,The food at my school is alright tasting but it could use a lot of work. There is a main dining hall that is available to undergraduates as well as grad and staff. The only problem is that there are very few selections and the menu gets very repetitive. Not very much nutritious options for students going to class.
College Freshman,1,Step It up â€“ The financial aid process is cruicial.  In my experience I've had to meet with them several time and they do not help as much when you need help in finding money to be able to continue staying at the college. So you must take the intiative to go to the financial aids office plenty of times to deal with situations in person.
College Freshman,1,the town is a tourist area mainly so things are focused for them and there really aren't many things especially during the winter to do. Once you seen the attraction there is nothing.

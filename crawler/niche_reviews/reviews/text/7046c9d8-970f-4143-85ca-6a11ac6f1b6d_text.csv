Alum,5,"Great school, excellent faculty, fun place to live and learn! Learning in a city like Salem, full of history, is so much fun!"
Alum,5,"Online and hybrid learning at SSU is easy, smooth, and lots of professors know what they are doing! Professors are always willing to help and answer questions and work with you!"
Sophomore,5,The transition from switching in class to online during the virus was very smooth in my experience. My professors were well prepared and understanding. They were able to provide everything we needed to finish the semester.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, Salem State is the right school for me. The campus isn’t too big so it’s easy to find your way around. All the professors are outstanding and very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"I love Salem State; it is like a second home to me. From day one, the staff and professors made me feel so welcome, and instantly it became my happy place. The beautiful dorm halls, newly renovated bathrooms, and a 24 hour dining hall certainly made it the place to be. The professors give us their full attention during classes, and learning is made easy. Salem State University is a phenomenal school."
Junior,5,I am a transfer student and am so happy at SSU! I am in the Public History concentration and it was a perfect match for me. The location is lovely and Salem is such an adorable city.
Junior,5,"I like the way they welcome you into the campus, you don’t feel like you’re alone. They’re always making sure that you’re doing great. They are very good at listening to the students. Changes that I would like to make are only the parking and the freshmen dorms."
Junior,5,"This school is a great school with many academic options for students who are looking to advance in life. Although due to the covid19 a lot of classes were moved to online, which made the experience a little bit harder because we had to be on top of assignments more than ever. Besides that, the school is a great place to get your education and learn about your field of study."
Junior,5,I truly enjoy going to college at Salem Sate. Very friendly to transfer students. There is a lot of  diversity on campus.
Freshman,5,They are professional with every student I need extra time on my exams and quiz and I got it. I was struggling with a class and they told me if I don’t xyz they would take it and grade it . They do everything in their powers to have all kids pass unless they are really not getting it
Junior,5,"I have had a very positive experience attending Salem State University. There are a diverse community of professors that are really engaging with the student body. Academically, the classes have been somewhat challenging but not to the point that its too difficult to succeed. All the professors really care about our education and really do everything in their power to help us learn the material they're teaching. The food at Salem State may not be the absolute best, but it is very good, better then a lot of the restaurants in the area. The cafeteria is always clean and the staff are very nice and friendly."
Sophomore,5,"All jokes aside I truly love this school. The inclusiveness really makes you feel at home and makes you feel like you belonged. I remember my freshman year having doubts about coming here but eventually I realized this school for me. Now, I could go on and on about this school but what really bothers me the most is how much the university fees go up each year. Freshman year I was paying 700 for tuition but now I have to pay 2000$ for tuition. They have really awesome food here it’s so good"
Freshman,5,I love Salem State great culture and great relations between the faculty and students. Food is amazing which is key. Dorms when your a freshman/sophomore are ok. Senior and junior year they are so much nicer and better. Other than that its a solid school. I would recommend it because its affordable and great learning experience.
Senior,5,Salem State is a really good school where I am able to get a great education. They are so many professors that are willing to help you to succeed. I have overall a good experience.
Junior,5,I love it here. The people are super supportive and nice. There is a lot of people that I would not have met coming here. The professors could use so work though.
Sophomore,5,During my freshman year at Salem State University I have learned so much about my major in theater and in playwriting. All the professors take their time in the theatre department to have a one on one talk with each students and help them achieve their goal and become successful in their field of expertise.
Freshman,5,Great faculty to student ratio and everyone is willing to help you with any kind of issue you may have.  Plenty of resources on campus and opportunities to find employment.
Freshman,5,This school is very diverse and accepting of everyone. There are so many opportunities across campus as well as beyond the classroom for students to succeed.
Sophomore,5,Salem State University is a wonderful college. All the teachers are super helpful and they work with you. The staff at Salem State University is great and also helpful. I do not think I would change anything for Salem State.
Freshman,5,Salem state has been a great school.  Many of my family members and friends have graduated from Salem state and have had great experiences
Freshman,5,"I chose Salem State for its affordability and education program. The best education in the state of Massachusetts. The program really prepares you for K-12 setting, community education, or other forms of education. I highly recommend. I lived on campus and the resident life is amazing there. All of the programs really help in the college experience."
Senior,5,"When I was in high school trying to figure out what college I want to go to Salem State became my dream school and first choose college when I applied. I love everything about Salem state. I love that it is in an easy walkable town and that it is closed knit easy to go to your classes, I loved my dorms I stayed in and the roommate I have, I also love the chooses of clubs and organizations on campus. The food could be better but other then that I love it there and can't wait for my last year. I am also thinking about applying there again for my masters in social work."
Sophomore,5,Salem State is an amazing university with nice professors. Who are willing to help you in your academic life. The housing staff is also really nice and helpful. There is always a fun activity on campus from carnivales to movie nights.
Junior,5,"I'm currently going into my junior year at Salem State University and I cannot express how much I love being a student here. I discovered my passion for History and stepped out of my academic comfort zone due to all the tremendous amount of support I receive from my professors and the faculty. I am also a First-Year Mentor and helping the incoming freshmen every year brings me so much pride and I feel a great amount of gratitude at the opportunities having this job gives me. Furthermore, SSU made my dream come true as I am studying abroad this Fall in Ireland - this would not have been possible without their guidance and overall enthusiasm. I love Salem State and I am a proud Viking!"
Sophomore,5,"I am a theatre arts major at Salem State Univeristy, and going into my sophomore year. As a theatre student I am involved in a lot of extra curricular activities. The shows, plays, and musicals that we put up are fantastic, and they are a great way to meet good people. Every professor I've had has been nice and welcome to open discussion in the classroom. Even my math professor my second semester was enjoyable. The school is far from perfect, but I enjoy it at Salem State University."
Junior,5,I haven't been to salem state yet but it is a very good school. I will be transferring over in the fall 2018. I'm very excited to know more about it and see all of the diversity they have.
Junior,5,I love ssu! From the teachers to the atmosphere I feel like I could not have picked a better school to fit me. Everyone is so welcoming and for the most part all teachers are willing to help better their students and help them pass. There is not much to complain about SSU. They offer all the resources you need to pass and get your degree.
Alum,5,"By having my strong example of a mother graduate and get her masters in social work from this institute I am following in her foot steps and will be getting my degree in psychology. Salem welcomed me with open arms and made me feel thankful to have the opportunity to study, learn, and grow there."
Niche User,5,I went to Salem State University for a college visit. I fell in love with the campus and I also loved the sense of community here. I encourage people to go and visit this school and check out the different activities there are for students. I Am defiantly considering going here.
Freshman,5,My experience attending Salem University  has been a great inspiration and motivational experience to succeed and continue on completing my future goals .The courses are easily accessible and informative .With many accessible help tools available taking courses are made easy and well taught by professors who care for a successful academic experience.Having a well informative library accessible to all .Many courses available . A very well diversified school.  The only thing that needs to change about the school are the school colors.
Freshman,5,"I love then environment and how everyone is kind. In the classes, they're small. I rather the class size be small because you're an actual person and not just a number. If I could change something, then I would add a swim team because I was a swimmer for four years and I would love the chance to compete again."
Graduate Student,5,"The school is very easy to get too, parking is usually easy to find, I loved it here. I learned so much and my professors were willing to help out whenever needed. I am going back soon for another degree and I cannot wait to attend the college! Great events, great gym, great people and teachers, and wonderful learning environment!"
Freshman,5,"Salem state university is a wonderful school. Classes are not as filled where you can have one and one with the professors. The professors here are very helpful and are willing to help. Academics overall is amazing, I have learned an exceeding amount of things."
Senior,5,"I like the convenience as an older student; being able to attend day and evening classes while I work full time makes my life easier. Through their flexible scheduling in terms of classes, I am able to complete my degree and work full time. I wish the campus was more diverse and I hope some day that it will be."
Freshman,5,Salem state is a beautiful campus with great professors that are engaged with their students and want them to succeed.
Sophomore,5,My experience on campus is limited to the classes I take because I try to focus on that aspect of my life. I have had classes that required me to attend events outside of my classes but those were manageable. I don't have much to base campus life on being that I attend classes and leave after the end. I cannot rate things I haven't experienced so those are the N/As. I am a commuting student so I don't stay on campus.
Freshman,5,I'm going into salem state as a freshmen and I love the admission process. The faculty was very helpful and orientation helped with anxieties.
Senior,5,"SSU is a great state Institution for its tuition affordability, multicultural, quality academic standard and learning resources and easy campus access, convenient parking system for students and its proactive safety facility with police dept station on site."
Sophomore,5,I love Salem State University they help me discovered what I want to do with my life. The environment is open and friendly everyone so nice and you're free to express your self.
Sophomore,5,Salem State University is a beautiful school with such a diverse set of faculty and students. The university makes  it appoint to have their students feel at home and safe. It is a fantastic community to be and you can tell the professors enjoy what they do.
Freshman,5,"I really love it here at Salem State University. Everyone here is very welcoming and there are many resources here on campus to help you succeed and be the best student that you could possibly be. there are many different activities on campus that one can easily join. I recently just joined Theta Phi Alpha, and all of the girls are really amazing and great people. I am also apart of LASO (Latin American Student Organization) and they are very accepting of everyone that comes into contacting with them. The professors here are also very inviting and welcoming and encourage you to reach out to them if you ever need help. Everyone here wants to see you succeed."
Works Here,5,"I actually work at Salem State University and am going back to earn my Bachelor's degree.  From what students say, the university is more affordable than those in the surrounding areas.  I know a lot of the staff and they have helped me enroll, complete my FAFSA, and become prepared to start this summer.  I am a single mom of 16 year old twins who also have an interest in SSU for fall 2018.  The amount of help I received really took the stress out of the way.  I am feeling more confident than ever being an older adult going back to school.  I was 30 when I entered college for my associate's degree and my twins were 2 and I did it!  I also want to be a role model for my family and other single moms, like myself."
Freshman,5,"This my second semester in SSU and I feel that this place is amazing, there a lot of diversity, a amazing atmosphere and the faculty are amazing. I was so afraid about my first semester, but thanks God I made it with good grades. Overall this place is amazing the faculty are very responsible and passionate."
Freshman,5,"I loved my time at SSU. All the professors I had were laid back but still passionate about their work and their teaching, and I've yet to experience a bad class. The campus is nice, some buildings are old, but overall everything is in walking distance of each other and in a very safe area of town. Salem itself is also super fun, especially around October. It doesn't have much of the ""suburb feel"" and feels more like a little city instead. SSU is definitely a good school, you get your money's worth for sure."
Freshman,5,"I remember applying for colleges and not having any idea of Salem State University until one of my counselors told me to apply there because they had a good Nursing program and so I did, then took a tour of the school and absolutely loved it. It wasn't too big nor too small, I could get to my classes in less than five minutes which was good because then I wouldn't have to worry about waking up too early or being in a rush. The faculty and staff at the school are helpful; they like to see students succeed as well as teachers do too. The school offers many clubs and sports, there will be something to do on campus to your liking and if there isn't, then you can create a new club. Everyone has a good time in this school and enjoy it!"
Sophomore,5,Salem State is a great university. There is so much the school has to offer both academically and socially. Overall it is a very good school with numerous amounts of programs and resources. 
Junior,5,Love the feel of the university. Great Library! Make sure you get your clipper card and put some money on it. Wish I applied to this university first and sooner.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is really a safe place. The school has its own police and it is everywhere so there is a sense of safety. They have buttons to press incase of feelings of uneasiness. overall, it is a safe place. except the area around rainbow terrace. it is not a place to be walking around late. Other than that, the school is good."
College Junior,5,We don't have a football team but hockey and rugby are REALLY big on campus.
College Junior,5,the professors really care about you succeeding
College Junior,5,I feel our security on our campus has shown in multiple cases that they have a really well understanding of keeping our community safe. This year alone we have had multiple incidence that has caused out safety to be at risk but our police and security have taken control the situation allowing it to be safe for many on campus.
College Freshman,5,"I have recently made the varsity Women's Lacrosse team here, it's a great experience so far. It's being apart of a family and everyone is accepting and excited to have freshmen on the team."
College Freshman,5,Salem State University is a very welcoming school. Not only does it have one of the most appealing  student environments as a new university but its professors want to do their best to see every student be successful in their own individual passions.
College Freshman,5,"I really like the class sizes, they are small enough that the teachers will get to know you. All my teachers so far have been really great"
College Freshman,5,I am not involved in athletics
College Junior,5,"Salem State University is by far the BEST choice I made in my entire life. The professors there are fantastic and helpful. The school is located right in the city and near by to all malls and local stores and restaurants. It has many opportunities on campus as well as off campus. As a commuter, I feel entirely grateful with all the support from school and feel involved like those who are residents on campus. I can't forget that they have been remodeling and constructing for the past three years and the campus looks AMAZING!!!"
College Freshman,5,"The reason I believe Salem State is the best University to attend is because of how inclusive and diverse the community is-- and I don't use the term community lightly: the student body and faculty at the school is so close knit and wholesome, it's easy to believe they are a family. There is a wide array of extracurriculars, including sports, clubs, and community programs. All fields of interest are represented within the extracurriculars, and there's always something to do. Everyone at the school makes an effort to be inclusive and nonjudgmental. All around, this school offers a wholesome and ethereal campus. In addition to the atmosphere, the education offered at the school is what I look forward to most. While admittedly, I have yet to experience the academia, I only hear the most respectful and superb commentary from the students."
College Sophomore,5,"The school offers great courses that help build on your own personal learning and toward your degree choice. The campus is kept clean and lively and feels very welcoming. Resources are always close at hand with offices for financials, health, and research. Their programs are always helpful whether it's academic or just to get to know the school and your peers more. I want to continue my education at this school since it famous for its program in education. I feel this school stands out because of the quality of teaching with a reasonable class size, great scheduling, amount of resources, and the easy feel of dorm life."
College Freshman,5,"There are plenty of places to get food: near the campus / downtown Salem, Northshore / Liberty Tree mall, and plenty of take out / delivery options within the main roads surrounding the college. I love the options. It won't take you long to figure out the best places to eat. Examples of places people usually go: Gula -Gula Cafe, Howling Wolf, Engine House, Jade House, Omega, White Dove, Chipotle"
College Sophomore,5,ABSOLUTE BEST ATHLETIC FACILITIES. Favorite part!
Sophomore,4,"The only online classes I've taken are due to the COVID pandemic, however all professors made it very simple to learn online."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID, I was required to take online classes for my first semester. I think they handled the situation very well and took plenty of appropriate measures to keep the campus safe."
Junior,4,"The first time taking an online class can be nerve wracking since it's different from in-person classes. I was confused about online submissions, but the professor made it very easy for me. I emailed my professor & asked for clarification. I received an email back within 5-10 minutes which the professor kindly explained to me step by step regarding submissions. 

When we changed to remote learning for the remainder of the semester due to covid-19, the professors did their best at mimicking their in-person lectures & taught the courses just like they would before the pandemic. During these virtual lectures, they would continuously check in on the students to make sure we understood everything before moving onto the next topic. They prioritized our mental health & gave extensions if we needed them. We were given quizzes or extra credit assignments to test our understanding of the lectures. They also offered extra office hours if we needed someone to talk to & acted as our counselor."
Senior,4,"Going to SSU has been life-changing. My high school did not offer me many experiences in feeling free to fully express myself. Going to Salem State University was a culture shock. I saw brown and black faces ranging in different shades. I met people all around the world, who taught me about their cultures and religions. I made friends with people who have educated me on what it is like to live life in their shoes. My professors always extended a helping hand and I was given the chance to participate in groups like TRIO, BEES, LASO, NSLS, the psychology club, and Evan became a mentor to local high school students. College is what you make of it and I thought I've learned much about my major, but I feel that I have learned more about myself that can help me improve my life and career later on down the road. Salem has extended their hand and offered me the chance to be comfortable on campus and always looks to try to benefit their students and its something many under-appreciate."
Alum,4,"I love the atmosphere of Salem State. The Professors are really helpful and try their best to see you succeed. They always have events on campus and Salem itself is very lively as well. I was a commuter student, so I don’t know much about dorm  living, but I would still highly recommend Salem State."
Freshman,4,Salem State University is a great place to explore your interests as they have a wide range of courses in a welcoming and very diverse environment.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Salem State University. Salem State was one of my top choices because of the academics and how affordable it is. When I fist arrived at Salem State it took be some time to get use to the environment, but the on-campus activities allowed me to go out of my comfort zone and make new relationships. There is lots to do here, and I have learned that there is never a dull moment at Salem State University! As for academics, I am currently a Nursing Major and I am very happy with how my first year has been going. The classes are all very interesting and almost all of my professors have given me extra help or resources to be able to succeed. If you want to go to a small school that has an amazing campus and incredible resources, I highly suggest considering Salem State University!"
Freshman,4,"This school has a good and positive atmosphere, a lot of very educational and fun programs weekly, and most of the professors are good as well. The facilities need to be more up to date. Facilities like the two main classroom buildings are very old and in need of repair. They have been fixing the roof of one of them for nearly a year and it is very disrupting when youre in class to hear those sounds."
Freshman,4,"While SSU was not my top college choice, I have grown to love it even more than I could have thought, and I can't see myself elsewhere. However, if you are looking to study anything other than the humanities, social sciences, or theatre, I would not recommend SSU. The music department is sub-par, but the theatre department is absolutely fantastic. SSU is the ONLY four-year public school in New England that is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST). The psychology department is also very good, with countless courses, pathways, programs, and student organizations to take part in that make academics feel that much more involved (again, mainly for the fields of study described previously). Despite focus on only some departments within the school, SSU is generally a fantastic place to be, with thousands of students living both on and off-campus that are absolutely stellar people who do their best to contribute to a welcoming and encouraging environment for all"
Senior,4,I like that the school offers accommodating resources and flexible classes with supportive teachers who generally want you to do well and succeed.
Freshman,4,My experience with Salem State thus far is average overall because this is my first year here and I have to say academically it was terrible because the professors were not all that great and understanding but the environment and people you meet are amazing and I have made such great friends and survived my first semester and can only hope for the better next semester.
Junior,4,"SSU is a great campus for commuters. The professors are awesome, the school is accomodating, and the cost is low if you are commuting from home. However, living in the dorms can be messy as facilities is slow to respond and is reactive to issues, not proactive. The on-campus experience has improved as a whole between less-strict rules, improved dining experience, and emphasis on events for students. There is not a large party-scene on campus, and greek-life is very small, so if that's an important aspect to you it may not be the best choice. Overall, choose this school with confidence if you are looking to feel accepted and save money by commuting while also recieving a good education."
Alum,4,Commuted throughout my four years of undergrad. I enjoyed that the campus is not too big but not too small. The add on of the garage helped a ton. Most profressors were helpful and wanted so see their students succeed.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman now at Salem State and I really have liked it so far. I have made lots of friends so far and really like my classes. Some of my teachers I would not recommend because of how they act in the classroom and the way they teach but my other teachers are great. I don’t have a lot of workload which is also nice but other people do and that I know.
Freshman,4,"I think many different things could change. I think their food could use a huge upgrade, it reminds me a lot of high school lunch and I did not like that at all. I think the dorms could also use an upgrade. I think they could make it bigger so it is easier to move around and also improve the beds a lot by making them more soft and comfortable because when I slept on it, it felt like a wooden bed and my neck hurt in the morning."
Freshman,4,"Salem State is a very diverse community that is always willing to help. Coming from Maine, you don't typically see a lot of diversity so it's nice to see a state that is definitely a melting pot with citizens that come from all over."
Freshman,4,"Very diverse community, as well as a great sense of togetherness. Professors for the Biology department are all very willing to answer any questions yo may have as well as offer you one on one time to better understand any of the topics that they may have gone over during class."
Freshman,4,"They’ve got a nifty little system with this thing called a Clippercard that serves as an ID that you can use to buy food at the campus dining halls and/or at the local restaurants in the surrounding area! The faculty is also very adamant about providing help and support to its students in every area applicable. I wish they would get better beds, they’re like concrete, so remember to bring a good mattress pad!"
Freshman,4,Staff and students are both very friendly and helpful towards the first year freshmen students. The campus is clean and well kept.
Freshman,4,"Salem State has been a very good experience for me thus far.  I will be a sophomore next semester and I am also a commuter.  I know that I have seen some things about the dorms and school buildings not being cleaned. Which is very true, I think that Salem State could work on upkeep in all academic buildings for sure."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at Salem State so far. The campus and overall atmosphere is a smaller school but in a city, so you can still have an intimate experience with the school while still being in a densely populated area so you don't feel like you are missing out on much. The only thing I wish would improve is the dining hall services, but other than that I have no complaints."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Salem State University has been challenging but also rewarding. The campus is extremely diverse and I'm getting the opportunity to make friends and socialize with others that are of a different culture, ethnic background,  or religion. However, some of the professors lack the skills necessary in order to teach their students. They sometimes lack patience and are sometimes unavailable when needed. But otherwise, I've been thoroughly enjoying my time at Salem State University."
Senior,4,I am a transfer student and have only taken online classes. I have found that the professors have been super helpful and quick to return emails.  The course work is straight forward. As long as you are willing to put in the work you will succeed.  These upcoming summer sessions will be my first in class experience.  My wife being a graduate of the school will help me navigate campus.  I will admit the campus is spread out too far.  Some parts aren't walking distance from certain parts of campus.
Graduate Student,4,"great Gym on campus, good library, the registrar was responsive, it was easy to get feedback from teachers and administrators, affordable too"
Graduate Student,4,"Salem State University is located in a great town. The students are diverse, the teachers are very enthusiastic about teaching. The tuition is affordable"
Freshman,4,"I've only been a student at SSU for a semester, but I know it was the right choice for me.  While the school isn't perfect, it provides an environment that fosters learning and meeting new people. The food could be better, but they are making improvements in their freshman dorms, and they are definitely on the right track."
Freshman,4,"Personally I like Salem State, the staff is beyond helpful and understanding. But the buildings could use a remodel and the food options can be changed up a bit."
Graduate Student,4,I love the classes and the community. The classes are challenging and the professors are great. The Social Work classes are offered in the evening which is great for working students.
Graduate Student,4,"Salem State University has been a great experience as a graduate student. Despite some traffic in the city, Salem is a great location to attend college with many resources around. The professors are friendly and helpful. The library is has a great environment. I also got the chance to travel to Rwanda in Africa that Salem State provided me with."
Sophomore,4,"My experience has been good so far. I have enjoyed most of my professors and classes. I do believe that they need to change their shuttle system, food options, parking and visitor policies."
Senior,4,"I am an evening student at Salem State transfer from Santo Domingo, my experience at Salem State has been for the most part pleasurable when needed assistance on academics I have received help needed. Would recommend the school."
Senior,4,Salem State University recently got the status university it was previously a college. It is in general a good school. It is quite expensive for the service it offers. The student life lacks a lot. Help centers in school like the admission and the center for students need serious improvement.
Senior,4,"Going to Salem State University is a pretty good experience, the campus is well designed and nicely incorporated in the town. There are plenty of small food places and food chains at remote distances. Even though the parties aren't all that they have a couple of good bars"
Senior,4,"I like the different opinions of students and faculty on campus and the right to express their opinion even if it is negative regarding the university.The right to express discrimination by minority students is heard by the administration,but not always resolved.The affordability of the higher education is attractive and the commute is easier than driving into Boston,and quicker than taking the train.Access to the Salem State food pantry is helpful and builds community .The athletic teams and facilities are top notch and build healthy bodies and minds."
Sophomore,4,Small school but is still a good learning atmosphere. Greek life made my experience in this school better. One thing i will say is that food needs to be improved as well as parking and shuttle transportations.
Senior,4,"Salem State has been a great home for me over the last three years. Now reflecting and looking back at my experience, from the moment I stepped on campus I felt welcomed. I was able to join multiple student organizations (Latin American Student Organization, Student Government Association, etc.,) that made me feel like family and helped me pursue the role of becoming a student leader on campus. I loved being able to have such a role on campus which led me to become an orientation leader at Salem State to welcome all new students just as Salem State welcomed me."
Graduate Student,4,Salem State is an affordable university with many degree options. The business building is well maintained but the school of nursing could use much updating. The location and option of hybrid and online classes are convenient for a graduate student who is working full time.
Junior,4,"What I like about the school is that the school is very diverse. The school is well equipped with people from various ethnicity and race. The inclusive environment Salem State University creates allows students to learn different cultures and help build interrelations between people from all over the world. 

What I would like to see change is the tenure that some professors have. Every semester, student give feedback on how teachers performed throughout the semester, however because tenure, some teachers are not surveyed and cannot be assessed by students. I don't think it is a good idea that they cannot be surveyed because the art of learning never stops till we die, hence these teachers can continue to learn from students' feedback and make necessary changes on the classes they teach."
Sophomore,4,"The reason I choose Salem State as my college was for two important reasons. The first was for the program my major is involved in. I am a Theatre Performance major at Salem State and the program there is one of the best in the whole country. The professors are amazing at their jobs and they take the time to get to know every student on a personal level. I have only been there for one year and I already feel like everyone knows me. That is the best part about this school. The second reason I chose Salem was for the location. I love the city and I enjoy going downtown with my friends and seeing all the historic and exciting things Salem has to offer. I especially love how fun and exciting Halloween is every year. Even though the school is not perfect, then again, what school is? Even with the imperfections of the school itself, I still think it is the perfect school for me."
Junior,4,"I transferred from North Shore Community College to Salem State University. Salem State University has a lot of great student and staff same as NSCC, I have had such an amazing experience attending this four-year college. I like the school environment, I have not yet seen something that can make me think about transferring to another college. The only thing I could complain of is the parking situation, it's really hard to find a parking space even though you pay for school parking ticket and end up parking in the streets. If you live on campus, there is no need to worry about."
Freshman,4,"Salem State is very diverse and inclusive with everything they do, including having gender neutral bathrooms. The library is full of twists and turns, and you're always likely to find a nice quiet spot to study. There are also rooms where you can talk and study with your friends! I love the fact that my school brings so many different kinds of people in; this is where I met all of my current best friends! There are two things that stick out the most to me when it comes to what should change within the school; the bathrooms (at least speaking from the girl's point of view) do not have any ventilation, so we're breathing in the grime from the wet shower walls. So maintenance could do something about that! Second, the food. There is rarely ANY vegetables out and a lot of the food is extremely salty or coated in something most likely unhealthy; there are also not a lot of vegetarian options."
Senior,4,When you walk around there are a variety of people walking next to you. Class sizes are good and most teachers are great at their jobs.
Sophomore,4,The people there are very helpful and they are always willing to help their students with everything.
Sophomore,4,The faculty are great. They definitely know what they are teaching and are almost always willing to go the extra mile and meet with you one-on-one outside of the classroom. There are so much opportunities to get involved on campus. There is always an event happening so you're never bored.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the environment around Salem especially downtown. There is such amazing food, stores, people, and views with so much history. The door rooms here at Salem State are very nice, they do a great job cleaning them and updating them. The only thing I would personally change is the food, the dinning halls seem to have the same thing every night with not a lot of options."
Alum,4,I loved Salem State. The professors really care about your well being and want you to succeed. There are a lot of opportunities for student involvement.
Freshman,4,Salem State is a good school overall there are just a couple problems with acceptance within the students.
Junior,4,I love how inclusive the campus here is! I would however like to see more preparedness for the real world.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman, so I have not experienced much so far, but from what I have, it has been great. The food is really the only downer, I would say. But the professors are great, class availability, the honors program, and all the sports and clubs are really great. Also getting a free gym membership to the gym on campus is great."
Sophomore,4,It is a very good college but is very heavily commuter based so the parties are off campus and the dining halls close on the weekend so only one is open. All of the staff is very nice and wants to help but they don't care if you finish in 4 years or 10 they just want money.
Senior,4,I am a senior year nursing student at Salem State University. I am entering my final semester and will be graduating this upcoming May of 2018. My experience at SSU has been a good one. My major has challenged me and I feel as if I am prepared to enter my field of work after graduation. I have been challenged constantly and this has made me stronger in the long run. Something that I would like to see changed at this university is the cost. The cost of attending SSU has continued to increase every semester and has made it very difficult for students to continue with their undergrad education.
Sophomore,4,"I like that everyone is outgoing and friendly. I like how awesome the professors are in class and how helpful they are. I like how there are a lot of resources you an use for help such the writing center, career services and trio. What I would like to see change is in the food selection and more parking spots for the commuters."
Junior,4,"Biggest complaint is the parking situation and the 3 campuses being a walk from each other. Other than that, the classes are good and the people are welcoming"
Junior,4,"I love being close to home. My commute is only 20 minutes driving with traffic. Also, I like the community; very diverse and involving for students especially commuters. Professors are also very helpful for my transitioning from a private school to a totally different program and environment of a public school. I've enjoyed my experience here more than at my previous school."
Senior,4,"Salem State is one of those schools where you either love it or hate it. I transferred into SSU going into my sophomore year and I loved it from the minute I arrived. That being said, there are some issue with the university that need to be worked on. The lack of diversity within the student population as well as the faculty/staff population is what drives away many students because they do not see themselves represented at the university. The first year dorms are sub par but all the other dorms are a huge step up. Gender inclusive housing is available at SSU but it needs work to make it better than what it currently is. The biggest drawback to SSU is the amount of time it takes to actually receive your degree. Most students at Salem State require five years to obtain their bachelors degree which is absurd because not everyone has the ability to drop another $20,000 on a year of college that they were not expecting."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my freshman year, and I loved it. I met many amazing people, and some wonderful professors who made it easy to come to class, ask questions, and never stop learning."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my professors have been great. Small class sizes make it feel a little like high school.

If you can, rent off campus and commute to school. You'll save so much money compared to just living on campus."
Senior,4,I would like to see the advisors have better communication with the students and have more knowledge with the information they provide.  I have found the advisors would give course information regarding what classes to take but the information hasn't always been correct and prevents students from taking the proper classes on time.
Junior,4,"This school is coming a very long way! They are continuously doing construction and expanding. Also, their nursing school is very well put together and very knowledgable! The freshman dorms could use some work, but the sophomore and junior dorms are extremely nice."
Alum,4,"The administration was quite confusing to deal with and maneuver.  Like all colleges, it seemed like none of the departments talk to each other and you can lose a day running back and forth across campus.  However, the professors are wonderful and believe in the students.  I think I received a quality education."
Senior,2,"A lot of my professors are much older and are not so tech-savvy. The transition to remote online learning has been an experience that I have not admired due to the fact that learning online is not how I retain information. My professors did their best to cater to the needs of my classmates. Many of them stayed up later than usual, gave me personal emails and numbers to reach them for questions. Some of them didn't even bother to read their emails. We used our online learning portal, CANVAS, and many of my professors did not use it cause they were unfamiliar with its software. It was difficult trying to access new syllabi and keeping up-to-date with assignments. Many assignments weren't listed properly, so I struggled with turning in assignments on time or even trying to understand on what I should be doing for the assignments. I feel like I did not retain any of the information I learned online and felt like many of my professors kind of gave up out of frustration and stress."
Freshman,2,"The school is just not quality, classes are extremely easy here. Small Classes, but the school is pretty cliquey so if you don't initially feel like you fit in, it won't change, as people usually stick to themselves and who they know. Parties and fights happen at all hours of the night here and can keep you awake past 3am. Smoking isn't allowed but people openly smoke weed here and drink. The reason to factor as to why the school also sucks is because they literally let people who didnt graduate highschool come here. Theres a program from incoming freshman who didnt graduate called summer bridge program, and by letting students enter in that way it makes it seem like the gpa to get into this school is less than a 3.0 but the majority of people you meet in your freshman year could've gotten less than a 2.0gpa in highschool. Overall the experience is like a trashy highschool that you pay for, if you want to have a legitimate college experience, look somewhere else."
Freshman,2,"In my honest opinion, it was the worst decisions I've ever made. I applied to 20 schools and got accepted into 19 of them. I was persuaded to come to Salem because it was cheap but as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for."""
Graduate Student,2,"The faculty here are initially helpful to students and appear to want the best for the student. However, they will play favorites and treat some students better than others. When you get into the upper-level courses of the program the faculty are no longer helpful. They are hesitant in answering emails or questions students may have and they are not required to post grades in the upper-level classes. I had a very poor experience in one of my courses where the Professor posted feedback and grades late on paper, leaving students hanging. I did end up failing the course and being dismissed from the program because of poor feedback on assignments and not receiving help when I requested it. If they attempt to put you on a behavior plan please do not return to the program as they use this as a way to dismiss students. Choose another OT program that allows you to perform to your best capacity, this program is unfortunately not designed this way."
Sophomore,2,After completing my first yearn I have never been more disappointed in my life. The lack of care for the student body and overall vibe of the campus is saddening.
College Junior,2,There's not much to do.
College Junior,2,"Greek life almost doesn't exist at my school. There's one fraternity and two sororities. We just recently added the second sorority. Nobody really pays much attention to Greek life. They don't get their own houses or anything like that, so there's no party scene like there is at some schools. Non-Greeks seem to have no interest in how the Greeks act because it's so low key at my school. Greek life doesn't effect my school much at all. There are sometimes fundraisers that are going on at the dining hall or some place, but it's not enough for the whole school to get involved or even know about."
College Freshman,2,The professors honestly don't care how youre doing. They just care about getting through all the material that they have to for the semester. No information has to be retained because its not gone over after the test is done.
College Freshman,2,I don't think we have greek life but if we do then its not very common at all.
College Freshman,2,"My biggest problem with SSU is the fact that most kids who go to school here are local. I'm not from Eastern Massachusetts so I have no idea what goes on here. Normally that wouldn't be a problem because I'd be able to figure it out, however, everybody, and I mean everybody, goes home after Friday night. It's rare that you see more than 20 people around the Freshman part of campus on the weekends so that makes it very difficult to find people that you really click with. On top of that, the food is terrible, I find myself on the toilet because of the food as much as I find myself in class. SSU is also going through a phase of non-stop construction so everyday around 6-7 I wake up to the beautiful sounds of jackhammers tearing apart pavement and constant screaming from the workers. In addition to this, the school is infamous for it's terrible parking and it's dial-up internet. However, October in downtown Salem is very fun. The whole place is packed and there's a lot to do downtown. I'm definitely transferring at the end of the year because I can't deal with another 3 years of this."
College Freshman,2,"The food sucks, but that's chartwell's fault not the school's. The food at the dining Halls is greasy and makes everyone sick. It's not even about options. It's about how they cook EVERYTHING in oil, and then put butter and milk in everything. Very hard if you are vegan or lactose intolerant."
College Freshman,2,I need help with the financial aid.
College Freshman,2,Its not really a smart idea for a college student to do off housing so earnestly when they quality is way below the dorms and the price is way higher.
College Freshman,2,The food can easily improve if people tried a little harder with for diversity. It usually the same things and it not cooked very well either.
College Freshman,2,"I got my financial aid after going to the office three times, but this semester I was told I had to pay $1,117 to remove the hold on my account so I could register for classes. I was furious, the point of financial aid and all the help I was asking for was so I didn't have to pay out of pocket. I was very upset with this. There should be a better system, outlining all the costs of this university."
College Freshman,2,"It's a commuter school, so there isn't a lot going on on the weekends. When a party does happen and it's worth going to, it'll be in someone's off campus apartment."
College Senior,2,Salem is technically a dry camps and the campus police really suck. Parties are alright off campus if you like wanna be frat bros or D3 jocks that think they'll go pro lol.
College Junior,2,"I called to talk to someone concerning my financial aid and they were not very helpful, I thought I got enough in grants and loans but i recently got a bill and it was all so confusing, and I am still confused. I may not have gone here if I realized I would have to pay some out of pocket."
College Junior,2,Greek life isn't big at my school. They are more about community involvement than anything else.
College Junior,2,"I receive no help from my parents, yet the school thinks that they contribute a minimum of $18,000 every year. The Financial Aid office is a stressful place where I never leave happy or on a good note. The employees are miserable and unhelpful."
College Junior,2,"It is an expensive area to live and some of the off-campus options for housing are not safe, especially if there is a late night at the library."
Recent Alumnus,2,With all the campus police you think this wouldn't happen.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is constantly noisy, no parking especially for commuter students.  They keep putting buildings up, taking away student parking and not creating any new parking."
Recent Alumnus,2,This schools financial aid office is not well run.  Your either on hold for extremely long amounts of time and then there's no one there that can answer your question and if you leave a message it takes days to a week to get a return call.
College Senior,2,"DO NOT waste your time with emails.  YOU MUST visit the office with questions and concerns.  YOU should not expect answers to your questions on the first visit.  Be a strong advocate for yourself or be dismissed.  The staff is poorly trained and the administration is weak, this is not the staffs fault and frustration should not be taken out of them, however do not allow them to take out their frustration on you either."
College Senior,2,"Menus do not seem to reflect the tastes of students.  Limited options for those with special diets.  Theme or ethnic menus are usually pretty horrible.  Staff incredibly unfriendly.  Food court contains odd selection of ""brands"" with Burger King as the main draw."
College Senior,2,"Very few options in Downtown Salem.  Public transportation options to downtown are weak, university transportation is irregular and unreliable."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining is horrible! I didn't even think about dining when I applied to school which is a huge regret of mine! Sure, the wraps and salad is alright, but how hard is it to mess up wraps and salad!? While the school says it offers many choices, the choices are repeated daily so your options run out quickly. Many students say the food makes them sick, and I know my stomach did not handle it well when I first came here. Sometimes food isn't even cooked!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"The World Cultures professors are very nice and are always willing to help you. Many of the classes are discussion-based and relatively small. Still, I've found that the students do not hold up worthwhile conversation, unfortunately. It is hard to find another World Cultures major on campus as well. Also there are a few study abroad options, but the higher level you become in a language, the more difficult it is to find an option for you that is through the school and affordable."
College Freshman,2,"The school is extremely strict when it comes to attendance and visitation in dorms. Even if you are a student at the school they will make you be signed in to a dorm at any time of day. As for attendance, each professor has a strict policy but some will be reasonable if you are sick etc. Other professors are so strict that they will kick you out of the class if you miss more than 3 classes, no excuses. As for alcohol and drug use, the school will go as far to check bags but is not strict when it comes to cracking down on students. I had a few friends who were transported and they received little to no discipline. The school and the authority figures in the dorm like to turn a blind eye."
College Freshman,2,"It's clear the university is a commuter school because the university caters to its commuters. My experience with the Freshmen dorms was awful. I live far away and therefore couldn't go home often. On the weekends I found myself all alone in a huge building. I'm lucky enough to be in a nicer building next year. Still, the housing selection process is cutthroat. Also, the school tripled people up in dorms meant for two because they don't have enough room for their residents. Living in a triple is AWFUL and really interfered with my happiness on campus and my success on schoolwork."
College Freshman,2,People seem to be accepting when it comes to ethnic/racial diversity and political beliefs. The campus is EXTREMELY accepting when it comes to sexual orientation. Nevertheless the campus is very standoffish when it comes to religion. I joined various religious groups on campus and found myself fighting for both. The university seems to make things difficult for students who are eager to practice their faith. The Prayer Room on campus (which is shared by EVERY religious group on campus) is little bigger than a closet. I felt like Harry Potter in his cupboard under the stairs. Worse still are the students which tend to act cruelly to those who openly practice their faith.
College Freshman,2,"The guy to girl ratio is extremely lopsided. I believe it is a 7:3 ratio of girls to guys. A large percentage of guys are gay as well due to the popularity of the theater department. This isn't necessarily bad, but unfortunate if you're a straight female."
College Sophomore,2,I misunderstood the deadline for nursing students and regular students.
College Freshman,2,"As an undeclared student, I feel as though there wasn't much assistance in the ""finding a major"" process"
College Sophomore,2,There are no spaces for people to park at north campus for health services or for the library for those students who live on south. It doesn't make sense we're far away and it's not fair.
College Sophomore,2,not really much of a presence or added importance on greek life here.
College Sophomore,2,"No football program is a huge downside. Brand new gym/fitness center is beautiful, but the main athletic building (O'Keefe) is in rough shape. Locker rooms/swimming pool are very obviously outdated."
College Freshman,2,The shuttle is usually never on time for the pickup of students.
College Freshman,2,I'm not very interested in Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid was easy enough to apply for, and even receive, but having the aid applied to your account in a timely fashion - not the greatest.  My aid was late being applied to my account so I couldn't sign up for classes and some of the classes I needed filled up.  My second semester aid came though on time and I had no issues, but I know others who started classes a week or more after classes started and also missed some of the sporting events they participated in because of financial aid mixups."
College Sophomore,2,the school is not know to be a party school
College Sophomore,2,Some of the buildings need renovation and they too spread out
College Junior,2,"It is not great, especially since there is going to be a lot of construction for the next few semesters where the off-campus parking spots currently are. "
College Freshman,2,not a lot of parking spaces
College Freshman,2,"They are strict about a lot of things (dorms, buildings, etc) and it gets annoying. As far as classes go though, that is up to the professor and some are strict while others aren't"
College Freshman,2,"If you're an international student, or can't do the FAFSA for any reason, they hang you out to dry. Absolutely no help, and you're stuck with private scholarships, or even worse Loans"
College Freshman,2,I can smell weed down multiple hallways and in the stairwells sometimes. Drinking occurs practically every Thursday night and there are angry drunk people occasionally that rip down door decorations. 
College Freshman,2,"In my dorm building, the bathrooms are not what i expected. The bathrooms are very small and the shower area is small and dirty after a couple of uses. hair clogs up the drains and the sinks have food in the drain and toothpaste on the side by the end of the day. We need more maintenance.
However, the double and triple rooms have enough space.
Wifi sometimes doesn't connect. "
College Freshman,2,"There recently was just a snow storm, pathways to get to places are icy. You must be very careful when walking."
College Freshman,2,"Any pizza shop I have ordered from have either taken so long to be delivered that it was cold or it was just so bad that I would throw it out. A lot of the time the food isn't worth the price. Best pizza by far has been dominos. They are always on time, their food is always good, and it is reasonably priced."
College Freshman,2,No one seems to care about what anyone does. I'm up all night because our floor is very loud and is usually drunk or high and causing a lot of disruptions.
College Junior,2,"We don't have a football team, the baseball team sucks, and you rarely hear about other sports on campus. I wish the school was more involved, because sports are a great way to bring a university together."
College Senior,2,"Average, some need updating and there network systems needs improvements.  Wireless is not that great"
College Senior,2,"There wireless is very spotty at best.  It's up and down.  The parking at Salem is non existent when there is no construction going on, but when there is construction forget it.  Unless you get there 1 - 2 hours before your first class you will not get a space even though they make you pay $50 for a parking sticker which doesn't guarantee you a spot."
College Sophomore,2,I am a commuter and a vegetarian so I try not to eat at school because there are not many options for me and the food is expensive too. If I eat one meal a day I run out of dinning dollars way before the semester ends.
College Sophomore,2,Not many options for vegetarian. Food quality is not very good either.
College Sophomore,2,"I am giving the computers at Salem State a solid C because we do have many different computers labs on each campus but you mostly all the time have to pay for printing and i think that we shouldn't because we pay to go to the school so it shouldn't matter. Also i mainly gave it this low score because the wireless connection is very poor half the time and has many issues. I think it is like this because there is only one server and if there were different servers for each campus (ex. North campus, central campus and south campus) each had their own the access will be quicker."
College Sophomore,2,well there are parties usually on thursdays. But thats about it. There isnt much parties here. everyone goes home on weekends. So it gets boring.
College Senior,2,"I personally had trouble getting any help from Salem State and had to do all the work on my own. I talked to a Financial Aid Advisor at school who told me I didn't qualify for any scholarships or grants only loans, but after I did some research on my own I found at least three or four scholarships through Salem State that I qualified for that I was not told about. I've stopped trying to get help from the school directly and now rely on the internet and my FAFSA for help. They may be better now it's been about two years since I've spoken to them."
Sophomore,1,"Worst school out there!! Don’t waste your money here. It’s cheap and there’s a reason for that. Food is trash, people are literal weirdos, professors don’t give a s*** about you as long as they got paid. There’s project housing between central and north, not the safest for girls... people out there drinking and being loud during warm months. I can see why this university is tanking and going under financially.  I’ve been to other state universities and it’s been my displease of being a student at this poor excuse for a joke university. People don’t look up to it even consider Salem a real school. As soon as next year hits I’m out..."
Senior,1,"Not a happy experience, I have been maintaining a 4.0 GPA since freshmen year, now I am a senior and I must acknowledge that students and professors here are treated poorly with little respects. Parking is the worst issue, which is unfortunately handled by the power-inflated  campus police. I have a student commuter parking sticker. They gave me a parking ticket for parking at the admission building, where I routinely visit to update my transcript and drop off paperwork. They denied my dispute without proper justifications, wrongfully accused me of parking in an unauthorized area even after the admission staff notified them that I was there to drop off academic paperwork. If you are vising an admission building, and the building says parking are for admission visors, why am I unauthorized to park there?"
Niche User,1,"Worst  decision I had ever made. People, food, dorms, academic buildings on north, and “parties”all were awful. Way to small not enough people to meet. During just my freshmen year there was no hot water in the freshmen dorms more then once and there were literal bug in the bathrooms. I have watched soo many people transfer after this year along with myself. Professors care but higher up people don’t care about students at all. Freshmen can’t have cars and then after this if you happen to get your car it costs an arm and a leg not to mention you usually have to park wicked far away on this note the campus is obviously in Salem which has a lot of attractions downtown but the options to get there are very slim."
Freshman,1,"Hated salem state, not my type of school.. boring on weekend and the campus wasn’t for me. Professors were really nice and classes weren’t to hard but i didn’t feel like i was at home when i was there so i decided to transfer"
Junior,1,"The worse decision I ever made was attending Salem state. I am a female, and I was physically abused by a guy on campus and the University did absolutely nothing about it, instead, they prevented me from certain parts of campus as if I was the aggressor, all while I had police files and restraining orders. I brought this issue up to the Dean and till this day I haven’t heard back from her. If you’re concerned about your safety, please, reconsider Salem State."
College Sophomore,1,"i hate the party scenes. do it off campus, but not on campus, where you can get caught and fined, and disturb your neighbors."
College Freshman,1,"My estimated financial need was about the same of the overall cost, I received way less than that. I am currently struggling to find a way to pay my tuition."
College Freshman,1,Chartwells aka Shartwells is the worst thing that will ever happen to you. You won't gain the freshman 15 at SSU because you won't be able to keep the food down.
College Freshman,1,Literally no one knows there is a Greek Life. It's like they don't exist.
Recent Alumnus,1,Their housing is the pits.  They did build 2 new dorms but the old ones are not fit to live in.
Recent Alumnus,1,Do not eat of campus as the food is terrible.
College Senior,1,"Salem State is VERY white with a female majority.  Those with different backgrounds are tolerated just fine, there just are not many different backgrounds to tolerate."
College Senior,1,"Within walking distance to North and Central campus there are very few options.  Fran and Dianes Kitchen is great, otherwise your options are McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and Bagel World.  The Salem Diner has reopened but is managed by the school."
College Freshman,1,"Because the school is largely a commuter school there isn't much to do at night, or at all on the weekends. I'm sure life is much more exciting if you have a car on campus, with Boston being close by. However, if you're stuck on campus as I was I suggest joining MANY clubs and activities to give yourself a social life. Greek life is one option I found that gives you access to parties and events that will fill your time."
College Freshman,1,"The school shuttle is terribly unreliable and completely unpredictable. As for the Public Shuttle, they tell you they will be there in fifteen minutes, and take an hour and a half to pick you up. The car usually smells of weed."
College Freshman,1,"If you want to party, look elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,The cops have the place locked down tight. Don't expect to do much.
College Freshman,1,"Campus is dead. It's a commuter school. If you are looking just to go to school, then that's it. You won't get a full college experience here. School events are a joke, and no one cares about sports. There's no pulse at Salem."
College Sophomore,1,"September and early October are absolutely beautiful with the New England Autumn foliage. After that though, be prepared for day after day of minimal sunlight all winter long."
College Sophomore,1,"good luck finding any spots after 9 am... the majority of the students at Salem are commuters, but for whatever reason, the school refuses to make any attempt to improve the horrendous parking situation."
College Junior,1,"Oh my god, Chartwells is nauseating. I get sick almost every time I eat at the dining hall. "
College Senior,1,"If you're a commuter, you're in for an interesting four years. Don't expect to find a spot at 9:30 if you have a 10AM class. Get to campus at 8. Permit decals have quintupled from $10 to $50 dollars; $75 if you're a resident. Freshman resident are not allowed to have cars. Bottom line is: too many cars, not enough spaces."
College Sophomore,1,Everywhere you walk people are smoking cigarettes.
College Sophomore,1,There is always an issue finding parking on campus and the campus police are quick to have cars towed.
College Junior,1,"Theres not much areas to park, and on top of that you have to pay 50$ for a parking sticker and then fight for a spot, hardley any street parking as well"
College Sophomore,1,"SSU is supposed to be a tobacco free campus. However there are still students and staff who smoke on campus in front of the campus police, who do nothing of the matter. Alcohol is in a dorms tucked away in drawers or even just left in the fridge, (including Bowditch and Peabody) as well as weed. Drug dealers sell everyday and the dorm hallways and elevators often smell like weed."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely nothing that sets this school apart from the fact that it's in Salem, Massachusetts."
College Freshman,1,This school is very strict. It's a dry campus and they crack down hard on any violators of this. The campus police can always be reached in quick amount of time. If you want to have any guest into your dorm buildings they must check in and give a valid photo ID to be kept until checkout.
College Sophomore,1,"PArking at SSU is horrible.  The majority of students are commuters and they have the least amount of commuting parking spaces.  Even if you live on campus with your car, its worthless.  Make sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before class so you can maybe find a space."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms at SSU are not great at all.  They are very dirty, untidy, and not taken care of.  Residence Life tries their very hardest to maintain them and place responsible people in them, but when I lived there, I found the opposite to be true."
College Freshman,1,There are 2 frats and 1 sorority. Both of these are expensive to join. The parties are good I hear. But the cops watch the greek houses like crazy. They drive by there on a regular basis.
College Sophomore,1,The only way to find parking is to get here really early.
College Sophomore,1,"If you're Caucasian and aren't a sports star or have a perfect GPA, it is very difficult to receive financial aid."
College Junior,1,"Lots of Fast Food – I prefer eating healthy, and upon my first year at Salem State, I only discovered fast food restaurants nearby. After 1 semester, I began packing dinner in the morning to bring with me from work to class."
College Sophomore,1,"They Freak Out Over Everything – The RA's are very strict with the guest policy in dorm buildings. When you have a guest signed in, you cannot be more than 10 feet away from them. You have to stand outside the bathroom and wait for them to go, even if they get up to use the bathroom at 4 am. You are allowed 2 guests at a time but they have to be with you at all times. If you take a shower, they have to wait outside the bathroom for you. With alcohol, it all depends on the person who catches you. The campus is also drug and alcohol free, but the ground is littered with cigarettes. No one smokes inside too often, but they do around campus."
College Sophomore,1,Punishments Are Way to Harsh – You will get kicked out if you sneeze the wrong way
College Sophomore,1,You need to pay to use the computers...enough said
College Sophomore,1,"Park at Your Own Risk!!! Terrible Parking, Never any spots, Campus Police tows constantly, just another headache!"
College Freshman,1,"The Greek Life is almost non-existant because it was just started this year there for there is only one sorority at the school so far. Because they are just starting out they are not well know, for their parties or anything."
College Student,1,"Salem Sucks – I hate my experience.
I've had terrible teachers, very few actually care about your class, or your grades, or you. 
Many spend the whole class going over homework and you learn nothing.
It's an awful place to be.
There are some nice students, but most commute so there is very little interaction."

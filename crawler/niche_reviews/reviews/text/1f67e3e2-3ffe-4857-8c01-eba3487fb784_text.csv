Alum,5,UA is a great university. I loved the majority of my teachers and classes. I attended both big lecture hall classes and small classes of 5-10 students. I liked that most of my freshman entry level courses were larger while my more specialized courses my senior year were smaller in size. Also I loved the variety in language courses. UA has a great atmosphere that encourages student involvement in all aspects.
Niche User,5,"Alabama was a unique experience, with welcoming students and more than enough people to make you feel at home."
Senior,5,"This school is truly like any other. You won't find more school spirit anywhere. The football and the party scene is great, but so are the academics. There are so many majors to choose from, and you will find great faculty in any one of them. Coming from Arizona to Alabama was scary, and even a bit of a culture shock, but I quickly grew to call this place my second home. Everyone is from all over the country, so you will meet more than just Southern people."
Senior,5,"I love the capstone college of nursing here at UA. From day one, when I began taking pre-requisites, they encouraged me, continually motivated me, and were right along side me cheering me on. Even now that I am in the upper division nursing program, all of professors have a genuine care in their heart for me to succeed. My clinical instructors are eager to teach me and find different learning opportunities for me within each hospital setting. Aside from our incredible leaders, my cohort is incredibly understand and motivating as well. We all push each other, reassure one another after a tough exam, and remind our peers of important due dates. We all want to see one another exceed and reach their full potential. UA is such a large school with incredible communities that make you feel right at home."
Senior,5,"Given our circumstances, I really feel as though my professors have gone above and beyond in providing us with the proper materials to ensure we are understanding and learning all of the material."
Alum,5,"I was a full time student and didn't take online courses.   But, I know people who did and had outstanding experiences."
Alum,5,"This University will stay in my heart forever.  So many wonderful growing experiences.  Also, the University of Alabama carries so much clout a job search.  I was so fortunate to have the opportunity to graduate from UA.  I'm glad I took advantage of it."
Senior,5,"They don't treat you like another tuition check or just a number, the faculty, staff and student government know you by name. Even in large classes professors remember you and keep in touch while you're a student here."
Niche User,5,"Great campus, very pretty, people were very nice during my visit. The dorms are really great, everything is easy to get to"
Niche User,5,I've taken two online courses through the early college and it has been an easy and smooth process. The professors are very informative and respod quickly to questions.
Freshman,5,"I love this college. Would recommend for others to attend! The staff is very involved and friendly. I've had no problems. The response for COVID was satisfactory, there are also steps implemented against the virus. The campus itself is very beautiful and well kept. The setup for classes are compliance with social distancing and helps to make us students feel better. Most of my classes are online or have the option. I really appreciate that notion."
Freshman,5,So far so good. We are beginning to go back and from what I've experienced there have been no problems.
Senior,5,I have had an exceptional time at Alabama. It has exceeded my expectations. The level of education I have received has given me the foundational knowledge I need to purse my career area.
Junior,5,"The University of Alabama is a great place to go to school. As an out of state student, it was very easy for me to make friends and fit in with all the opportunities they offered. There is something always going on at the University of Alabama so there is always something to do."
Junior,5,I am currently taking classes online at the University of Alabama. Online classes are great and the professors give you as much opportunity as the professors on campus. They give you all the opportunity and information you need to pass exams and succeed.
Junior,5,"I experienced many things, from meeting new people to learning different things. With such great diversity at the campus, this allowed me to meet people from all over the world. Being on campus is the place to be."
Sophomore,5,The professors at the University of Alabama made sure that our online learning experience was the easiest transition it could be. Every one of my instructors was able to send out an updated syllabus letting us know exactly what woud be taking place and how cirriculum would change.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere and the way the whole campus really comes together. Everyone you meet on campus is so friendly. There are also so many resources for Freshman students who may not know exactly where to go or what to do! I remeber feeling very overwhelmed this year and I automatically found a answer to all of my question just through my advisor!
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any online classes yet, but my friends and boyfriend has and they loved it. All of the professors that they have had has given them more than enough information and have been very king and quick when answering any questions they have had."
Freshman,5,The University of Alabama is an amazing school! The atmosphere in Tuscaloosa makes you feel at home right away. There is always something to do at Alabama whether it's attend a football game(roll tide) or go to a basketball game. You will immediately feel right at home going to The University of Alabama!
Sophomore,5,"So far I've had a great experience. The University is filled with opportunities. The coursework is challenging; it does not matter the major. I am in the engineering department and from the first year alone, I can tell that the coursework will be very thorough and well informing! Also, I am in the STEM Path to the MBA program and not many universities have this option!"
Sophomore,5,"Despite me personally not taking to online learning in general, my online experience with the university was great. The professor held up their job and I help up my duties as a student."
Junior,5,The University of Alabama's Capstone College of Nursing has provided me with exceptional opportunities to learn and grow.
Junior,5,All the professors that I have had for classes and been in contact with have always done everything they can to help me move forward in my education.
Junior,5,I feel that most of the online courses that I have taken have been held to the same standard of education that I experience on campus.
Sophomore,5,My professors were very nice and understanding. I'm a music major and all of the moody staff are very good.
Freshman,5,I loved my trip I took to the university and I am looking forward to attending in the fall. the programs offered here are amazing and I know it will suit me well.
Freshman,5,I did not take any classes online but I'm sure if I did they would be fluid and help me in the same way that a regular class would
Senior,5,I love the campus and the feeling of being on campus during a game day weekend. The teachers are out to help you succeed in their classes and will do what they can to help.
Sophomore,5,"My experience was great as a freshman. Everyone that worked at the campus truly wants to help you succeed, help you in any problem and are very resourceful."
Niche User,5,I took English 101 and Art History online and they were great with flexibility. My professors were great with work that is helpful. One thing that was really interesting was we got to interact with your classmates even though you are online.
Niche User,5,I am currently doing The University Of Alabama early college program. I highly suggest this because it helps me prepare for college and behead in my college career. The professors are amazing.
Junior,5,"Online experience was very good one. For all the classes I have taken online, there has always been good communication between the professors and students. There is also an open line of communication there."
Junior,5,"The best experience I could ever have with college. The professors and classes are amazing, they are so willing to communicate and help you. It is an overall fun place to be, there are many things to do. Also, everyone there is so welcoming. I am so blessed to go to University of Alabama."
Freshman,5,I didn't really have any classes online. But when I did work online through UA it was very easy. The interface was good too.
Freshman,5,I loved how nice everything was at Alabama. Everything was always cleaned and cared for. The food and dorms exceeded my expectations.
Senior,5,"Alabama is the quintessential college experience with the added charm of being located in the South. But with people from all walks of life in attendance, you'd be sure to find your niche."
Alum,5,I enrolled in a few online classes. Each class required daily work but mostly there were discussions that would help you if you needed extra help. The professors provided their contact information and were easily accessible.
Alum,5,I had a great experience. I majored in Social Work where our classroom sizes were small enough to really get to know each other and the professors. It was very hands on and everyone was willing to help.
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience specifically due to COVID-19 was amazing. My professors were very good at communicating with us and transitioning to online based classes in such short notice. The workload was a bit lighter than in person class which was great!

Graduate Student,5,It was great I actually loved online they adjusted perfectly. The teachers and students were very understanding and helpful.
Junior,5,"I have been thoroughly pleased by my experience so far at The University of Alabama. The campus is beautiful, the student organizations are numerous and varied, and I have had some of the kindest, most helpful professors (specifically in the Spanish department). Although I will admit that their Computer Science classes leave a lot to be desired, and I have not had the best experiences with advisors, I am still content with my decision to study Mathematics at this university."
Sophomore,5,"Not bad! Professors were willing and eager to help as needed! Only a few classes on zoom, and a lot of the work was given to the student right away."
Freshman,5,My online learning experience was very well-organized and easy to understand. My professors kept in contact very well and always provided us with extra help whenever necessary. They were very understanding.
Alum,5,"I liked the commitment to student success from University programs and professors.  The campus was always well kept and organized.  Game days were hectic but that's part of the fun.  Overall wonderful experience, I couldn't imagine graduating from any other university!"
Sophomore,5,"When I started back in the Fall, 2019 semester, I loved it! Every class, every person I met, and I especially love the brothers I have in my fraternity. From campus life to night life, nothing compares to how amazing the University of Alabama is."
Sophomore,5,"Once Covid-19 hit, my friends and I had no idea how the transition would be, but as soon as we got back home, our professors immediately got to work on how to transition to online, at first there were hiccups, but it was very easy to make the switch thanks to our professors!"
Freshman,5,"The University of Alabama is an amazing school. The environment is overall nice and safe. Everyone there is so friendly and welcoming. When it comes to the professors they care about you so they do everything they can to make sure that you are okay and you succeed. You will have the time of your life going to this school, but also at the same time succeeding and getting closer to your future."
Freshman,5,"I kind of had an online class which was in math, but we were still required to physically be in the class rooms, all of the assignments and test was just online. I would say that it was a really good class though. There was reasonable deadlines. The professor was always there to help in or outside of the classroom. On the website there was a button that said ask your teacher and it would send them a message that you needed help, o it was access yo your professor basically  24/7."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Alabama has offered countless amounts of easy to access resources during the online transition. Not just extra resources from professors, but also University-wide study sessions, tutoring access, and a multitude of opportunities to reach out for assistance and ways of coping and adapting to the new pandemic."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Alabama is a college like no other. With an outstanding environment of school spirit, top notch educational opportunities, community service, clubs, and, of course, athletics. Alabama is a college with a majority of students coming from out of state. No matter what you home state is, the University of Alabama will always make you feel at home."
Junior,5,I have had an amazing experience at UA.  I enjoy my professors and the assistance is fast and efficient.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love going tp UA. I love the campus, learning environment, and of course Alabama football. Roll Tide!!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Alabama is more than just a school, it is a home for thousands of students. Academics are very important which is why there are always tutors available and the professors are more than willing to meet with you whenever it is convenient to your schedule. Other than academics, the campus is very safe. Everyone looks out for each other and the UAPD are always patrolling. I have felt safe, included, and beyond satisfied with my time so far at the university."
Senior,5,I had the most amazing 4 years at Alabama. I felt like I really got a lot out of my education and it opened up doors for me while I still had a lot of fun.
Sophomore,5,"The university offers so much outside of academics, The opportunity to participate in sports whether varsity or intramural is always encouraged"
Sophomore,5,Love everything about this school! The academics are really good along with the social scene.  When you attend Alabama you enter into a family. I truly love the spirit the campus provides not to mention the awesome football! Roll tide forever.
Graduate Student,5,The University of Alabama is unlike any other university. The school truly values their students and is willing to actively make changes to better the school (while you are still there). The school has devoted a lot of time and effort into developing STEM on campus.
Senior,5,"The experience at The University of Alabama is really amazing!!! With the rich tradition and very diverse atmosphere, there is no other place to be but Bama! The organization and determination of the faculty and staff is really amazing. Alabama continues to grow and improve every year, with that being said, there are no changes to be made."
Senior,4,"When everyone switched to online classes due to the pandemic, everything was a bit chaotic. However, I do feel that UA had a better plan in place than most schools. They handled the transition very well and were great about reaching out to students who may need help."
Senior,4,"For the most part online has been smooth sailing with all the professors being kind in the face of this uncertainty, not 5 stars though because of the few hold outs who have made online learning nearly impossible."
Freshman,4,"Alabama is a nice place to go. I’d like to see a little more diversity, but overall it is amazing. The academics are definitely worth it."
Senior,4,Online learning provides a different atmosphere of confidence and engagement for a student like myself. I can work ahead on my own time and study whenever time permits. It's also very important to have great internet connection because at times ZOOM meetings or BB Ultra meetings will be lagging. It's exciting and new and I am very thankful for such an opportunity.
Senior,4,A great institution for learning and limitless opportunities. If you plan to attend as out-of-state then I recommend getting involved early with something on campus. The environment is certainly one of groups and collaboration and is difficult to find one's footing going at it alone...trust me. Within your study focus numerous advisors and peer mentors are available  to help ensure future success. Have an open mind and make sure you stick to your morals and values.
Senior,4,I have just started the online learning platform and it has been fair.  I wish Alabama had adopted a more synchronous learning platform that allows for more engagement.
Junior,4,I'm currently taking online classes now. online classes are pretty easy simple. You are given assignments and have a certain deadline to finish them by. Instructors give you every material needed for you to be able to past exams.
Junior,4,Classes online at UA are incredible. Professors are very helpful and keep students up to date on deadlines.
Junior,4,"The University of Alabama is a diverse and excellent Public University. Student life is what draws people from all over the world. More students are out of state than in-state. COVID forced classes online, and all of the professors handled it with ease. I'm so grateful I get to attend!"
Junior,4,There’s a lot of involvement opportunities. Greek life is extremely big here as well as sports. You see someone you know everywhere you go.
Senior,4,"UA offers a wide range of opportunities for its students, especially in academics. The University of Alabama strives to make everyone feel welcomed and accommodates any needs we as students have."
Senior,4,Teachers have been very helpful in accommodating our needs during COVID-19 and helping us transition to online-learning.
Junior,4,My professors went above and beyond to help the transition from face to face classes to online. They were also always accessible.Th
Junior,4,"UA is an overall good school. The campus itself is safe, but the safety outside of campus could be better."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID, my nursing school classes were moved online for the summer.  It was not ideal, but my professors did a wonderful job of accommodating on such a short notice."
Alum,4,I didn’t have to take online classes very much but the University was very open minded and adaptable to everyone’s situation and made it it a smooth and easy transition for their students .
Alum,4,"My experience was definitely one of the books! I met so many people , networked so well with my classmates and professors and it really helped me prepare myself personally and professionally for the real life business world !"
Sophomore,4,"The parties are fun but if you're black, make sure you have tough skin. There are going to be a lot of people that try your patience but hang in there. UA is a great school with amazing opportunities and many organizations that you can get into."
Senior,4,"Online classes are fairly easy, the teacher provides their email and will answer questions usually within a day or 2 of you emailing them. They try to help in any way they can and will often provide office hours for you to go to if needed."
Junior,4,The university of Alabama has a very nice and inviting campus for all races. It included many endless opportunities of participation and leadership. The professors can be more helpful because they are very research oriented instead of student help.

Freshman,4,"I love the welcoming, inclusive culture at Alabama. Everyone is kind, driven, and happy to be on campus. The professors are very accessible and they really care about their students. The campus is beautiful and very well-kept and easy to navigate. The surrounding town provides lots to do and eat. The people there are incredible! Everyone is very involved and passionate about their on campus activities."
Alum,4,The courses I took online had valuable online lectures and resources and the professors easy to get in contact with.  The course expectations were always clearly laid out and visible on blackboard.
Senior,4,"I would love to see the proctor setup change. The company they use not only costs anywhere between $10 to $20 per test out of pocket but they are a hassle.  They should definitely run this and use something else,  especially something that fits not charge so much. For me taking 4 online classes, that's atleast 3 test per class, about $120 dollars extra to worry about."
Senior,4,"Online learning is great at UA. If they thought through the proctor testing a little more it would be great.  Get rid of the high prices per exam and teach the proctors some manners and etiquette, it would be 5 stars."
Freshman,4,It’s a great school. I gave it a 4/5 because of some basic things. The dining hall food isn’t the best and the internet is shaky half the time. If they fixed those two things then I’d definitely give it 5/5
Graduate Student,4,The University of Alabama has an unmatched atmosphere that is built on success. The professors are unmatched and are always willing to help when it comes to things in school and in life.
Sophomore,4,The University of Alabama is a great university to experience while jump starting your career and challenging you academically.
Freshman,4,Overall I have had an amazing experience attending UA! I would like to see more black incorporated events around campus.
Niche User,4,From what I've read about UofA it seems like a great school! Some cons might be the lack of diversity and some older dorms.
Niche User,4,"So far from what I have read it seems to be a very good school! The only downfall seems to be the lack of diversity and the older dorm ""tut"""
Freshman,4,"The experience has been great. This school will challenge you, but I wouldn't trade this experience for anything."
Niche User,4,"I love The University of Alabama, but there are a few minor inconveniences. The Tutwiler Housing is one of them. I understand that freshman dorms may not be the best, but this hall is past due on a renovation. The air conditioning is all sorts of messed up and showering in a stall is not something anyone wants to do."
Niche User,4,"I took online courses through the University of Alabama, and my experience was great. The professors and other staff were great!"
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of this university is very welcoming and calming. One thing I would like to see changed is the teaching methods of majority of the professors residing here.
Sophomore,4,"Love my classes and the campus , would like to see more diversity both the n the students and instructors"
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior at The University of Alabama.  My experience has been a mainly positive one. It is such a large school with a large Greek Life scene, so not being involved in that was slightly scary. It is harder to make friends when everyone is involved in a sorority or fraternity. However, after my freshman year, I found that the university has tons of resources to get involved."
Niche User,4,"very nice campus and so many benefits for students to take advantage of.  I love all of the programs, i just wish there was a larger basis for my desired career major."
Freshman,4,"Thus far, I have only had good experiences with all my professors. The college offers a plethora of clubs and opportunities so it is easy to find something you enjoy and become involved. I live in one of the newer dorms so I don't have any issues there, but I do know people who live in older dorms and experience may issues. The dining hall food isn't bad for dining hall food. I typically feel pretty safe all around campus, and have had an overall good experience. However, I do think there is room for improvement in every department."
Junior,4,I enjoy the campus.  At first its very over whelming because of the size of the campus. But you quickly find your way around.  The classes can be a bit large and it takes a little to get adjusted.  Fit in and get involved so you feel at home.
Senior,4,"The University of Alabama is a good college in terms of the various courses and specialties that it offers. The study abroad program is also fantastic. Campus culture is very southern and Greek-life oriented, but you can find clubs that match your interests. Not much to do in the local area"
Niche User,4,I love the University of Alabama's campus! The people their are so friendly and helpful and they have so many different programs to offer.
Senior,4,"I'm a transfer student here at The University of Alabama, and so far my overall experience has been great! The campus is friendly, upbeat and positive. The professors are willing to go the extra mile to ensure that you succeed in your courses and thats always a plus."
Senior,4,"I like the University of Alabama because of the atmosphere of student success and involvement. There are many clubs and organizations on campus that fit just about any and everybody. Even if you don't find a club that fits you, which is rare, they provide you with the opportunity and resources to start your own club. UA wants you to excel both academically and socially which allows you to be a well rounded graduate and hot commodity when looking into post graduate plans."
Freshman,4,"The University of Alabama is a very good school. Most of the professors are kind and helpful. The campus is beautiful and the food in the dining halls are good. There is not much to do in Tuscaloosa, the school is the main attraction but at least Birmingham is only an hour away."
Sophomore,4,My freshman year was pretty good here.  The school has many programs that focus on incoming freshmen and their transition from high school to college. There are students that you can talk to when you're having a tough time with your transition. Sorority life isn't as big as it seems when you get here. There are hundreds of clubs you will be able to join. They have Get On Board Day which is dedicated to finding clubs that you feel will help you fit in. The University Programs also host many events where you can meet new people. The events are usually fun and there's free food which is a plus.
Freshman,4,"I haven't started classes yet for my freshman year, but from orientation and my other visits to Alabama i know it is a great school and i'm sure to have a blast when i'm not studying hard."
Alum,4,"The University of Alabama is a beautiful school that promotes a well-rounded student. The school has great academic resources as well as student-life resources. The school offers a wide range of courses to take and has many great teachers who care about their students. The athletic programs are fantastic and sports is a huge part of campus life. The campus buildings and facilities are very nice and well-kept. The grounds crew keeps campus looking beautiful year-round. Physical activity and a healthy lifestyle are all heavily promoted on campus as well through the campus recreation centers, sports, cooking classes, health center and more, which is a huge positive."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite things about UA are the beautiful campus, the community, professors, academics, and athletics. The university could improve in campus food quality and options for those on specific diets (especially Lakeside), and the quality of the dorms varies greatly."
Junior,4,"Small classes and passionate professors make for a very beneficial learning environment. Greek life is a prominent character on campus but does not interfere with those who want nothing to do with it. There are multitudes of programs and societies on campus geared towards helping those that are struggling or who are alone at college. Home games can get a little hectic, especially if you live on campus, but otherwise it is a very peaceful, safe, campus where there is always something to do or places where you can be alone with your thoughts."
Freshman,4,"The University of Alabama has the nicest dorms I've ever seen. Almost all the dorms are suite style so each roomate gets their own room, there's a living room, kitchen, and a bathroom you share with one other person including a shower."
Senior,4,"As a transfer student from a smaller college, I found that UA challenged me academically and socially. In so doing, I’ve become a go getter, and I feel much more prepared to take on every day challenges in the work world. 

For its size and world renown popularity, UA immediately felt like home when I first  toured the campus. As I’ve progressed through my second year now, its only grown on me like a new family. The professors, teaching assistants, and advisors are all very warm, friendly, personable, and helpful.

Tuscaloosa could use more things to do, but honestly it’s just fine with the many hiking locations, places to swim, and loads of benefits you get as a student on campus."
Senior,4,"So far, my experience at the University of Alabama has been wonderful with a few uh-ohs thrown in the mix. The advising can definitely be better for students and the money could be used better towards something other than sports but other than that my experience has been great."
Junior,4,"There is not much I would change about the school. It is an amazing school in general, student life, athletics, acamenics all of that is amazing. everything about UA is great. Roll Tide!"
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with The University of Alabama (UA), during my visit of the school. I'm very excited that I received my official Letter of Acceptance and early admission into The UA, as this was my first school of choice. I believe that The UA will help me to continue to develop into a successful student and future Medical Social Worker. I plan to double major in both Public Health and Social Work. The UA will provide the college experience to transform me into a wise and mature adult. This experience will help me explore the world of ideas."
Junior,4,"So far it has been amazing, the staff has been wonderful to work with when it comes to financial aid and assistance.  Being a non-traditional student that is taking distance education courses, the phone conversations and the help they provide makes everything easier to focus on studying."
Sophomore,4,"I would never change the school I decided to attend for the world. Because of UA I have made amazing connections, because of UA I have met amazing, irreplaceable friends, and because of UA I have been given the boost I need to flourish both personal and academically. I know it is hard to pick a college and to take that big first step into adulthood, but if you do it somewhere where they refuse to let you fall and uplift you in all your endeavors, just know you will never fail. The connections and community within the University of Alabama is as welcoming as you let it, but once you welcome the university, it welcomes you back. I know this sounds sappy and unbelievable but college life is something you have to experience for yourself. It maybe scary, and it maybe hard but just know it is worth it. I love the University of Alabama and I don't regret a minute I have spent there or a cent that I paid to be there."
Junior,4,"College town with a tremendous school spirit.  I have never been in a place where alumni and students were so involved in all aspects of campus life.  The University of Alabama has the largest Greek system and since athletics is so successful our fan section is always a blast.  Something I would like to change is the diversity of food and people, but I see that changing in the near future. In this year alone there have been many new resturants and activities available for students.  Also, since Greek life and athletics is huge here there are a lot of parties and university events for students to partake in.  One of my favorite things to do is go to the lake with some friends and spend the day swimming and eating some great food in the sun."
Freshman,4,"I am a computer science major but unfortunately, the computer science department/professors are not the best and don't focus on their students."
Junior,4,"The University of Alabama is a well-built and well-run institution rooted in academic excellence (and yes, football). My time at the university has been great, and I am impressed with the level of engagements offered and even the course rigor. There is room to have fun and enjoy college and to also find courses that are interesting and challenging."
Alum,2,It was more of a teach yourself experience and the professors weren’t easy to get in contact with when assistance was needed.
Freshman,2,"Horrible decision to go to school here. Was sold a bill of goods by aggressive recruiters at my HS. Once you get down here, you realize you are surrounded by a bunch of morons who are probably racist and completely out of touch with reality. Their goal seems to be brainwashing all of the out of state students into being typical Alabama football fans complete with the mid-60's style and attitude. 

The football team is why most are here, and that is all they care about. They sincerely believes it gives them stature outside of what they have actually accomplished. The football team has also given UA a national brand that gives B/C students a chance to get into a school that isn't a directional nor a community college. 

I'lll be transferring after this semester."
Freshman,2,"Transferring from here. 

The school and students are big on image and cover a lot of things up. Most kids here all look alike and almost act robotically as if they've been brainwashed. A strange place and kind of disturbing as they think this is a ""prestigious"" school despite being very average school. 

The school recruits heavily nation wide and basically gets the remains of kids who couldn't get into their 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc, choices and are all set to go to the local directional school or commuter school. They also pay money to kids who get decent test scores and want to go to school as cheaply as possible. I bought it for a while as the price tag was almost unbelievable, but am now transferring closer to home for a variety of reasons.

Be careful."
Freshman,2,"They recruited me heavily from another part of the country and I am questioning my decision. I didn't get into my school of choice and a couple of others. It was either go to a commuter school near home or a state school with average academics in my state. UA offered me some scholarship money (surprisingly) and I had seen their football team on TV and got carried away with the idea of going to a school with something to be proud of. 

I visited and really liked the campus, which is pretty nice. There are a lot of out of state students here and many of them were recruited and got money like myself. The in state students are a different breed. I had always heard about Alabama and how backwards it is here, and the in state kids do not disappoint. We kind of stay away from them whenever possible. 

I really doubt the admissions score on here. 53% yet the graphic shows almost total acceptance regardless of GPA or test score."
Freshman,2,"Out of state parents: STOP sending your well eduated high school kids and your money to this school. The student body is mixed with 50% normal AL kids, who are not that well educated and the other half are out of state kids providing higher test and gpa stats and make up the shortfall of monies the university lost from state funding. The faculty and deans are super nice and well organized but you wont find diversity or intellect from AL kids here. This is not a rigorous academic school or southern experience because its over run with rude east coast kids. Sad that it also caters to the athletes on full rides who take customized remedial summer classes and eat at a $15m steakhouse smoothie bar dining hall. Students eat disgusting food not worth the meal plan.  Also nick saban will penalize students for leaving the football games early. Not an institute of higher learning but a prep school for the nfl. Im transferring. Save your money and send your kid elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,"The campus feels like a continuation of High School. Diversity is frowned upon. Everyone dresses the same like a cult, the notion that the south is kind and friendly is a farce. Try introducing yourself to a fellow student in class and they recoil or have such poor networking skills that they act as if they are unsure of how the real world works.  Yes, I  came for a degree but between my fraternity, clubs, honors dorm and my on campus job, I feel that my experience is well rounded enough to say this school is the least mature, sophisticated large University in the South."
Freshman,2,The University of Alabama is a typical SEC school. Every week revolves around the football game. It is hard to find incredibly motivated academic people.
Freshman,2,"As an introvert, I don't really like the University of Alabama. Because I live 800 miles away from UA, it makes it hard for me to get back home, and it's hard to go shopping for amenities without a car. If you're a freshman and you can't drive, you're pretty much screwed on game days, because dining halls close early and nothing on campus is open. If you're not into Greek life, Alabama is not for you, as the presence of fraternities and sororities looms over the university."
College Junior,2,The housing was not worth the money I paid for it.
College Junior,2,If you're a non Greek then your social life is kinda boring.
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of the Greek life. I am glad I didn't join just because it seems like the huge amounts of money spent to be part of Greek life is not even close to worth it. I think Greeks get special treatment here and they earn more respect socially just because they are Greek.
College Freshman,2,"Sooooooo difficult, depending upon your major also. But still not very easy! Workload could be heavy depending on class and professor. The registration process can become frustrating because it is first come first serve. Classes fill up pretty fast."
College Freshman,2,"I came here from California because I got a full tuition scholarship and it made sense.  I wish I had gone somewhere I wanted to go instead of what made sense financially and academically.  Surely there was a middle ground.  I am transferring now.  Don't make the mistake I did, go somewhere you actually want to be."
College Freshman,2,"The food is my least favorite thing about Bama. The dining hall food is very low quality and unhealthy. For example, there was always the standard, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and salad, but never any whole grain options. The salad vegetables weren't fresh and the cheese they use on the sandwich is the gross, processed kind that doesn't even taste like real cheese. They made the nutritional information available, and most of the food items are loaded with sodium and added sugar, even the healthier dishes like pasta and asian dishes. My freshman year I got tired of feeling lousy from eating the food so I often bought my own, but this also made me angry since I had been forced to buy a meal plan I wasn't using. I will never purchase a meal plan again."
College Sophomore,2,Annoying. Never are clear about what you need. You get a decent amount if you're out of state but nothing amazing.
College Freshman,2,"the only places that are open after 2am is quick grill, waffle house, McDonald's and taco bell"
College Junior,2,Campus is strict for some things and not for others. Most strict policies regard underage dorm drinking and protests/demonstrations.
College Junior,2,"It depends on who you are and where you're trying to party. If you're a person of color, particularly black, don't expect to waltz into any fraternity parties as they won't let you in."
College Junior,2,"I recieved a 29 ACT and a 3.47 GPA according to a different GPA scale but still wasn't awarded a scholarship. This is because the University refused to convert my grades to the same GPA scale as other schools in Alabama. After doing the math, my ""alabama gpa"" wouldve been a 3.82. This would have given me a HUGE scholarship but instead I was awarded nothing for my hard work. Very disappointed in how they treat this issue. Big problem for students coming from out of state."
College Freshman,2,The food at lakeside is trash and gets really old. Fresh foods has terrible hours and Burke is a solid 15 minute walk away.
College Freshman,2,"I went through sorority rush and liked it. Most hate it. It is a grueling week of scorching heat, dresses, fake smiles, feet that feel like they'll never walk again, and bid day which is very fun. But the system is flawed, the chapters are so big that it's impossible to have a real sisterhood, and"
College Freshman,2,"I do not personally have a car on campus, but I know a lot of people really struggle with what a pain parking is."
College Freshman,2,This school gave me no scholarships or financial aid.
College Student,2,Campus police huge pain in ass. Still baby us
College Freshman,2,"Students are not allowed candles, pets, or illegal substances in the dorms. Random checks are done periodically, but it just depends on the RA as to if you get in trouble or not. UAPD seems to be more concerned with keeping intoxicated people safe rather than arresting them, which I appreciate. Other than that, students are pretty much allowed to make their own decisions as long as they aren't harming anyone else. At least in my dorm, visitation policies are nonexistent. The only thing that's really strict is parking. Don't park without a tag or in a wrong zone, they'll ticket the snot out of you."
College Freshman,2,They gave me what i need but there was a lot of trouble with the financial aid office.
College Freshman,2,"Realistically speaking, this was the worst part of the process. They were not too generous with financial aid for an out-of-state student with relatively decent grades (3.4 HS average). I was not a high honor roll student however I worked hard for the grades and did not feel compensated in the end for being in honor roll."
College Freshman,2,The quality of professors at UA that I have had so far are a mix between inexperienced grad students and busy research professors.
College Senior,2,Even after the headache of finally getting it applied to school you still do not recieve enough money to pay for classes and books and then if they do not offer the classes online and you do not live on campus and want to take them elsewhere closer to home the financial aid office absouletely does not work with you! it is absouletely the worse!!!!
College Senior,2,If you have to live in an older dorm its terrible they are old and nasty and very small. If you are lucky and get the newer ones you are set for life!
College Freshman,2,"The bars on the strip and in downtown are nice, but other than that, there's really nothing at all."
College Freshman,2,"If you have the GPA and SAT scores, you can get aid right away. I had SAT scores that were just short of their standards for scholarship. As for financial aid- if you are middle class and out of state like me, I wish you luck. I sure haven't gotten any."
College Freshman,2,"The guys dress really weird. I thought they would be well dressed and preppy but they wear 90's jeans and ugly sneakers. Also, the ""frat daddies"" can be really pretentious. I don't see many guys on this campus who I could even consider dating. There are attractive people, but their personalities can be a quick turnoff."
College Freshman,2,"One of the issues of going to a conservative school is that many people ignore the prevalence of rape/sexual assault, treat it as a joke, 'crucify' the victim, etc. Although the school's official policy is fantastic, it never follows through. Already, at least three girls have reported some form of assault, and the UAPD has pressured them to retract their report."
Recent Alumnus,2,"UA is not that diverse and the acceptance of differences (be that sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, religion, race) is not anywhere it needs to be on this campus. Students who are considered outside the ""norm"" are not treated equally by fellow students and in some departments, but certainly not all.  If you're a queer student, practice a religion other than Christianity, or are not Greek, UA can be a challenge. HOWEVER, there are several progressive groups and people on campus committed to bringing about a positive social change on campus. So, it's getting better, but way to slowly."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The University of Alabama refuses to add gender identity/expression to their non-discrimination policies. Several documented instances of student harassment due to their gender are well-known to administrators, but they refuse to add this simple protection to their policies. UA is the flagship university. Other universities have already included protection for all their students and staff. Wish UA would do the same."
College Sophomore,2,"It seems that everyone besides me basically got a scholarship handed to them. I have been trying so hard for well over a year, and I have received nothing."
College Junior,2,not very diverse. lots of segregation
College Sophomore,2,I had grants from my home state that could not be transferred to alabama which was extremely frustrating.
College Junior,2,It gets pretty hot in the spring and fall. Storms and tornadoes can be an issue. So can ice for a few days in the winter.
College Junior,2,"There is still quite a bit of segregation in the state of Alabama. There has recently been some breakthrough in the Greek system which we are proud of, but it is difficult to break such an old trend."
College Sophomore,2,I wish they had cameras in the riverside dorms.
College Junior,2,"Greek life at our university is not equal, there are certain groups who receive more than others."
College Junior,2,Their money runs the school. The infamous machine controls the university and surrounding community
College Freshman,2,YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN
College Freshman,2,"Two words, Tornado season. If you arent from alabama and used to it, it can be quite scary."
College Freshman,2,"We have a race problem.  The majority of the campus tends to be white, Christian conservatives."
College Freshman,2,Greeks seem to run the campus.
College Junior,2,"It's not really diverse, I feel like everyone stays together. There's also racial issues on campus"
College Student,2,parking strictness is beyond belief. I truly believe they school uses parking violations as a revenue builder. it is sometimes completely impossible to park legally.
College Freshman,2,I don't care for it
College Freshman,2,Dorms suck and are so overpriced. But you are forced to live in them
College Freshman,2,If you like to be a drunk slob at a frat house every weekend you will LOVE it here
College Freshman,2,Its a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. What can you expect?
College Freshman,2,The girls are mostly snobby and full of cliques. Don't plan on making friends with them. The guys are much more 'open' to new friends. Everyone seams to be from the same tiny town in rural AL.
College Freshman,2,"The wifi is horrible, which is bad when there is a midnight deadline. It frequently goes out."
College Freshman,2,I really like cold weather and hate hot weather. The fall semester was way too hot. Winter didn't come until January and is gone by March.
College Freshman,2,I've only been to the SHC once and I had to wait way too long before I could see someone.
College Student,2,Everyone usually hangs out with their own race and ethnic background. Most everyone is Republican but there are clubs for those who are Democrats. Most everyone is Christian or atheist. If you are a minority you might have to look a little harder to find people who accept you.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a member of Greek Life so I'm just speaking from the outside looking in. What I see in the Greek System is a lot of separation. There is very little racial integration in either the Caucasian greek organizations or the African American Greek organizations. And in both instances there is an extreme distinction between those who are Greek and those who are not. However, individual members of the sororities and fraternities are pretty genuine. I just wish the system weren't so elitist."
Graduate Student,1,I graduated from the SLIS program and I wish I had known what a joke that department really is. I didn't learn one thing. Not one thing! The professors are insecure snobs who don't teach students any skills that are applicable to gaining meaningful employment. Waste of my time and my money. Don't go here. You will regret it.
Sophomore,1,Great place to go to college if you can’t get into your top five and want to work in a call center or restaurant after graduating with a business degree. Made a terrible decision to go here and will be transferring.
Sophomore,1,Brainwashed students in a backward state. A- for academics? Who is getting a B? This place is safety school USA relying on its authoritarian environment and football team to cover up all of its deficiencies - and there are a myriad of deficiencies!
Freshman,1,"I went here because I wanted to go out of state and try to do something completely new. I did not rush greek life because of the cost and I really don't think it is my thing. However, if you are not in greek life there is very very little to do here. Parties are girls and frat brothers only. I did not have the best roommate situation, the only guy I knew coming here dropped out before classes even started so I was stuck alone not knowing anyone and really struggled to make friends I really connected with. The campus is great, everything is laid up really nice and nothing is a super long ways away. The athletics of course are super fun and dining halls are decent most days. So, if you rush fraternities or sororities I'm sure youll love it here. But if you are not planning on it, I would highly suggest you look at other options especially if you're going into this college not knowing anyone."
Senior,1,"Just a bunch of conservative, Southern, white party-going students who don’t care about academics. Their focus is drinking, hooking up and their looks. Shallow kids who care only about their social lives. Get me out of here."
Freshman,1,This school is horrible. I don't recommend to anyone. Please choose a different school. They literally took all my money and then some. There's always something better.
Niche User,1,"Personally, I did not have a great experience at the University of Alabama. If you are looking for a party crowd, then you've found your school, but I felt that the chaos of the social aspect made thriving academically impossible. That aside, I found a lot of the professors in the hard sciences to be rude and extremely unhelpful. I ended up transferring after only a year to save my GPA."
Sophomore,1,"Coming from a large urban city and going to school in Alabama sucks. The parties lack umph, everyone is too drunk to care that it sucks. The Greek students stay in their own clique. There's nothing to do in Tuscaloosa except party and that's not fun (refer to earlier mention). The off campus apartments are nice and spacious but other than that the school isn't worth it unless you really love college football."
College Junior,1,"If you're Non-Greek, you're pretty outnumbered."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The Greek life at the University of Alabama runs the school. It is also referred to as ""The Machine""."
College Sophomore,1,"In terms of how Greek life affects UA, I really dislike it. If you are not part of a sorority or are not a big partier, it can be difficult to find your group of friends, until reaching upper level classes of your major. It also affects the school's safety. It's normal to be possibly date-raped at a Greek party. As well, whoever reports a rape by a Greek member will get hazed or a simple ""slap on the wrist"" is the punishment. The Machine is an actual issue in the school system."
College Freshman,1,"Unless they offer you money while you're still in high school, it is a pain in the ass with this school. Your adviser will send you to the scholarship office, the scholarship office will send you to the financial aid office, the financial aid office will send you to undergraduate admissions, and undergraduate admissions will tell you to go back to your adviser. This is exactly what happened to me and several other people I know. If you aren't going to Alabama on a scholarship, good luck getting financial assistance. Nobody there wants to help you with that; as much as it sucks, you will have no choice but to get a loan in order to pony up the 20-40k required to attend."
College Freshman,1,They gave me no aid
College Freshman,1,It is very competitive and near impossible to get unless you're a national merit student.
College Freshman,1,I am struggling to find scholarships and am In need of help
College Sophomore,1,"Do the engineering program, the other colleges don't give out as much money."
College Freshman,1,"Off-campus housing is extremely expensive and lackluster for the prices. while the best option are at least 3,600 a month. However, on-campus housing is also expensive but, since there are only a number of limited residential dorms students, who are not freshmen, must live off campus. The options for housing for both on and off campus are terrible."
College Student,1,There has been quite a bit of controversy with the sororities on campus.
College Freshman,1,"I'm in a fraternity, and I really enjoy it as I'm from out of state, and it gave me a fast group of friends. However the large majority of fraternities are very stuck up, and very Alabama-centric. Somewhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of the fraternities here will not give you a bid if you are not from Alabama, regardless of any legacy. (I had double legacy at one fraternity where this was the case. They were unwilling to even answer my emails.)

There's also an organization called ""The Machine"". They're basically a coalition of greek organizations (fraternities and sororities) who use their various contacts to shape the university how they see fit. This includes professors, generally speaking a large contingent of professors here were greek, and part of greek organizations who were part of The Machine. Essentially, you do not have a chance to have a voice in any university policy whatsoever if you are not greek. And even if you are greek, there's a high likelyhood that if you try to do something shaping anything at the university without this group's consent, you will be told to stop at best to stop, and at worst, you and your family will be run out of town. (For context on the last part, google: ""Joey Viselli The Machine"") To put it quite simply, the fraternities and sororities that are involved in this - and most of them are - are essentially a very dangerous cult.

Lastly, the incredible amount of anti greek and anti independent stigma is incredible. There's really no great way to describe this in detail, but it's absolutely greek vs. non-greek"
College Sophomore,1,"The faculty and the student body abhor the administration. We even have a fake Twitter account for the President mocking her failure as a leader. Although the failures of the administration don't truly hinder students' academic/social lives, they are making decisions that are truly terrible for the school. The administration's decision to continuously expand the student body, for example, has lead to an extremely overcrowded campus and not enough room for all freshmen to live in dorms. Furthermore, the administration bows to the Greek system, leading to failure to build new traditional dorms and accommodate non-Greek students. They also allow the Greeks to get away with everything from underage drinking to rampant racism with no real consequences."
College Sophomore,1,The food is always the same and is gross.
College Freshman,1,"We have a really big racism problem here at UA. It was very overwhelming especially when i come from such a melting pot. If you arent white, rich and pretty, you pretty much are looked down upon. Our greek system has been in trouble because of racism twice this year."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at UA is awful. Even if you have a parking pass there are only certain places you can park. On football Saturdays, our parking usually gets taken away and there isnt anywhere for anyone to park. Its WAY too easy to get parking tickets."
College Freshman,1,"Tuscaloosa isnt exactly fun when football season is not going. There isnt much to do and the closest city is 45 minutes away. Tuscaloosa is very ideal for college, just not to live afterwards."
College Freshman,1,"Everything about the Greek life at UA is bad. The way they think, act, and accomplish things. We've been in the news a few times for our greek system, im not a big fan of it."
College Student,1,not diverse at all. too bad.
College Student,1,very little money given to even the most needy
College Student,1,impossible. high risk of getting car booted or towed. extremely high fines.
College Freshman,1,The police need to control people...
College Freshman,1,THIS SCHOOL IS NOT DIVERSE AT ALL. Everyone is exactly the same.
College Freshman,1,The campus wi-fi sucks. The connection is always out
College Freshman,1,The wireless network is so slow and it consistently does not work.
College Junior,1,"Our school has poor representation of those who are below the socioeconomic status and those who are not Caucasians. If you are not in the white Greek system, life will be more difficult on campus, espeically if you want to run for an SGA position, which is ran by the 'machine'.  Even though half of the population is not from AL, the school overall has poor representatuion of the student body and faculty/staff."
College Junior,1,"It is really hard to obtain a scholarship(s) from UA, espeically if you are not apart of the patronage system, Honors College, or athletic.  There are not enough scholarship offers for current students and they do not actively let students know about opportunities."
College Senior,1,"expensive and difficult to find housing. realtors are not helpful, only want money."
College Freshman,1,I can't imagine most universities have quite as limited diversity
College Freshman,1,It's literally so expensive to go here if you live out of state and really hard to receive any scholarship money.
College Freshman,1,"Small, nasty old dorms. The new ones are super far from campus (15-20 minute walk). Our dorm was closed down for a little bit due to asbestos this year."
College Sophomore,1,The weather is so biopolar. It's rainy one minute and cold the next.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a nightmare. There are not enough parking spots for students at all.
College Freshman,1,The Computers are not reliable and you usually are going to be charged a lot for printing 
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life is very important on campus. The white Greeks have better houses and whole rows dedicated to their frats or sororities, compared to the nine frats and sororities that blacks have combined. There are only one house for one black frat and one house for one black sorority, and they are nowhere near as nice as the other houses."
College Sophomore,1,Horrible. The weather is so bipolar. One minute its hot than the next its raining but still HOT.
College Junior,1,there is no place to park unless you want to walk 30 minutes to your destination
College Sophomore,1,Parking at University of Alabama is the worst thing about the school. The university makes 7 million dollars off parking tickets and fines. They mark up fines over 100% than the city of Tuscaloosa. The School is more concern on about the beautification of campus and fan zones for football than building a parking garage for students. Parking pass are worth a  one month rent. The University of Alabama  needs to figure out a better system.
College Sophomore,1,"The university of Alabama is still working on bridging the race gap. There are few integrated clubs, fraternities, and sororities on camps. Most in state students still have animosity towards people of color. The University is bringing in students from out state which challenge the traditional ideas of segregation"
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is pretty overwhelming at UA and they are more useful for parties than actual community service. They received a C- from me because the white greeks don't accept the black greeks, even though they all believe in the brother/sisterhood bonds created. There are even certain frat houses that do not allow blacks to attend their parties. It's very segregated."
College Freshman,1,Only athletes and national merit scholars receive scholarships
College Freshman,1,"You should not come to Alabama if your first concern is a first class education. Having said this, the professors are generally great and the curriculum can be quality if you make it so. The workload is very light and should not be a problem. But this is a football school first and foremost. Any money left over goes to academics."
College Freshman,1,"A problem students face with the Yellow Pass is the distance they must walk back when there is no parking available near the students dorm. When the parking lot for Presidential, Highlands, and Ridgecrest is full students must drive to the Ferguson parking garage in order to park. The Ferguson parking garage is over a fifteen-minute walk for each one of these dorm rooms. This becomes very stressful when its raining or a student has groceries to carry back 
With the lack of parking space available a second problem students with the Yellow Pass encounter is the distress of leaving their spot.  Students are afraid they will lose their spot and have to park fifteen-minutes away."
College Freshman,1,"We actually reviewed the transportation on campus in my intro to Civil Engineering class last semester. The buses suck: they don't run on time and are overcrowded when it's raining. There aren't really enough bike racks near the really big/popular buildings and sometimes you must choose between riding on the sidewalk or on the roads, which is dangerous at points due to lots of car traffic and reckless student drivers. Then when you're walking you run the risk of getting hit by a bus, bike, or car. You're almost better off just not going to classes."
College Freshman,1,"parking here is terrible. The parking decals are expensive, and even once you pay for you're parking you are never guaranteed you will find a space. Don't park in the wrong zone though, the parking police are sure to get you. And it isn't like a typical Tuscaloosa parking ticket of $15, these suckers range from $25-$50 just for parking in the wrong lot. Parking here is literally a scam. And they try to make it seem just by allowing you to appeal you're ticket. But they always deny claims and then add on a 5 dollar processing fee for you're appeal in the first place. The crimson white just published an article saying the University made 2 million dollars annually on parking tickets alone. I love this school, but the parking here is beyond terrible."
College Freshman,1,"The campus is very racist, however, no one is alone.  People of the same race seem to stick together."
College Freshman,1,Parking permits are expensive and only allow you to park in select areas. Even though you have a car you will have to walk or ride a bike around campus anyways because driving is such an inconvenience. There are a lot of students so parking can fill up very quickly!
College Sophomore,1,The F is for how it seems to me that on campus everyone are into groups of color or race.
College Sophomore,1,"It's nice to stay on campus due to being close to different campus activities, especially if your running late for class or a meeting. If you stayed off campus you have to deal with traffic and finding a place to park your car. The D+ is for housing on campus being overly expensive."
College Sophomore,1,All I can tell you is be prepared for anything and everything!
College Sophomore,1,"As a sports and exercise major, I am concerned for my future. UA has this major under the college of education. For those, including my self, that are not in this field to become a P.E. teacher find this alarming. The internship opportunities in this are are slim. If I could do this again I would have stayed in the D.C./ Baltimore area, which has the highest employment rate."
College Freshman,1,"Parking At UA Is Horrible! There Is NO Parking By Any College And Even By The Residence Halls You Have To Come Home Before 8 To Get A Spot, If Not You Risk Parking On The Side Of The Curb And Getting A Ticket Or Parking 3 Or 4 Residence Halls Down And Walking 5 Minutes To Your Dorm..."
College Junior,1,"Since UA is expanding campus enrollment, more international students are more prevalent now. Despite all of that, I would say it's still segregated somewhat. All groups tend to stick together and Fraternities and Sororities also do the same. This campus harbors a semi-racist environment, but people at least hide it. People are a predominately conservative, Christian  and middle to upper middle class. I wish I could say LGBTQA+ students were accepted here, but that's not really the case. The slurs and sayings hurt people."

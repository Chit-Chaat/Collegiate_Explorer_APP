Junior,5,I love my school! Very friendly and small. All of my professors are nice and I can tell they care about my education.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Otterbein University for the second semester of my freshman year. All the staff did an amazing job at helping me to get adjusted and getting in all the classes I needed. Having heard the new rules the will be in place due to the pandemic when we return to campus in the fall, I am even more impressed with the schools dedication to creating a safe environment for all students."
Sophomore,5,"My professors did an amazing job at rearranging our class work to fitting with online. Not only have professors have been professional, I also still feel as though I am a part of the campus community and that I am continuing to learn as much as I would in a classroom."
Senior,5,I took classes online during the COVID-19 spring and summer semesters. Professors only had a few weeks to prepare - but did their best in helping students.
Niche User,5,"A small quite university. Great learning environment.
I love the small class sizes. Great professors ready to work with their students."
Junior,5,Otterbein has been a great experience so far. I just finished my first year here and my social life and education has been fun and rewarding.
Senior,5,"I feel like I got a well-rounded education at Otterbein. I never felt like just a number to professors. They all genuinely cared about me and my education. The campus is small enough to see somebody you know everywhere you go but you still have the chance to meet new people in every class or organization. There is a strong sense of community across campus. There is support from faculty and staff, organizations, and even the President. President Comerford makes a clear effort to support all organizations and students to the best of his ability. He truly cares about the university and hid mindset trickles down to all levels at Otterbein."
Niche User,5,"Otterbein is the perfect school to go to when you're looking for a career in nursing. The program is excellent and I look forward to applying to said program when I start the semester. Overall, the cost of tuition is not horrible, though to attract more people, they should lower the cost or offer more scholarship money."
Niche User,5,"I am research scholar. I worked in the department of Health and sport's science, Education and Sociology.
I like the student- faculty relationships. The faculty at Otterbein are amazing and always there to answer any questions or concerns. 
Sitting in the classes and observing the lectures was incredible. Otterbein has small class sizes, gives enough space to the students to interact. The university offers a variety of study abroad programs.
One thing that I have observed is that the school is not diverse. I speak as an international student from Africa. I think a lot still must be done when it comes to defining the term diversity. I believe it’s important to a have a class or an institution that represents the world. As the world moves closer than ever towards globalization, it is important to have as many representatives as possible in training leaders for the next generation that we are creating.
Amazing University highly recommended!"
Freshman,5,An amazing university in an excellent location. The academics are great and they offer a lot of student aid options.
Niche User,5,"I've been to Otterbein several times for college visits. I first went there last spring break to meet with the wrestling coach. We then stayed in contact for several months and I visited again over the summer for tour of the school, and campus. In early September I did an over night visit with the wrestlers and had a great time experiencing campus. Everyone I meant enjoyed the campus and the school overall."
Freshman,5,"So far I like everything honestly, everyone is really nice and helpful. Professors take their time to explain everything and Westerville is a really calm and relax area so it’s really nice to attend there."
Sophomore,5,"I like having a tight nit campus, but being so close to central Columbus. You get the best of both worlds! There are so many originations and clubs, many resources and a huge community connection. Sports are also a huge part of campus life. I love my major and departments really help students find their interest and help them accomplish their academic and career goals."
Sophomore,5,"I love how close the community is, it is so welcoming and open to others. We are a small campus in the middle of Westerville but still in our small enough community that you don't feel like you're right in the middle of the city. All of the faculty and staff on campus are so kind and always willing to help you with whatever you need, even if it's just someone to talk to. One thing that could be improved on campus is when classes are offered, this is because when someone like me comes to campus who already came in with college credits, I can't always get into the classes I need to get the credits for the semester to be a full time student"
Freshman,5,Otterbein has an amazing nursing program that really prepares students for their future careers. Otterbein is a very welcoming place that everyone can belong to. There are tons of student organizations on campus and the Greek life is very unified at Otterbein.
Sophomore,5,"It's a small university, so it's easy to get from class to class. The professors are wonderful and there are many activities/speakers/events. I love my school."
Niche User,5,"Otterbein is a smaller private college that is in a very nice area of Westerville, OH.  The campus is beautiful and has alot of activities and clubs to join.  A great to meet new lifelong friends.  I will begin my journey in the nursing field in the fall of 2019 and I cannot wait to get started on my future."
Freshman,5,"Super connected
A lot to do
Really nice community
Loved the library
Interesting classes
Professors are really nice and passionate in teaching as well as keeping good relationships"
Freshman,5,Very small and confortable school that makes you feel at home at all times. A nice sized time within a short drive of a bigger city in Columbus.
Alum,5,"Otterbein was an excellent private school. I made lifelong friends there. Athletics are good enough to be focused on more, but overall, it was an excellent experience. Plus the surrounding area is awesome and action-packed."
Junior,5,I have had a very stressing semester and suddenly all my teacher as well as faculty members reached out and offered assistance to both my health and my grades. It truly made me feel appreciated and cared for
Sophomore,5,"The faculty, staff, and students make everything worth while! You can tell that your teachers and advisers genuinely care about your well-being, not just academically but make a real effort to help you succeed and be the person you want to be."
Freshman,5,I've had such a great time here! I'm always challenged and there are some great classes. There are many opportunities inside and outside the classroom. I love Otterbein!
Freshman,5,"Otterbein strives to be a place of inclusion and diversity, which really makes you feel welcome as soon as you arrive. They have a small, close-nit campus that is located in a very safe and connected community. Everyone treats you with compassion and they are all very eager to help you in any way that you can. There are a decent amount of ways to get involved on campus, whether it be with clubs or with the community, and it's not very hard to make friends. Overall, I am very pleased so far with my college experience at Otterbein."
Sophomore,5,I like the special individualized attention given to each student. The instructors take time to get to know students' academic needs. Then they give individualized assistance as well as review resources that will be helpful. They also pay attention to students' individual circumstances and suggest ways they can do better.
Freshman,5,"I love the community! The campus is small, so everyone gets to know each other! I love walking through campus and being able to say hello to almost everyone I pass."
Freshman,5,Otterbein University is a wonderful place to go to school. I am happy to be a freshman here. I love how close everyone is here and how all of my classes in my major are connected in some way. I love how we integrate with other majors and that the town of Westerville is very close and helpful with the college.
Freshman,5,Otterbein University is a great place to be! All of the people are friendly. You develop a close relationship with classmates and small class sizes make it easy to communicate with professors.
Junior,5,Its very diversified and yet everyone feels equal. There are many clubs and courses that are available to meet everyone's needs and interests.
Junior,5,"Smaller school - you really get to know your professors. Campus location is great. In a very nice suburb of Columbus, OH. Show up. Do the work. You'll do fine here."
Senior,5,"Awesome academics with many internship opportunities. Columbus is a great place for after college job opportunities. Westerville is an awesome place to be during college years, anything you need is in this area. Polaris is only 5 minutes away which has everything you need. Athletics are awesome! Great coaching staff for all athletic teams. Hosing/ dorms are great and the food is pretty good. Lots of off campus housing opportunities for upperclassman."
Freshman,5,I love the sense of community and how student oriented the school is in everything they do. The class sizes are small enough that you can form a relationship with your professor which is something that was important to me. They also have an excellent education program that I know will teach me a lot and give me life experience to help me become an amazing elementary teacher.
Freshman,5,"I come all the way from Hawaii I had no idea what this campus looked like or the kind of people I was about to get myself involved in. I am majoring in Musical Theatre and got in by a slim chance. Otterbein has one of the hardest programs to get into and I am lucky I was looked at and considered in the first place. I got here on the first day nervous and excited. I moved in and immediately got to experience my program and the talent level. From then on I knew I belonged here. There is such a high level of professionalism within the program. Because it is a small program, we become a family and create this idea of an ensemble. We are all here to create, and  everyone is important."
Freshman,5,"I love Otterbein University.  I love how small it is because you get to know your professors more efficiently, and they know you.  The professors are always willing to help you out of class and frequently have office hours.  The Otterbein community is filled with various types of people that all intergrate together nicely."
Sophomore,5,"Otterbein is small enough so that you feel at home, but it is large enough so that you see new faces everyday.  Because class sizes are small, professors genuinely care about each students' success.  I've become very close with some of my art professors - they even care about my activities beyond art.  I'm on the volleyball team at Otterbein as well, so I've become really close with some of my teammates.  Two of them are my roommates, and we do everything together.  I am very happy with my decision to attend Otterbein University."
Freshman,5,"Otterbein is such a wonderful place to go to college at. The people there are great, and there's always someone there to support you both academically and personally."
College Freshman,5,This community feels like a family. I have never felt threatened nor do I ever think I will. This is a loving community that would do anything for its student especially protect them.
College Freshman,5,This school has allowed me to grow so much as a person. Coming in I was shy and now I am outgoing and have created a tight knit family.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are great! They are so nice and you can tell by listening to their lectures that they are very passionate about the subject they are teaching! The class sizes are very small; my biggest class was 32 people. There are so many great courses offered as well!
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe at Otterbein! There was only one issue my first year. The campus police do a great job at keeping the campus safe and under control!
College Freshman,5,a lot of school spirit
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. I have never had an issue with fear of safety, however there are many possible solutions available to students if they did feel unsafe. The Otterbein Police Department is happy to drive students to their destination on campus late at night and is available to call 24/7. There are also emergency phones located around campus. If anything suspicious should occur on campus or near campus, an email, call, and text will be sent to students and staff."
College Junior,5,People on campus are very good at looking out for one another. The Otterbein police department is also very helpful and easy to get a hold of if you every need anything.
College Junior,5,"Overall, my experience has been awesome. I don't want to leave. I have made friends that I will have forever. I have been able to pursue my dream of becoming an equine vet. Everyone here is so supportive and helpful. I wouldn't be where I am today or who I am today without the wonderful faculty, staff, and students of Otterbein University."
College Junior,5,You are sent internships emails almost every week. There are many opportunities to meet and speak with people in many professions and discuss job opportunities. The alumni are really nice and super helpful in helping students find work or internships. We are given so many opportunities on campus.
College Junior,5,Greek lIfe is fantastic at Otterbein. The community is ver tight knit and highly involved in community service and just on campus in general. Non-greeks and greeks get along very well. We all work together to make the school the best that it can be.
College Junior,5,I love going to Otterbein! it has been one of my favorite experiences ever. I have been given so many opportunities to work and ride on campus while still focusing on my major and my hobbies. Everyone is very accepting no matter where you come from.
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,5,Greek life is amazing! It is definitely one of the best decisions I've made in college. I've made the best friends and had amazing leadership opportunities.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my small school! My sorority provides a lot of support, and small class sizes means I really get to know my profs."
College Sophomore,5,Joining Greek Life is one of the best decisions that I have made. I love the girls in my chapter and it is comforting to have a group of people I can turn to on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I love otterbein and everything it has to offer. I have had the opportunity to get involved all around campus. I also like how all of the professors know who you are and care about how well you do
College Freshman,5,I chose Otterbein because of the job outlook
College Sophomore,5,Feel very safe. Small community.
College Sophomore,5,"Many people have said if they had to choose a job hire between two people and one was an Otterbein grad, the Otterbein grad would get the job instantly. Heard many good things about hiring!"
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.  I also make sure that I am not walking late at night alone and/or with my pepper spray.
College Freshman,5,The classes are staffed with very good and knowledgable teachers. They are very available to answer questions. Class sizes are small and you get individual attention.  The gen ed classes are unique and interesting. You are encouraged to explore and think outside the box.  I cannot imagine going anywhere else.
College Freshman,5,I have not had the opportunity yet to be a job seeker but I did explore their reputation and job hire rate after graduation.  I am interested in med school so I looked into the connections they have with hospitals and med schools.  I was impressed!
College Freshman,5,I went through rush and pledged a sorority.  The experience was a good one and I love my new sorority. Because it is a small school I knew many of the girls in  greek life. Their is an emphasis on community service.
College Freshman,5,I love Otterbein.  The campus is beautiful  and it is a small school in a very wonderful quaint city.  The professors care about the students and have a passion for what they teach. Their gen ed classes are unique and interesting.  There are many organizations that I have to pick from that meet my interests.  i can't say enough wonderful things about this school.
Junior,4,"I had a good experience online! It was an adjustment but considering it had to be done quickly, it was efficient and I felt I was receiving a good education."
Sophomore,4,"Otterbein University is an amazing school with professors and faculty who care about your well-being and academic success. Otterbein University has an awesome campus life with a lot of diversity and programs that help you find ""your people"". Otterbein is also in a great location. With uptown Westerville in walking distance and downtown Columbus only a 20 min drive. If you are looking for a small private college I would highly recommend."
Senior,4,"I transferred to Otterbein after achieving my associates degree. The professors are wonderful, and the campus is absolutely beautiful. It's located in a super safe area, with access to Downtown Columbus jobs and night life."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and the city of Westerville. The food and dorm life could be updated and upgraded.
Niche User,4,"I took two classes online.
The professors we're very flexible in helping students adjust to online learning."
Junior,4,Otterbein University provides a very welcoming atmosphere with teachers who genuinely care about your well being and success.
Freshman,4,Otterbein is very fun they have a lot of fun activities to attended to. Professors are also amazing and easy to talk to and are always there for you!
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere of the campus overall. The faculty are always willing to provide the help I need and there are so many ways to get involved and make connections on campus.
Freshman,4,Otterbein is a very unique and great school. The professors and administration care about the students and make it easy to learn.
Senior,4,I enjoyed the professors in my major. They were always willing to help me and adapted to my schedule since I played a sport and had a job.
Senior,4,Otterbein University gave me a solid foundation in Human Movement studies that will further me into my graduate school career in becoming a Chiropractor.  Small class sizes allow for close interaction with faculty and lead to my success and acceptance into a Doctoral program in the field of Chiropractic.  The school has a lot to offer academically and a diverse group of students that have varying interests.  Student life is mediocre due to the lack of clubs and organizations.  The food is not great at all and in my four years attending Otterbein we have been through two food providers in which health inspection failures were not uncommon.
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, but so far I am loving Otterbein! I made friends immediately and everywhere I went. The professors are extremely caring and genuinely want you to do your best."
Sophomore,4,Amazing faculty and degree programs. Great support systems. Beautiful campus. Needs a more diverse student body.
Freshman,4,Professors and administrators strive to help students when they are in need. The Otterbein community is made up of great people including the students.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, great experience. I love the program I am in. There are small class sizes and the professors truly want you to succeed. Otterbein has taught me a lot academically, as well as personally. I have been opened up to new experiences in my short time there as well. The only thing I would change is how expensive attending this university is."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere and the professors, who all seemed to care about my education. The only thing that is unfortunate is that parts of the campus seems to be a bit run-down, but this does not change my overall view of Otterbein. I was able to make friends easily and get along with anyone I came in contact with. I began to develop a personal connection with my professors and those who worked in admissions and the financial aid department, all of the staff cares about your education!"
Junior,4,"The campus is very friendly and great! The food isn't the best, but there are so many restaurants close by."
Freshman,4,"The staff is great and there are so many opportunities to strive. The staff is really there for you and want to see you succeed. They will do whatever it takes to help. There are so many different ways to get involved and meet new people. The classes are challenging but worth it. The food is not very good but the food in Uptown is great, some places even give discounts with your student ID. The Nursing, Education, Theatre, and Equestrian Majors are huge here. You'll definitely find your group of people here. The campus puts on many events and gets people involved and interested. Great way to meet new people. Campus is very small and you can walk everywhere. Great gym facility and housing."
Niche User,4,I loved the town it is beautiful! Everyone in town was friendly and so was the campus tour guides and  were very great and honest. The campus seems accepting and wonderful.
Niche User,4,The Zoo and Conservation program looks interesting. I have visited the campus twice and like the small class size.
Alum,4,"Pretend my rating is 4.5.

Otterbein was one of the best times of my life. I can't speak for after school opportunities just yet, as I'm still a fresh grad, but I'll get back to you guys on that (maybe).

If you go into this place with an open mind, you'll do alright. Most people are pretty friendly and down to get to know you if you give them a chance. 

As for academics, I wasn't a huge fan but there's quite a few different departments so try and find some juniors or seniors in your field at the school. INST courses, which are essentially super-focused electives, are pretty hit or miss. Many students don't like them, but I actually really enjoyed  most of mine. Just take the ones  your interested in and not the ones your friends are taking.

Great school going through some huge changes which will make it even better for the most part."
Junior,4,"I'm a biology major and the classrooms and labs are in a new building, that's amazing. Class sizes are smaller, and it's easy to get individual attention with your professors. There are tons of things on campus to get involved in."
Junior,4,"Otterbein is a beautiful campus and the ratio of professors to students is really outstanding.  Also, many of the professors really care and are there for their students. There is also a lot going on campus to support you through whatever you may need assistance with. For example, if you are going through something emotional wise we have counselors ready to talk with you. We also have good internship/career advantages and many more bonuses. Now, compared to The Ohio State University Otterbein is the farthest from diverse but, it is getting better and that's all that matters. Campus is pretty safe and our on campus police staff (OPD) does a great job keeping up on patrol and response when they are needed in any situation."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love Otterbein. It really is a home away from home for me. I have found my place here. The professors are great, all the students are very friendly, and the location is amazing. If I could change anything about it, I would change the food and the cost. The food is pretty risky most of the time and the cost is outrageous and financial aid doesn't do anything to try and help you get more scholarships or aid. Those things sound like enough reasons to leave this place but I just love the people and the staff here too much to transfer. I have grown so much this year and I am thankful for Otterbein."
Freshman,4,"Otterbein provides such an intimate community. Attending a small school, as inclusive as Otterbein is has been such a nice experience. I would personally love to see more racial diversity on campus!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman and will be attending Otterbein for the next 4 years. Coming from a different state I was very sceptical on coming to this new school. After spending my first semester here I know for a fact that I clearly made the right decision. The teachers and faculty of various resources have been nothing short of supportive and kind. The university is full of diversity when it comes to people. Unlike the Big State schools where you are just a number in giant lecture hall, you are treated like an individual with the small classroom sizes. you will be treated with dignity and respect as soon as you walk into the classroom by the teachers just as long as you put forth the effort asked of you. You will get as much as you put in here with the numerous internship and work opportunity available here at Otterbein. I would highly recommend this College to anyone who is looking for a new experience."
Freshman,4,"Otterbein has a very nice, campus in Westerville Ohio.  It is small enough so you don't feel like just one of the crown but big enough to offer many programs and student life activities."
Freshman,4,"Otterbein has a very nice campus set in Westerville, Ohio. The students and faculty are very friendly. There are a wide variety of programs and extra-curricular activities."
Freshman,4,"Almost everything about this school is perfect. The professors, the athletic facilities, the academic facilities, the aesthetics. The only glaring issues are the *surprise* nature of the Financial Aid department when they don't let you know of any issues until the last possible moment, making it a pain. Also, there is little parking which is terrible for commuters."
Freshman,4,"Otterbein is a great college and cares about its students. The faculty are very knowledgeable and support the students to help them with their career paths. The food is decent, but not great. Otterbein is also located in a very friendly and tightly-knit community, and only a short distance from downtown Columbus."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere here. Everyone is friendly and the professors truly want you to succeed here. It is personable and the professors know who you are. Everyone is always willing to help you and better your experience.
Freshman,4,"I love how Otterbein truly has a close-knit atmosphere. You truly cannot walk across campus without running into a friend or kind faculty member. This being said it is very expensive even with a lot of academic scholarships. In my opinion, the extra money is worth your investment for the most part"
Junior,4,"I love Otterbein! The campus is really cute, and it's the perfect size. There is amazing sense of community at Otterbein. You get to know a lot of different people because it is a small, private school."
Sophomore,4,"My professors at Otterbein University are really great. They go above and beyond to help me and my peers succeed in our goals not just in the classroom, but outside the classroom as well.  They have always taken the time to work with me one on one to make sure I understand the material. I also love the community. Everyone here is very supportive of each other.  I love being able to walk to class and see at least one person I know, and knowing there are still plenty more for me to meet.  Westerville is an awesome town to be a part of.  Uptown Westerville is like an extension of our campus, and it is so nice to have shopping, food, and convenience within walking distance."
Alum,4,"Otterbein is a small community with a large heart. You will know most of everyone including professors not in your major if you are involved in anything outside of your classes. The campus is like its own little bubble but surrounded by so much - Uptown Westerville, Polaris, Easton and Downtown Columbus. If you want to have a close college experience while it not being too close Otterbein is perfect for that!"
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed attending Otterbein and graduated with a degree in Psychology.  The class sizes are small, many of the teachers are wonderful, and I had an easy time getting involved in basic research when I took it upon myself to do so.  I took advantage of their Study Abroad program which was one of the best decisions I've made.  I also know nursing students who have done very well with their careers.  As with any Psychology major, school is what you make of it.  If you take advantage of what Otterbein has to offer, you will give yourself an edge in the job market.  If you allow yourself to merely attend classes, you may not get the best return on your investment.  Overall, I would recommend Otterbein to anyone who wants a small college and small town vibe (with Ohio State a short drive away if you need a big town feel or resources every now and then)."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and quaint. It is a reflection of the personalities and vibes you see/feel from all of the staff and professors that work there. The professors are more than helpful and the resources on campus are abundant! If you ever have a question about ANYTHING you don't have to look too far. 
College Freshman,4,I was able to go from high school to college pretty easy as this university is a lot like my high school. The class sizes are generally the same so it feels like home an I don't feel like I am just a number in the class. Also I feel like the way the professors teach really get the students involved which is great.
College Freshman,4,I feel like many people see Otterbein as a prestigious ohio university so its like being labled when going to get a job.
College Freshman,4,Dorm life is amazing. You get to meet new people you thought you never would. My best friend is from Illinois so you meet a variety of people and become one.
College Freshman,4,We have a wide variety of houses and dorms that are dedicated to Greek life so you can really choose what you like and go from there.
Freshman,4,"Otterbein University is very welcoming.  I am proud that I am a cardinal. They want you to succeed and be happy.  If they notice something is off, they will try to help you.  I feel like I am part of a big and welcoming family.  "
College Junior,4,I feel my career prospects are good. We have a great alumni network at Otterbein.
College Junior,4,I've been pretty happy with all of my courses and my professors
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus. Otterbein Police do a good job of communicating with students and making sure we are all safe.
College Junior,4,"Sports are a big thing on campus, but everything is kinda a big deal on such a small campus."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love Otterbein! Of course it's not perfect, but what school is? This is such an amazing campus where I have come to grow close to so many people."
College Sophomore,4,"If I had to go through the college decision process again I would definitely go for Otterbein University again. I have learned so much my first year and not just while in class but about life, myself, and how to succeed in life in general. I love Otterbein so much!"
College Junior,4,"Most professors are great and passionate about their subjects. A lot of mentoring goes on here to between faculty and students. Class sizes are small. The variety of courses offered is diverse. Although it may not be as diverse as it is at some larger schools, it is sufficient for getting a well-rounded and solid education for whatever one wants to do after their bachelor's degree. For students in the sciences, it is easy to get involved in student research as early as your freshman year."
College Junior,4,"The alumni network here is strong, and many people respect Otterbein's reputation. I feel very proud to be an Otterbein student and have benifitted from its reputation in the community."
College Junior,4,"The Otterbein Police Department is really helpful. You can always go to them if you feel unsafe or call them. They have no problem escorting people at night, helping people locked out of buildings, etc. I feel very safe on campus, in large part due to them."
College Junior,4,"It's wonderful your first year, and helps you to meet many new people. The dorms are fun for new students and a very good experience. The suites are more private and provide way less of a social atmosphere, except of course with your roommates. It's a lot easier to stay connected to campus resources and take full advantage of them while living on campus. The nicest dorms are in Clements Hall, and Hanby is currently being rennovated. A lot of people also like the honors hall, Mayne Hall, but the rooms are not as nice. Garst is pretty far away from everything and not as nice. Dunlap King is rumored to not be very nice, but to have great people, and is close to the academic buildings. As far as suites go, Devore is much more luxurious than 25. West home. It is closer to the gym, but farther from academic buildings. The housing process can be hectic, but they try to make it as smooth as possible. The cost is high here, largely because a meal plan is mandatory."
College Junior,4,"Otterbein University is unique from other liberal arts colleges, because students tend to help one another to succeed academically, rather than being competitive over achievement. The culture here is very supportive, and there are many resources that can be easily used by students, such as the center for career development, the center for student success, and free student counseling sessions. I have formed mentoring relationships with faculty and older students that have taught me valuable lessons for my career field personal life. I have also been inspired to be an engaged member of my community. Servant leadership is something that is often exemplified and talked about here. The campus is very active in the community and every year students complete many hours of volunteer work."
College Sophomore,4,"The school really tries to ensure that students have internship opportunities. For my major, we had multiple engineering companies come to a lecture and tell us what they had to offer. It was nice getting to speak with the different companies about what they do day to day. We also did projects for companies like Nestle that gave us a great opportunity to get acquainted with the companies."
College Sophomore,4,Don't live in the triad! All other dorms are really nice and clean. Most have a lot of space including Mayne and Hanby. The housing process is very simple as well which is nice!
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of student involvement at the sporting events and the school encourages students to come to the events by offering free pizza or tshirts to the first 100 students,etc. Our teams may lack talent but the fans are always there to support them and the stands are always loaded with fans and students supporting our school colors."
College Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes and how great the professors are! They are very willing to help with any problems you encounter on homework our lectures and will make time to meet with you to help you better understand the topic. Great school and it makes being so far from home a lot easier!
College Sophomore,4,professors actually really care about you and your grades
College Freshman,4,loved my roommate I was paired with
College Freshman,4,Living on campus has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I met so many friendly and kind people whom I have become very close with. It truly feels like an environment I can call home. Otterbein continued to improve the dorm I resided in throughout the year to create a more convenient and enjoyable living experience.
Junior,2,Learning online was a struggle through Otterbein University. The curriculum wasn’t taught to the level as it would have been in class and a lot of busy work was used. Finals were significantly different online than in class and affected my grades.
Freshman,2,"i am currently a freshman at Otterbein and enjoy my course work.  I am extremely disappointed with my living arrangement on the dorms. I have caught several mice in my dorm room and have had mice feces in my bed.  The school does not seem to care about this situation. In addition, I would have the food in the cafeteria a very low rating."
College Sophomore,2,there are so many parties and a lot of drinking that students don't focus on studying
College Freshman,2,Not very cleanly in the freshman housing
College Junior,2,"You pretty much have to go to Columbus to OSU's campus, the short north, or downtown to find a good place to party"
College Junior,2,"Campus is mostly white and lots of females, there is a substantial gay population but other than that diversity is fairly low."
College Junior,2,We are a dry campus and the town that surrounds our campus is mostly a dry town. To go to any bars or clubs you would have to drive to down town Columbus.
College Junior,2,"If you want to drink you're driving to Columbus; there are a lot of options there, but Westerville is mostly limited to bars that specialize in food over drinks and atmosphere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I like playing flute, but they squash the love of music out of you. They refuse to let you play another instrument, especially if your secondary is saxophone. They have a pitiful at best jazz and pop program, and force feed you classical. So, if classical is your thing and nothing else, you might love it."
College Freshman,2,Expensive with no student discounts
College Freshman,2,We have had three snow days already which is a lot for here. It has been super cold!
College Sophomore,2,The biggest part I regret about coming to this school is the food options. Other than that i have no other regrets about coming to this school 
College Sophomore,2,"The police on campus are decently strict. They will not hesitate to hand out tickets to students if parked in the wrong zone or registration/parking decals are not present. Police respond quickly to any crime or complaint. Otterbein is a dry campus, but students do have parties off campus; usually, unless there is some kind of complaint, police leave them alone. However, police do roam campus on weekend nights; just to make sure everyone is safe. "
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know much about the long distance transportation on campus. I know that for all breaks, Otterbein has a shuttle to take students to the air port. I think this shuttle is available whenever, if students contact directly. Also, there are many COTA buses around Columbus/Westerville; although they don't provide direct routes, they are reliable means of transportation. I don't know about the costs of these means of transportation. "
College Sophomore,2,Although Otterbein has many international and diverse group the majority of the student and teacher are part of the white population.
College Sophomore,2,I think it depends on the season. It may rain one day and be sunny the next.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a good ratio of parking spots to students allowed with cars on campus, including staff, faculty, and commuters."
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife on campus is almost non-existent. There are parties here and there, but you have to know where you're going and where you could possibly find them. However, there isn't a whole lot to do on campus. On the weekends, everyone packs up and goes home. If you have a car, however, you're set."
College Sophomore,2,The food is not appetizing and makes me sick to my stomach.
College Sophomore,2,Parking spots are tough to find and there are not enough for everyone usually. Many students like to drive to class and park by their building and that can be difficult.
Sophomore,1,I took 5 courses online and only 1 of my professors taught actual lectures. The rest simply posted the slides for us (the students) to learn on our own. I feel as though I would have learned better and been more productive with the courses if there had been an actual live lecture class during this time.
Freshman,1,"Worse college I’ve attended , don’t come here if your a person of color! You will feel attacked and isolated and treated unfairly , this school is thirsty for money they will get you and make you pay for anything majority of the dorms on campus don’t have air conditioning and are cold as shit ! Food is disgusting and a waste of the 5k a year"
Senior,1,"You are immediately indoctrinated during the orientation period with many far left opinions, one of the most prominent being white privilege. 

If the orientation process contains political views then it is obvious that the University is designed to make you think a certain way. If you do not agree with the far left opinion you are labeled a racist (or some other buzzword).

I would not recommend anyone go here but especially so if you are white and going into the humanities. You will be shamed for your race / who you like to take to the bedroom / your gender / ect.... and if you don't give into that shame, well, good luck dealing with the backlash. 

If I could do it over I would go to a University that cares about intellectual diversity and not so much what your race is or who you have sexual relations with. I DID NOT have that option here and neither will you. Choose wisely."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The school is beautiful, however I absolutely hate the place. I have had terrible experiences with friends, teachers, and organizations. I would not choose it again because, because of this school, I am now 130,000 in debt and only a B.A. in music to show for it. I cannot do anything with this degree, and I was forced into it by the department. So if you are going here for something other than equine or nursing, don't come here!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am a B.A. in music concentration flute. The flute part is wonderful with the best instructor you could ask for. However, the music program at Otterbein is terrible. If you want to do anything other than music, it is like getting teeth pulled. I was flat out refused the ability to take a language class until I dropped to a B.A. I was a music education major until junior year. If you have your heart set on this major, but have a hard time with school. just pick somewhere else. I failed a few classes and retook them and passed, and they kicked me out of the major regardless. Absolutely ruthless. They only see the students as another number, and not as you. The teachers are nice to your face and talk about you to other professors behind your back. I saw it happen on a professors phone!"
College Freshman,1,70% girls to guys plus everyone's white
College Freshman,1,The administration fought me every step of the way
College Freshman,1,Hate it. I am transferring
College Freshman,1,Greek life is the only way to be part of something here
College Freshman,1,Had my car broken into
College Freshman,1,Tracey Benner(the director of residence life makes it he'll. she is a total bitch)
College Freshman,1,They are idiots who know the rules and do the bare minimum. AWFUL ADMINISTRATION
College Freshman,1,"White Kids, White Kids, Everywhere – The diversity question at Otterbein is always humerous when answered because the fact of the matter is that there is none. No matter where you turn on this campus 99% of the time you will see surburban middle class white kids going to and from classes. And it's not surprising considering the community surrounding Otterbein is full of uppermiddle class white folks who most probably graduated from Otterbein. DIversity is a joke."
College Junior,1,"Too Much for Too Little! There is a huge issue with parking. It costs way too much with very limited places where you can park. They pass out more passes for cars than there are places to park. Freshmen are allowed to have cars, which I don't think should be allowed because then they take up spots for upperclassmen who have been there longer and usually have their own apartments and need to carry in groceries or other things like that."
College Sophomore,1,"Can Be Pretty Strict – Like most school if you drink in the dorm you will get caught. so its not a smart idea to do that.  But the dean in charge of that stuff is pretty cool about punishment if your honest with him, so its really not to bad."
College Sophomore,1,Miserable Ohio – Winters are long and cold. Very few days are ever sunny and it is always windy
College Sophomore,1,"The meals are decent, but there are not a lot of options for people who want to eat healthfully. There also are few GOOD options other than the dining hall... which is not so good."

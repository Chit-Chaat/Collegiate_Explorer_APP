Freshman,5,The school's size makes you feel very close to your professors and their teachings. You can get started on your field of choice very quickly. There are many research and internship opportunities on site.
Senior,5,"The thing I enjoyed most about MSOE was it's ability to change.  much like the students there as they grow and learn, MSOE adapted to the needs of its students, staff, and faculty.  It connected with people to ensure its promise of learning in a way that only a small university could."
Junior,5,"As a transfer student I really appreciated all the help I received and felt as if I fit right in with the other students. I appreciate the small class sizes and often see the same people in my classes, which I love. I find that many of the professors make it a point to get to know your name and make sure you know why the material is important by relating it to the real world as often as possible."
Junior,5,"This spring quarter at MSOE, due to the pandemic, were delivered completely online. The professors were very understanding and made the transition very easy. All professors could be reached easily if needed and were very helpful in taking additional time outside of online lectures to answer questions. My only issue regarding the online format was the inconsistency between professors and their choice of platform they would be conducting their classes through. I found that this made the new online experience more difficult to get used to and harder for me to keep track of all my classes. Though most of my professors were proficient in this area, I did wish that all of my professors were more flexible with due dates as my at home situation was vastly different in light of the pandemic. Similarly, having time outside of the time that was allotted for quizzes and exams to capture, convert, and upload files of work would have been appreciated in all of my classes."
Freshman,5,"I like the smallness, you get a sense of knowing everyone around you. Also everyone very helpful. The like the school and events and what they offer. All the professor care about your learning and if you’re willing to ask for help, they will no questions asked. I also like the small classrooms, they are engaging and Are great environments for learning."
Freshman,5,I took classes online during quarantine. The professor did a great job implementing the classes with sudden changes in a way that wasn’t too work heavy and they were there to help if needed.
Freshman,5,"I have just completed by first year at MSOE as a Nursing major. I have to say that I love it. MSOE's professors are very passionate about what they teach to students and are always super helpful. The campus is in a great area with so much to do around, and it is very beautiful. It is a very hard school and you have to have at least a 77 for nursing prerequisites in order to move to the next class. This is a big challenge for a lot of the students as the classes are not easy, but they can be done with persistence and determination. For social life, it is what you want it to be as it is a small school. You have to find your people just like anywhere else! I've met great friends in my 1st year and we have gone out many weekends together and made great memories. There are plenty of parties, sport events, and more for whatever you like. It is a very safe campus, public safety is great! I love MSOE and I would definitely recommend it for those who want a great education."
Senior,5,Very rigorous institution but graduates are very successful in their career fields. MSOE properly prepares students academically to succeed post graduation. Career Services is available and very willing to help students but job searching and internship searching is something they lack in helping students with.
Freshman,5,Welcoming staff that are there for students. Classmates that are friendly and willing to go out (when there is no homework).
Freshman,5,"Milwaukee School of Engineering is a great college for mechanical engineering students with a great amount of opportunities- from college organization to annual Career fairs, where you can find an internship. Also, professors are usually good and helpful (for me, as for international student, it was totally new level of attention to students), usually patient about their subject. Finally, most of facilities are in a good condition and university services work like Switz watch."
Freshman,5,The academics and support of the staff are excellent. The wellness center has been especially supportive.
Niche User,5,"Milwaukee School of Engineering is a fantastic school. It is located in a very nice area of the city, with it being 10 minutes from the lake, practically right on the river walk and also the public market. The campus is beautiful and they are always improving it as well. The school itself is amazing as the professors are all very helpful and the education you get there is one of the best you can get for engineering, along with its return on investment being very high. The school has really good facilities for all athletics and the coaches there are very fun and understanding when it comes to balancing sports and your education. While it is not a party school, it is in the city of Milwaukee which always has fun activities and events to participate in with your friends, so there won't be much missed there. This school is fantastic and if anybody is looking to go into engineering in any sort this should be on the top of their list."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved my time at MSOE (although it was only for a year). I had to transfer out because I no longer wanted to do the major I was there for and MSOE did not offer the major I was interested in. Now at a new school, I MISS MSOE A LOT. If they had the major I'm now interested in, I would've never transferred out. Although the work load is a lot, if you can manage your time wisely, you should fine. make sure to set time aside to study, because most of the time professors here are lecturing during class time to make sure you know the content. I loved being able to talk to advisers about literally anything. Whenever i struggled with any personal issues, I went to them. Never be afraid of your professor either. they are always willing to help you and guide you in the direction you want to be in. Become friendly with the professors too, because they're people as well. I was close with 3 professors and I still keep in touch with them."
Sophomore,5,"MSOE has so much to offer to any and all types of students.  Being a student with austim was very worried and nervous attending a college with zero people I would know. Freshman week being only ones on the campus truly broke the ice.  I was attending as much as possible to learn what the campus will be like for the next 4 years.  All are very welcoming; Advisors are easy to communicte with to progress correctly.  I knew on my first visit this would be my college!  Is amazing to see a dream come true and how well I fit in this college.  They are so helpful, working hard for all to succeed."
Freshman,5,Milwaukee School of Engineering is a very great school for someone who wants a focused track education. This school is very efficient at producing quality graduates in a set 4 year course track. The university is filled very knowledgeable staff and faculty that are very welcoming and helpful for students of all ages. The student body is very helpful as well. The campus is very nice sized and quality with the newer buildings.  The overall campus is a great safe place for students.
Sophomore,5,"I won’t lie, MSOE was low on my list for a while, and I am so glad I changed my mind. Whatever in my gut told me it was right, was right. I’ve never felt more at home than at school. It’s not perfect - some things are real janky, classes are hard and it’s very stressful. But, I’ve made so many amazing friends, received so much support from teachers and faculty, and grown in thousands of ways I couldn’t have anywhere else. The kind of people MSOE attracts (both faculty and students) are the kind of people I want to surround myself with - driven, genuine, good. Not to mention nerdy in the best of ways. No college is perfect, but if you’re bad looking for people like you who want to work hard to truly understand and master their academic passions, you’ll be right at home here."
Junior,5,"Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) pushes students to do their best academically, but it pays off. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and understand the fields they teach, which is really helpful to the students. On the downside, since the campus is so small and there are significantly less students than other universities, their athletic department lacks a bit. For example, there is no football team. However, because of the smaller school, students are better integrated and develop strong relationships with their peers. And, all buildings on the campus are within blocks of each other."
Niche User,5,The best school to meet new people and get to know individuals that are pursuing the same career choice as you!
Freshman,5,Milwaukee School of Engineering is an amazing school for those looking to be prepared for the real world with fast paced classes and very helpful professors it is defiantly the school for any aspiring engineer
Niche User,5,"So far, I have been communicating back and forth with some of the staff at MSOE because I want to start there in the fall and they have done nothing but treat mea like I am already apart of their family! They've done nothing but welcome me."
Alum,5,"I graduated from the school of nursing about a year ago. Having been employed in my area of interest for a while, I can honestly say that my professors did a great job at preparing me for what the career requires."
Junior,5,"MSOE is a great place for a math lover, the different engineering programs are challenging, exciting and top ranked across the country. The college is located downtown Milwaukee which gives countless opportunities of entertainment and exploration."
Freshman,5,"Although I have not attended MSOE as a student yet, I have applied and will be a student there next year. The staff and administration have made it so that applying and getting scholarships was easy, and personal. My application adviser has been excellent and ensures that he checks in on how everything is going."
Niche User,5,"t is a very challenging school. If you are looking for easy grades or parties then it is NOT for you. I know people land their career in east coast and west coast so you are not limited in midwest. Again, there is no easy grade so please blame yourself if you dont have a good gpa. In fact, i dont have a good gpa but i was able to get multiple job offers before graduation. I was told by employers and alumnus that employer will take MSOE over UW-Madison quite often. I really appreciate the teachers and people that i met there!"
Freshman,5,"My experience at MSOE University has been more than I imagined. The professors are willing to help with any questions about course material and are very open to helping students during office hours and class time. Being a part of the Women's soccer team has taught me about hard work, and what it means to be a part of a team which will help me in my career choice of nursing. The direct admit nursing program also is also an experience I am so glad to have. It is easy to seek help from other nursing students, as we are already in the program and not competing against one another to be accepted into it. It is also a huge advantage to start clinical a year earlier than schools that do not have direct admission."
Freshman,5,Excellent describes this school the best! Not only does Milwaukee school of Engineering offer great classes but it's also located in a beautiful city with plenty to do.
Freshman,5,I am just starting in the Fall of 2017. But so far everything has been wonderful. Everyone has helped and seems to be friendly. I have not had any problems transferring in.
Freshman,5,"MSOE was the right choice for me. The course load is challenging enough for me but not impossible (I'm a nursing student not an engineer), and leaves me with enough time to get involved on campus with InterVarsity and Theatre Troop and workout six days a week."
Freshman,5,"I am presently in MSOE, I love how friendly the teachers are. It makes the evironment condusive for studies. Similarly, the method of teaching makes me very mych interested in knowing more about my field."
Niche User,5,"I loved speaking with the admissions counselors, as well as the student leading the campus tour. The way that the counselor gave me, what was basically a layout of my classes for the next seven years, which I really loved."
College Sophomore,5,"never had a bad prof, class sizes are very small which is great for the fast paced environment"
College Sophomore,5,"Excellent job placement rate, students prepared for internships"
College Sophomore,5,"I participate in varsity athletics at MSOE and I'm very content, academics obviously still come first but there is school spirit/fan support, facilities are excellent, Kern center is great for those participating in varsity athletics and those just looking to work out"
College Sophomore,5,"Multiple career fairs throughout the year. Every major hosts them and at the sophomore level, theres always opportunities available"
College Junior,5,Campus activities are great for socializing .
College Junior,5,Close to the was as well as downtown .there are also security shuttles available for transportation services.
College Junior,5,Professors prepare you for your future jobs with the experience they have in the field as well as new and up comming technology to make you the best qualified for any company .
College Junior,5,Security is 24/7 always around either walking or driving . The campus indoors or outdoors is always safe.
College Junior,5,The best education for your money and experience. The professionalism needed to land you the job you desire in your field with confidence and expertise.
College Junior,5,"Housing is very close to campus class buildings to the point you really don't need to rush yourself in the morning. It is very convenient for central dining ,shopping,and activities around town also."
College Junior,5,It is very nice and interesting how they help in the community and participate in social networking creating activities during school break hours as well as off days.
College Junior,5,The athletic facility is available for all students on a 24/7 basis . Weather to work out on body building or indoor running or just playing basketball or aerobics everything you need is accessible.
College Junior,5,Its a great melting pot of cultures. Where students help each other to succeed and mentor each other. The policy is no one is left behind . The student atmosphere is wonderful where everyone respects each other. The professors are professional and teach you the newest developments in your field of studies. The professors go that extra mile to help their students succeed. The resources available for each student is great where consulars guide you through the best options that will benefit your success as a professional in your field.
College Sophomore,5,MSOE works hard to maintain their 96% acceptance rate average across all majors.
College Sophomore,5,There is great Greek life for a small engineering school.
College Sophomore,5,"As a member of a Varsity sport, MSOE does respect our work but it is still important that school comes first and I love that."
College Junior,5,Sexual assault doesn't really happen when everyone's too busy for sex.
College Junior,5,"The school really focus on getting students jobs/internships, and it's clear it's a priority for them."
College Junior,5,"Not in Greek life, but friends like it."
College Freshman,5,They are very kind people. Very accomidating though at times tedious to work with everyday. I do have to say i feel very safe in the dorms or classrooms on campus.
College Freshman,5,I very much enjoy this school. It has given me many opertunities that have progessed my learning.
College Freshman,5,There are many career fairs and organizations that bridge the gap between employers and students.
College Freshman,5,I would choose my school again because of how the professors help and guid the students with their previous experience.
College Freshman,5,"I love it here. Great people, good education"
College Sophomore,5,"I would choose Milwaukee School of Engineering again since the school is a good size that you know a lot of people on campus including professors. I also enjoy taking classes that lead to my major starting my freshman year, this gives a early opportunity into deciding if that major is right for me. Finally, I enjoy the student life and activities on campus, and being surrounded by students with similar interests."
College Sophomore,5,I can tell that the hard curriculum is growing my work ethic
College Freshman,5,The financial aid at this school will make things very easy.
College Freshman,5,Downtown is the best place for food variety.
College Sophomore,5,This is hard. Being a ME is very difficult and MSOE expects you to realize this and put in the hard work. You will be challenged and not everyone makes it.
College Sophomore,5,"The majors are hard, anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. But again we are here for the education and the job placement rate in ME is 94% so clearly there is something done right here."

Freshman,4,"There are many online applications available to you through your campus laptop, making the transition to online learning very easy."
Senior,4,"MSOE is a school focused on innovation.  technology is weaved into our culture, and so MSOE makes sure that technology is taught, and handled to the degree that enhances the learning experience.  Of course, at a school where hands on learning is also critical, 100% online learning is just not feasible in the long term."
Freshman,4,"A great school to study mechanical engineering. It has a good location in the downtown Milwaukee. As for professors, most of them a good and know their subject."
Freshman,4,"The online learning experience was good, since most of professors were using Microsoft Teams and were really open to communication even at their personal time. But not all, I have encountered one professor using just emails and it was really frustrating. I wish the university had made it obligatory to use Teams."
Freshman,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, classes were moved to online. It was a big transition and required a lot of self-discipline. Professors did their best to move lectures online with the utilization of Microsoft teams (like zoom calls), blackboard exams/quizzes, and more."
Sophomore,4,Pretty good in terms of academic. High salary once graduated(according to stats). Professors are amazing. Definitely a college for nerds and people who wanna be rich. Don't go here if you just want to party.
Sophomore,4,MSOE has a very strict and inflexible schedule. Lots of work as a first year student but it's manageable. Campus life can be dry but it's what you make of it with your friends.
Freshman,4,"MSOE is a stellar institution as far as academics and return on investment. The instructors are insane and really push you to your limits, however, because of that companies know that they get great candidates from the school. However, the school has much to be gained as far as student life and diversity."
Sophomore,4,"The dorms are old. Food is terrible, very difficult to eat healthy. Some professors are great while others can be terrible. Would definitely ask older students who to take."
Sophomore,4,Very small campus; people are extremely friendly; everything is within close proximity; professors are good and will always be willing to help you
Sophomore,4,So far my experience at MSOE has been great! I am very involved with organizations on campus that are connecting me to people working in my industry.
Sophomore,4,"It's pretty close to other places and its a really nice school. People are friendly and the teachers are superb. Overall, my experience has been great so far. ?"
Freshman,4,Housing and meals are great. Friendly atmosphere. The professors actually are there to teach. The only downside was there were a few mistakes made with my finances.
Freshman,4,I love the city atmosphere and the openness of the campus. There isn't much unity among the students though. It is definitely a school that you attend solely for the academics and maybe athletics but not so much any on campus activities.
Sophomore,4,"Milwaukee School of Engineering provides students with an excellent education. All classes and labs are completely taught by the professors, since there are no teacher assistants. In their first term, students take classes within their major. This helps students discern whether their chosen major is the right fit and provides immediate exposure to material that they will use in their collegiate and post-collegiate careers. By using the trimester system, the school gives its students exposure to a large range of classes and material. If one succeeds at the school, a degree from Milwaukee School of Engineering is highly respected, at least in the surrounding area. The school provides all of the necessary tools to find a quality job before graduating."
Freshman,4,"Non-Liberal Arts school, gets you started in your major right away and guaranteed 4 years (passing every class)
Hard classes but teachers are willing to work with you."
Junior,4,"If you are looking for a challenge, MSOE is the way to go. I never felt challenged in high school, but it is completely the opposite at MSOE. The rare few moments that I am not being pushed to my limit, are spent relaxing and mentally recovering. If you truly are ambitious, then this is a great school, just be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort. "
Junior,4,Good school and tough at times but overall I could not ask for a better experience.  The city life is amazing and there is tons to do in and outside of the campus.  Top notch professors and tons of hands on lab experience.  Athletics are some of the best in the Midwest if not the nation.  You will meet and make many good relationships along the way.
College Sophomore,4,"public safety is always around and willing to help with anything, shuttle will drive students to doctor apts/similar so they don't have to walk"
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are average but good for being in the city, housing is very close to all class buildings, fitness center etc which is great"
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is generally professional/service oriented as far as I can tell
College Sophomore,4,"Great so far, very fast paced due to ""quarters"" system but definitely worth it, feel confident that I will have the necessary skills to enter workforce after graduation"
College Freshman,4,all positive outcomes so far
College Sophomore,4,"Tons of studying. Professors are accessable, and easy to talk to. Plenty of tutoring available too"
College Sophomore,4,"Tons and tons of international students. Lots of religions, ethnicitiecs, ect."
College Sophomore,4,"Never really hear about drug use. Drinking at frat parties and such, but hey, its college."
College Sophomore,4,"Man i love this school. the students are all awesome, the professors are accessible and want to see you succeed. Housing is truly the only downfall"
College Sophomore,4,Public safety on the prowl 24/7
College Sophomore,4,"They put on a lot of school activities, like dances, free food (!!!) and movie nights."
College Sophomore,4,"Its challenging, not gonna lie. But its rewarding too, you make connections that stay with you and meet plenty of people in your field."
College Sophomore,4,Public safety is the best around but with Milwaukee Police usually in the area it is very safe.
College Sophomore,4,There are no TA's and class sizes are within 20 and usually less than 20.
College Sophomore,4,MSOE is difficult but proves to be worth while as it is easy to get a great job after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a wealth of people from all parts of the world with organizations advocating for them
College Sophomore,4,"There are multiple career fairs, internship postings and the online system ""handshake"""
College Junior,4,"Professors were hit or miss, and course variety is pretty low. The nice thing is classes are small and professors have time for 1 on 1 questions in office hours, which is really helpful."
College Junior,4,Kern Center is great for athletes and good for non-athletes.
College Freshman,4,Every thing is clean and tidy. The cleaning staff is very friendly. Also security is extremely nice.
College Sophomore,4,It can be tough and a bit of work at times but it's worth it for the great learning experiences.
College Junior,4,I have made so many great friends and experiences
College Sophomore,4,"The school is a great place, the campus is small but its in downtown Milwaukee, making it easy to walk places. The instructors expect you to put a lot of effort into the courses and the 11 week semester makes it a really fast pace, so you need to be on top of the workload. The professors are all willing to talk to you and are easy to find, even outside of their office hours. The cafeteria food leaves something to be desired and if you can avoid the dorms, the better. All of the dorm buildings need to be upgraded because there are features that are original and the building was built in 1967. The hard work and fast pace pay off, in the end, with all the resources that MSOE provides, and the speed at which you get a career with a six figure salary"
College Sophomore,4,I've liked the opportunity to be involved in clubs that apply what I'm leaning and allowing myself to have a hands on education.
College Freshman,4,"Even with there being a smaller amount of students in sports, they really enjoy them and promote them well."
College Freshman,4,Going out for food is a great idea. There are a lot of good places within walking distance.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of options close to campus, however close to campus options can be expensive."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid office is always helpful and gets back quickly. They answer any and all questions I had. If you don't know, just ask."
College Freshman,4,Many restaurants within 5 blocks of all on campus housing. A little pricy.
College Freshman,4,It's easy to do with the right people.
College Freshman,4,"The food available at skylight is awesome and made to order with snacks, fruits, and a deli available. Roscoe's is a late night snack shop with a subway like sandwich ordering, short order grill, and smoothies. The cafeteria has a nice selection of food and a grill to make burgers and grilled cheese."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are very close to all classes. The atmosphere of the all the people on the floor and in the building general is very inviting.
College Sophomore,4,Milwaukee is a wonderful and very beautiful city in my opinion. There are many things you can do in the city in the moments when you aren't studying.
College Freshman,4,The policies seem fair and I have not had any issues
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of sports options and campus has a nice work out center complete with an ice rink
College Senior,4,"If you have money, there are plenty of places to go find. There's a wide variety within a decent walking distance, and the closer stuff that's fast food is okay. All restaurants are absolutely packed on weekends, especially during Packers/Bears/Badgers/Brewers games."
College Junior,4,The degrees coming out of this school are well respected by employers.  The application process for MSOE is fairly easy and they usually have a couple week maximum response time for acceptance.
College Junior,4,"Many scholarships are available, especially for those who did well in high school.  A lot of scholarships are applied automatically to tuition, meaning there is no application process, but sometimes the scholarships available outside of the initial application for the school are limited."
College Junior,4,Love the mixed different things that MSOE can offer
College Junior,4,Love the mixed different restaurants nearby
Senior,2,"If you like spiritual lobotomies then come to MSOE as a mechanical engineer. You might not graduate in time or at all but you will learn valuable skills such as how to gain more working time from your day and how to move past failure. MSOE provides an immersive engineering experience without distractions such as people of different ethnic backgrounds or genders. MSOE also provides a direct pipeline for candidates to get jobs in the locations of their dreams like Pewaukee, Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, New Berlin, West Milwaukee, and many more! Professors are always willing to help students in their endeavors as well, constantly pushing their students off the cliff of GPA improvement. Professors are also very accommodating for career opportunities, oftentimes assigning large projects and difficult homework assignments during the career fair just to ensure that their students are well prepared for any tough questions their interviewer might ask them. 
All I can say is #MSOE4ME!!!!!"
Senior,2,"Prior to COVID-19, there simply wasn't any online courses available for MSOE. The school intentionally ties its learning environment to in-person laboratory settings to re-enforce the engineering principles being studied. Once the school was forced to go to all online courses during this pandemic, the school has had a bit of a struggle re-adjusting its programs.

In general the classroom experience is should be review on a course/instructor basis. Classes that didn't have a lab section associated with it seemed easier for professors to adapt to and the transition was smoother. Classes that initially had an in-person lab were a bit harder to work around. Some professors were able to make suitable changes to make sure students understood the importance of the lab experiments, but since in most cases, students weren't able to gain hands-on experience with the equipment needed to perform the experiment, skill development  and confidence suffered."
Senior,2,"MSOE is in one word a crucible. The amount of academic pressure to perform is almost completely soul crushing. The school currently has only a 64% graduation rate; and even if you do graduate, you'll most likely be spending 4.5-5 years to finish your degree. 

Currently, the school runs on a 3 term/school year (not including summer). This means that the pace at which course material is cover is expedited; which then falls on the students to understand through aggressive work loads. The trimester system also makes incredibly challenging  to transfer in and out of the school. 

If you're able to obtain an degree from this institution, you'll be rewarded with a great career outlooks and income earnings. MSOE also has a strong alumni program. Many students who graduate from MSOE who moving onto management positions tend to hire other MSOE graduates because there is a reassurance that the individual is determined and passionate about their career field."
College Freshman,2,The housing in the Milwaukee School of Engineering is not that good. There are three dorms; two are very old and another is new but it is very pricey. The older dorms have air conditioning and in the summer it gets way too hot. In the winter the heater is often put up very hi and students are in the need to open up windows. Security is often rude and angry about helping out. The new dorms/towers are beautiful both from the outside and the inside but they are more expensive than living in an apartment.
College Freshman,2,The worst thing about living on campus is the absurd visitor policy. Opposite sex guests are not allowed overnight in the dorms.
College Freshman,2,"The general administration isnt terrible, but there are some issues I have with specific teachers that should probably not be teaching here or anywhere else and the determining of when students schedule can be a large impact on life on campus and the fact that MSOE does not give any perks to commuters makes it difficult to commute and attend schoool"
College Senior,2,"It's nearly impossible to get any events going unless you are part of a big organization. The number of hoops you have to jump through in order to get something done is ridiculous. The administration is made up of a bunch of grumpy, white, old men who are really stubborn. It seems like the entire administration just doesn't care about the student body at all."
College Senior,2,"I would have given a much higher rating, but seeing that my aid inexplicably dropped $6000 this year I'm gonna give them a 2 star rating. They seem to try giving you financial aid when you come in, making it seem cheaper. Once you're in the system though, they aren't really helpful in giving you aid. Now that all financial aid runs through the terrible website, it's difficult to get anything done without going into the office directly."
College Senior,2,"Terrible school spirit, decent teams, and a moderately diverse amount of sports. I'm one person who does the mascot, and the amount of cheering and enthusiasm from the crowd is just pitiful."
College Senior,2,I've never been so busy in my life.
College Junior,2,"Most people do not attend sports games on campus, though the gym/workout facility is quite nice."
College Junior,2,Everyone can find something that fits there needs
College Junior,2,The food is horrible and they reserve the food over and over again untill its gone.
College Sophomore,2,The campus is mostly comprised of socially award nerds and the social atmosphere is bad unless you meet one of the few interverts on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The only reason freshman stay here, is because they don't have a choice."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office isn't very organized and treats every student like they're the same.. i've received tons of emails about scholarship for women or minorities that i can't apply for and it's kinda annoying. They don't really do much... and now they've switched from emails to the school's main website ""the hub"" which is just the least useful website on the internets. "
College Sophomore,2,the school forces you on a meal plan if you live in the dorms and while roscoe's and skylight are good you need to go to the cafeteria on a regular bases which has pretty low quality food. The problem is the school only lets one company serve food so they can charge huge prices for not that good food. 
College Sophomore,2,They're not too strict but there are random little things they care way too much about. Some of the security people are cool but one or two go way overboard and will call you out for things like not showing your card to them perfectly when you walk through the doors. The school puts way too much into security just so parents don't freak out cause they think the city is filled with gangs or something. 
College Sophomore,2,The workload and curriculum are alright but the school's choice of professors can be awful. They only hire people with actual outside of education experience which makes sense but then they don't check if they have any teaching skills at all and won't get rid of teachers who obviously don't know what they're doing. In a school that moves this quickly you can't afford a teacher that bad. Secondly the registration process is awful they say it's supposed to be fair and unbiased but pretty much everybody gets screwed over during registration. Some how the registrar doesn't know how many of what class they need (even though every student is on the same track) so they never make enough sections of classes that fill immediately. 
College Freshman,2,Options limited and people just end up getting drunk.
Alum,1,Was boring and did not provide the life which one could expect of a graduate. Was boring. School should be shutdown.
College Junior,1,"Awful, ancient buildings. The dorms are terrible with almost no places for socializing."
College Senior,1,"If you're in the standard dorms, enjoy the enticing whitewashed prison cinder block walls. You want to interact with people, go right ahead and try, maybe you'll find at least one socially apt person on the entire floor. If you do, befriend them and DO NOT LET GO. If you happen to get in the nicer dorms in the new towers after freshman year, then awesome, enjoy that and christen the apartment by smashing a 6 pack of beer on the floor. If you have the money to live in the nicer housing, then good for you, live it up. The towers are really nice, but a bit overpriced for my taste."
College Senior,1,"Ha, what Greek life? You mean the few fraternities/sororities that are on campus? They're a joke, and have no impact on life at MSOE. Nobody really cares if you're in a Greek society, and those societies don't seem to do much besides the occasional event. But that rock man, whooooooweeee, that's one crazy painted rock."
College Junior,1,The dorms are terrible and are scheduled to be torn down within the next ten years
College Sophomore,1,"If you want to have a member of the opposite sex over, they can only stay over until 1am or 2am on the weekends."
College Sophomore,1,This school is so hard and difficult that most of the students here just stay in and do homework.
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process here is not easy, its rather confusing and misleading. They don't notify the people whose financial aid is not accepted. Then when they email you about financial aid information, they will add within the email ""ignore this email if it does not concern you"" instead of individualizing the process."
College Junior,1,"Minimal at best, even though campus is only 4 blocks wide for the furthest buildings. Shuttle only goes to the campus buildings and then the Amtrak/Greyhound station. Hours for the shuttle start at about 2pm as of this year and only run until about 10pm or earlier, makes it difficult to get picked up or dropped off at the bus station."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus safety officers on the whole are very difficult to deal with.  Some are not bad, however it seems that the majority of them wake up determined to make things difficult for you."
College Freshman,1,"The driving factor for MSOE's lack of diversity is its obsession of money. An understanding of this obsession is important to understanding why MSOE gets a F.

To be clear, this ""money"" has nothing to do with tuition. Instead, this monetary obsession pertains to how MSOE persistently pushes its money-based agenda. This agenda is hard to decribe quickly, but this is what it generally is:

""An engineering degree will land you job faster than any other degree. You won't just get money faster than anyone else, you'll get more of it, too. Your income will be better and so will you.""

MSOE arrogantly prides itself on producing graduates who make more money than graduates from other schools. They put this you'll-be-richer-than-your-friends statistic in brochures, websites, ads, and all their other marketing channels.

This in turn attracts students who care only about is their income in their future jobs. It's the money, and the money only, that drives the majority of students here. And it's this same money that is the source of MSOE's lack of diversity.

The male:female ratio is 4:1. Out of the males, more than 80% are white. These rich white teenagers come to MSOE only because they know they'll be rich in their adult lives.

Their conservative, money-based ideologies flood MSOE and wash over all the other students, making it impossible for diversity to exist.

Homosexuality is shunned, progressive thinking is extinct, and racism is rampant. There is an obvious disdain for lower-income individuals, accompanied by a complete lack of empathy for those who are unfortunate in their lives.

That is why MSOE gets an F in diversity."
College Freshman,1,"There are many hours throughout the day where there are absolutely no places to eat on the entire campus. On top of that, the basic cafeteria food is disgusting, all about quantity over quality, the other two areas to get food are both sub-par at best"
College Freshman,1,"The wifi is absolutely terrible, there is no AC, the cafeteria food is god awful, every different dorm room on any given different floor seems to have a completely different set up inside (some have lots of power outlets, in mine I struggle to find enough plugs for my things even with multiple splitters)"
College Sophomore,1,Seriously Lacking – At school where the guy to girl ratio is outrageous you would think that means there are tons of hot guys. Think again because that's definitely not the case.
College Sophomore,1,Very Boring. Everyone here really don't go out that much. They would rather play video games all day then try and get laid.
College Sophomore,1,Very Gross – The food here is not that good. It tastes like dogfood and ass.
College Junior,1,Guy to Girl Ration – It isn't a good way to set yourself apart from other schools but our guy to girl ratio is one that few schools can challenge. We are about 80% male and 20% female. And that 20% isn't the cream of the crop either.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at MSOE's parking structure feels a bit useless because it is probably a mile away from campus (remembering that MSOE has a very small campus and the parking structure is in the north west part of Milwaukee), so walking is annoying, especially since we have only one ""campus shuttle"" and only are allowed 2 free bus passes a week. MSOE does not take any reliability for car theft, which is understandable, but a friend of mine had gone to the parking structure at night to get her car because the campus shuttle was elsewhere and her car was being broke into. Luckily the guys left and there was almost no damage on the car. Not the best area to be in Milwaukee. I've heard that we are getting a new parking structure closer to campus, but it'll be a few years before that happens."

Junior,5,I have had a positive online experience with Montana Tech. Professors have been really flexible and willing to let students stay home to attend lectures and submit assignments virtually.
Freshman,5,"Online learning has been a big adjustment for everyone. Tech has definitely made the adjustment really easy for students, and our online learning has not been a hinderance on our education. I like that we have been able to keep a lot of our in-person classes, and that our online classes mesh well with in person classes."
Freshman,5,"Montana Tech is a great University! It is an awesome engineering school, and the small community creates an environment where you can get to know you professors and peers well, and truly excel. The community here is inviting and fun, and the professors care that students succeed. Butte is also a really fun town with lots of really interesting history!"
Sophomore,5,"Of course, the pandemic changed the schooling situation significantly from last year. (I'm a sophomore). However, it is still a great experience. Less than half of my classes have been moved to online since new Covid- Learning techniques. Labs are still in person, so the real hands-on opportunity has not changed, with my degree field anyways. 

One of the best upsides of Tech is how hard the administration works to find you a job after graduation. Job fairs, conference meetings, position listings. There are so many resources available to the student body that allow for easy career searching."
Sophomore,5,"The best part of Tech is the small school atmosphere. Professors are overly helpful, and your education feels personal. 

The people are a perfect mix of hicks and nerds. Our game plan is always to study hard, and play even harder. 

Butte itself is an amazing city. The citizens grubby,  cops chill, and the weather mostly cold and sunny. 

The only downsides to Montana Tech are the lack of diversity and good sports. Also, because there is a smaller student population,  big party options are a rarity."
Junior,5,"I love the small class size, and the interdisciplinary focus of many professors here. Undergrad research is common, and the small campus means that you get to know people quickly."
Junior,5,"Montana Tech is a fantastic place to get a degree in STEM.  The classes are small, so you're on a first-name basis with professors.  The faculty & staff have a very obvious passion for providing a safe, interactive, positive learning experience for their students.  The campus is easy to navigate because it is small.  Montana Tech provides a warm, welcoming environment for everyone: from incoming 18 year old freshmen, to non-traditional students."
Junior,5,"Professors have made a very clear effort to make the transition to online learning (COVID-19 related or not) as smooth as possible for their students.  Some professors have had to relearn teaching as a whole to provide a positive online teaching experience, and they are always easy to communicate with."
Junior,5,"Montana Technological University is a wonderful place to attend college. The small class size allows one on one interactions with professors you cannot get at larger schools. The classes are not only small, but intensive, ensuring the material is easy to follow and comprehended well"
Junior,5,"The online learning experience at Montana Tech went smoothly. The professors, not having much time to completely convert their course to online, we’re very understanding and helpful"
Senior,5,What I enjoy most about attending Montana Tech is the sense of community. It’s a smaller college which allows for you to become closer with your fellow class mates as well as your professors. This also makes you feel safer while attending school and gives you a sense of security if you need help from someone.
Senior,5,"I have not taken any online classes. However, when the school sent us home due to COVID-19, they did an excellent job at converting from face to face learning to online."
Junior,5,"Montana Tech is a very hands-on University because it is so small. I enjoy that the professors and students can have one on one time if needed. If I were to change anything, I would have the school put on more community builder events so students can meet each other."
Junior,5,"I took a few classes online. The professors were very good at answering questions via email and phone calls when needed. Overall I did not have a lot of online classes, but the ones I did have were good."
Senior,5,"Good education, good value. Small school, perfect for my son. He major in Petroleum Engineering  and landed him a good job. Teachers were very helpful and he excelled in his full potential. Drawback is small town Butte, can be good for some people. My son was able to focus on school and enjoy outdoors such as fishing, hunting, hiking etc.. very happy with this whole experience. Wow kids actually learning."
Freshman,5,"Excellent college located in the heart of Butte America.  Nationally recognized fields of study that will set you up for success.  Smaller sized classrooms with more teacher/student interactions.  Teachers really care about their students and want to see them succeed.  Many resources available in all areas.  Campus is continually improving and growing.  Many sports, clubs, and events to participate in."
Freshman,5,I love going to Tech. The academics here are unmatched along with its amazing engineering program. The professors are truly passionate about what they tech. There is also an overall feeling for success that the school wants for each student.
Junior,5,Montana Technological University provides a very rewarding experience. As a non-traditional student this university has welcomed me with open arms. I was able to apply and be accepted into a degree program of my choice with ease. I think it is very important for people of all ages to feel welcomed to earn an education they deserve. I have been so successful at Montana Tech I have earned a high GPA which has been so rewarding with scholarships and academic awards throughout the past couple of years. I am proud to say that I am part of the alumni of Montana Technological University.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Montana Tech. The classes are fun, but challenging, and the professors are all nice. The dorms are well kept, and the food is great."
Graduate Student,5,The campus sits above the town giving beautiful views.  Professors were good and open and easy to talk to.
Junior,5,"This is a great school!! Everyone of my professors really care and have given me the extra time and help I need. I am a non-traditional student and mother of three and I feel like the staff at Tech supports and encourages me, even when home life gets busy! I highly recommend this school!!"
Works Here,5,This is a great campus with an amazing faculty. Students will have the best experience at Montana Tech and it will set them up for great life after school as well.
Works Here,5,"Overall, there is nothing short of excellence at Montana Tech. With just over 2,800 students the student to faculty ratio is 15:1. Montana Tech's students connection to staff not only adds to the quality of education received BUT staff will aid students in obtaining internships, job placement after college (91%), and moving on to higher education. Montana Tech's hands on learning and dedicated staff guarantees a quality education no matter your major."
Sophomore,5,I honestly enjoy Mt tech and the area. It's a great school with great academics and great staff. I always felt safe and welcome at my classes and where ever I went on campus.
Senior,5,I love the overall atmosphere of this university. I came here to pursue my collegiate volleyball career two years ago and I have loved it ever since. The people on campus and around town are incredibly friendly and there are a lot of routes to take to get help with classes - considering Montana Tech is a very prestigious/difficult school.
Junior,5,"There is an excellent return on investment at this school.  Housing is cheap, as is tuition.  The school offers excellent programs."
Sophomore,5,Montana Tech is a college for those who love the small town feel and want to have the most fun while being comfortable and getting the most out of your education. Tech allows students a lot of places to sit in peace and work as well as plenty of activities and entertainment for everyone. The sports teams are fantastic and the professors do their very best to ensure your learning will be beneficial to you. You meet a lot of people at Tech that help you get acquainted with your peers and it's easy to find a party on the weekend. If that's not your scene you can just as easily study away in the quiet of your dorm. Montana Tech is a fantastic school and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get a degree that Tech offers.
Graduate Student,5,"Highly recognized school, small campus, great atmosphere, definitely enjoyed obtaining my Bachelor's Degree, and looking forward to continuing my Masters Degree!"
Sophomore,5,"Having been a student who struggled with school in the past, I was hesitant to re-apply for college to reach my goal of becoming a Registered Nurse. At Montana Tech i have had wonderful instructors who have helped restore my confidence in my academic abilities, because of this i have been able to maintain a 4.0 GPA each semester and am loving the chance to  work towards achieving my dreams!"
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, the teachers are well involved, and the students are so fun. The students are well involved in academics and athletics. The classes are not too big, and it is a great learning environment."
College Junior,5,I have multiple job offers already so I'm not too worried about being unemployed after graduation.
College Junior,5,"The fact that my school has a fairly low population, helps to make you feel more welcome. Sometimes I feel like there are more kids that I know than ones that I don't . I am very happy with my school choice."
College Sophomore,5,For the nursing program there is around 99% job placement after graduation
College Sophomore,5,I love our residence halls. In fact I loved them so much I decided to apply to become an RA next year and I got the job. The community aspect is amazing and I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
College Sophomore,5,"If I could do it all over again I wouldn't go to a different school. Academics wise it was a good fit for me and when it comes down to it I have met so many people that have impacted my life in such great ways. There are the few that make dumb choices but overall I have had some good times. Between swing dancing, skiing, friends, and campus activities, there is rarely a dull day."
College Freshman,5,"The academics are some of the best I've ever seen. Very knowledgeable professors, great curriculum, expedient registration, and plenty of study areas. The only downside is that there is typically a huge workload."
College Freshman,5,The campus is extremely safe. Very little crime happens.
College Freshman,5,Almost everyone gets out of the school with a well-paying job.
College Sophomore,5,"I just started here at MT Tech but it is everything I could hope for. I was immediately acknowledged by several of my professors and the department head. Its a nice feeling to feel that you are in the right place, doing the right thing."
College Sophomore,5,Montana Tech alumnus are often sought after.
College Freshman,5,What makes my school unique is the small enrollment number. This small number allows all students to be on a first name basis with the professors. Another reason my school is unique is the fact that the majority of the professors have experience in industry.
College Senior,5,Montana Tech is a hard school as colleges go but that is because there is no wasting time on your degree. When you get to Tech you start off Freshman year with degree applicable courses and it only gets more specific. It is a fabulous school with good professors and a great student to teacher ratio. I don't regret attending Tech for a Mechanical Engineering degree.
College Sophomore,5,It's a very successful school with successful students. Montana tech gives every student the opportunity to succeed in booming industries all  over the world. Montana tech keeps education interesting while being very challenging.
College Freshman,5,"Montana Tech has a 98% job acceptance rate, because it is one of the best engineering schools in the US."
College Freshman,5,"Great variety of majors, some of the best programs in the country."
College Freshman,5,Every administrator in the program will reach out to help anyone who needs it.
College Student,5,There isnt any bad situations at Tech.
College Sophomore,5,Students come from all over the world to earn a degree from Montana Tech
College Sophomore,5,A degree from Tech is very impressive.
College Sophomore,5,Class sizes are small and professors know students by their first names
College Sophomore,5,Butte is an amazing town. The people are nice and the history is amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"Tech has many rentals, varied prices and a lot of choices."
College Sophomore,5,"Butte, MT has a rich, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic history and the restaurants reflect that."
College Sophomore,5,At this school they have so many programs designed and based off of my major to help prepare me and get a job in the field once I graduate
College Freshman,5,"The academics are the only reason you should come here, any other reason and you'll definitely be disappointed."
College Sophomore,5,"The drug scene is not really noticed at all here. It is all about drinking. Butte is a drinking town, and it is very evident on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Montana Tech is mainly an engineering school. It has a huge petroleum engineering influence, as seen by the new petroleum building on campus. There are also geological engineering, mining engineering, and civil and mechanical engineering. The curriculum for engineering is the usual math, science, chemistry, and core engineering classes, then after this each course branches off into more specialized classes for each major. The workload is tough. Chemistry is the weed out class that gets a lot of freshman. The library is usually full of students. The first floor of the library usually full of people talking, and the second floor silent with people working by themselves."
College Student,5,Montana Tech has one of the top Engineering programs in the U.S.
College Sophomore,5,Health and safety are not a concern on campus.  
College Sophomore,5,"I love the old time feel of the campus, set above a historic mining town.  It's a great place to go to school."
Freshman,4,"Amazing Campus, everything is within walking distance - usually won't see this at other Universities. If you love outdoor activities, Butte is a perfect place to go to do these things. The average class size here is 20 so it is perfect to get and know your professor. All of the staff here is amazing, you will feel welcomed."
Freshman,4,Professors are understanding and extremely helpful. If you are struggling your professor will help you the best they can to make sure you are doing well and get it under control.
Junior,4,"Montana Tech is a great school to attend to learn a lot without having to accumulate lots of student loan debt. The surrounding outdoors scene is very fun to explore. Due to the small class sizes, it is easy to get to know your professor on a personal level and to receive academic help. Getting involved in research on campus is usually pretty easy too!"
Junior,4,"All of my professors have used online tools to some degree. My biggest issue was before the beginning of the semester, it was hard to determine which subscriptions were required. I'd recommend waiting until you have a lecture or two, so you can find out if you need the publisher's online system or not. Most have a free trial for the first couple of weeks of class, so you won't miss homework if it's required."
Freshman,4,"Most professors know how to utilize online learning, and provide office hours the same way. Some struggle to use zoom, and others forget to post on Moodle often. It's a balance and depends mostly on the professor."
Freshman,4,"Montana Tech has a wide variety of courses with knowledgeable professors and clubs that develop professional and recreational interests. The campus could get more up-to-date equipment, but you can often find what you need to complete a project."
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere that the campus brings. The campus overlooks Butte and offers a variety of outdoor activities. The campus is smaller, but you get a better sense of community and you feel like you can recognize others. The food here is not the best, but other than that I love everything else about Tech!"
Freshman,4,It is a very STEM centered school. There is a nursing program now though and it is making a huge name for itself in the state. I am looking forward to seeing what the new chancellor will bring! There are a lot of tutoring opportunities and the professors are very approachable. Small class sizes make learning easier and they are one of the top Petroleum Engineering schools in the world!
Sophomore,4,"This is a challenging curriculum.  I would recommend study groups. Find good study friends. Get out and enjoy Butte, but focus on your academics.  Talk to the professors, they are very helpful.  Plan on working hard.  What you new and did in High School is not the same as college.  Show up for classes and tests.  Do not skip or you will miss something very important for the class. Most of all ask questions and do not be afraid to interact with your peers.  They can be a very helpful resource."
Junior,4,"Being an international student, attending at Montana Tech has made it easy to adapt.  The faculty and campus members are very genuine and helpful. Not only that, the professors are sufficient and knowledgeable where I can enhance my knowledge and feel like my money is worth. I really appreciate how Montana Tech is a hands on college, it provides the right experience of what is expected in the industry of interest."
College Junior,4,For the most party professors are very good at what they do. They're interested in their subject so they convey it well to the students.
College Junior,4,Overall it's not bad but there seem to be frequent break ins.
College Junior,4,The dorms aren't too bad. The newer dorm is much nicer but they've been making improvements to the old dorm so that's good.
College Junior,4,Just recently our sports teams have become better and win more games. This of course helps with the involvement of fans. It makes for a great experience at games.
College Sophomore,4,Academics are a large part of tech
College Sophomore,4,There is a large number of exchange students that attend campus
College Sophomore,4,I had an online professor that was out of state and that caused some problems other than that though it was a pretty good experience.
College Sophomore,4,"Being an athlete the facilities are very nice and everything except the varsity locker rooms and sports med room are open to all students, however, I started as a two sport athlete and decided that it would be in my best interest to only continue with one of the two."
College Freshman,4,It is a safe campus.
College Freshman,4,"There's huge diversity, particularly with race. We have many international students and professors."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors are great, however some have impossible to understand accents."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the freedom of the campus. I have difficult classes for the first time in my life. The campus is also very beautiful.
College Student,4,Ive never had any problems on campus. I have a class that dosent get out until after dark and have NEVER felt unsafe walking to my car
College Student,4,It a little over whelming just getting back into good habits for school but if I have any questions the professors are eager to help and break things not understood into what I can understand.
College Student,4,Football and Lacrosse are big here and both teams do very well.
College Sophomore,4,Sometimes they try too hard to weed people out and they do not really care if you pass or fail.
College Sophomore,4,Everything is going really well the campus is beautiful but sometimes I feel like they are trying really hard to weed people out.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at Montana Tech is the friendly atmosphere surrounding the college.  As well as the beautiful landscape that this area consists of.
College Sophomore,4,Montana Tech is a small school and you get to know a lot of people that way. The classes are smaller so the teacher is able to give one on one time and knows who each student is specifically. The school is prestigious and they want to see everyone succeed so they are accommodating to needs.
College Sophomore,4,My school is perfect for the degree that I am pursuing - Software Engineering. The campus is pretty good and accessible. It would be nice if it were a little larger with more hang out places on campus. And definitely better if more females went there as the male to female ratio is terrible!
College Sophomore,4,"A large variety of restaurants and fast food places accept a ""digger discount"" with proof of your student ID"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very concerned with your education. Some tend to have a higher education
College Sophomore,4,"A huge activity at Montana Tech is an even called Mulletfest. It is a co-ed softball tournament open to anyone. Softball is played in the snow for a chance to win $1,000. Butte gets really lively for this event every March."
College Sophomore,4,Tech consists of two dorm buildings. They provide a social atmosphere with several activities around campus to participate in.
College Freshman,4,"Much of the housing is older, but it is affordable and close to campus."
College Freshman,4,It's a nice small campus with plenty of options and opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not had one yet but within the next year I should. I know most places are great, they hire students after, they are friendly and knowledgeable. It is a great stepping stone to a job after college!"
College Sophomore,4,It is strict enough to keep everyone very safe.
College Sophomore,4,"The surrounding area is pretty and you can do things for cheap like hike, a couple lakes are close."
College Sophomore,4,"I think it is very safe. Although, I have never heard of anything from administration about sexual assault."
College Sophomore,4,It is cheaper than living on campus if you have roommates generally.
College Freshman,4,There are very many houses and apartments around campus at very low prices.
College Freshman,4,"The varsity teams are not very good, however, Montana Tech offers many intramural sports that one can take part in."
College Student,4,There are many intermeral activities and clubs and sports offered.
College Student,4,I feel safe at school.
College Student,4,Everyone has a cadual presence.
College Student,4,Getting into my program was simple.
College Sophomore,4,Tech athletes are supported by the school and the community.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are great and the class sizes are small.
College Sophomore,4,Administration is involved in everything.
College Sophomore,4,You work hard but you meet the right people and you learn alot
College Sophomore,4,If you like bars Butte is the place for you. This city has an insane amount of bars. and St Patricks day is an absolute blast
College Sophomore,4,Coming from a big city and moving to Butte I thought the housing was very affordable and it isn't hard to find a place close to the campus.
College Freshman,4,"I'm an incoming freshman so I haven't experienced the academics yet, but I've heard it's a great school with helpful teachers."
College Freshman,4,"I can't complete my major at the college of technology, but I'm interested in teaching math and the math classes they have are challenging and take me in the right direction."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are the only reason to come to this school, and be ready to work incredibly hard."
College Freshman,4,"The RAs are super chill and I'm pretty sure the only reason campus PD is there is to give out parking tickets, which they will do if you spend 21 minutes in the 20 minute parking spots."
College Freshman,4,"Definitely preferential to drinkers, the only places to go if you're underage are the mall and bowling alley."
College Freshman,4,The professors are all very knowledgable and have extensive experience in their fields. The main weed out course for all the engineers here is chemistry which is a full class and the teachers can be hard to get help from.
College Freshman,4,"Everything is super cheap and for the most part well taken care of even if it doesn't look like it on the outside, a lot of places are from the early 1900s and many can be purchased for less than $100k. Rent is pretty reasonable as well, the fully loaded high end apartments go for around $950 for a 2 bed with a balcony."
College Sophomore,2,Our financial aid director is not a pleasant individual and does not get back to anyone in a timely (weeks) manner if at all.
College Freshman,2,"Butte, Montana is a very small, rundown town. It was once one of the most populated areas in Montana, but once everybody left, the town went with them."
College Freshman,2,"The newer residence hall, Centennial, is gorgeous and has a ton of amenities. Prospector on the other hand has had it's capacity doubled since it was built and space is tight, beds are terrible and the bathrooms have pool showers on the first two floors with no privacy whatsoever."
College Freshman,2,"The city bus is free for students, but only comes once an hour and doesn't run on the weekends. Combined with the fact that the cafeteria doesn't open until noon on the weekend, not having a car was a terrible experience."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty frequent thunderstorms in the fall are kind if cool, but winter comes early and there's usually a negative streak in November or December with little to no snow."
College Sophomore,2,There is so much racist people there. Its terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Ya know, if I knew what I know now, then. I would not have transferred to Tech from Western. I have been told so many different things about this whole agreement between these two school. I am now worried I will not be able to get my degree because I might run out of financial aid. I think its bullcrap and I wish there were better people up at Tech that knew what they were talking about. I would NEVER do this again. I would not even recommend it to anyone."
College Sophomore,2,DO NOT GO TO TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AT ONCE. IT IS ALL SCREWED UP. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
College Freshman,2,"The ""college atmosphere"" at Tech is nonexistent. Parties can be found but they are very rare. Being an engineering school, a lot of students are more concerned with hunkering over their chemistry book than enjoying they're Friday night. There are a couple bars in town that can be fun but it really depends on the day. If you are interested in enjoying a nightlife while in college, Tech is not the place to be."
College Freshman,2,"The first couple football games of the year are usually very fun. There's lot of people and the student section is full. But after about the third game, they die down to about five students. And nobody goes to any other games."
College Freshman,2,"People in Butte do not make enough money to go out to eat a lot. Consequently, there are about four decent restaurants in town, the rest are all either bar style food or burger joints."
College Freshman,2,Butte is one of the sunniest cities in the country... but sunny doesn't always mean warm. In the winters prepare for weeks of straight -40 degree(F) days and plenty of snow.
College Senior,2,"Really, there's not anything beyond the student union cafeteria. Beyond a salad bar and daily grill specials as well as one or two featured menu offerings, there's a grill/deli. However, there are options off campus that are very close by so find food off campus is not inconvenient."
College Junior,2,"parking sucks, and so does the parking enforcment and the cost."
College Junior,2,"old, and distant places for students to live."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are a lot of old houses in Butte Montana.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's pretty average. Nothing to exciting or diverse
Recent Alumnus,2,winters are very cold at montana tech and spring is usually rainy summers can be very hot too/
College Junior,2,"I have heard there are quite a few scholarships for students and i know a few people who have recieved them, but i myself have yet to recieve any scholarships."
College Junior,2,"Campus housing is just about equal to any apartment found here in Butte, Montana, except for the fact that just about everything is under the Historical Preservations Act(dorms, family housing, apartments, and homes), and can barely be kept up without lots of permits through the city. Don't get me wrong, the dorms are livable but there are few alternatives that cost less than a $1000 a month(including utilities, internet, and accessibility (for those with a disability). Dorms and family housing are highly limited and priority is given to international students and families."
Niche User,1,Online? oh please! theres no wifi in montana! Even if there was there is no way in hell the students could figure out how to use a web browser.
Niche User,1,"Montana Theft University, that pretty much sums up the whole town and the college kids. Oh and the law enforcement wont do anything to help you. Good luck getting a job a**holes!"
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,There is no public transportation at all. There is one bus that runs during the day but stops at about four in the afternoon. Even if you want a cab you're out of luck unless it's before seven.
College Sophomore,1,there is no greek life
College Junior,1,"Butte is an old mining town that has seen better days. The atmosphere is all about the hardworking community that has very little entertainment besides the bars, and the occasional bands that perform. 

There is a mall, but closer related to a mini-mall or strip-mall. Wal-Mart is the biggest store in town with the best deals on anything- quite literally. They also are they only ones with the best variety of anything in town. 

The school itself is divided between the 2 year College (Highlands College) and the University (Montana Tech). Highlands is an extension of Montana Tech which is a child of the University of Montana. There is a lot of unnecessary rivalry that happens between them. They are currently 7 miles apart from one-another.

There is the Mineral Museum and the Mining Museum that Montana Tech hosts on campus. They are fairly decent to go see. Again, not much else to do in Butte but go to the bars."
College Freshman,1,"Everyday, the weather is different. We have wind, snow, rain, sun pretty much anything. One minute it can go from a beautiful cloudless day, to a dark snowy day. Living in Butte, one has to live on their toes when it comes to the weather. Be prepared for anything."
College Freshman,1,"There aren't too many different people here. Most people are from Montana and are white males. It's an engineering school, so it has a high number of males."
College Senior,1,"Parking is decent if you get there at 6 in the morning. The school sells considerably more parking decals than it has spots available and there is limited off campus parking that can be used due to city parking ordinances. If you have a 10 o'clock class and think you are gonna just drive up and get a spot, you are mistaken."
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are not cheap but if you get caught without one on your vehicle its a $20 fine which has to be paid within 7 days and having a parking fine means a hold on a students account and until paid the hold doesnt come off the account. Which means a student cant register for classes, add/drop a course, gets fined everytime you park."
College Junior,1,Tobacco Use on Campus – The campus has strict rules regarding smoking and tobacco usage on Campus. They dont allow smoking within 50 ft from the buildings

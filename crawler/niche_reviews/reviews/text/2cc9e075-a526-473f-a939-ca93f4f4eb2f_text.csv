I am 17 years old and I go to a charter school in Gardena. I was accepted to Talladega during a HBCU event, on the spot. It was the first college that accepted me.

We consider ourselves one big happy family which is very nice when you are coming to get a HBCU experience.I love that the classes are a good size and if you was to ever need help in any class somebody is always there to help you. There’s a few things that could change about Talladega . We need a football team very bad we have other sports but if we have a football team it will bring a lot of publicity and many future Talladega family. Its a small campus and really nothing around it so if the school was to put more to do around there that would be great! But so far I love my HBCU.I’m very proud to attend a wonderful HBCU .

Sophomore,5,"What I like about Talladega College is that it is small, so everyone is pretty much family. I would love to see the café food enhance and also the dormitory conditions."

I wanna get better in every area I lack in on and off the court. I wanna do whatever it takes to earn an degree to make my family proud."
Freshman,4,Talladega is a pretty good school. Most of the teachers are willing to work with you to make sure you get the work that you possibly missed. Some teachers are willing to sit down and talk to and possibly help you with things that could be going on. The café food could be way better then what it is. There isn't a lot of parties and their could be more student participation on certain events.
Freshman,4,I honestly cannot complain too much because they have built a new dormitory and a new student resource center is being built but my room is a little on the small side and our central tempertaure control for the building needs to be either properly fixed or replaced.
Senior,4,You truly feeling you are home. Everyone is extremely helpful and it’s an experience I am proud to be affiliated with.

College Freshman,4,We dont have safety issues. The schools is in a very small town and the college campus is s3cure and inclosed.

College Freshman,4,Souther schools are known for sports. Football season is huge on campus.
College Senior,4,I haven't started looking for internships but I have seen my peers get help.
College Sophomore,4,Our school is filled with people who don't speak English. They are pretty rude sometimes because majority of them are there for baseball. They think they run the school.
College Sophomore,4,Although becoming a part of greek life can be difficult it can be very rewarding.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is the biggest attraction on campus. Everyone gets together to see what the Greek community are up to when they throw events.
College Junior,4,Nothing bad ever really happens on campus. Not gated like I believe that it should but other than your occasional fight. Its pretty safe.
College Junior,4,Most of the professors at this school are pretty great. They love their jobs and want to see you succeed. Class sizes are fairly small being that its a small school. For instance im in a class with only 3 people in right now. Only down fall is the variety in classes. You course catalog is guaranteed to have classes that you need to have to complete your program that the school doesnt even offer.

College Junior,4,I am a Computer Science at Talladega College the mathematics and science does a great job of preparing students for graduate school but there are only a hand full of teachers If we had more teachers in this department Talladega College mathematics and science department will be a prominent Mathe and Science depratment but with the staff we do have they still do an outstanding job.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a big deal here on Talladega since it is one of the times were the student body collective gather to cheer on their fellow Tornades. Midnight Madness is always a fun event to attend since it introduces both the male and female basketball team to the students. Plus there are other activities that occur. However, the only downside is that there is no football team."
College Sophomore,4,I can not blame the teachers but if you do what you have to do its easy to get your work done
Freshman,2,"They put there money in the wrong places, bathroom showers are molded, they make us pay to wash and we have to go walk a whole block and a half to get to the building. The wash room isn’t open yet and it’s been 4 weeks now. Refund checks still haven’t been dispersed. Hard to reach financial aid directors,etc ."
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much help on this campus.
College Sophomore,2,Very old dorms that are not safe nor clean
College Senior,2,"The sports are cool, its something to look forward to"
College Senior,2,"The food is the worse, the dorm rooms including bathrooms are in terrible condition. The only thing good that i can say is that the classes are small and when the school hosts events they are entertaining..but only when there are events. Any other day you'll be dying of boredom"
College Senior,2,"Some professors are okay and really care for their students but most done, the registration progress in school is a total chaos"
College Senior,2,Talladega college rarely have contacts to help you get a job or an internship.
College Senior,2,I really don't know because I'm not into that kind of stuffs because I don't think it's worth joining them. It's dumb
College Senior,2,"The only reason I went to talladega college was because they gave me a scholarship for soccer but then coaches started getting fired and they took our scholarships away, playing with out education and financial future, if I could do it all over again, this would be my last option ."

College Freshman,2,i dont ever know when one is
College Freshman,2,the town is really boring with nothing to do. the only way to ensure you're going to have fun is if you have a car and go to neighboring cities
College Junior,2,"Living on campus is horrible. The female dorms have roaches, and spiders. The bathroom are atrocious, and the resident assistants do not put in work orders in a timely fashion so things such as air conditioning, cable, and electrical plugs can be fixed. The wash rooms look like a dungeon, and the toilets are always over flowing."
College Sophomore,2,So many fights and shootings make me feel unsafe on campus
College Junior,2,They need to update equipment and space
College Senior,2,"We have campus transportation, but it runs rarely. "

College Freshman,1,There are not a lot of places to choose to eat from in Talladega.
College Freshman,1,"Mainly everybody at Talladega is African american but there are a fewm students from Ghana and Puerto Rico. It's kind of depressing because everybody does and likes the same thing, the diversity could be a lot better than what it is."
College Freshman,1,"Talladega college can be fun at times but sometimes it can be a pain. The student center is always full and the advisors are not always there to help you when there's an issue. Students are are always complaining because of the lack of organization from the school. Besides that, there are fast food joints, different places to study, and a place called the upper lounge where students go to play games, watch TV and just hangout. There are tons of organizations to join and lots of events but there are hardly any activities."
College Junior,1,not much to choose from within 10 miles of school.
College Senior,1,"Clubs Are Stupid to Go to – Nightlife is for students who are 21 or older. There are a few 18-and-older clubs, but I say skip the clubs. House parties are free, the music is better, and you don't have to pay for a cab back to campus."
College Freshman,1,"The cost of the tutition is fairly high here. I mean the finical aid office helps but at the same time, it feels like we are paying way too much."
College Freshman,1,"Wireless Network – The wireless network is horrible. It only work in certain areas of the campus. It doesnt make any sense because if im trying to do research in my room, i can't because the internet isn't working."
College Student,1,Fastweb.. Really? They really don't have scholarships to offer. They started telling us to go to Fastweb.
College Student,1,Most of the parking lots are filled with pot holes and are just crowded to the point where people park in the dirt.

College Junior,1,It storms and floods a lot but classes will not canceled.

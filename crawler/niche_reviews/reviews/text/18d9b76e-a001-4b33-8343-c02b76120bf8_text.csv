Freshman,5,"I love UNM like my own home. The campus felt comfortable immediately, and Albuquerque is a beautiful and diverse city. Public transportation is easily accessible thanks to a deal between the City of Albuquerque and the University of New Mexico. The teachers are well-mannered and are easily some of the greatest mentors I have had so far. The housing options expand beyond traditional dorms, and I loved living in their on-campus American Campus community, Casas del Rio."
Junior,5,"Even though it's online, they make sure that you are doing your work and you're focus because they have proctored tests."
Junior,5,My experience with the University of New Mexico is great. The teachers are great and they really make sure that you're learning.
Junior,5,I love the diversity and the different activities offered at UNM.  The campus isn't in the best area of Albuquerque but there are so many enjoyable places outside of the University as well.
Freshman,5,"Covid-19 has been hard on everyone especially the teachers switching their lectures from in-person to online and I honestly think my professors have been doing great and I am very thankful for them putting the extra work to making online classes still fun, productive,  entertaining, and most importantly very knowledgable."
Freshman,5,"With COVID-19 things have been very limited but the University of New Mexico has done very well to implement different regulations to keep everyone safe but also keeping things fun. There's a lot of activities still going on around campus and online especially for incoming freshman. Even though it's been hard, freshmen can still walk around campus and get to know not only the university but the rest of the scholars here. Everything has been very safe and clean."
Freshman,5,"I like the diverse community here on campus. Everyone trying to meet one another and make new friends. The campus also likes to get involved with the students. Planning social distancing and virtual events for the students which is what I like. Later in the years while staying at UNM, there could be a change of high price markets here on campus. Us college students are already paying a lot for school, we should get lower prices on things we need on campus, such as; food or personal items."
Junior,5,Right now its excellent! Teachers are good at Zoom and always respond to email quickly. You can always count on the teachers to be here for you.
Junior,5,"The teachers are the best! everything is always organized and they are always excepting of all kinds. I always felt excepted at UNM, will recommend to anybody!"
Graduate Student,5,I have several online courses at the University of New Mexico. I can join them easily and learn new stuff. I enjoy online courses.
Graduate Student,5,I came here in Fall 2019. I have passed several courses. I really like this University. Its campus is great.
Sophomore,5,"The University of New Mexico has been such a brilliant experience. Attending this college has helped me become more independent and learn incredible things not only in class, but also about myself. They provide tons of resources and I can't imagine a University suiting me better than this one!"
Graduate Student,5,Most of the online teachers are organized With deadlines and assignments. They are also willing to help you succeed in their class.
Senior,5,I loved the online learning experience. Instructors and tutors are always there to help you succeed.
Freshman,5,Online learning is the right amount of challenge. It’s easy to navigate through canvas and find everything you need in order to complete a course. IT is always ready to help with any issues you may encounter. Professors make it as simple as possible so you can learn as much as possible without having to struggle to find the material.
Freshman,5,"Love the environment and how helpful and friendly the staff and professors are. It’s a safe campus, with plenty of diversity."
Junior,5,"I take one to two online classes each semester at UNM. It is easier for me and my specific program and class loads to take one class a semester online. There is an online option for almost all courses offered, except labs and specific program classes. The nice thing about most online classes at UNM is you're given the entire week to work at your own pace. I've also only had two courses that have proctored quizzes and exams, which is nice because not being proctored takes away stress. Overall I haven't had any negative experiences with an online class yet."
Graduate Student,5,The professors were able to pivot quickly to an appropriate online classroom environment to handle today's restrictions.  Online platforms work well and structure ensures a continuing collaborative learning environment.
Graduate Student,5,"Dedicated, smart, diverse professors who care about putting out good students and ensuring UNM is considered a top school.  The Anderson Business School has solid MBA/EMBA programs that prepare future business leaders for the reality of the marketplace and leading organizations.  Campus is beautiful, in a great location, and you can't beat the unique New Mexico cuisine.  Athletics are good, but they just don't have the fan base and experience of a midwest school.  Still quality sports though."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing campus experience! Great studies, online studies as well. University of New Mexico is wholesome."
Sophomore,5,"I took many classes online, and it is a great experience! I enjoy taking online classes, as my work schedule changes."
Freshman,5,"The University of New Mexico so far has provided me with top grade education. They have helped me to register for classes in a very easy way. They helped me figure out which major I was going into and which college would offer me the best outcome. I believe that student and advisor communication is very important. They provide you with ways to make appointments with your advisor and talk out your future. They also provide you with many ways in which you can achieve your goals. UNM has helped me with aspects of living, educations, jobs, and extra curricular activities. I now know which classes I will be taking and I am assured that I am taking the correct path. This college also helped show how to pay for it. I think as students we go into college not knowing how to afford it, but UNM teaches you about how you can. I truly believe that UNM has been an amazing experience this far."
Freshman,5,UNM learning experience is amazing. They provide you with all the tools you need in order to become successful. I think they have advisors and professors that are truly there to help you 100% of the way.
Senior,5,"I took several classes online during the COVID-19 pandemic, and found the workload manageable and informative."
Freshman,5,The website is very helpful and I know when certain events are happening. I haven't had to do online school at the University of New Mexico but I heard from others it is harder than going on campus but they have adjusted and are used to it now.
Freshman,5,"I haven't attended the University of New Mexico yet. I am enrolling in fall of 2020. My brother goes to the University of New Mexico and he says that he has a great experience. The sports events are great to go to and are very fun. The academics are good, the professors are engaged and helpful."
Sophomore,5,I haven't taken an online class yet. But from what I heard it was great. Like I said I haven't taken an online class but I will be taking one this semester.
Senior,5,"Top engineering and STEM majors experience for sure. It's easy to go around on campus, and the tuition is affordable for both undergraduate and graduate students.
Great researching place to go if you are in Physics , the national lab would help a lot since it's located in Albuquerque. The town is also easy to get around if you come to new mexico, downtown is close and same as uptown.
Beautiful environment on campus for sure, spring time is beautiful and all sorts of activities are happening all year round."
Sophomore,5,"University of New Mexico environment very good as I see now. Most of the professors very nice, ready to help students, especially English teachers here, they inspirit students to work forward and get the graduate. They teach writing but also give us advice on how to be a success in college."
Niche User,5,"Although I haven't yet attended UNM, I went to visit and it is a beautiful place where it seems that everyone is united into a big and trusting community. I am excited to start classes there in the Fall semester."
Junior,5,"I like the teaching styles here. Even though the classes are large, the professors find the time to answer every ones questions."
Niche User,5,It is very nice. Great people and staff. Teachers are always there to help. Dorms are very nice too.  Very nice experience.
Freshman,5,"Most of my admiration for this college comes from it's unique culture and diversity. There are programs, resources and clubs for everyone. I am a Freshman and I can already tell that this University will give me everything I need to thrive as a person and be successful in my career."
Senior,5,I love the attitude of every professor or teacher I have had in the last three years. They all have a passion for what they teach and not one of them was difficult to approach with questions. They do a really great job making learning fun and interesting!
Niche User,5,"I have gone on college tours and have experience the college live at UNM. Also have seen their very unique facilities and have learn all of their great resources that they other at the university to help students with their academics. It also overs many classes that a student can take as en elective or to just have fun. The university also offers free tickets to the students to all the sport events which is really cool to have to be able to get into the school spirit. Also the campus host many events including fine arts, health, and community outreach. The thing that did get my attention about the university was the diversity in culture and learning style."
Freshman,5,"I was really scared to start at UNM because it was so big and intimidating. Ever since I was little I was always drawn to be a lobo, never figured it out tho, probably because I grew up with it in my town. But since ive started! I’ve loved every second of it!"
Freshman,5,I like the beautiful campus. The professors are great they really interact with their students to help them learn. The school has great and varied courses. I enjoy getting involved the school has some great vibes. The energy is awesome. I love this school and made a great choice.
Niche User,5,"What I liked about UNM is all the choices we are given, the opportunity’s and the people. At UNM they give so much choices of study and they give everyone a opportunity to study regardless of their ethnicity and financial aid. The people at UNM are also really nice and help every student out for example I was helped by the people at the centro de la raza for my FAFSA and not everyone likes to take their time to help everyone of their students and up coming students to do such things. Overall in my opinion UNM is one of the best college choices me as a student can choose."
Niche User,5,Big campus and is in a good city. It isn't very far from home and might become free for residents. There is support just as any other college would have and they offer the New Mexico lottery scolarship.
Sophomore,5,I like that the University of New Mexico is a place where everyone is accepted and treated like family.
Junior,5,"Overall, UNM is very diverse. The student life is very much improved if you go out and get involved with school activities. Its truly all about not being afraid to talk to others and get information on things you're interested."
Freshman,5,MY first semester was rough to find ways to pay for my bill but I was given help. The campus is great and the opportunities are endless here.
Niche User,5,The University of New Mexico is a great university it is full with many good majors and programs. It is surrounded with great attractions of Albuquerque to explore on free time and it has great activities for students to enjoy when they aren't focusing on their academics. It isn't too far from many things and the campus offers transportation for students com ing from far parking lots.
Junior,5,"Since I have started attending the university of new mexico I have loved it. It has been a great experience so far. There are many events and opportunities around UNM where you can fill most of your time with fun activities! Most of the teachers I have come across have been very helpful, and insightful. Many of the professors are very dedicated to their work inside and out of the class room, for UNM is a great place for conducting research in many fields. Many come from all around the globe to attend UNM for its educational recognition. UNM has opened my eyes to a new world, and has given me hope for a bright future."
Alum,5,UNM was a great learning and growing environment. It's diversity and affordability gave me some of my greatest experiences in life. Not only is the university great but the nursing school is top notch. UNM truly prepares its students for their best life.
Senior,5,"UNM and ABQ treat me so well.  I love it here, so diverse and unique.  The campus is gorgeous, night life can be really fun.  The Sandias are so beautiful and you can see them everywhere on campus.  The only thing I don't like is the Spring Winds.  And it's debatable that the chill factor there i.e. ""Land Of Manaña"" is good or bad.  It's a love/hate relationship."
Junior,5,"I liked a lot of things about the University of New Mexico, it has a great student life with a large emphasis on student safety, as well as a focus on the education and academics of the campus with a lot of focus on study clubs and tutor departments. I like the environment around campus and how nice all the students and staff are to one another as well as how great the entertainment is at the Student Union Building and the quality of the food they serve there. They also have a lot of fun student events as well as public events that help everyone to have a good time, like the superhero day or harry potter day as well as the annual Halloween pumpkin carving contest."
Niche User,5,I went there this summer for college advantage camp. Very pretty and they have good programs. My Nina goes there and she says that the school is really good.
Niche User,5,UNM is a special place where all kids go to learn. It is a place that is welcoming and warm. I just am so thankfu that i am apart of UNM and I cant wait to attend the school. Im so glad that I am able to share my college experience with UNM
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful, everyone is so nice, and I have had some excellent professors. The campus is clean and busy with students, I love being on the campus, especially the duck pond. It's so relaxing to hang out there on the grass and work on homework."
Senior,5,Currently attending and having a great time! I didn't know what to do with my life until I found UNM. Now I'm a perfect citizen and do no wrong! I have so many job offers it is incredible!
Freshman,5,"The University of New Mexico welcomes students with open arms and are always there for students who have questions. With lovely staff and students who are enthusiastic about education, The University of New Mexico is the place to be if you want a school that prides itself on diversity and building connections with people."
Sophomore,5,I love the school! It's an urban campus which is not some peoples vibe but I enjoy it. The school is really beautiful and made mostly of Adobe buildings. The people are nice and the professors are always available. We also have free tutoring for all students which is extremely useful for broke college students. It's also a leading university and very cheap!
Freshman,5,The process to check into the dorms was amazing. They have such wonderful activities for people to feel welcome and part of the university community. There is a lot of information about classes available before starting.
Senior,5,"I love UNM. My instructors have all been encouraging and inspirational. I am a Fine Arts student, so most of my classes have been studio art courses. In each class I have been encouraged to follow my passions and create art that is important to me. All of my peers and professors have given positive constructive criticism that has enabled me to develop my art and artistic skills. I have enjoyed almost every one of my courses and look forward to attending school 90% of the time."
Freshman,5,"What I love about the University of New Mexico is that I feel welcomed and the professors put what they're teaching into a students prospective, so it makes it easier to comprehend."
Junior,5,The main thing to remember at UNM is it is a school filled with professors who want you to succeed and will try their best to help make that happen.
Junior,5,The University of New Mexico has given me many friendships and mentors. The faculty truly cares about your success during and after graduation. If you're looking for a big city with a small town feeling I recommend UNM.
Junior,5,The University of New Mexico is an amazing school with dedicated and talented faculty. All my peers are eager to learn and excited to be in high education while the professors are helpful and smart and teach the most interesting classes. This university has been a perfect fit for me.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy college I am the first person in my family to go to college right after high school. I have grown so much from being at UNM with joining a sorority, volunteering three nights a week and overcoming my learning disability. At first, I never wanted to go into college in the same state with that I grew up in with that being said I have grown so much as a person due to college and being involved on campus. I am really glad that I grew so much in the short time period. I do not really have any negative experiences in college, I take advantage of the counseling, the small community and how much pride the students and alumni take with them everywhere they go."
Freshman,4,"I began learning online for the most part at UNM when COVID-19 precautions first began. Otherwise, I had one class that was online before COVID-19. My original online class was very helpful, and I learned a lot. My needs were catered to more than some other classes I have taken and that was because the online aspect of the class helped me manage my schedule better. The online classes post-COVID-19 precautions were a bit hectic at times like many others at different colleges, but overall they were helpful, the teachers were understanding and patient, and I made it through the semester."
Sophomore,4,I did take classes online and it seemed like being online required more work than doing face to face.
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience with the University of New Mexico. When ever I need a question answered I just have to make sure that I push for it and don't stop till I get help since there are so many other students you have to make sure you are heard.
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience with the University of New Mexico is actually really good. Four out five of my classes have zoom meeting times, but all five are online. With that, I have lacked motivation because I have always disliked learning online, but my instructors try to be encouraging and help as well as they can. On top of being encouraging and helping, they are also, in my opinion, doing a good job at teaching their material over zoom. I am definitely learning the information they are teaching. I have developed more respect for my instructors, because we are all struggling with schooling during this pandemic."
Freshman,4,"So far, as a new college freshman on campus, I have enjoyed it despite the current pandemic. I like to get out and walk around for a bit, because the campus is so beautiful. The one thing though is I have not made any new friends because I have been nervous to approach anyone because of Covid-19. I think my physical experience will get better if this pandemic calms down. As for the academics, I am actually learning material from my instructors. I would rate every one of my instructors that I have this term a 10/10."
Graduate Student,4,"Good community. Bad neighborhood. It depends what degree you go for, but the engineering and nursing program is good!"
Junior,4,Each class varies with the online format.  It depends on the teacher how they present their information.  Most do lecture videos.  It is based on Blackboard.
Junior,4,"I like the student life of UNM. Some degree programs are a little bit challenging on the administrative side, but if you're willing to put in that work it is very rewarding. Campus is a fun place to be even outside of class."
Junior,4,"I love the diversity of the campus. I've met so many different people with different perspectives, and there are classes offered that are quite unique to our geographic location: history of New Mexico, Native American studies, Chicano/a studies, Latin American history and Native American language studies. I would however like to see UNM be less for-profit."
Junior,4,"I've taken several online classes, what I like is that I am able to take it at my own pace, as a low-income student working two jobs, that kind of flexibility with a full time schedule is incredible."
Sophomore,4,"No doubt, online learning can be a hassle. It comes with its own challenges and tribulations. However, UNM provides the help and assistance its students need to overcome these difficult situations. The professors are quick with replying to emails to answer questions you may have and give thorough instruction."
Graduate Student,4,I liked that the classes have a very flexible schedule. Advisors are always available for students and there explain everything well. Also the tuition  is not too high and they give different payments options to pay it.
Senior,4,This university is affordable but be careful with alllll the hidden fees and such. Sports is a priority. Though there are an array of resources there to help students succeed.
Senior,4,It's a great school and there are several scholarship opportunities and work study. Tutors are great at supporting students.
Junior,4,I've taken some online classes. Most are easy and make it so you learn more at your own pace. I would suggest taking some.
Graduate Student,4,"The schooling is pretty easy if you can get connected to resources! Since most teachers are lazy and reuse their old tests and materials, if you find a friend who have taken the class, ask for their old stuff. Or purchase a course hero account. Easy A."
Graduate Student,4,"I'm now a graduate student and did my undergrad here at UNM. I wish I utilized more of their resources because they offer so many! Food drives, GYM, free pizza and snacks, and lots of clubs and events! The people here are pretty nice and the teachers are a hit or miss. The school is in the prime location of ABQ so there are alot of things to do around."
Graduate Student,4,I had an overall good experience because I was involved in student groups. The leadership at the university and the curriculum could be a little stronger
Sophomore,4,My Experience with UNM has been overall good! The professors have been great to get along with and the environment is great for learning.
Junior,4,"My experience so far at UNM has been very good. There are a lot of different programs and majors for students to choose from.  The only minor issue I've run into is that some of the advisors are not very reliable, and has set a few of my fellow classmates back in their graduation requirements. Other than the advisement issue, UNM is very diverse and there are a lot of student organizations for all ethnicities and cultures. The professors are also pretty good, out of my three years at this school I've only had one bad professor. Overall, a pretty good school with a lot of activities and degrees to choose from!"
Junior,4,Now that the virus has hit and we can no longer be in classrooms most of the teachers have adjusted to it well with being able to post and help with any assignments. Although some teachers had to have some time to adjust just as much as the students but so far it has been great!
Junior,4,"Most of the staff is very helpful, not just teachers but advisors and anyone else around campus. I just received a certificate in CNA and it was hard but worth it, it was very beneficial to have great teachers and a wonderful sim lab."
Sophomore,4,I think that the university has some great teachers and you can gain excellent experiences and advice from teachers. unfortunately the chemistry department and classes are not good and I would not recommend them. One thing that I would like to see change is for advisors to be more helpful in finding the track that is right for you as well as helping put you in contact with other advisors if you think that your major isn't right for you.
Senior,4,The University of New Mexico is an extremely culturally and artistically diverse college. Freedom of expression is welcomed.
Freshman,4,"Hello! 
  
      I am attending the University of New Mexico. Its a great school to attend because they have helpful staff and professors. Along with tips, they will tell you things such as what you need to do to stay of top of things. Also they communicate with you very fast and have many minority groups which is great because you can learn about different culturs. UNM is the place to go Wolf! Wolf!"
Freshman,4,"Welcome!

 The University of New Mexico has certain online courses according to majors. They also just recently started nursing online which is just fantastic. Online with other classes online the university teachers and staff want you to succeed in school and graduate. I been told online is very good and flexible."
Junior,4,"My advisors are really helpful and most of the time they tell me how it is. The financial aid office is iffy and are not willing to help.  So far, everyone is really positive and nice."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see the safety on campus improve. I saw someone on campus almost get stabbed and we tried calling UNM Police and they did nothing about it!
Alum,4,"The University of New Mexico is very diverse and has tons of clubs, activities, educational experiences and opportunities to expand your knowledge. They really care about your education and well being, by helping you not only with your classes, but also helping you decide what you want to do with your degree. They will help you with internships, networking and even finding your dream job. The University of New Mexico is a great school to receive your undergraduate, graduate and even doctorate."
Junior,4,"This college is great for students who like smaller class sizes and outdoor activities. It's diverse and the professors are caring, fun, and make the classes enjoyable. However, there is not much to do in the city and it's hard to get into the classes you need as they fill up very fast."
Alum,4,"It has very good programs, but like any school your experience will depend on what class' you take and who your instructor is."
Niche User,4,"Its very big, classes are large. Thee campus is alive there's so many groups and support groups and there is also a lot of activitys going on on campus"
Alum,4,"Renovations to campus, more parking structures for students, more athletic programs for students to sign up for."
Junior,4,I like how helpful the staff is. I spoke with an advisor to help me change majors and they were very honest about the financial strain it will put on me to extend my stay. I am also transferring over from another college and their admission was smooth and very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I like attending UNM. It is close to home and the restaurants around campus are great, but the area is known for a lot of crime."
Niche User,4,"My son is graduating from UNM with an electrical engineering major and music minor.  I assess that UNM provided the most balanced STEM/music educational environment in the State.  He had a chance to regularly interact with music performance majors at UNM, and learn from a world class trumpet professor (Dr Marchiando).  UNM has the most research funding in the State and my son was prepared enough to receive a prestigious Fellowship to pursue engineering graduate studies at Notre Dame.  Sure there are rough spots regarding neighborhood security and there is some unevenness in faculty, but it’s a great value if you pick a viable career major like in STEM."
Senior,4,"UNM is an overall great school. The campus is beautiful and big, and there is plenty of opportunity to get help with your courses. I have used the free tutoring services several times, and they have been very helpful. My advisors are great and have really helped me navigate college."
Niche User,4,I barely got admitted and it really is a little expensive but seems like a great school by the way admin treats new people.
Freshman,4,"The food and the on campus living isn't stellar, but the classes and opportunities they provide are great. There is always something fun to do on campus or around the area."
Freshman,4,"The University of New Mexico is honestly a really great college. It's only my first year attending university but I love it. There are so many opportunities and events that are open to everyone, thus, making it somewhat easy to meet new people and find/do things that you like. The majority of the people at the university are also very accommodating and friendly which is a plus! I always thought I'd go out of state for college but I'm glad I decided to stay because it can be intimidating at first, seeing all the people from different age groups. But the nice part of that is being able to learn something new from everyone."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at UNM and so far I really like it! People are friendly, the weather is nice, and the campus is easy to navigate."
Sophomore,4,"I think it's a great place to start off. There's a lot of diversity and celebration of that. The classes themselves can be as challenging or easy as you'd like. It's also a great place for outdoor activities like hiking, rock climbing and that kind of thing"
Niche User,4,Unique majors available. Excellent dance program. Good connections and communications with laboratories in the area.
Freshman,4,"Overall, the faculty is very kind and will help you in need of a difficult situation. The advisement building and the advisors can be slightly difficult, and it would be a better option if they had more faculty in those departments. The clinic is very organized and will help you in need of a simple illness or non-emergency, but they will still help if you have a fractured bone. Campus food needs work but at Lapo most of the staff is very nice and will ask you how your day is going or a simple smile goes a long way after your tiring day, however the food at . the markets could use more options even if its in need of a quick meal this will be very much appreciated even at 2am."
Junior,4,The university of New Mexico is a great college for students who are multicultural to really see a lot of different cultures and people all in one place it’s a great college with making sure students are getting all the help they need
Niche User,4,"All in all my experience at the UNM facility and falculty have been great, it is  very welcoming environment with a great amount of diversity. The campus and also the environment are beautiful a"
Freshman,4,"Being a UNM Freshman has introduced me to the challenges and rewards of being a student there.  My experience has been a very positive one as I have found the course work to be directed to my academic major which is in Dance.  I have found the instructors to be helpful and personal.  I have met outer students and classmates that are interested in my major, Dance, and that have opened me to other venues of the learning experience.  I believe that the campus is welcoming and for me safe!"
Senior,4,"Open campus, love that health care is on campus, but hate the liberality scene. Everything is very liberal centered and self-righteous bratty kids take the lead here. Other than that, nice campus."
Senior,4,"I really like the professor here, they do a good job at teaching. I also like the layout of the campus its easy to navigate."
Junior,4,"I have had a great experience at UNM so far. The campus, staff, and community are so welcoming and supportive. I have learned so much and now that I have chosen a career, I feel that UNM is preparing me well for the career that I want. One thing that I would like to see changed is providing more resources to incoming freshmen to help direct them toward their desired career."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at a University. I had no idea what to expect at first. The University of New Mexico is the top research institution in the state. There are smart, kind, and talkative people everywhere. There are tons of communities and clubs which you can join. It has been a pleasant experience! I have learned a lot from my first semester!"
Freshman,4,What I enjoy about the University of New Mexico is that they provide lots of help for the students that would be useful throughout their years attending the university.
Freshman,4,"What I liked about the University of New Mexico University Is that the people in the community will help you to step by step.
The campus around is very decent and celebrate important special events that means a lot to them."
Freshman,4,"I like how the University of New Mexico has a lot of diversity. There are so many different people that are so different. So far my experience has been great. It is a peaceful campus, with a lot of places to sit. There are a lot of professors who care about their job and truly want to help the students learn. If you need help with a subject CAPs is a great resource to help in whatever area you are struggling. The food on campus is very good. There are a lot of different kinds of choices you can pick from. The location of the campus is also very convenient. It is close to a lot of stores, and places that people in Albuquerque like to visit. Overall I think that it is a good campus."
Sophomore,4,I like hanging out around campus with my friends. I wish they wouldn't have most classes teach in a flipped learning style.
Freshman,4,As the semester has progressed I have felt that I am more and more at home. I love the sunshine and the campus. But off campus there is a large amount of homeless people that I would like to see find a home or a better life.
Senior,4,"This school is an awesome school. The specific program that I am in is an incredible program. The overall school is a good one although I feel like there are plenty of improvements that can be made. The policies of the school, where they are putting their money, and the imbalance of help that is provided to each school in the University or the programs here. There are not enough opportunities for students to have help financially even though there are programs that are willing to help. The campus is beautiful, the maps are clear, the students are friendly. There are many places to study, workout, relax, eat and hang out with friends both indoors and outdoors. The campus has many resources for studying and help with courses."
Junior,4,"It's a beautiful campus and has tons of opportunities for students. The programs in place are great for getting connected and the teachers provide great content. The only hiccup so far has been that, because of how large it is, information takes forever to travel."
Junior,4,The campus of the University of New Mexico is smaller than most campuses but it is much more affordable. Everyone is helpful and friendly. The professors here care about the students and work with us to pass our classes.
Sophomore,4,There is everything to UNM. From the students you meet in the classroom to the guy who gives you coffee at the SUB. This place is so open an friendly. I have never met people who friendly and supportive. The campus itself is pretty cool too. The duck pond is possibly my favorite place to hang out especially in the spring. UNM is really amazing social campus.
Junior,2,"Agenda pushing. Not concerned with actually teaching so you can learn. Fun ""college experience"" if that's all you're looking for."
Graduate Student,2,"because of covid a lot of teachers who have never taught online before had to, which led to disorganization and a many other difficulties"
Alum,2,"Simply a degree factory. Teachers are not interested in teaching and would rather do their research. TA/GA's are there because they have to be. Best of luck when your GA cannot even put together a simple sentence in English and you don't speak an Asian language fluently.

Location on Central, hahaha! What safety? Constant problems there

Sports? Greek? Easily avoidable and probably for the best.
You can watch your tuition rate climb ever higher as the school struggles to pay constant $$$ buyouts for the rotating door of Coaches and Presidents
The ""new dorms"" are already in worse shape than the old dorms. The off campus housing is great if you like break ins. Parking is a joke and again great for break ins.

The UNM Administration is more interesting in looks and spend money on updating buildings or to draw in ""student"" athletes. Because the real reason no one wanted to come to UNM is we didn't have a recently renovated gym"
Sophomore,2,I do notice most of the professors them seem to really care about the subject and their students. The main campus is really beautiful and a bit confusing but in no time you’ll figure out where to go. My one problem is sometimes faculty might know what they are doing and it can be frustrating and time consuming going multiple time to campus to find out information that’s not helpful.
Graduate Student,2,"This school makes terrible financial choices and continues to throw everything under the rug. This school made me feel as if I do not belong, something taught were seemingly to brainwash. The parking was terrible, the moral was terrible at this school. It was hard to attend class when your professors practice favoritisms and had well too high expectations for students. This school is a special case, many students, maybe more that 60% commute, myself included, I missed out on so many opportunities because I was unable to make the hour and a half drive. These professors need to be more aware of their students situations. My mom passed away and I was told to drop all my classes instead of getting help."
Senior,2,"I think that the University of New Mexico has potential if it were to look at the experience of classrooms through a student's perspective. Sometimes, there are teachers that don't even know what is on the tests that they assign their students. Others give homework that does not correlate with exams given. There are also good teachers in this school and I believe with more guidance, the teachers can make the experience better for everyone."
Senior,2,UNM as a whole doesn't care about their students. Unless you're an athlete or rich you are insignificant to UNM.
Senior,2,Dealing with any and all staff members at this college (in all departments) is tedious and frustrating. I have never had a good experience when dealing with any UNM staff. I have also had a total of 2 great professors while I have been a student there. The only reason I go to UNM is because it is more affordable then most online colleges.
Junior,2,"I didn't receive enough financial aid.  I wish I could attend.  It would have been great.

The professors were excellent.  Major GPA: 3.85/4.0."
Freshman,2,"The University of New Mexico is not ideal for me. There is little energy on campus. Everything is complicated and frustrating. The teachers seem to do their job and nothing more. There is no excitement in the class room and it always seems I'm just mindlessly sitting there learning little. Don't get me wrong, not every single teacher is like this, it was just my overall view on my first semester"
College Freshman,2,"UNM has some serious issues with communication, such as not being able to to get emails, or get wrong information. UNM New Student Orientation (Freshmen) is not helpful at all on signing up for classes, or understanding what I need for multiple degrees (I'm an Electrical Engineering Major and a Music Minor). Also, parking at UNM is hard to pay for if you need help with something over the summer."
College Sophomore,2,"On campus security is more reactive than proactive, especially when concerning sexual assault. The university does provide on campus security and escorts are available at any time."
College Sophomore,2,I don't do any sport
Recent Alumnus,2,UNM has one of the highest assualt rates in the country. There are also many homeless people who frequent the campus.
College Sophomore,2,There are no security guards at night or around the parking garages...very isolated
College Freshman,2,Lobo Village is run by terrible people.
College Freshman,2,"I have to walk around campus a lot alone, even though it is during the day I feel stress about being assaulted."
College Freshman,2,"Being on campus when it is dark outside is very unsettling.  It is absolutely terrifying to walk alone on campus at night.  There is not sufficient lighting nor enough security walking around on campus, yet they have multiple security guards inside the library at all times.  It is also very concerning that we have a public campus so homeless people can often be seen digging through the trash and have been known to harass students for money on multiple occasions.  We also get alerts at least once a week that say that someone has been robbed on campus or that a girl has been sexually assaulted and they happen in the middle of the day in public.  I am usually just very wary of walking alone on campus at all times because of how unsafe I feel when I am alone here."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not know too much about Greek life  but from the rep and what I have heard, there is usually a negative connection with those involved in a sorority or a fraternity"
College Freshman,2,Everyone goes here to get a degree. There is very little socialization
College Freshman,2,The typical negative vibe is still around greek life.
College Senior,2,"After a break, and coming back to UNM. The layout has changed and services have moved off campus which is inconvenient to students who do not have a main transportation. Also, the run around that happens when you don't get the proper information from Services and Advisors."
College Freshman,2,Location is in a bad part of the city
College Freshman,2,Not really a big Greek Life at UNM.
College Freshman,2,I was kicked out of a fraternity in what was perceived as  discriminatory by the other members. I still keep in touch with my frat bros but I would never rejoin
College Junior,2,We aren't very good. And Johnson Gym is older than the hills.
College Freshman,2,"There are alerts about what happens on campus, but I feel like there isn't much done about the probably. More can be improved about the safety and health of our campus."
College Freshman,2,Boring and not effective for students.
College Junior,2,"Some precautions such as installing light paths for walking at night have been installed, but the issue remains that more can be done for the safety of the students."
College Junior,2,The best bet is to rent an apartment off of campus because the houses are ridiculously high on housing and the rent is not worth the quality of the housing. It would take a few friends and roommates to get together in order to afford the cost of living off campus.
College Sophomore,2,There are far too many hoops that need to be jumped through in order to get the aid applied to your account
College Freshman,2,The food sometimes made me sick but it is always there and cooking can be a hassle in a community kitchen
College Freshman,2,"I am having a very hard time receiving any financial aide from UNM. I have maxed out my credit cards trying to pay for tuition and various fees that are not covered by the lottery scholarship, however I am determined to finish nursing school so i am persevering on. The best tips I can give is to be very persistent with the financial aide office and make sure you cross check information with other students. (I have been given inaccurate information on several occasions). My adviser also encouraged me to make sure I am speaking with someone from advisement and not the other side of the office which is enrollment. The enrollment side of the office does not have the most current information and could advise you wrong."
College Freshman,2,"I lived on campus my freshman year, the dorms at my school are expensive! I saved $1300 this year alone by moving off of campus into my own apartment. The dorms at my school badly need to be renovated, the rooms are tiny with a bad bug problem and plumbing that was under maintenance daily during my time on campus. The only perks of living in the dorms was the closeness to my classes, and getting to live with my best friend."
College Junior,2,"The University of New Mexico has terrible housing. The internet is constantly cutting out, some dorms barely have any lighting, others are far too expensive for packing 6 people into one place."
College Freshman,2,I don't really like UNM's campus or any of it's architecture. Only pro is it's all compact in area so it's easy to get around.
College Freshman,2,I'll just say I've already been admitted to another school and I'm transferring at the end of the year lol.
College Freshman,2,"If I could go back to before my freshman year and choose a different school I would. I am already admitted to a different school and I'll be transferring in the Fall and I can't wait. UNM is a big commuter school, not very many students or upperclassmen live on campus(dry campus), there's not much really ever going on, and it's kind of a weird atmosphere. Not the worst school ever, but definitely not the school for you if you're looking for the whole college experience."
College Freshman,2,If you're coming to UNM for the athletics you're at the wrong school. Our best/most payed attention to sport is basketball and even that we sucked at this year. Sporting events aren't a big deal to people.
College Freshman,2,Lapo sucks and gets old so fast. They have the same food every other day and good luck if it's your main source for food.
College Freshman,2,"To make it simple, if you're coming to UNM to party, you've got the wrong school. 

Not many people at UNM party at all(due to it being a commuter school?) and there are 0 parties on campus because it's a dry campus."
College Freshman,2,La Posada is disgusting. There is little variety and the healthy food options are weird and gross.
College Senior,2,"I hardly ever see the campus police or any sort of university enforcement except to give people parking tickets. There are few security people at night which can make the campus a little scary because of its proximity to Central. When there is an incident on campus, we only hear about it days after the fact."
College Senior,2,"I've heard some pretty crazy stories of campus housing parties. They happen, but only through association."
College Senior,2,"They are sensitive with holds. Every semester, I'm always ineligible to receive my scholarship. Its a process to get everything back in order. Its frustrating and an unnecessary stress students need, especially when classes start."
College Senior,2,"We have frequent problems with our fraternities and sororities on campus with issues like drug use, sexual assault and alcohol abuse.  There are a few (small) greek organizations that are dedicated to education and community service, but they are not very well funded."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid gives me the run around. I got a some help from the government and a loan, but it still does not cover my balance."
College Freshman,2,If you have the money it's great! But for full time students with little income it can be bad.
College Freshman,2,New Mexico is a quiet place. Transportation sucks so people don't want to drive.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, most parties around here are just straight up fakes. What I mean by that is that they just try to copy what you see in typical college movies. It never ends up working out that way. In the real world, college students are broke. We can't afford to be renting out DJs and huge spaces to do them in."
College Freshman,2,"It is made for adults, no one under 21"
College Junior,2,Athletics programs demand too much money from students (tuition rates) only to be subpar in comparison to other schools and facilities are not well maintained or available to non-athlete students.
College Freshman,2,Student housing still has a lot more to improve on. There are many old dorms which are the worst to live in and the new dorms are nice but its clear to see that they were poorly built and in a few years will be quickly run down.
College Freshman,2,Greek life at UNM is not much of importance. Greeks do not do much at all to better the school and they just talk about being greek but don't move on from that.
College Freshman,2,Some one was shot the other day
College Sophomore,2,"At least in my field, the only internship offered is highly competitive. There isn't much value in a nutrition degree without the specific internship that is so hard to get."
College Sophomore,2,Just filling out a FASFA gets the job done. Though I wish scholarships at the university were more on par with chances of even receiving a scholarship.
College Junior,2,"I chose to be an English major with a concentration in creative writing. While the literature classes are hit or miss, the creative writing classes tend to suck all the fun out of writing."
College Junior,2,"I chose to be an English major, with a focus in creative writing. General literature classes are hit or miss, depending on the professor you get. Some professors are open to dissenting opinions, others want their students to regurgitate their own opinions. When it comes to the writing focused classes, I don't recommend them. The professors I have had sucked all the joy out of writing. The workload isn't terrible, but it seems like a lot when you're not in the mood to write or read a lot."
College Senior,2,People attack many people on religion. There are some Christian men who will preach outside of the lunch room explaining why they are going to heaven and everyone else is going to hell. The men will say things such as women are whores and need to cover their bodies. The campus does not unite well with religion.
Sophomore,1,I feel as though I am just teaching myself. I don't feel like there is any teaching going on. I am trying my hardest.
Niche User,1,"I never attended UNM and I was charged with a 3,300.00 bill. All I did was go to orientation and I never registered or attended any classes. When I called about the bill they sent me to 4 different departments. I am upset that they want me to pay for it because according to them it was my fault. They told me I couldn’t register for classes until I turned in my final transcript. I never did that because I couldn’t afford to even go to the college. The classes I was being charged for I had to even audition to get in. I was never even informed I was registered for class let alone notified I was missing classes. At any normal functional college they drop you from classes if you had not paid or attend classes after two weeks. I am still puzzled on how I even got registered. Now I have a bill, they sent me to 4 different offices only one man was helpful and he was just an intern. I am sadden that they told me they could only help me with 50% if it passed the appeal portion."
Niche User,1,"I never even attended the college and I am being charged 3,300.00 dollars for being miss lead. All I did was attend orientation now it’s my fault and I don’t feel like I need to pay for classes I didn’t even know I was registered for."
College Senior,1,"Advisors or ""career prospects"" still cant find a way to help students most of the time. Students have to work twice as hard to find the right connections to seek job or internships"
College Sophomore,1,What the heck is Greek life and how is this relevant
College Junior,1,"I hate this school. The freshman advisement center is a joke and as a freshman I was told that there wasn't even an exercise science program when it's actually one of the largest majors at the university. Finding anyone who actually knows how to advise or understands what they're talking about is one in a million. There is no guidance when actually trying to figure out what path you want to take during your four (More like 5) years here. Getting into classes that are required for your major is sometimes impossible and finding the adequate advisement to prepare for registration is practically non-existent. It takes most of us 5 + years to graduate and it always feels like the system is working against you here. If you're unsure about what you want to major in or what career you would like to pursue, this university is not for you. Finding yourself here is hardly ideal."
College Junior,1,You know people have used by the look on their face.
College Junior,1,Left over mess and abuse of property
College Junior,1,Stick to the old ones
College Sophomore,1,Lapo is disgusting and the food is gross. It's expensive and unreasonably priced since the food is so terrible.
College Freshman,1,Privileged and ostentatious is the athletic attitude on campus.
College Junior,1,"Financial aid at UNM may be the worst thing I've had to deal with here. They've audited me two years in a row- even though I got them the extra information by their deadline, I was not able to receive the aid I needed because they had already distributed to those who weren't audited. When I brought my paperwork in, every time they needed additional information and it took them several days to a week to inform me I needed to bring more paperwork in."
College Junior,1,There are barely any healthy options. They are not accommodating to students with dietary restrictions and force you to buy their meal plan if you live on campus. La Posada has terrible food and there is not a lot of variety.
College Freshman,1,"UNM is a dry campus so if you live on campus you will not be able to have alcohol. Security guards walk around the dorm areas and The RA's do room checks and will make sure you don't have any alcohol, weed, drugs, and even candles. If you like to drink or smoke, then campus is not the place to live/be."
College Freshman,1,"All of UNM's financial aid, ""advisors"", scheduling, and whole front office completely sucks. Your advisors are never going to help you and scheduling is really bad. If you have to have a specific 2 classes you have to take and they just happen to be at the same time/dates, you're SOL."
College Sophomore,1,"On-campus dining is abysmal. Though we do have Satellite Coffee and the tiny co-op near the bookstore for somewhat healthy food, all other on-campus eateries sell either fast food or, in the case of La Posada dining hall $10 diarrhea-inducing slop. On-campus first years, even those living in the apartments are forced to pay $3200 (this will be increased to $3800 next year) per year (at the least--the fanciest dining option will be $4450 a year for 2014/15 students) for meal plans that most won't use in their entirety, as the majority of the meal plan can only be used at La Po. If this happens to be the case for you, and it most likely will be, your points will expire and you'll be out several hundred/thousand dollars. Thanks, UNM. 

Whenever I went to the dining hall, I could never find many ""healthy"" options. They have a salad bar, but the wilty greens and thick, cheap dressing was never as appetizing as I hoped. They have a gluten-free section, but everything there usually looks like it's been left out all night and, as far as flavor goes, tends to be bland and incredibly boring. They have a rotating menu, but the cheese sauce for the burritos and nachos served as meals aren't very nutritious choices for developing college-aged minds and bodies. 

My one suggestion is to get your own kitchen and use it. That's the only way that you'll be able to actually afford healthy meals on campus. Even if you have to pay for a meal plan, use it as little as possible. Seriously. Your body will thank you in the years to come."
College Junior,1,You need a car to get out of the college area.
College Freshman,1,"Having a car on campus would be fantastic, and it's a good thing I have a lot of friends who have cars, because there's a lot of times when campus is really boring and we want to go do something, and walking off campus isn't an option because it's sort of sketchy. However, students and faculty often say that the most efficient branch of UNM bureaucracy is the parking office, because if you leave your car for ten minutes without a permit, or in the wrong area, you will get a ticket. Permits cost around $300 for resident parking, and even with the permit my roommate usually has to park across campus because there's never any parking in our lot."
College Freshman,1,"I hate New Mexico weather purely because it's always sunny, and when it isn't sunny it's usually windy. It's actually fine in summer, but in winter the sun is just depressing because it's freezing, but also not snowing."
College Junior,1,Agh parking is the worst!! So expensive for a dangerous and time consuming parking pass.
College Senior,1,"RA's and housing system in general treat us like little kids. And to the ones who don't like socializing or going to meetings, we are neglected and treated differently. Living in the dorms was a true nightmare. There's no respect."
College Junior,1,Not enough parking and passes are outrageously priced
Recent Alumnus,1,"I would the financial aid has been the worse because I don't qualify for financial aid. I see so many people who abuse of the financial aid and it gets to me because, I go to school full-time and I have to work part-time so that I can pay for school every semester. "
College Junior,1,UNM isn't known for athletics. We are known for alcoholism and Breaking Bad.
College Junior,1,Parking is shit if you do not live on or near campus. 
College Junior,1,there are not many options of food and its not good nor affordable
College Junior,1,there are no fast food restaurants close to my campus
College Junior,1,there should be enough transportation for all types of students and there is not
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is extremely expensive. It's not too hard to find a spot. The system is stupid, you have to pay for a certain amount of hours, regardless of whether or not you're under that amount. You can get a ticket for parking even 2 minutes past your payment."
College Sophomore,1,Transportation at UNM is time-consuming at best.
College Sophomore,1,"It is an extremely long drawn out process which takes a lot of time. Paper work must be processed through the Financial Aid office, the registrar, and the dead of students. Also, the bursars account is not set up to tell a student upfront how much tuition he or she owes."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is the reason I take the bus. There are ten times as many students as there are spots. In an emergency, I still can't park on campus, and rely on parking three blocks away, in front of the vacant lot."
College Senior,1,"If you're missing high school, UNM is the place for you! Relatively attractive campus, nice part of town. Albuquerque is a decent little city, pretty boring to be honest. Nature is the one saving grace here."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is awful if you do not have a permit--Firstly parking is almost always impossible to find (I've been late several times due to a lack of parking or money to park on campus) sometimes even the giant parking garages fill up. Secondly, most classes are an hour and fifteen minutes long but you can only pay for parking in hour intervals and its 1.75 an hour. So you can either risk getting a ticket or pay another 1.75 just for those last 15 minutes."
College Junior,1,Parking prices are a bit ridiculous and you have to take a shuttle to get to campus.
College Sophomore,1,The campus is pretty old. There are some new buildings and there have been new construction but the majority of the campus is still stuck in the past. Our student union building has a limited amount of fast food options. It always seems like the buildings smell of fish.
College Junior,1,The parking is horrible and the fees are exorbitant. also getting a space is usually a problem.
College Junior,1,It's very hard to find a computer that is either open or isn't out of order. The network has its weeks when it is extremely slow and you have an extremely hard time logging into your UNM account.
College Junior,1,"there are several option available on campus. However it seems to me that the point of on campus housing is to help the students out. Quite the opposite, dorm life is extremely expensive. Half a room can cost you $600 a month, and it is Half a room only, and a little one at that. No kitchen, shared bathrooms. It seems illogical."
College Freshman,1,I do not feel safe to walk on campus by myself. We have had many problems with gropings this year and in other years there were many other violent crimes. It just makes me feel terribly unsafe!
College Junior,1,More money gets you closer to the campus but if you are struggling with cash like me you will be sent way office campus and still have to use a shuttle to get to the main campus. Parking tickets are expensive as well and limited so get a permit early.
College Freshman,1,I have no tips for financial aid because I do not recieve any except for the lottery. My only tip is to do well in high school and you might still have a terrible time like me recieving financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is awful. You can either pay at least $500 for a parking pass for somewhere that isn't really close to class, or you can pay $1.75 per hour for the meter parking, which is fairly limited. There are two parking structures for which you may pay by the hour, but they have no way of keeping track of how full the structures are, so you can spend 30 minutes crawling to the top of the structure with so many other cars, only to find that there is no parking and turn around to find somewhere else."
College Freshman,1,"I havent received any financial aid and I am really hoping for better luck this year,I apply for as many things available .To stay on top of things I usually try to make a time that I can sit and apply for some financial aid,which would benefit me alot!"
College Sophomore,1,"I got the cheapest dorms available and they were pretty bad. I had bug problems the entire year and the cost was pretty high; it's cheaper for me to get an apartment with a friend than stay in the dorms.  The people in the dorms can be pretty mean too, although the RA's are pretty nice.  The dorms are also fairly convenient, unless you're going into engineering."
College Freshman,1,There is no way to park at  UNM for less than $3 a day without a permit. Plus there is not enough parking in general.
College Senior,1,"They do not have a lot of options or a good variety of classes, especially for the TR schedule, which is very popular"
College Junior,1,"Parking for campus residents is fantastic. Sadly, that is the only group with a good parking situation. Everyone else is either expected to pay ridiculous amounts of money for a permit, or park somewhere near campus and hope you don't get a ticket. Because UNM is mainly a commuter campus (not a lot of residents compared to its overall student population) one would think its parking would be much better."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is way to expensive. 200 dollars for a pass is kind of ridiculous. I take the bus and it takes me an hour. I want to drive but i dont want to spend money to park somewhere then have to take a shuttle to school anyway. The hourly paid parking is also to expensive. Its almost 2 dollars per hour. If i were to spend a class day at school i would end up spending over 10 dollars a day just to drive to class. I think ill stick to the city buses and save some money.
College Sophomore,1,There are policies but most of the time they arent enforced. I see students smoking all the time when there are designated smoking areas. Students on skate boards almost collide into other students. This can leave to the campus being unsafe to even walk on.
College Junior,1,"The things that bothers me most at the University of NM is that they make rules that aren't enforced. The best example is the no smoking rule. I am constantly walking behind people that are smoking while walking to their next class, cigarette butts are to be found all over the place and when calling the dean's office or campus police they say it's not their problem and to confront the people participating."
College Sophomore,1,the greek life is lame!! the sororities and frats rarely do anything together. the only organized events that sororities and frats ever have are the serenades and winter formal. there are never any date dashes or mixers which is one of the best part of being in greek life. Not worth it!
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking around the campus is permit only except in the two parking structures.  Parking is strictly enforced.  The cheapest lot to park in is located far away from the campus.  The shuttle buses can get crowded, so leave plenty of time to get to campus from the parking lot in case the bus is too full to get on."
Recent Alumnus,1,Anderson School – Advisers are not the best the work studies are even worse
College Junior,1,"Bars and clubs are all terrible, good EDM scene but that's about it."
College Senior,1,"There's hardly any on-campus parking, and the parking that is on campus is very expensive. If you pay meter parking on campus, there's usually a limit and parking patrol is always coming around. The cheapest parking pass is at South Lot and it's a shuttle ride to get to campus, so give yourself plenty of time so you aren't late to class."
College Sophomore,1,Bipolar Much? The weather in NM is crazy. One day it may be freezing cold and with super high wind speeds when the next day its sunny outside. For the past 3 years (2009-2012) every late june/ early july it has either snowed or hailed at least on one occasion per year. Our winters have been getting colder with more snow each year as the summers get dryer.
College Junior,1,Be Ready to Pay – The parking permits are over priced and on campus parking costs even more. There is a shuttle and it's crowded. There are some spots that cost less near campus but you got to get there early.
College Junior,1,Blue Boxes Hell – They say the blue boxes work but it takes security forever to get to you. I rarely see campus police on foot expect near the book store our in the student union building at lunch. I safe because of my own self defense training.
College Junior,1,Not at All Helpful – They consistently lose forms. Different people give different answers to the same question. They make decisions seemingly without reason. They don't reward students for academic success.

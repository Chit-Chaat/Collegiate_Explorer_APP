Freshman,5,The University of Central Arkansas is an amazing school to attend. The student life is so fun to be apart of!
Freshman,5,"Most of all my teachers are nice, food is pretty good, and the campus has a lot of student diversity so you can find stuff for everyone. It is just the right size of campus for me not too small and not too large."
Freshman,5,I love how they are all about learning. They make you work for good grades and don't believe in slacking. It's a beautiful community and I cannot wait to graduate from here.
Freshman,5,"UCA has a gorgeous campus, and from what I've heard, there is a fabulous biology program, even for those considering wildlife biology rather than pre-med. The dorms are a little larger than normal, and there are accommodations for service animals."
Senior,5,"Truly recommend UCA to everyone. As an international student and former student athlete there are so many resources available for you to feel as though you have a home away from home. The campus is beautiful as well especially in the Fall/Spring. The professors really care and want you to learn and grow and I strongly recommend the EXSS department.  Also, the size is mid-size so not too small but also not too big so class sizes are nice which definitely helps with learning. Overall I would strongly recommend anyone to attend UCA."
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore in college and I really love it! The atmosphere here is so kind and accepting and the campus is so diverse!
Freshman,5,"Great school, lots of resources, on the cheaper side when it comes to colleges. Feels like a small safe community."
Niche User,5,I would like to further my education at UCA because the overall feel of the campus is so inviting. It feels like home as soon as I arrived. I even attended special programs at this college during my high school career. This university is a beautiful place.
Alum,5,UCA was a place that felt like home. My professors were committed to my educational and personal growth and I had access to numerous academic and professional opportunities that have served me well as a college graduate.

Niche User,5,"Very helpful in admissions. I called after I messed up my email, and they went in and fixed it for me and helped me with some other things while they were at it. Overall, I was very pleased."
Freshman,5,"Thus far from working with the administrators, they seem to really care about making sure that you're successful and can find good job opportunities after college. So I so far would definitely recommend."
Freshman,5,"The campus is very pretty, but it's looks kind of old and run down. It's somewhat rustic but also feels a little dirty/outdated."
Senior,5,"I love this school because first off, they are do take care of their Veteran Students which I am. They help you out any time you have questions and even contact Admissions if there is ever any issues that need taken care of. The Campus is great with lots of places to study."
Freshman,5,"It is very family oriented with the professors and staff!! Once entering the campus for Bear Facts Day, it is very welcoming and I loveeeee it.  The atmosphere is just like a home feeling and my parents really enjoyed their visit and we decided this is the college of our choice."
Sophomore,5,"I like the diversity that UCA has to offer, as well as the student life opportunities. The campus stays clean, and is well put together, as everything is easy to locate. The teachers are very nice, and are always willing to put things aside in order to make sure the students needs are met. I think that UCA could add more food in the food court, which would draw a bigger crowd and better business."
Junior,5,"I love how close to home UCA is, the amount of diversity and the great campus food! I think itâ€™s a excellent place to attend to get your education."
Sophomore,5,"I love how there are many activities to do at the University of Central Arkansas, such as concerts, Greek life, and the Hper. Going Greek has brought me many life long friends that I could never replace. The Hper is huge and has many workout machines. The staff at The University of Central Arkansas always seeks to improve the campus and are curious about what the students believe could make college life more enjoyable. I often get surveys of what I believe could be improved, and the only thing I ever say is the parking. I love The University of Central Arkansas and I couldn't see myself attending another college I have made many friends in college and there is never a dull moment. The University of Central Arkansas has brought me many memories that I will never forget."
Alum,5,My overall experience at UCA was amazing. I enjoyed all of my instructors from General Education to Honors to Spanish to Linguistics. The Study Abroad department helped me study abroad on two separate occasions. The campus itself is beautiful.
Junior,5,"The campus is stunning. I love that everywhere you go, a friendly face can always be found. The professors want you to succeed and give you all the materials needed to succeed."
Freshman,5,It is a smaller state school where you can get to know more professors. The dorms are designed to help students get to know others in their field.
Sophomore,5,UCA is a very inclusive and open-minded school.  UCA's campus is very welcoming.  The volunteers and staff on campus are very helpful and understanding.  I love UCA and the environment it has provided for me to grow and learn.
Niche User,5,"I personally enjoyed the atmosphere of the campus and the people on the campus. I am going there to play indoor volleyball so the coaches really sold me on the school. By being so nice and helpful, I choose this university to be my home for the next 4 years."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with the University of Central Arkansas such a great one. Many memories were made and also a few long lasting friendships were made also.  They're is a vast number of facility members ready to serve each student and help each single person in there walk in life. I have been one of those students who had been helped by the members at UCA. As a first generation attending at UCA, it was such a great experience overall because of the help I've received and the push I was given to strive for more."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus. It is layed out in a square shape, and is easy to navigate. They offer a lot of classes and have a reputation for professors that care.  UCA offers a variety of courses in multiple degrees.  The quality of education is supposed to be excellent.  I like all the degree fields, and they continue to change and provide new opportunities for growth.  I also like the athletic program, and I would love to play baseball for them in the future.  I hear great things about the professors...especially about how much they care for their students.  There are many student activities available including SGA, intramurals, different clubs and organizations, Christian organizations, and on-campus dormitories."
Freshman,5,"The University of Central Arkansas is voted #1 in the most beautiful campus in Arkansas and that is definitely not a lie. UCA is filled with so many wonderful opportunities for students of all ages, ethnic groups, and much more. I highly recommend anyone to UCA!"
Freshman,5,Love this college its so pretty and amazing to be at. I stay there every year for band camp and love it so much.
Graduate Student,5,"I loved getting to be part of such a great sports team and there are so many things going on campus that I didn't want to miss out. Student Activities does a great job of entertaining students and fulfilling needs of the students from all different backgrounds and cultures. I learned a lot just by attending events to make European, Asian and Spanish students feel welcome."
Niche User,5,"I'm an upcoming freshmen at the University of Central Arkansas; though I have only visited there a couple times, the few times I have visited I've always felt such a warm welcome and the feelings of a good and friendly environment. The campus police are very protective over not only the campus but the students and I love how all around the UCA campus they have emergency buttons just in case danger occurs or help is needed. The cafeteria has such a wide variety of food it's amazing! The dorms are very nice and are slowly getting renovated from what some of the staff informed me on. I also got to meet one of the professors in the Behavior Health and Sciences, he was super nice and friendly he also was very great on not only giving advise but also relating it back to his personal college experience at UCA. All I can say is now is that I am beyond excited to start college, further my education  and make new friends at my home away from home at the University of Central Arkansas! GO BEARS!"
Freshman,5,"The school has a great atmosphere, focusing on educating ALL and providing a deverse, challenging method of learning. The professors and administrators take time with their jobs and genuinely enjoy themselves. There is a lot of effort in communication for students."

Also, there is always some activity to get involved in and several opportunities to get volunteer hours. I do not regret choosing this university!!!"
Niche User,5,Staff and tour guides were really friendly and welcoming! The campus is very beautiful with many new upgrades. I loved the idea of residential halls and I can't wait to be there next year!
Niche User,5,"I have toured the campus one time, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I am going to be a senior next year, and I hope to be enrolled by the fall of 2020."
Niche User,5,"This campus is great for someone looking for a college where they never have to leave! There's great food served in the cafeteria, a mini food store, a post office, and much more for students to use."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the people here, the campus is beautiful, and I love working and attending classes here. I feel at home once I step foot on this campus."
Niche User,5,The college is very up to date and beyond beautiful! They really do try their best to help the students! <3
Senior,5,Everything!!! This is an amazing school! The academics are amazing as well as the faulty. There are so many RSOs on campus that help you get involved!!!
Niche User,5,"The University of Central Arkansas is my first choice of universities. Their campus is beautiful and diverse. Conway is a beautiful city because there is a lot to do in the city. The University of Central Arkansas has a range of opportunities to choose from, major-wise."
Senior,5,Diversity is a huge thing I like about UCA. So many cultures and backgrounds surround you. Everyone is so friendly. Their academics are outstanding. They have some of the most competitive programs in the state and nation.
Niche User,5,Its  a GREAT campus and I can't wait to go in the fall of 2019. They are very welcoming and it seems like a great place to start my education for the next stages of my life.
Niche User,5,"The University of Central Arkansas is well located school in Central Arkansas. Professors go above and beyond for each student. The students are family. The campus is gorgeous, and is always well maintained."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman this year and so far the staff has been very helpful and excited for you too be here. It very hard to not be excited about this school with so many smiling faces and uca pride. Iâ€™m very honored to have attended such a great school as this
Niche User,5,"Right when I visited campus, I noticed the beautiful landscaping and new buildings. The people were so friendly and welcoming!"
Senior,4,"The campus and the staff are amazing. It still lacks things that almost every campus does, food options, accessibility, insane tuition, but overall I have loved my experience here."
Senior,4,So far my professor have done a great job at making students feel safe and heard with their concerns on in-person learning. We have all adapted to almost complete online learning with only a few short classes being held in person with social distancing.
Alum,4,"I never personally took an online course, but I heard from other students that had positive experiences."
Freshman,4,I have heard very good things about this college.  I have family members who have went to the college and that is one reason that I chose to go.  As well as the nursing programs that are offered!
Freshman,4,I feel that online anywhere can be challenging.  So based on the school they are fine but based on what we have to have on a personal level is okay but it takes time.
Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19, all classes were forced to become online courses. This transition was not easy, but UCA made it very comforting. The professors were prepared as if they knew there was going to be a pandemic! They communicated effectively, for the most part, and were always prompt."
Senior,4,The University of Central Arkansas is a student centered campus that focuses on student success. There is a culture here that I have never experienced before. Each professor and many of the students feel like a family away from my own family. The classes are very engaging and are medium in size! This allows one-on-one interactions with the professors!
Sophomore,4,"The classes went well. Patience can be a difficult quality to demonstrate at times, but the instructors handle issues reliably."
Senior,4,"It was an entirely new environment that I had to adjust to. I was nervous at first about being at an entirely new university, a new city, very different surroundings. UCA made the effort to adjust to a new social/educational classes easier by offering resources such as clubs, work-study offers, and restricting classes to a fair student-to-teacher ratio."
Senior,4,"The online experience has been very different, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and as expected feedback time is nowhere near in-person classes, but UCA has offered excellent resources to make the transition easy as possible by offering tech grants and flexible and understanding professors"
Junior,4,"I love UCA, its very welcoming and it is a family like atmosphere, but with anything there is always cons. I think that they can work on there diversity and having more professors that are minorities. They can also work on getting more parking and having more spot available for classes that are necessary for graduation."
Senior,4,"I am a student who struggles with online classes. I need in class sessions to understand material. At UCA though, I have found that their online structure has helped me grow in my understanding. Professors are there for you and can help you learn at your own pace. All you have to do is ask for assistance and they are there to help."
Sophomore,4,"I prefer learning in person so I wasn't the best at online classes. However, the professors take great care in making sure students understand the assignments and are great at answering any questions you have."
Sophomore,4,UCA is a wonderful school that celebrates its students and helps every student succeed. The president of the university loves to get involved in students' lives and will make sure your experience at the school is amazing. He comes to every sports event and loves interacting with students. This school is very diverse and celebrates everyone's differences.
Alum,4,"I loved UCA! I met so many people as well as formed bonds with professors that I will value for the rest of my life! The professors really work with you to make sure you understand the material, and there are so many resources for you whenever you need help around campus!"
Freshman,4,The University of Central Arkansas is a beautiful campus. It is located in a great city with many things for college students to do.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the welcoming feeling of safety on campus. I like the diversity of cultures and races on campus between students and professors. The resources we are provided are very nice.
Sophomore,4,I love the the friendliness of the instructors and the willingness to help students. The environment of the campus is very welcoming and clean in the sense of how put together the campus is. Student life is very important to me and UCA has great student life and it shows that the students really enjoy being there.
Freshman,4,"All of the staff is kind and welcoming, the students are even more so. I went for a band audition and was greeted by many staff members and was befriended by a student immediately."
Freshman,4,I really loved my visit. The staff was incredible and the food was great. Only problem was the amount of construction going on.
Freshman,4,"I have had a good experience with UCA so far, but the changes I would like to see is that the University decrease their tuition and make it more affordable for those like myself to be able to attend without having to take out so many loans or just didn't qualify for scholarships to help pay for the tuition. The atmophere at UCA is great and it is pretty diversed. Overall UCA is a great school and I would recommend it to those that would be interested in attending."
Senior,4,"I love the atmosphere the campus has. It is very conducive to learning, everyone is very helpful and friendly."
Freshman,4,I am planning on getting a degree in music.   They have a excellent music program....   The trombone choir is well know and is one to the best around.  I'm looking forward to enriching my education with the tools UCA has to offer.  I have already been accepted and look forward to starting college in the fall on 2020.  I have done research to see what colleges offers the tools I need to grow and UCA is what I am looking for.   Music is a big part of my life and I know UCA will help me to succeed.
Junior,4,"I love living here at UCA. The school has so many different activities for the students to get involved and have a good time. There are countless church organization on campus if you're into that, and there are non religious ones if you aren't as well. The teachers overall have been pretty good, but there will always be that one bad teacher you get in the bunch of good ones too. Overall I think this is a really good school with amazing people and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the campus, while it has a lot of reported crimes, there IS an on campus police patrol. The housing, unless you pay for the expensive apartments, is not the most modern of well maintained. Saying this, the Professors are extremely intelligent and involved on campus. Academics are very strong here and is the best choice I've made for a a college."
Niche User,4,"I like the overall atmosphere of the campus, such as professors, diversity, and the food. I also like how it is close to home and the sports that they have."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very diverse and has a lot of programs to get involved in. The one thing that I wished was better was the times of classes. As a college freshman, I work two jobs and the scheduling of my classes makes it hard to do that. Other than that, the school is great!"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely stunning. It is beautiful year round. Unfortunately, some of the dorm halls are not so beautiful, or clean. The food is decent, but not worth the money you pay to go there. Professors are great, but sometimes you can get a bad apple."
Sophomore,4,"I believe The University of Central Arkansas is a fantastic school with so many benefits. This school helps people branch out introduces them to so many clubs and organizations. its just up to them if they are willing to learn and take a step into success.  the campus is so beautiful and has so many open spots where students can study, enjoy the weather and just socialize."
Sophomore,4,"Needs better parking!!! Overall, the students and faculty are very friendly and helping. The campus hold certain standards of maintenance, so they will be mowing all the time. The resources that are available will help you throughout your college career, you just have to find out what they are and take advantage of them."
Junior,4,Great campus with a good balance of academics and fun. The area around campus is beautiful in the fall.
Senior,4,"The advisers are helpful,  the Campus is friendly and easy to navigate. The professors are willing to talk and help students through any problem. Only downside is that printing papers costs 0.10 per page, while at a local community college that's part of UofA is 0.05 per page. Things are slightly more expensive for a college with more student body traffic."
Sophomore,4,"When I first got to UCA, I was undeclared in my major but after many meetings with my adviser I was finally able to decide my major and major concentration. UCA offers so many career options and graduate program options, and they offer many different departments such as biology, liberal arts, mathematics, therapy, health care, etc. UCA offers a spot to anyone who is trying to better their careers! The campus is beautiful and the safety that UCAPD provides the community is unbeatable. Also, there is many helpful programs such as the food pantry, sexual abuse reach out, and different helpful opportunities to reach out during rough patches in life. The professors that I have had are so caring and take the time to work with us so we understand the material and are genuinely good caring people. Also, class times at UCA are easily managed because every class offers different times and you can always fix your schedule to make it work for your daily life."
Sophomore,4,UCA has a beautiful campus. Many good studying opportunities. I like how UCA provides many tutoring services. Some changes I would like to see is a more organized system in class schedule making and financial aid service.
Sophomore,4,"It's a small but nicely sized campus. Every class is easily within walking distance of any dorm you might live in. Professors take their work very seriously and want you to do well in their classes. That said, they can sometimes be a bit too strict and some of the dorms are in need of renovations."
Freshman,4,"Very community oriented college,  with a very caring faculty!! Everyone should really consider applying here!!"
Freshman,4,"University of Central Arkansas is the go to college in Arkansas. It is considered one of the five most affordable colleges in Arkansas. The online courses are also affordable. It is not a difficult process in enrolling. The University provides education in many majors, careers, and programs. The College tries its best to keep the students entertained in different activities as well. They have every sport you can think of. The environment is great and clean. The only thing I would have to complain about is the food quality and the prices in the cafeteria, but other than that it is a good university."
Junior,4,This university is a good place to attend for students wanting to stay close to home. They offer many programs to fit everyone's needs.
Graduate Student,4,The faculty and staff I have encountered are welcoming and empowering. The student body is also accepting and innovative ranging from high accreditation in business to physical therapy. The campus is beautiful and how can you resist a school colored football field?
Sophomore,4,"I liked that it was close to home and I wouldn't have to pay for housing on campus. I liked that I could eat at home and would not have to pay for a meal plan. I also liked how pretty the campus can be, even though it is relatively small."
Freshman,4,"I have not actually started school there yet, but I will in the fall season of 2019. I have been acquainted with UCA my whole life, however. Both of my aunts went to that college and both had a great time there and I have gone on several tours and have numerous friends already going to it so I go up to the college very often. Every time I go, I am amazed at the new things they implement into the campus every time. The last time I have had the chance to tour, they had finished their new gym and have a new campus security protocol involving poles set around campus that you can press and call security to your direction. They even showed that if you're running away from something and press numerous poles in a similar area, they can triangulate where you may be. UCA is a very safe school and a very diverse one to attend and I cannot wait!"
Sophomore,4,"The food from Aramark is not good at all. The campus is nice, and staff is excellent. Professors have all been amazing so far. My dorm is old, but it's just right for college living."
Junior,4,"I am a junior now and I love this school so much. It is not a biggest school in Arkansas but they have a great academic system. Student life in college is the priority of the school. Even if you donâ€™t know anything, there is always helper available to help you whenever you need, like RA, housing, student worker, advisor, professor. I am a transfer student and I am sure UCA has an excellent career service system to help student landing a job. Housing system is so much easier when you alway have an RA living in the same apartment or dorm floor. Basically, all you need to focus on study, live the best of yourself and land a job, the school reduce everything they can to secure you from paper work and stress. Library opens 24 hours for student need and they have dog therapy one in a while for student to pet inside the library.Iâ€™m not guarantee this will be the best school to you, but Iâ€™m sure you can live the best life you can and grow up day by day."
Senior,4,I love the diversity of the college and the professors are wonderful. More financial aid option should be nice.
Senior,4,"UCA has a very good academic reputation and offers many useful and profitable degree paths. Many international students benefit from its education, and students of all religious walks are welcome. The campus is beautifully kept and landscaped, and quite clean. The professors here (in the art and music program at least) come from prestigious backgrounds and share their wealth of knowledge and wisdom freely. Food choices are abundant. Police surround the school in droves, which I suppose can be good or bad, but I feel safe most of the time. The housing department has made mistakes for me and my friends, one of which resulted in leaving housing and withdrawing from school. UCA should improve on communication between housing and students, and between advisors and students. It's a shame what happened to my friend."
Niche User,4,I hope to go here and Would love to attend. has a Great campus seems friendly and gives tons of opportunity's which i would love to take on.
Senior,4,"It's a good college to attend. The college make sure they implament study guides and techniques for their students to succeed. These techniques are available online as well during X Period in a class setting. There are also counselors, advisors, and other faculty members to help.  The university is building good rapport and I believe a better retention also graduation rate overall this way."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far is very different from high school but I really love the environmental change . So far, I love the great service of the staff and how patient they are with the students. The staff is very very helpful. It's a little too soon to tell what I would like to see change..But if I could change something, it would probably be their lack of a law program."
Junior,4,"The curriculum was set up to help you if you have problems in class.  Your counselor checked your progress monthly.  I had a seizure at school and the campus police along with the paramedics, notified my parents and had the Residential Assistant check on my every hour til my parents got there.  They care for their students"
Sophomore,4,"This college has a great student life with many organizations that you can get involved in. They could get a bit better on the food part, but they have many other things that make up for it. They have a great gym for exercising with many different types of equipment that everyone can enjoy. They have great graduate programs that makes you want to compete to get into them. They also have many different types and places for you to choose for your housing!"
Freshman,4,"The school is cool , seems big at first but its not once you get used to it. Something I like about the school is the friends I made, and something that should change at the school is the food. They should but more options for different food."
Sophomore,4,"While attending the University of Central Arkansas I commuted to and from school. The faculty and staff were very understanding of my circumstances. With the exception of the science and business courses that I took, class sizes were relatively small (less than 30). The campus is expanding to include even more stores and things for the students. UCA is committed to its students and offers a beautiful place to earn an education."
Junior,4,i liked the options to get involved with the school. all of the clubs offered allow anyone to find their group and feel more at home.
Sophomore,4,"After completing my first year of college at UCA I've grown to love the campus and environment, and ultimately can call this college my home.  Some suggestions I would make is that some of the on-campus resources should extend their hours.  By adding extensions this can be a more flexible and convenient campus for people who stay on campus."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed my stay at the University of Central Arkansas. The professors were always willing to help and would let you know when you need help.
Sophomore,4,It's a great town with a homey feel and the school is beautiful and compact. Not always something to do and they do not offer a very wide range of majors toward the engineering direction. It's a wonderful school for anything medical and the sports are pretty good.
Freshman,4,"UCA is a great place full of friendly people.  If you don't live in the south, then UCA is a perfect place to come and get some southern hospitality.  the school is run by those who really care and are working to help you get a degree and be successful.  UCA is a sweet, southern, place with open arms."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity, but the work load is concentrated. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus and in the community. They also have lots of scholarships that they will give you if you are accepted. They also are very good about sending out emails about new scholarships and opportunities on campus. There is always something going on somewhere on campus. The biggest problem is trying to choose what it is you want to go to."
Senior,4,"To be honest, I never would have pictured myself attending a University of Central Arkansas but I must admit, I have quickly fallen in love with it. I have met amazing people while attending UCA. Professors here are always happy to help you with anything you need to reach your academic and future career goals. 
UCA does lack in the party scene department but it makes up for it with all the activities that the student activities board hosts. These range from foam party to sunday movie nights, which includes free popcorn. Speaking of food, there are many dining options on campus. Chick fil-a, Quiznos, Mooyah's, and Pizza Hut are just a few. The Christian cafeteria's staff are some of the nicest people you'll meet. They have a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian meals for those that follow such lifestyles. 
Overall, University of Central Arkansas is a great school to attend. You should definitely consider joining the UCA Bear family."
Freshman,4,We love the school and its campus. They are very helpful and ready to help students get all they need out of school.
Sophomore,2,"If you have a hard class, take it with friends because from my experience in Earth Science, Accounting, and Nutrition, the professors will usually suck. They will give you assignments on stuff they haven't covered yet and expect you to learn it yourself. Which is doable, just not in hard classes like Accounting and Chemistry."
Sophomore,2,"The people who complain about parking are the ones unwilling to park in the back of the lot and walk to their dorm. There IS parking, but all of the good parking spots are usually taken. I am rating this 2 out of 5 because of the profs. In 2 of my classes (1 is core requirement, 2 is business foundation), both professors have assigned homework for material they haven't covered. How are we supposed to do homework over stuff you don't teach? In their syllabi, both profs said nothing about independent learning. It's not something I can't do but when it is Earth Science 1400 and Principles of Accounting, I need all the lecture I can get do to well in those. However, these professors have not covered a single thing over what the assignments they posted require of me. Food is good (Get the 200 block to meal swap in the student center). Campus is beautiful. There are good professors but in most of the hard classes, you're out of luck."
Freshman,2,"Academically University of Central Arkansas has helped me a lot, but overall experience I believe that coming from a big active high school UCA has not fulfilled my expectations, being that it's a small campus, and sports involvement are also something I was expecting a good thing from but not a lot of people go to the sport activities unless they're greek. Again, Educational wise great school but college experience not so much."
Senior,2,"I loved the campus size and it's beauty, but a grand majority of the professors are not friendly and tell you that you need to dedicate all of your study time to their class. It's rude to tell someone that they're going to fail a class if they don't spend 6 hours studying for your class alone. No one in the world has that much time."
College Sophomore,2,"Expensive, no one helps whe you need help, teachers dont respond to emails very quick."
College Junior,2,no one cares about the athletics at our school and no one is going to start caring
College Freshman,2,The availability for internships and job just aren't there. Nobody is ever hiring and frankly there isnt much diverse job around campus. Most student just work in the cafeteria.
College Freshman,2,I really do not like it here. There is nothing to do and not much fun people to do it with. I urger you to find the school for you. This may be it for you but it just isn't for me.
College Freshman,2,Housing sucks! Most of the building are not up to date. you do not have much control over the temp in your room.
College Freshman,2,The school is actually really beautiful but it is not until you walk into the buildings that you're turned off. The people are fairly nice and helpful . There really isn't anything to do around the town of Conway. The place is full of dead grass and walmarts. The school pretty much makes the entire town. You have to drive atleast 10 minutes to get to anything substantial. The school does not do very well when it comes down to housing. They do not take the time to pair students together. The people care too much about irrelevant things. Everyone has their own thing and some people like it here but for me I just haven't found my thing.
College Student,2,"I haven't made any friends so far. So far, being here has been the worst time in my life and I dread college. I'm hoping it's just a rough start and that things will get better but who knows. There are lots of ways to get involved, but I feel like communication within the university isn't great."
College Freshman,2,Honestly I don't like it here. Not what I expected. Not a fan of Evangel University.
College Freshman,2,Do you're application before the scholarship deadline and you'll be fine. Otherwise don't even bother it's such a headache to receive more aid for UCA. Financial AID office is very rude.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is not very helpful at all.  It is not the people, but more so the process of receiving financial aid.  There are many hoops you have to jump through to get the aid you need."
College Freshman,2,"I barely received any financial aid from my school, and parents were stuck paying the bulk of it. UCA hardly offers scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"Not the worst, pretty nice"
College Freshman,2,"Not very frequent, and no alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"It took a while to get necessary information. They listed it on the website, but i should have gotten an email, or notification by mail. I shouldn't have had to hunt for the information."
College Junior,2,The caf is nice i like the atmosphere. and unlimited food is the best.. but there are so few optionssss
College Sophomore,2,"The people in the financial aid offices are very rude. They take forever to clear your financial needs. They rarely pick up the telephones.

You have to be blunt and straight to the point with the financial aid process.

Go to the offices, don't even think about calling them."
College Senior,2,Involvement in Greek life is the only way to have a major say for on campus politics and give input for on campus events and use of money.
College Freshman,2,I need one now as we speak because my account is on hold
College Freshman,2,"Frat parties in my experience have been not so great, you have to go off campus if you actually want to have fun."
College Junior,2,I basically had to do everything and figure everything out on my own. I maybe had a little of assistance.
College Freshman,2,"There's so much bad rap about Greek life here - I mean, i know a few awesome people that were accepted into the Greek community here but if you get on yik-ya kon almost any given day there's so much negativity towards them"
College Junior,2,"There may be a lot of places to eat, but there isn't much variety. To get anything out of the ordinary or healthy, you have to go into Little Rock."
College Junior,2,Nothing to do there at night for students unless there is a frat party
College Junior,2,Didnt like cafeteria food. Need more of a variety and fresher foods. Have longer hours or the food court open later would be nice.
College Junior,2,"I didnt like it. Although my dorm was freshly renovated my freshamn year, the bathrooms were still disgusting."
College Junior,2,Cafeteria is terrible both for food and space. Extremely limited in healthy and special diet options. No service after early evening.
College Junior,2,The only scholarships available are to in-state students.
College Sophomore,2,There's not a lot of sites to see or anything besides food places in the town. Very few shopping centers.
College Freshman,2,I don't have a car here and really wish I did.
College Freshman,2,"Parties aren't that good. There are no clubs in Conway, and no club/party type of places for underage students. Since it is a dry county you have to drive to buy any alcohol, and the bars don't let underage in after 10-12 at night."
College Freshman,2,nothing happens on campus at night
College Junior,2,Some places that offer discounts only do it one day a week.  There are limited restaurants that deliver.  Finding healthy gluten-free options has been worse than difficult.
College Junior,2,"You have to constantly walk through the rain in the spring semester, or even snow.  We have areas that are susceptible to flash flooding.  At other times, it is extremely hot and humid and the campus is rather spread out, so it is very uncomfortable."
College Junior,2,"My school is in a dry county, so there not a nightlife here.  Students have to drive out of town for bars/clubs."
College Junior,2,"Rain rain, go away!  It's like the town is a swamp and the rain is just reiterating that face on a weekly basis."
College Junior,2,"Maybe I'm just not the biggest party person since I work and go to school, but I don't know of many parties except for the frat parties."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus shuttle only goes to a few places, and I don't even know what times they pickup.  The only people that really use it live in bear village."
College Student,2,I did not want to stay on campus because the dorms were very small compared to how they had explained them
College Freshman,2,Don't know of any campus transportation. 
College Sophomore,2,"Conway is a small, Old town.  There aren't really any attractions other than Toad Suck once a year.  Shopping is poor.  No sports and recreation.  Campus is very vibrant, but it's located in a relatively lonely town."
College Junior,2,Very expensive for college students w/I jobs 
College Junior,2,Have few choices and they fill up quickly
College Sophomore,2,UCA invests in a lot of things but they lack in providing enough parking for college students. UCA gets more and more students every year and the parking is getting worse.
College Sophomore,2,"They always lose me or blame the other end, and I have to wait for my aid"
College Freshman,2,"Conway, Arkansas is not the place to be if you are looking for nightlife in Arkansas."
College Freshman,2,"UCA offers a good physical therapy program at their school, it is listed as Number 44 in the nation, in terms of how good they are."
College Freshman,2,They're good for a college w/ the amount that UCA has.
College Freshman,2,"Weather is weather, I can't change that."
College Sophomore,2,I have had some trouble finding financial aid scholarships for myself as a student.
College Senior,2,"I will admit that it's hard to find healthy food and though the cafeteria has good food when we have visitors its not very great other times of the week. You can find something good, just not good AND healthy."
College Junior,2,"They are trying to make parking more of an ease for students, but most lots fill up quickly and you usually have to park in the back and the walk to campus is usually 5 to 10 minutes from any lot."
College Junior,2,I gave this grade because no boy or girl is different from any other student. He/she has their own label as far as being an individual
College Sophomore,2,"Some classes and teachers are absolutely amazing, but some are terrible. It just depends."
College Sophomore,2,It's not any better or worse than any other college campus
College Sophomore,2,"There are several different minorities and ideas present at UCA, however they are never seen. Generally it is only white students who are in sororities or fraternities that are favored and and are in charge of all organizations and events. Other clubs are neglected or not given as much importance."
College Sophomore,2,The transportation at UCA that I know of is from bear village apartment(dorms) and it from 7a.m. to 7p.m. Its not bad it you live in bear village.
College Freshman,1,It's terrible here. Not as bad as state schools but still pretty bad.
College Student,1,"I hate that UCA has Greek life. It segregates the students, not unites them. I wish they hadn't started."
College Sophomore,1,I tried getting scholarships but no work.
College Freshman,1,"What Greek Life? Oh yeah, that life.."
College Sophomore,1,Campus food seriously sucks. I honestly go and buy my own food from Walmart and Krogers. I only eat on campus if it's a necessity.
College Freshman,1,"I honestly hate it. The bathrooms are gross and always have weird bugs in there. And there's only one washer/dryer for the whole floor, which is ridiculous. I really don't recommend Campus Housing."
College Freshman,1,I never hear of any parties
College Sophomore,1,Our city is too small for public transportation. We just have a shuttle to get students to and from the softball field and to and from Bear Village Apartments.
College Freshman,1,"UCA tries to build itself on having a good Greek Community, but frat's aren't all that they're made out to be."
College Freshman,1,"Conway, Arkansas and Nightlife do not mix well together."
College Freshman,1,"The cafeteria is a hit and miss here at UCA. Sometimes the food they serve is outright gross, while other times it's pretty delectable. However, when the weekends get here, you better fend for yourself because they close up dinner before 4:30 on saturdays."
College Sophomore,1,You can never find good parking unless you come 45 minutes before the first classes of the day. If you're late you usually have to park in off limit areas that earn you a ticket; it is very inconvenient.
College Sophomore,1,My financial aid was canceled and I received no notification of it.  I only learned of it when I never received my excess aid.  Even if your financial aid officer is in charge of notifying you of changes in your status it is still up to you to check it yourself frequently to avoid the negative effects of other's incompetence.
College Sophomore,1,"The drug scene at UCA is big on drinking and a on drug. Conway is a dry county so if they are trying to drink , its a drive."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Never any parking, better get to school 45min to an hour before class...Even after you park your still walking across campus"
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the parking on campus is usually very far from where you want to park. They have visitor parking in areas that should be for students, and by the way parking in visitor or staff parking will get you parking tickets every time and they double if you do not pay them within 30 days. I usually have to park down the street from campus and ride the shuttle bus to campus. Parking is good for those who live on campus but not at all good for those that live off campus."
College Freshman,1,My financial aid experience at UCA has been questionable. Part of the reason is my fault. I applied to the school after the freshman scholarship deadline. So because of that I have no scholarship from UCA whatsoever even though I accepted into the school a couple of weeks after the deadline. All other scholarships offered by the school are mostly Alumni scholarships which makes my financial situation very difficult and stressful.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is truly awful, even for those that reside here. People are often getting parking tickets because of the lack of open spaces. It's more reliable to just walk than drive around. There is a good chance you won't be able to find a parking spot. And even then, there is no guarantee it'll be close to your destination."
College Freshman,1,Parking is bad at UCA. They need a new parking lot. Tickets are given daily to those who park where they know they shouldn't. Cars can be towed if not moved on game days. I personally think you need a car on campus but it's a hassle. Parking far away from your dorm is very usual. You are considered lucky if you get a spot outside your residence hall.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is limited and small and very far apart. The cops are also strict when it comes to ticketing for parking. They're not exactly pricey but not cheap either. You have an inch on the line or your permit doesn't show the slightest bit correctly, you'll get fined. Honestly once i park my car i don't want to move it. You mostly carpool anywhere anyways but still you want a car for yourself sometimes."

Alum,5,It's a good accredited University in a small town in Iowa. Professors are knowledgeable and try to work with you. It's a save campus and the on-campus experience offers students to keep pursuing their athletic aspirations.
Sophomore,5,"From the very beginning, Waldorf University staff was fully invested in getting me enrolled quickly.  I am an older student and time is of the essence and they were wonderful to work with."
Graduate Student,5,I am a 2019 graduate of Waldorf University with a Master’s in Organizational Leadership.  This school has exceeded my expectations on many fronts.  The instructors are well versed in their chosen fields and provide students with a well-rounded breath of knowledge.  I have attended four other universities throughout my educational journey and Waldorf ranks at the top.  My sincere thanks to Waldorf and their faculty for their top notch service.
Niche User,5,I will be an incoming freshman fall of 2020.  I have spent time on the campus for a volleyball camp the coaches are welcoming and made me feel at home.  With the smaller environment I feel safe walking around.  I have been to a few sporting events and the support the students give to one another is exactly what I have been looking for.
Junior,5,"The online library is fantastic, the student services team reaches out on a consistent basis and responds quickly when a student is in need."
Sophomore,5,I started with Waldorf in their online degree program and I can’t say enough good things about it. Every week you are getting emails reminding you work is due or just to ask how things are going. The advisors really take the time to make sure everything is spelled out for the student.
Junior,5,"Through the online program I was able to earn my AA in Psychology. The tuition price is not bad and one of the best parts is that through their loan-a-book and book grant programs, your books are free so long as you return them in good condition and pass the class. In some cases, you are even able to keep the books for free after passing the course."
Senior,5,"Their online program is very easy to work.  The student advisors are great at communicating and assisting with signing up for classes and degree completion. They always respond to messages within two days.  I have also always been assisted with completing forms for my job.  Everyone is very nice and knowledgeable.  The classes are very well priced as well, especially for online courses.  There is a wide variety of courses to choose from, and varied degree plans. I would recommend this school to anyone.  They also give out some awesome swag for free, to students.  I have received a t-shirt and coffee mug, and I use both frequently."
Senior,5,"Waldorf University is a fantastic university! The academic programs, professors, faculty, and staff members are awesome!"
Junior,5,"Good School with good academic level, professor are willing to know you better and help you in 1v1 scenarios. Small school but with a big diversity, enrichment of knowledge if you get to meet people."
Senior,5,"Great Campus, I don’t understand some of the negative reviews. I have enjoyed my experience. Although the campus food could use a little help."
Senior,5,"Waldorf is a multidisciplinary school that provides resident and online programs to many students of different backgrounds. I am a United States Military member pursing my education to become an Emergency Management professional. I am proud to study at Waldorf because I feel understood and provided for. Professors and staff are willing to work around erroneous schedules and difficult times in life. The online experience provides a great personal manner that relates the student and entire class together with the professor. 

Every professor and staff member I've dealt with has been professional, caring, and supportive. My educational goals are given a highlight and I am driven to achieve and exceed them with a backbone of faculty and students to help. 

Go Warriors!"
Alum,5,I had a beautiful experience at Waldorf College. They offered a robust program focused on the typical working parent. Extremely impressed
College Freshman,5,They are very free with people and listen to ideas and opinions.
College Freshman,5,No one put pressure on you to do what you don't want to do.
College Freshman,5,"i intend to be part of an internship program in order to familiarized with aspects of nursing, anatomy and medicine."
College Freshman,5,Waldorf has great sense of responsibility when it comes to sexual abuse even though there hasn't been a case ever.
College Freshman,5,Waldorf has been a motivating and career building institution to be a part of.
College Sophomore,5,"Waldorf is the best choice.  Sure its a small school but everyone knows everyone and you make friends easily.  the teachers are great and help you as much as they can,  and they make sure you don't fail, even if they have to receive late work or extra credit.  If you are an athlete Waldorf is the best choice for you, especially if you want to be on the girls wrestling team.  There's not much around the school since its in such a small town but the school does take you places like the zoo, the Mall of America and other fun places all for free.  Everyone is so nice and loving here and i believe the most beautiful thing about Waldorf is the campus especially when it is spring and autumn."
College Senior,5,You're safe. Virtually no crime.
Freshman,4,"Admission, financial aid and counselling departments were all very helpful. 
The cost of tuition was reasonable in comparison to other colleges."
Junior,4,Waldorf University is an excellent place to begin and or continue ones educational career. I would highly recommend this university to others.
Junior,4,I am currently in the process of enrolling to complete my bachelor's degree online with them and they have been so helpful and quick to respond to questions. They all seem very willing to help with anything I need!
Junior,4,I like the support that I get from my academic advisor. She let's me know when registration opens to give me ample time to get my Ta form submitted. I have only done online classes.
Junior,4,"Good online experience.  Staff is very helpful in getting application, transfer credits, and registration completed."
Freshman,4,"Waldorf is a beautiful school with a welcoming place. It is in the middle of nowhere, making it really hard to have fun outside of the school. It gets very cold to the point where its hard to walk outside to class. The teachers are very caring, and work well with athletes."
Senior,4,Waldorf University so far has been a great school with outstanding staff. The only issue I have is that for some reason I am constantly being assigned new academic advisors and student services representatives which make it hard to have someone who knows your college goals. Especially with me being an online only student it would be nice to have had the same person working with me throughout my college career.
College Freshman,4,Science professors are great in all aspects of teaching students to understand. Humanities makeup assignment for orientation are highly stressful.
College Freshman,4,Greek life make up an individual and allows them to express themselves freely.
College Freshman,4,"Athletic department at Waldorf is great since it show a good example to students and teaches cooperation among student, coaches and teachers."
College Junior,4,"The employment rate of Waldorf is pretty good. I won't have an issue getting a job because of my major but overall, Waldorf is pretty good about making sure their students get the training and help they need."
College Junior,4,"In my three years at Waldorf, I have only heard of a few safety concerns regarding sexual assault"
College Junior,4,I love the friendly atmosphere and programs that the residence life staff organize. They do a fantastic job!
College Junior,4,I have loved getting to be at Waldorf! They do a great job of being available for their students and I feel like I can really talk to most of my professors whenever I need to!
College Senior,4,They have been very helpful throughout my academic experience.
College Junior,4,great way to meet new people
College Senior,4,"I feel extremely safe on campus. There are hardly any issues with health or safety other than the occasional theft. Sexual assault does happen once in a while, but it is not very frequent at all. The campus works well to keep everything safe, keep students informed, and support them with any issues."
College Senior,4,"I am so pleased with majors at Waldorf. As a student, you are encouraged and assisted throughout all your years here. Teachers help you get the most out of your studies. I was able to double major with hard work, but with ease. The admission process is easy and not very strict; the better your grades and test scores, the better your academic scholarships."
College Senior,4,"Athletics are awesome at Waldorf. More than half of the student body is involved, I would say about 80%. Everyone comes out and supports each other at athletic events; there is good school spirit, even for a small school. The facilities could still be improved, but we just got a brand new track and turf fields for softball, baseball, and football, so I think facilities will only increase and become better in the future."
College Senior,4,"There is a good ratio of girls to guys; in the past there have been more male students than female students but this has fixed itself in the past few years. There is a variety of interests, hobbies, looks, and social lives of students. I think this adds to the diversity and fun of campus. There isn't one set type of look that is 'in' or 'popular'. Popularity doesn't really exist--everyone is friends with one another, seriously."
Niche User,2,"Starting my freshman year at Waldorf, I thought that this school was going to be the best fit for me. I was wrong. I was involved in band there, which I was not a fan of because of the organization and quality. The academics felt like they were easier than my high school classes ever were, but the professors were all really nice. Maybe for the right person this University could be the right fit, but definitely not me. They do offer really good scholarships, so you really don't have to take out loans."
College Junior,2,"Even though most of Waldorf's teams don't perform well, the fans are always supportive and we have great school spirit"
College Freshman,2,My town is better and it's smaller...
College Junior,2,The weather is very cold and snowy. I do not like it. if the school was an hour south it would be more convenient. 
College Senior,2,There is not much transportation around Waldorf to use if you don't have car. Most of the community is walking distance from apartments and dorms. Having a means of transportation is not necessary unless you live outside of Forest City where the college is.
College Junior,2,It is good sometimes but it seems like when its  good then everything is good but when its bad you basically do not eat that time.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not alot of people on campus. It is very dry, I don't like it here at all."
College Sophomore,2,The Campus is very dry and there isn't much to do.
Senior,1,"I am very disappointed with this college due to the lack of help received f et om financial aid. After being accepted and completed a year, I was told that I had exhausted my financial aid and that I wr would pool at on my own in order to complete my studies.  The financial aid office never offered me any assistance.  I am a single mother and unemployed and cannot afford to lay the amount of money requested on my own. The sad part is that my gpa is 3.88.  I am an excellent student.  I am stressed as a result of the lack of help from my financial aid office."

Freshman,1,"Recommend to students who are from small city and can handle non city lifestyle. Not a lot of city life, small area, campus housing was average, not the best. Food sometimes had hair in it and was average. Overall the school was okay, most of the professors worked with you to be successful."
College Freshman,1,Food isn't of very good quality.
College Sophomore,1,The food here is the worst. There's only one cafeteria and the serve alot of leftovers.
College Junior,1,Health Code Expectations? I have had moldy food and there is not a good variety!
College Junior,1,"Few Options – Not only few options, but Waldorf makes it difficult to move off campus."
College Junior,1,"Not much to do besides go to Shooters or go to a party.  But if you go to a party, the cops ALWAYS bust it."
College Junior,1,"Nothing to Do? If we need to go anywhere, we had to take at least a 30 minute drive.  They should get more things to do in Forest City. Such as a different restaurant, I bet McDonald's would make so much money.  And possibly a Wal Mart or something else like a Wal Mart because Pamida is too expensive!"
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – The police force and campus security is extremely strict. They allow drinking on campus even if you are of age. As for off-campus, the police is extremely  strict and usually bust every party."

Senior,5,"I am approaching my final semester at this school and have good overall feelings from my experience. Even though they had their share of issues, (I identify as a Black-Male Student; so, I would know) I would not trade the experience for another. The location is superb and travel capabilities are spectacular (the U-Pass was my life line pre-Covid). This school also has many resources for students; however, you have to go looking for them. This does not mean faculty is willing to help when they can. I am aware some students felt misrepresented by the school, but, I loved my experience and the people I met. I gathered a number of connections from this school. I believe the student body of American University will change the world.

Side note: I loooove Kogod School of Business and all the professors who walk the halls. I plan to graduate on-time with a B.S. in Accounting."
Alum,5,"Fantastic faculty with real-life/hands-on experience in the international relations field, academic and career support for students, beautiful campus, and great academic and research focus."
Alum,5,"I had only one online learning course at American University, delivered via BlackBoard, and it was a positive, organized experience."
Junior,5,"Every university has its problems, but I was lucky enough to find a home at AU. The faculty, administration, and student body are welcoming and kind. I would like to see the administration reform policies when it comes to student conduct and the ways they handle Title 9, but when it comes to the learning environment, the campus facilities, and professional development opportunities it is a perfect balance in one of my favorite cities."
Junior,5,"Professors, especially in the School of Communications, are very. well trained to teach both in persona and online."
Junior,5,"Professors have been more than accommodating in conducting their online classes. While not perfect, I think I am still getting as good an education as is possible under the circumstances."
Junior,5,"I really love American University. Every professor I have had is impressive and knowledgeable, and the friends I have made inspire me to better, more engaged, and open-minded."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a current Sophomore at AU majoring in Public Health, So far schooling here has been very rewarding with a fairly diverse student body ethnically/religion wise and vastly different in terms of passions/political views. The one universal factor I've found is student's passion for politics high-level of intelligence.

Academics are great/almost all of the professors. Additionally the dorms/campus/safety are top notch. Only two things that this school lacks are the food(although the food is far from as bad as people complain it is, there are a ton of options+ constantly taking criticism to heart and improving in this department every semester. 

The only thing this school lacks is a noticeable party scene, small dorm parties happen/the RAs are almost all chill. The lack of a larger scene may due in part to how isolated students were in high school but in my experience even the most nerdy of the students come round rather quickly. Note: Didn't do greek life last year,  take that in2 ac"
Freshman,5,"American is driven by opportunity. Even before students start classes for their freshman year, they receive communication from multiple different campus organizations. Students are encouraged to get active in classes, research, internships, and extracurriculars. AU has a huge support system to make sure that all of its students have the opportunity to succeed. The have a small general education program that allows students to choose the classes they want to satisfy their core requirements. This allows the student to get a liberal arts education but focus more of their time on things they want to study."
Freshman,5,"Classes moved online for the semester, but they are still effective. The teachers are very responsive to emails because they want to see success. We are also changing our learning platform, but that isn't causing too many issues. It actually provides more ways to get in contact with the teachers."
Junior,5,"My experience at American University has been such a fulfilling one. As a Junior, I have already learned so much in just my two years at AU. From taking unique complex problems courses about the various moral and ethical global issues, to having caring professors and mentors in Neuroscience. I have grown both intellectually and personally at this institution, and would 100% recommend this university to any student in any major."
Junior,5,"Transitioning to an all online spring semester due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, all of my classes and professors transitioned to an online instruction swiftly. While an adjustment was made on both the students and Professors part, my professors were all caring and supportive as we all navigate through this tough time."
Junior,5,"Impecable learning environment, great connection between Professors and students and many resources available to those who need it. Too expensive tho for what they offer, especially in terms related to dining services and housing."
Junior,5,It's an inspiring environment where you're never bored or cannot find something to do. The staff is always open to make time for you and there are many opportunities on campus to get involved and network.
Freshman,5,I love how American University has a really good international relations program for students who are interested in that field. Its location in Washington DC makes it an ideal place to get internships and experience what the nation's capital has in stock. The professors are all nice and helpful and the student body is fairly diverse. I really liked how classes were medium-sized so that each student was able to receive the attention they needed.
Alum,5,I had a great time at American University. I loved the ability to have both a traditional campus feel and access to a big city. I enjoyed my classes and my major. I feel like I learned a lot at American University.
Sophomore,5,"A school that can take some getting used to, but in the end a very good institution with endless opportunities for its students. As a Kogod student I get emails every day with internship opportunities and panel events. The professors all have good experience in their fields and in my experience have been very helpful in all circumstances. Groups can be cliquey and the party scene can be hard to break into but honestly if you just go out and try to talk to people you are most likely going to befriend them as AU students tend to be somewhat reserved. There are numerous clubs to join that range from cheese club to the Financial Management Association and Greek Life is also a great opportunity to make friends. American is definitely not for everyone because you have to try kinda hard to find social events due to a lot of students living off campus and a limited athletics scene, but if you give a little effort you will find your way into the social world and have a great time."
Graduate Student,5,"American University is situated in the heart of Washington, D.C., providing easy access to an abundance of internships and career opportunities for students to take advantage of. During my four years at American University, I was actively involved in extracurriculars and leadership roles with Sigma Kappa Sorority and PRSSA. I pursued internships with a variety of employers such as PR Collaborative, DC SCORES, and the McCain Institute and excelled in my academics as a Public Relations/Strategic Communications major. 

Attending American University put the world at my fingertips. While pursuing my full-time degree I discover other passions such as education and public policy. I connected with professors and experts in my field that gave way to me receiving full-time offers immediately after graduation in my area of study. I am very satisfied with my undergraduate experience at American University and am proud to be among the thousands of alumni who have graduated from this school."
Graduate Student,5,"I graduated from American University in May 2019 so I did not experience the shift to remote learning in the wake of COVID-19. However, there were a few instances in my academic career where I was required to join my classmates online for classes and to complete assignments in real-time. During those circumstances, I found the experience to be intuitive and conducive to online learning. Productive lectures were able to result in an online environment. 

I will be returning to American University this Fall as a part-time Master's candidate and expect to complete my courses online as the university is moving forward with classes in a blended learning fashion. I expect my classes to remain just as interactive as in-person classes and look forward to starting in August."
Freshman,5,I hate this school with a burning passion. It is a huge waste of money and a miserable learning environment for all.
Sophomore,5,"If political science and international affairs are things you are interested in, American University is the place for you. The faculty are extremely knowledgeable and often leaders of research in their field. The campus is beautiful and perfectly situated within the city to keep the college feel while still offering everything a big city can."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, in the northwest quadrant of DC, super close to the city, yet still provides students with a traditional campus environment. A relatively small school but this is a great amenity since students can get to know their teachers very personally, which can later help them land an internship or a job. There are many clubs and sports to get involved with on campus, and as long as you immerse yourself into everything that American has to offer, you will find great friends, classmates, and professors who care about your success after college. The social scene is also great since they provide all students with a metro pass, allowing them use the metro rail or the busses whenever, which makes exploring the city and the areas around it, even easier. I love going to school at American and I am so glad I made the right choice for my future to go here."
Freshman,5,I really liked the campus and the alumni.  The location and campus was absolutely perfect for my needs.  AU really seemed to care about my wellbeing and my ability to succeed in that environment.
Alum,5,"I went to AU from 2012-2016, and I really enjoyed my time there. Since I was in SIS and Kogod mainly I do not know much about the other colleges, but I can say that those two programs have really good professors, high-quality academics, and really motivated students"
Niche User,5,My overall experience at American has been amazing thus far! The professors are so caring and always strive to help their students. There diversity here is great and every student is represented. The opportunities that American gives to their students are incredible and they helps set up their students for success beyond college. The DC area is also a great place to live and their are so many things to do.
Sophomore,5,"American University is a very good school for opportunities, internships, getting an education and a social life. Gives you great experience with being on your own. The professors are very helpful, kind and understandable. You also get to experience 4 seasons and have fun whiles being on campus in general. Academics is very good and helps you to think critically and help with on hands learning. It is also a good place to socialize and find your circle of friends. There are good places to eat; Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Chick Fil A, Panera, and others as well. There are also varieties of places to eat on campus ."
Alum,5,"American University is a great place to get a degree, the professors are experts, the course offerings expansive, and the career center is excellent. Overall the school is very focused on ensuring students are prepared for and find jobs post-graduation. Campus social life is present and active, but less so than larger state universities. The location in DC can't be beat for both internships and night life, which is very accessible to the student body."
Freshman,5,"Since I began my freshman year at American University the overwhelming welcome that I received has been amazing. This is a campus that continues and strives to diversify themselves international and domestic students. Along, with the desire improve the safety and protection of the community and campus; American University shows their it's dedication through their involvement and events with the students on campus and ultimately their actions as a university."
Niche User,5,"It was very beautiful, and the people were extremely nice. It felt comfortable and safe. I took a tour and got to learn a lot about the school and what it offered. Everything from Kogod to the SIS program sounded amazing. In addition, the campus is beautiful. The variety of plants is astounding and makes the campus come to life."
Graduate Student,5,"Great school, student body, and faculty.  Convenient downtown location with emphasis of producing the highest results."
Freshman,5,"American University has a community that is extremely appealing to me. For starters, the blooming diversity is something that catches my eye immediately. As a black person who was born in America with Caribbean parents, meeting people from different countries and cultures is something that has always been important to me. Moreover, I can tell that AU cares about its students. During my dual enrollment program, this school has always made me feel welcome and that I have a place here. 

Additionally, the School of International Service can propel me to where I need to be. With me wanting to be a diplomat, the SIS will give me the foundation and experience to work anywhere that I want. Having said that, I know American University is the place where I want to spend the next four years of my life.‍‍‍‍"
Niche User,5,This university is one of the best universities I’ve came across . The campus is beautiful and it’s close enough to the city and it’s just gives me a sense of fresh air .
Senior,5,"I came to AU for the beautiful campus and location in DC, but upon arriving I was excited to find the level of political involvement and awareness among the student population."
Sophomore,5,"I am going into my sophmore year.  I had an awesome freshman year academically and socially.  I look forward to this year coming.  However, I could really use some help with the tuition/scholarship.  I will not be able to go back in August if I can't get any help.  

Please advise...

thank you

Jordan Keys"
Alum,5,"- science at AU is such a supportive community to be a part of
- teachers are so supportive
- prepared me for post-graduate study"
Junior,5,"I love the dance and philosophy programs here. I wish there was more diversity, inclusion, and acceptance of others. I feel that I am really finding myself here, and it is wonderful to live in DC."
Alum,5,AU was a great school to attend for my undergraduate degree. DC was an incredible city to live in - you watch history happen right before you. The faculty and professors at AU were so supportive and only wanted success for the students.
Freshman,5,"It is an incredible institution. Right in Washington dc, any student can explore all the museums and have access to downtown DC a few miles away. There is incredible professors always wanting to learn from students and there to lend a helping hand."
Niche User,5,What I liked about American University is that it is a small liberal arts college with a lot to offer.
Freshman,5,"Great atmosphere, food, and plenty of activities and academics to choose from. The students and staff want to make a difference in the world. American is a green campus and a pioneer in conservation."
Niche User,5,"I loved American University as soon as I set foot on campus. The campus is beautiful, and the people there are incredibly friendly. The tour I took there was amazing, and I can't wait to spend the next four years of my life there."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love AU. My classes are interesting and the work is manageable. The professors are chill, passionate and very approachable. The extracurricular opportunities are beyond amazing. I love theater, and have discovered endless performance opportunities. One is not restricted to one subject here; it is the ideal school for a Renaissance woman. AU is not a notorious party school but people do go out and there is a nice social scene. I have become part of multiple friend groups in just my first semester of freshman year. The dorms are not fantastic but they are acceptable, and there is a great sense of community in the residence halls. The campus is beautiful, and we have almost unlimited access to an international city. I truly feel I belong at AU and I couldn't be happier."
Niche User,5,"American University has an excellent network of internships in and around the Washington, D.C. area."
Junior,5,I love the environment on campus as well as the city of D.C. itself. There is a lot of history and a niche for any student that passes through its halls.
Graduate Student,5,"It was the only well known school in the area that did not require a GMAT.  It offers an online program for people living around the area, such as myself."
Junior,5,"Best university ever! The professors are beyond incredible people, the people are great, and the programs are challenging yet incredibly enticing. Changed my life forever and I'm so grateful."
Niche User,5,"American University has such a beautiful campus, amazing programs, polite staff, and an environment that strives to help its students succeed."
Graduate Student,5,"In my experience, enrolling in AU has a wonder experience. they prepare you for real work experiences and network is great"
Sophomore,5,"It is the university of my dreams. First, because of the nice people I've met, and secondly, the great professors.
I loved all subjects I learned there, which have taught me beyond the reading materials."
Niche User,5,I went here for nslc and this university made the experience all the more memorable and better. The dorms are good quality and the staff are amazing this university is beautiful and a great location.
Graduate Student,5,"Being in DC, you are in the epicenter of policy and international development.  American University has some of the top professors in the field who are working as well as teaching, so they have great expertise to pass on."
Graduate Student,5,"I am new to American University's Masters of Science in Finance program. So far I have felt a great amount of administrative support from the university's student advising team and career services team. There's no doubt in my mind, I am in for a great experience."
Graduate Student,5,"It is a great place to go to school, even though it is rather expensive. They will give you hands-on skills that you need to pursue a career in government, NGO, media, etc. Also the location is very good, with lots of opportunities to intern"
Niche User,5,Overall a great experience working with this University so far. AU was my top choice (choosing AU was a no brainer) but I am currently working on an appeal for financial aid.
Graduate Student,5,"The education is great, professors really invest in students education and want to help them understand and succeed inside and outside the classroom. Faculty are always creating opportunity for students to become involved and make connections to get internships and jobs. There is never a shortage of connections."
Freshman,5,"American University was able to give me a great financial aid package, and I was exposed to countless jobs in DC!"
Alum,5,"Best decision of my life. The student population is not too big and not too small, with hundreds of student organizations or volunteer groups to join. The professors are top notch and genuinely care about your education and future career goals. In addition, the career center is huge and efficient, offering advising on everything from internships and graduate/law school searches to interviewing for jobs at any point in your career. Once an Eagle, always an Eagle!"
Junior,5,"I absolutely love AU. I was never one of those kids that was excited about going to college-- in fact, I dreaded it right up to the day I left home. I never liked the idea of the typical college experience, with the hordes of students, giant lecture classes, football-obsessed mania, and more interest in partying than academics. From the very first day of orientation, I knew I had picked the right place, and what I had dreaded for so many years became even more enjoyable and enriching than anything I'd experienced before. The best thing about life at AU is definitely the location."
Sophomore,5,"I love my college so much and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. AU has the prettiest little campus in a really nice part of DC. There's a ton of synagogues nearby, which is awesome for me as a Jew and the school has great Academic support. The only problem that I have found at the school is the dining hall (TDR), which is quite honestly awful but I don't think that's worth taking off a star from the overall review. You don't really go to college to get good food. You go because its where you want to be and I love this school. If you want to study politics, don't go anywhere else but AU!"
Niche User,5,"Whenever I visit the campus, it is in pristine shape. The students and faculty are very friendly. They produce driven and motivated students with an abundance of opportunities. Physically, the campus is beautiful with flowers all over."
Senior,4,"The professors I had are (once we went online) are quite concerned about my health and zoom fatigue. Some professors even allow students to turn off the camera if we need a break; however, attendance plays a major part."
Freshman,4,"I took all 5 classes online. 
I'm taking Arabic, which is a 5 credit course. There are so many language opportunities for tutoring and conversational practice. The language professors are great and know how to make online class very engaging!
There are topics that you can pick for your class (and requirement)- the topics are vast and very interesting. It's easy to really customize your education."
Freshman,4,"I would like to have a ballroom dancing class in the future. I'm hoping AU will be in-person in the spring, but AU has made the transition to online class very easy so I'm not worried if we're online in the spring."
Sophomore,4,"I really love AU's campus and overall location. I feel like you can get anywhere you want to go in DC, since public transportation is really accessible. The dorms were pretty average, but you can't have too high of expectations with any dorm living. The buildings at AU vary, some are old and some are very new. This is definitely he school for you if you are interested in Political Science or International service."
Alum,4,online class was actually better because you could just mute the wonks spewing literal nonsense just to hear themselves speak
Junior,4,"Most of my professors have been to adjust to online teaching which is good. I have also been able to complete my assignments on time. I really personally dislike online learning though, it feels as though I am teaching myself this material and am overworked. I receive so many assignments everyday- it's ridiculous the amount of work I am expected to complete. I also am upset that my work-study money was taken away. Overall the online learning experience is okay, but I would recommend students take a semester/year off if they are thinking of coming here. Learning in person is a much better experience."
Junior,4,"I am glad I am getting my education at American University. They are known for having an excellent Political Science department, and they do! I am very fond of all my professors and they have very impressive resumes. They have been a wonderful tool in regards to learning and finding internships. I have also met some of my best friends at this school. I have a few issues with the administration though. They don't take racist incidents or mental health issues seriously. AUPD thinks their an actual police department and are very controlling as well as biased. The school has a real issue when it comes to helping students in general. Also, the overall culture of the school is toxic and concerning."
Graduate Student,4,"American University is one of the few schools in the Washington DC area that offer a degree in Taxation. It is highly rated by the Big Four companies in the region so for career outlook, it is great. The school provides virtual career fairs with very well-known employers. The classes are very knowledgeable and the professors bring real world experience into each lesson. The classes are exciting and makes you think outside the box. American University provided me with a well-rounded, career focused education. As a student, the career center has been impressive with the events, career fairs, and guest speakers have been interesting."
Graduate Student,4,"American University is a beautiful campus in the Washington DC area. My experience at AU has been amazing. I am currently enrolled in the Master of Business Administration Program (Online). All the professors have real world experience and do a really good job preparing you for the future. The professors are willing to meet and discuss with students at any point in time. However, AU lacks severely in diversity and does not offer much financial assistance to pursue a degree. The best they offer is a scholarship based Research Assistant position that pays minimum wage.  I would recommend the MBA program to anyone who wants a challenge and very rewarding education. The connections and contacts that a student will make is value for ones future."
Junior,4,"I really like that the university takes time for all of its students. Faculty go out of their way to help people out more often than larger schools. The students on campus have this collective belief that they are part of something bigger than themselves, which inspires hard work and passion. During my time so far at this university, professors have been genuinely kind and helpful, even when they do not know me. So many of the schools within the univeristy aare nationally ranked and they really did earn that ranking. One thing I wish could be better is tuition. It is a hefty price to pay and as a transfer student, they offer no financial aid because we will not be there for an entire four years."
Junior,4,"All of my classes at American University are online. While that is not ideal, I appreciate the courage the university had in deciding to go online to protect their students. I also appreciate that we got some discount on the tuition along with some refunds. However, even though that is more than other schools have done, I with more financial aid could be offered. Professors have adjusted surprisingly well to online classes and I feel like I am still getting a quality education even though I have to remain in my apartment. I with the university was more uniform in the software and programs used during online class because it does get a little confusing having to switch between softwares all the time."
Sophomore,4,Last semester(winter 2020) when covid initially hit my professors/university was not really prepared(At least in my experience) to move fully remote. However this semester(Fall 2020) so far both my classes and professors(all of which are online) have been great!
Junior,4,"I studied Theatre, which meant no online courses for me. It is true that the Department of Performing Arts has some very strictly- established social groups settled, but overall there's a great ambience and kind of welcoming environment, especially coming from professors."
Freshman,4,"My professors were all very clear about how their classes would be taught, whether that was online or in person. They tried their best to provide the same quality of education and resources that you would get if the class was taught in-person. However, I find that some classes I learn better if it was in person, such as a foreign language."
Alum,4,I took one class online and it went very well. You had to be responsible for your own time and involvement. We had a lot of message boards and were encouraged to comment on each other's work to start discussions.
Sophomore,4,The switch to online was done well by my American professors as covid was such a sudden situation that gave the school little time to react. Online is not my cup of tea as it is not what I signed up for but obviously covid made us switch for the end of the semester.
Sophomore,4,I really love the professors and the campus environment. It's a small university and very close to downtown DC.
Sophomore,4,"I have not taken any online courses until we were forced to have online classes due to COVID-19. I feel like the transition was a bit confusing, but overall not a bad experience."
Sophomore,4,"Great educational environment and very academic focused, creating a prestigious environment while also maintaing a liberal approach. LGBTQ+ friendly. Beautiful campus and surrounding area. Racial issues tend to be a reoccurring instance with AU, as they lack the proper representation within staff in order to understand their POC students. Hate speech and crime towards students has little to no consequences but as a Black student, I still feel safe and connected to people similar to me. Financial aid isnt the best."
Sophomore,4,"What I like the most about American is the environment and space that the students and faculty provide. Everyone that goes to this school is driven and eager to help others. Although it is a small campus, the community feels more like a family than any other university that I have visited. There are excellent professors of many backgrounds and students from all over the globe. Students are encouraged to go outside of their comfort zones and are given an infinite amount of opportunities. My experience here has been fantastic, but the only downside is the price."
Sophomore,4,"As the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, we were transferred to an online platform. Professors were stressed, as well as the students and faculty, but they were extremely communicative and flexible during this crisis. Although the online experience is not identical to being inside the classroom, professors were extremely helpful from the transition all the way to finals."
Niche User,4,I did not take any classes online. Lalalalallpllalalalalallalslslsllslslalsbbh. Vhnrbeishchcbrbejaoidhcbfb
Senior,4,The professors are really good and so are the classes but the administration and organization of the university is lacking.
Alum,4,"Very good university academically. The campus is ok, they do a lot of construction on it which has made it messy for the past few years. There is a lack of campus culture because most students live off-campus and they do not care about sports."
Sophomore,4,"American University is a unique experience at best. It is a University like no other, but not in a bad way. The professors are extremely invested in seeing their students do well and they stay in contact after the semester. Academics are challenging but not impossible. The party scene is not only through greek life but it explores the nightlife of Washington, DC. Always extremely crazy and fun though. Definitely not a sports school, not at all. Little school spirit, but there is a political and activist spirit. However, the sports spirit can be used for DC teams or going to nearby schools with more focus on athletics. I've thoroughly enjoyed all my time here at AU!"
Freshman,4,"I would love to see more food options and better financial aid. It is frustrating how little money they give yet how expensive the school is. I love the professors and the incredible backgrounds they come from. I had one professor who was the lead prosecutor for the DC Sniper case; only a DC school could offer something that personal. The class sizes are ideal and the largest class I’ve had is 30 people. The party scene is present if you want it and there are a lot of justice orientated clubs. I wish there were a bit more “fun” clubs and ways to express yourself. While it is great there are so many clubs working to create change, it can often feel hard to catch a break from politics and problems of the world. Overall, love the school and glad I decided to go here."
Freshman,4,It was a good experience i got to learn so much and had a wonderful time. The people and the location made it easy for me to enjoy and love.
Freshman,4,"American University is very sustainable for anyone concerned about the environment. Despite being in a large city, it is full of all different kinds of plants and is a certified arboretum, as well as having its own bee hives."
Freshman,4,The school is expensive but the professors and education they give are hard to beat.  People are friendly and location is fun and provides great internship and career opportunities.
Alum,4,"Good school, lots of international students, quality differs a bit depending on major and desired career path. The school has seen lots of construction over the recent years, expanding the available dorms. A little out of the way from the main areas of DC, but these are accessible by bus and metro. There are always plenty of internship opportunities downtown."
Freshman,4,"Academics are great, campus is cool (aside from all the construction, I guess), and the location is pretty ideal. But the party/social scene is pretty ass especially if you're a guy. Close to nothing happens at AU, you almost always have to go to GW or Georgetown."
Freshman,4,"Everyone here is very nice, and there’s always something here for everyone. You make friends on the first day and once you leave you always can’t wait to come back."
Niche User,4,"A very prestigious university, provides fantastic resources and easy access to the national mall for those seeking a history or government degree. However this does turn out to be pricier than most."
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed my time at AU. The school administration was very helpful and supportive. The professors were great. I wish there was more diversity amongst the students (I was one of very few non-White students), but the school itself was great."
Junior,4,"I love going to school at AU, but it is a school that takes a while to love. The academics are great and the professors are unbeatable, but the social aspect leaves room for improvement."
Junior,4,"Good school. Expensive, but academics and research are great. I am an IR major, so I am in SIS, and the professors there are top-notch. University also has a $12000 scholarship for high GPA that helps diffuse the cost."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I’ve loved my time at American. I’ve met some amazing people from all across the United States."
Junior,4,"Being just outside the major hussle-and-bussle of city life while being mere minutes from it, American University is in one of the most perfect locations."
Senior,4,I like american university because you are able to explore yourself and find your niche within the school. You can be in both greek life while also being focused on academics.
Senior,4,"Overwhelmingly I have enjoyed my time at AU. I chose to go to AU for a combination of financial and academic reasons. Financially I was able to get strong need and merit-based scholarships that made higher education accessible to me. I was academically drawn to the school because of the opportunities it offers. The professors at AU rarely fail to impress me, I have had wonderful experiences with them and they truly are experts in their fields. The only issue I have had within the school are the students. Everybody is SO passionate to the point where it becomes taxing. The most outspoken students are very stubborn and tend to refuse to listen to opinions differing from their own. There is also a culture of wanting to represent themselves as disadvantaged in one way or the other,  as a student from a very low-income family and who pays their own tuition I experienced peers trying to explain my situation to me without attempting to understand where I was coming from."
Sophomore,4,"The Univeristy has many opportunities and amazing professors! The social life here can be boring, and students usually visit nearby campuses for more excitement."
Sophomore,4,"Although there are some negative aspects of American University, I do not see myself at any other school. One extremely negative aspect is the diversity of the school. The school likes to claim that it is diverse and inclusive, yet it is quite opposite. There was one major incident this past year of a student using racist language to other students, and the university did not have a strong comment on the matter. Another negative aspect is the campus food. There is not a lot of options for places in eat, and the few options that there are, are not healthy and gross. Dorms are like another dorms at other colleges. Some reports of mice and bugs, but I never encountered any. The party scene is pretty good, and as long as you know people you should be good."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I find American University to be very enjoyable as the educational experience is rewarding and there are kind groups of people on campus. Some issues I have run into include a very cut-throat culture as everyone tries to get an internship or a high-ranked job as soon as they get on campus. It can be emotionally stressful at times since the classes are difficult but that is to be expected when you apply. Pretty good experience though."
Sophomore,4,"I like the social and educational elements from the environment in D.C. However, there are issues with how the University addresses student complaints."
Freshman,4,"I am excited about pursuing a major in Sustainability and Global Health of the International Studies Program of the School of International Service at American University. 

I am very much satisfied by the support that it provides in regards to disability and academic support, as I have documented disabilities.

I am happy to be a part of a diverse and inclusive community."
Sophomore,4,"My experience as a student at American University has been thoroughly rewarding. The School of International Service is ranked in the top 10 best schools for international relations studies in the world, giving students incredible opportunities to study, intern, work and become involved in the community in the nation's capital. I highly recommend this university for students of any major who wish to succeed in their fields in the most important city in the United States."
Sophomore,4,"American University has a great Public Health program and allows students to explore many academic options. I enjoy the political climate and emphasis on social justice. I feel that, in general, the administration listens to its students. It also has a beautiful campus and feels very safe.

I think American University can do a much better job in creating a safe environment for students of color and students with disabilities. It also must make its mental health resources more accessible."
Freshman,4,"It's a very wonderful campus with excellent faculty and amazing people! Definitely the place to go for anyone intending to major in politics, domestic or international!"
Alum,4,"I was a commuter night student and I was impressed with the number and quality of evening classes offered and the high regard AU held in the community.

As such, I was able to secure full-time employment almost immediately as a Press Aide to a Michigan Congressman. This tallied extremely well with my Public Communications major. I have NO doubt being an AU student tipped the scale in my favor."
Freshman,4,"I really love AU. All of my classes are 18-25 people, there are barely any annoying gen ed requirements and I can mostly take what I want and explore my major. I was surprised at the party scene, it's much better than expected. There's plenty of frat parties, but also 18+ clubs downtown that are free some nights (or cheaper for girls). I was skeptical about clubs at first but they're way nicer than frat houses and you get tired of those after a while. The dorm culture is amazing, every floor has such a bond and people know each other and have really positive communities. The actual quality of the dorms is not good tho, that's why AU doesn't have a fifth star. For the price tag I hoped they'd be nicer. However, upperclassmen housing is super nice. AU has a beautiful campus, everyone is motivated and outgoing, food is meh but hey it's college. Happy with my choice."
Sophomore,4,"AU has really amazing classes and professors. The campus is also beautiful and it is in a very very nice part of DC. The food is lacking in diversity and its not particularly great, the dorms are not great but definitely not terrible, and the party scene isn't crazy but definitely alive."
Sophomore,4,"American has excellent academics for sure, however the campus culture and spirit is really sad. The social scene is very restricted and if you aren't in a sorority or fraternity it is hard to be in the social scene."
Sophomore,4,"The food is extremely subpar. However, the classes are challenging and the professors are engaging. AU is located in a beautiful section of North West Washington, DC. The social scene is diverse, and there are things for everyone."
Freshman,4,"American University has all the elements of a great urban university.  Great people, professors, and students all right in the middle of the Washington DC."
Sophomore,4,"American has far too many lefties, but other than that is a stellar university. The access to D.C. coupled with the courses make a powerful and unique experience."
Alum,4,"I commuted to and from American University as a grad student, so I cannot speak to the dorm experience or the undergrad experience. But I can say that the graduate school of psychology was an appropriately rigorous program that prepared me for pursuing my doctorate. It's a small campus located in the city of Washington, D.C., so it's perfect if you enjoy the urban atmosphere. It's quite expensive to rent a place in the area though, so if you already live in range to commute, you should do so."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the fact that I was able to take major classes as a first year to understand whether my major was the right fit for me, and it was! I am fully satisfied with the International Studies program and with the School of International Service. However, some of my professors could have definitely been more engaging and others were simply not worth AU's high price tag. Dorms are lacking in sanitation. Tenleytown, AU's location, is subpar as it is uneventful in comparison to the location of George Washington University or Georgetown."
Junior,4,I like the overall academic offering. They have great professors who are challenging and professionals in their field. Food diversity could be better.
Junior,4,"My experience in the School of Education has been wonderful. It's hands-on and supportive. I've been able to go into classrooms and assist students during my first semester! They helped narrow down what I want to do in education! Housing on campus could be better and cleaner. Currently, AU is under a lot of construction so the campus isn't as pretty as it usually is due to all of the work being done."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, American University is a solid private university. Most of the professors in the College of Arts and Sciences are excellent and really want the students to succeed. Other aspects of the school, like the financial aid department, are terrible to deal with and don't seem like they care much about graduate students."
Alum,2,"Gonna shoot straight here. If you're looking to go here don't. Probably the most annoying and self-centered people out there attend AU. I knew many cool people who transferred after one year because they couldn't take it anymore.

Additionally, the University doesn't have your best interest at heart. Food and housing both are incredibly subpar, and I know even more people who were forced to transfer bc their aid package was cut by AU. Gyms suck too and virtually nowhere to play sports recreationally. Intramural system also subpar. Truly and evil corporation.

Professors: Hit or miss, I had a lot of professors help me and a lot of professors who let their power go to their head.

Parties: Bang average

Sports: lol

Area: the area is actually really nice and not too far from the metro, but the people in spring valley are just grown up AU type wonks

Don't go here, apply to GW. You'll have more fun at like any other school"
Sophomore,2,"Believe it or not Online courses were much better, simply for not having to deal with the incredible amount of stupidity that wonders the minds of the leftist student body, however, the courses by no means benefited from this situation and some classes were difficult to execute in the online format and although there is nothing wrong with that, the last-minute approach by AU surely made it furthermore difficult."
Junior,2,"This school is absolutely not worth it for the money you pay. First of all the dorms are horrid and I can't believe students have to pay money to live there.  Food options are terrible. If you're a vegan you'll starve. There's no party scene unless you're in greek life. If you're a political science or IR major, you can probably get past the other aspects and enjoy your time there or at least get something out of it. However, if you're not, you will absolutely not be getting what you paid for or even half that worth. The administration has so many issues from unknowledgeable advisors to awful mental health resources. The only positive from this school is the study abroad opportunities. However, you can get the same or similar opportunities elsewhere. Going to this school and paying tens of thousands of dollars for it has been the worst decision I've ever made in my life financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually."
Sophomore,2,"American University makes it difficult for a social or social and driven student to thrive. The overall worst two things were limited and poor quality food options and the uneventful/boring campus. While the number of complaints I have with the school is much more than the number of things I love about the school, facing extreme change and difficulties provided me a learning experience like no other. Although, this same learning experience can be found somewhere else with a higher quality of living and lifestyle."
Junior,2,"I like the professors, but the school administration is horrible. Will not recommend this school to anyone."
Junior,2,"A school filled with students and administration who pretend to be woke but are lowkey racist and elitist. But because of this, the people of color communities ESPECIALLY the black community are so strong as a result. And the opportunities we can obtain from this degree are unmatched."
Junior,2,"Despite having a lot of friends at American and loving the DC club scene and supportive professors, I have never met a more pretentious, truly egotistical and unfriendly group of people than those at AU. People at AU lack social skills to the point where you could be at a party mid conversation and they’d blurt out “who do you know here?” before talking to you. The classes are fairly easy, although the professors are a bit overly involved and egotistical themselves, but overall the professors and internship opportunities at AU are amazing. However the high school catty-clique environment is something I never dealt with, having been an outgoing athlete in high school. Coming to DC, I was shocked to find out that every person at AU was wealthy and stuck up. Despite enjoying some of my time there and appreciating all DC has the offer, I was thoroughly disappointed by the sheer lack of genuine people at American and how self interested everyone is."
Sophomore,2,"As a rising sophomore at American, I can say that the first year I spent there was absolutely miserable. I spent my first semester in the Mentorship Program, which basically was a second coming of high school. I was stuck abroad with only 23 other students. Upon returning in the spring, I could not make any friends as everyone is an elitist pig. If you don't party hard enough at expensive clubs or do enough drugs, they won't waste their time on you. Despite sharing the same political beliefs and wanting the same change as every other student that attends the university, they discriminate against you and negate your feelings based on skin color. It's an extremely toxic environment. The only thing American has going for it is its interesting classes and professors."
Freshman,2,"As a freshman at Au thus far I have hated my experience. There is a lack of school pride and the pressure to be successful causes anxiety for many students. Since the opportunities in a city like D.C. are unlimited, I suggest you take advantage of them at another school in the area. Tuition is extremely pricey due to the fact that it is a private school, but the environment and campus for which you are pay for is not worth it. The professors are sub-par and there is little to do on campus."
Freshman,2,"Professors are amazing, all of them provide you with great opportunities to learn and develop as a student. They also have great connections to policy makers and think tanks in the city. Beyond that, everything here is completely awful. The kids are ALL socialist level liberals. Nobody here has any school spirit. The morale of the campus is constantly low, as everyone always seems depressed. If you aren't in Greek life, their is no night life. The facilities are nice, except when the school shoves you in randomly small classrooms that can't fit all your classmates. The General Education requirements are tolerable but boring. The dorms vary from being gorgeous to totally trashy. The price is the school is insanely high, and paying that much seems insane when you can go to George Washington University downtown, or Georgetown. Everyone here secretly wishes they were there. I don't recommend AU for anyone who wants a positive social college experience. "
College Sophomore,2,"We have a good basketball team, but no one really cares about sports."
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life is pretty sketchy. It's lowkey, and doesn't start recruitment until spring."
College Sophomore,2,No school spirit. No one attends games. Basketball games are slightly fun though.
College Senior,2,There has recently been a Title IX complaint against the school for failing to  follow up on a case of sexual assault in a timely manner.
College Sophomore,2,"there is no school spirit, mainly because we don't have a football team nor good sports"
College Freshman,2,"Accepting, but low diversity in race, high in religion, low in political beliefs and sexual orientation."
College Sophomore,2,"Had horrible roommates my first semester, moved off second semester freshman year. New dorms are nice with good facilities, older dorms could stand renovations. Roommate situation is luck of the draw first year."
College Freshman,2,"My dad has coached at some of the most well-funded athletic departments in the country, so compared to like University of Oregon for example, AU is awful. But our club sports are just as good as our Varsity. Everything is just really underfunded."
College Senior,2,"American University's athletic program is not the best in the world, but not the worst. The school spirit is abysmal though!"
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are a very driven SIS or Kogod student, there isn't much here to offer. Socially you can definitely have a good time put you have to put in the time and effort and it can be expensive."
College Freshman,2,No one cares about sports here. There isn't a football team. The volleyball and basketball teams are the only two people show interest in.
College Sophomore,2,There is no school spirit. No one here really played sports therefore they are not really interested in watching.
College Sophomore,2,The only parties are frat parties or sports parties and both are extremely hard to get into unless you know someone.
College Sophomore,2,"as a non-greek, Greek life takes over the party scene and it is difficult to have a good time unless you are a part of greek life or are very close with those that are in greek life. A lot of people join just so they can have somewhere to party on the weekends. For the rest of us, every weekend becomes an issue of who's throwing a party and devising a plan of how we'll get in. Also sororities aren't allowed to have houses bc it's considered a ""brothel"" in DC which is just some sexist bull***t if you ask me"
College Sophomore,2,There is absolutely no school spirit when it comes to athletics. The gyms however are pretty nice.
College Sophomore,2,The greek life is nothing like I would have expected. It is really either something you are really into or not at all.
College Freshman,2,The Health Center is expensive and useless. Personal safety is good and the campus is in a pretty safe and quiet neighborhood.
College Sophomore,2,"I was truly disappointed to discover that I was only a statistic to the school. The faculty and student body have some of the most narrow-minded group of people I have ever seen.  The school claims to have diversity but no one intermingles with anyone outside their circle.  If you are a lower-class student of color, I would think twice before coming here. If I had the opportunity I would never have come here.  I would advise perspective students to definitely visit before committing and if the environment doesn't feel right, don't come here (a name is not worth your happiness)."
College Sophomore,2,Administration sucks and the university does not care about you unless your in a special program or a grad student
College Junior,2,"I once met a homeless woman in downtown DC with a degree from AU (she showed me her ID). That should provide a good illustration of the value of a degree from AU. It works well for some students who are good at ""playing the game"", but ultimately it is not worth the money and stress it costs."
College Junior,2,"Greek life isn't huge, but it's a big part of social life on-campus, which is frustrating."
College Junior,2,"Overall the administration does its best to keep students safe and protected, but, in doing so, it is extremely flawed. Mainly, the administration prides itself on advocating for students, but, in reality, it does very little to help students in need and holds bureaucratic processes above students' well-being."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process is confusing and they do not mention everything you can complete to receive aid.
College Sophomore,2,"Frat parties are not worth it. It's nice to go every now and then just to dance and hang out, maybe meet new people, but to go on a regular would be out of the question. Clubs are much more fun, clean, maybe expensive, but worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"I just feel like everyone there is worrying about debt and trying to get multiple jobs to pay off tuition. It's been a huge distraction in my years here and worries me every day. They could give us more, there's always projects going on that don't feel needed and you just don't know really what the money is used for and if its feel. I feel like I could get the same education and experience somewhere cheaper."
College Freshman,2,"Completely honestly, I think the campus is pretty lack luster. Campus is small, at least, so there's not much to do if you're not studying or eating. The library is pretty cool, and all the architecture is okay, but nothing is all that memorable. I truly hate the dorms, though! They're terribly designed and super boring. As far as I know there aren't any ""hang out"" spots on campus except the library, in dorms, dining hall, and occasionally the quad. If everyone ""hung out"" on campus there would be 0 room. The campus is seriously so small. We don't really have any points of interest I guess other than the gym."
College Freshman,2,"The marketing AU has done really makes AU seem like a place for motivated, passionate students, but in actuality, one semester into going to school here turns almost everyone into alcoholic cut-throat jerks. Lots of people like this kind of atmosphere, but it is very hard to find anyone down-to-earth. Students are VERY unfriendly. Good luck trying to strike up a conversation outside of forced group projects. Your friends will most likely be mostly your dorm mates unless you are in greek life, so it is really the luck of the draw. In general, AU is not known for having an attractive student body. If you are looking to date on campus you will be disappointed. Girls outnumber boys so you will probably share a hook up with somebody you know at some point (if that's your thing) and it can get INCREDIBLY awkward. My advice is to avoid dating on-campus at all."
College Freshman,2,I've personally never gone to any sporting events at AU. The sports facilities are okay but some are really not taken care of at all - like the soccer and baseball field (lots of people don't even know we have one because it just looks like a big fenced area of dirt).
College Freshman,2,"I kind of have a bias against the greek system at AU, because I find the sorority and fraternity members to be one of the worst things about American in general. The Greek system has a lot more influence than AU lets on. Frats pretty much control the social scene so if you can't make an impression on them during welcome week (or don't really care to) it will be IMPOSSIBLE to party. However, joining a sorority is incredibly easy (don't know about frats, sorry) and if you just show up you will be accepted. I hear that greek life can be pretty demanding but other than what I've observed from my roommates I wouldn't know. Most non-greeks couldn't care less about greeks other than getting into their parties. I don't think that the greek orgs contribute anything else to campus at all. Over all there is a VERY greek vibe on campus, surprising for such a liberal school, and ""fitting in"" is one of the main concerns among the students. Even if they're not actually greek, they might as well be."
College Freshman,2,"Administration at AU is terrible in general. You can expect that nothing will ever go through on time, no matter the work on your part. Several of my friends were forced to leave because of administration mess-ups, and I'm no exception. The amount I was actually supposed to receive from AU upon my acceptance to the school was very generous, until it turned out I didn't receive any of it. This school is expensive and there's no getting around it."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are terrible. Cramped and gross in nearly every way. The common areas are supposed to be cleaned every night, but you will be lucky if they are cleaned once a week. The cleaning staff and people from other floors use the common facilities all the time, so you will most likely have to wait to use anything. Bugs and rats are extremely common place. The administration is also just terrible at addressing any complaints. If you like noisy and rude neighbors, terrible quality furniture, and fire alarms at three am twice a week, you've found heaven. Otherwise, avoid Anderson and the L/A quad housing in general, though I'm sure the other dorms are probably terrible, too. There are not nearly enough amenities, which is SUPER difficult when it comes down to the showers, too. Everything is just bad- I truly hated lots of stuff about American, but the dorms and the administration are by far the worst things about this school."
College Freshman,2,People here are weird so the parties are too. Alcohol is terrible
College Freshman,2,The food is not as healthy as you think and everything is just blah. not  worth 15 dollar meal swipes
College Freshman,2,There is mold and mice. Need I say more. I am moving off next year because of it
College Junior,2,The goal of Financial Aid seems to be not to give out financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,I wish people cared about sports more than they do.
College Freshman,2,"There have been constant problems receiving my awarded loans, and the system does not notify you nor allow you to view what is going on, and those who are supposed to help rarely seem to know what they're doing."
College Freshman,2,I know a few people that have been sexually assaulted - and this only in my freshman year.
College Freshman,2,A lot of people do it but I wouldn't do it even in my wildest dreams.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at AU sucks. Frats are only 40-50 people. Thats a pledge class at a real college. They are either safe, or fun. No combo. Either you run the risk of being raped, or you run the risk of having a boring night. Some frats base their judgement of the hierarchy by the hazing. Which is ridiculous considering hazing here is nothing compared to real greek life hazing. Sororities are stupid because every girl is guaranteed to get a bid if she attends all 2.5 days of rush. For this reason, stereotypes about sororities don't hold up, because they are all jam packed of girls with all different personalities and looks. Once sorority rush is over though, Sorority girls gain an amazingly large ego that basically entitles them to anything. Essentially, in the matter of a 3 hour ceremony to find out who gave you your one bid, all pledges are no longer attracted to non greek men and only devote their time to AU frats. While this isn't applicable for all sororities, it applies to a lot of them."
College Freshman,2,I was promised a scholarship which was removed halfway through first semester.
College Freshman,2,"The sports teams themselves are pretty good, as this is a DI school, but there is no school spirit in regards to athletics."
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, the girls are good looking. Most are decently nice and polite, but still tend to be very boring and lack any creativity. 80% of girls on campus look and act the same, have the same professional goals, and like the same very shallow things. There are a few gems but they are hard to find and harder to hold onto.

The boys are ranged from very good looking to very homely. Almost all believe themselves to be total playboys. Incredibly boring and can't hold a conversation about anything but drinking or kanye west.

In general, the student body of AU is incredibly boring and everyone is the same. People with the most predictable personality type come here. Very basic. If you are a creative type you will feel completely suffocated here. Nobody is interested in art, and the few people who do know very little on the matter or still remain very much in the mainstream. Anyone slightly out of the ordinary is not tolerated here. I have heard that the student body is ""passionate"" but I have not met a single person who reflects this. Similarly, most people pretend to be liberal but in reality care about very few issues, if any. If you are very preppy you will fit in just fine and meet literally countless others just like you. However, I would suggest dating off-campus because there is just not an air of interest on campus. Lots of hook-ups, though, if you are interested."
College Freshman,2,AU is incredibly bureaucratic. Clear at every turn they are only interested in making money. Everything has a charge.
College Freshman,2,"Tenleytown is 'blah'. Barely convenient. However, still better than main campus... and that's saying something."
College Freshman,2,"Not remotely worth the price. Equivalent to army barracks, with the price-tag of an apartment in Georgetown. The ""amenities"" are a joke. The rooms aren't so bad but MUCH too overpriced, therefore making everyone feel a chump for much more than they bargained for. Communal bathrooms and showers often disgusting and not cleaned reliably - same with communal kitchens. I live in Anderson though and don't know about the other dorms. The dorm walls are incredibly thin. Be prepared to hear every word your neighbor is saying. And vice versa. Not spacious at all, particularly for triple rooms. The housing and dining services are notoriously terrible. If you have an issue with your room, even one detrimental to your health, you're on your own. Heating unpredictable. Also, expect to have fire drills at 2am multiple times a month. Honestly no fun to live here. You're paying way too much to have such a sub-par experience."
College Freshman,2,"The only people who care about sports are those who participate in them. The teams are very close and bond very well, but rarely does the school come together for a game. The most people I have ever seen at a basketball game is When Michelle Obama came! There is not football team."
College Freshman,2,Only frats have parties on/near campus. Not a big party school.
College Senior,2,wish there was a bigger variety
College Freshman,2,Very clueless and not interested in student needs.
Sophomore,1,"As of now, I am a rising Sophmore and I can truly say that AU has been anything but enjoyable the past terms. From feminine professors that choose favorites and even cases in which they only give constructive feedback to women and simply disregard comments by men, to the incapable administration, to the last-minute approach to everything including administrative decisions and professor grading and updates, and to the fact that AU courses have by no means been in any way shape or form more difficult than courses taught at my high school I am extremely frustrurated by the image the school provides during applications, only to come here and realize that the school is heaven grounds for any minority, hardcore leftist and  women to have control over all school wide decisions, I am strongly urging you that if you are a person of reason and have any sort of conservative views that you do not attend here. It will honestly drive you mad how people interact and think at this school."
Alum,1,Very limited experience with online classes.  Not sure what else I can say since my experience was very limited.  I did have some problems with getting setup with logging into the school to complete assignments and no one could really assist me with fixing the problem.  I kept getting bounced around by different people telling who I should speak to about the problem.  It wasted a tremendous amount of my time trying to get it cleared up and it ended up being the school's fault and had nothing to do with my computer.
Niche User,1,Everyone was antisocial and too competitive and manipulative. Not a good environment for learning and having fun
Freshman,1,"The school absolutely is awful. There are a few good professors here and there, but the administrations what really makes this school subpar. Most of the exorbitant amount you pay in tuition is handed right back to the pockets of administrators."
Graduate Student,1,"The worst decision I have ever made in my life was to enroll in the MAIR program in this school. Advisors don't know what they are doing. I requested for mental health counseling, I made an appointment and I was given an appointment to meet with the counselor on campus (mind you I am an online student who lives in Massachusetts. Live session teachers can't even synch the online material with what they teach during live sessions. I am not sure if students who attend classes also face same issues that online students do. As far as I know, please look elsewhere for online International Relations programs. AU suck at it. I wish someone had told me this before I committed to this school."
Niche User,1,"I went into American University expecting an inclusive and supportive academic experience. Faculty don't really care about its students. Administration's bureaucracy made getting help significantly harder and a time-consuming process. The school is significantly over-priced for what they have to offer. There is a significant lack of diversity and inclusion within and outside of the classroom setting. They also have very poor mental health resources, sometimes taking an absurd amount of time to get in contact with a psychologist from the Counseling Center. I regret ever thinking this was my dream school. I dropped out after a year and a half."
Junior,1,"I wouldn't recommend the school to my worst enemy. First, I did not get in for the fall semester but rather the spring, and to make it up to me I was told that I could study abroad in the fall. I took them up on the offer and had a great time abroad. When I went back to the US when everything declined very quickly and I had a horrible time from day one.

This school is elitist and not near worth the money. The administration was never there for me for the start and has not been helpful to 90% of my friends that I have talked to. Professors have been rude to me and refused to accommodate me for an unconventional disability that I have, even with documentation to prove. I was once harassed on the floor for it and when I told the RA she refused to write up a report and defended the perpetrator rather than me.

I could go on for paragraphs longer. I usually do not give negative reviews but had to make an exception for the complete insult to higher education that is American University."
Freshman,1,"When people ask me why I transferred out of American University, I reply that it was a combination of everything. My overall experience at AU was a nightmare. I experienced food uncertainty and had to eat Freshii three times a day everyday of the week. The university did nothing to help my dietary needs. Further, I experienced the most unprofessional professors ever. This university is not worth its tuition."
Sophomore,1,"At the surface, American has a great deal to offer; however, once immersed in the university it rarely satisfies expectations. The overall climate of the campus is toxic, the student body is apathetic, and elitism is a common theme. The school is overpriced; the dorms are subpar for the cost (and some in particular are often infested with rats, bugs, or rodents); the dining hall is wretched, and the other food options are bland and tired; there is little to no school spirit or pride; stress and mental health issues are frequent and widespread throughout campus; and details do not even need to be disclosed as it pertains to racism at the school (read the news reports and articles for yourself). American is a major financial scam and, ultimately, just is not worth the investment..."
Alum,1,I was poor before I went to American University and I am still poor after graduating from American University.  Graduating from this school did not do anything to improve my standard of living.  I am actually worse off from graduating from this school because now I have student loans to pay and I have never had one good job since graduating from this school.  And everyone I know who graduated from this school does not have a good job either.
Freshman,1,"This University lacks the pride and culture that you would see at most state schools. On top of this, the school boasts about their diversity and inclusion but there is very little diversity on campus. There is some racial diversity; however, there is little to no economic diversity. I often feel out of place amongst my upper-middle-class peers. While there are many opportunities on campus, the academics are mediocre. I rarely feel challenged by the work that I am given and most of the professors are very lenient. Even though I am not a fan of American University, I love the surrounding area of D.C. And it is nice that unlimited metro access is included in our tuition. I suggest saving your money and going to a state school like UMD. It provides the college experience, with proximity to D.C., and limitless opportunities to succeed. I have already applied to transfer."
College Sophomore,1,"Short review: they suck. No one goes- no matter the sport or importance of the game, Bender Arena is close to empty. As a Patriot League school, we are underlooked on the national stage, both for recruitment and tournaments, and the students know it. It's depressing."
College Sophomore,1,"For how small it is, it's extremely prominent. Gets annoying at times."
College Freshman,1,"This school is great if you interested in International Studies or in Business, but if you an undeclared freshman there are very few resources to help you find you way, not many diverse classes to explore, and scheduling is a nightmare. Frats and sororities rule the school, the male to female ratio is way off, and getting to and into parties can be frustrating and difficult."
College Sophomore,1,"There are people selling and distributing drugs. Students are constantly smoking pot, doing hard drugs such as heroin or cocaine, and quickly becoming alcoholics. The school claims they are taking this issue seriously but everyone turns a blind eye."
College Junior,1,There is no school spirit whatsoever. The lack of keeps the community unengaged.
College Freshman,1,"If I could do it all over again, there's no way I would go to AU. The environment is so un-friendly and smothering. It's somewhat cliche and very sad, but true: everyone is incredibly fake and while yes, really driven, they are completely focused on themselves and would push anyone under the bus to get what they want. The administration is cruel and totally unhelpful. The classes are equivalent to what I took in highschool, but with many more students, and much more reading. All of this, plus one of the most expensive rates of tuition in the world. Utterly not worth the effort. I seriously urge you to not make my mistake. I am deep in debt and have nothing but bad memories to show for it. I wasted a year of my life at this school and I hope nobody else has to: really take everything into account, good and all the bad, before you decide to go here. There are lots of other schools in DC with better programs, and all over the country."
College Freshman,1,"I did not find AU with the cost or effort. All of the professors were fine, but no better, more interesting, or more inspiring than my high school teachers. The experience was exactly like attending a public high school, with the cost of going to a baby ivy. The only thing I liked about AU at all is that it is near DC. If you want to study in DC, I really suggest you chose another school. (If you like being treated fairly and respectfully by others). DC is a great city with so much to offer, including OTHER SCHOOLS!"
College Freshman,1,"The Administration is the number one reason I left this school. It is best put that it feels like every member of the administration is paid to be as rude, unhelpful, and condescending as possible. The Administration ignored and mocked my disability to the point of it being impossible for me to attend class or comfortably stay in the dorms. But even my healthy/abled friends have had extreme frustrations with the administration, for periods of time that are just unacceptable. I've heard of several conspiracies revolving around the administration and the behavior of the RAs and professional staff seem to validate some of these. In short, the administration is motivated by greed and not much else. If you decide to attend American, you will see what I mean. Despite this, the RAs are in my experience thoughtful and helpful, although they do not have as much power as they would like you to believe. Rules in the dorms are really lax which are nice, but in reality kind of stupid. RAs work the front desk and instead of a security guard checking in everyone who walks in the dorms, the RA will just look up from their laptop/homework, meaning ANYONE can walk in if they do so with enough confidence. Kind of scary.  I would say whatever you might be caught doing in the dorms will come down to the RAs digression unless it's something more serious like drugs."
College Freshman,1,We hate the administration because they are so removed from the students and don't listen
College Freshman,1,If you hate Greek Life it's super annoying
College Freshman,1,"We pay more for a triple room on campus than many local apartments, but it has perks like the lounges and great community you build living on campus. Beware the mice though."
College Freshman,1,"The administration is out to get you. They are all condescending people who think that empty bottles or paraphernalia that can be legally used for tobacco are the equivalent of possessing massive quantities of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. They have literally tested an advil pill from a students room to make sure it was not acid."
College Freshman,1,"AU is here to take your money. A good portion of this campus is rich enough that they do not need to pay for tuition, their parents can. Thus, financial aid and scholarships aren't really important to the university. This is why the rest of us will be in debt for life."
College Freshman,1,"All on campus meal plan vendors are run through Aramark. They are guaranteed your money through the meal plan you pay for when you show up. Thus, the result is poor and remarkably inefficient service and terrible quality."
College Freshman,1,"Not interested in helping you. I think your overall experience will depend on your RA. My RA couldn't care less about anything so noisy neighbors and drunks got away with everything scott free. The administration has a very do-it-yourself attitude. Most people are impossible to get a hold of. If you can contact them they will be as rude as you can imagine. They are not interested in helping anyone, least of all those who are not paying out of pocket."
College Freshman,1,They give money to almost nobody or make it seem like you'll get money and then take the offer back.
College Freshman,1,"When you do find a party to go to, they're not easy to attend at first as a freshmen. You have to find out where the house (all frat houses are scattered far from campus) which is difficult on its own but then you have to also try to get in. If its crowded, you probably have no chance of getting in. If not, some frats will grill you about who you know. Once you actually make into the party, they'll be out of drinks after 10pm and play terrible music 75% of the time. In the end, for my friends and I, we gave up trying to go to these parties because it was not worth the trouble."
College Sophomore,1,"I had the absolute worst experience with scholarships and financial aid at American University. To say it's an absolute joke is an understatement. Including myself, five students from my high school applied to American University. Of the five of us, I had the highest GPA, highest SAT scores, and the most extra curriculars; yet, when we each received our acceptance letters, they had all received generous scholarships, while I had received nothing. Not only did this not make any sense, I still have yet to been given an answer as to why this happened by the Undergraduate Admissions office. When I tried to contact them, they dodged my emails and phone calls up until about a week before the May 1 deadline. Ironically enough, the person that I needed to speak with was somehow always in a meeting or at lunch. When they finally got back to me, I appealed, and was only rewarded a $6,000 per year scholarship. Let's keep in mind that this school costs upwards of $60,000 per year. I've been trying to argue my case ever since, but no one in any administrative office on this campus wants to hear it."
College Sophomore,1,"The lottery system is an absolute joke. If you are in an odd-numbered group, you're automatically screwed out of the good housing, unless you're a rich little white girl who complains enough to the Housing and Dining office to get bumped up in the order. It's ridiculously expensive, considering the dorms leave a lot to be desired. Don't expect any of the appliances to work regularly, and certainly don't expect anyone to properly fix them when asked. Laundry is expensive, the machines always flood, and the online tracking system doesn't work at all. The school was so overcrowded this year that they housed 15-20 people in lounges during the beginning of the semester, which is in no way moral or sanitary. If you can afford it, move off campus as soon as you can, rather than stuffing the pockets of the scumbags in Housing and Dining."
College Senior,1,"It's D.C. Parking doesn't exist. However, landlords are reasonable and there are plenty of options within walking distance of AU."
College Freshman,1,Haven't seen a computer lab on campus... There are a few desktops in the library.
College Sophomore,1,"Don't bring a car - again, it's DC. You don't need it and it's cheaper and more convenient without"
College Sophomore,1,"I wasn't given alot of aid, compared to how much the school costs. It is really terrible, I'm going to have to appeal for more money in hopes i recieve more aid. and I hope I can take out a loan next year."
College Junior,1,Better parking is needed! But this is a problem all across DC!
College Sophomore,1,"I am currently not happy with my major. I wish there was a variety of different options at AU. This is a great school if you are certain you want to do Political Science, Public Affairs, or something related to Business. Otherwise, don't bother. If you are undecided, I would not recommend AU to you."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no school spirit. The Dance and Cheer teams are not present at any games besides ""Phil Bender/Phil Reeves/Bender Blue Out"" games for sports. They are only present at Men's and Women's home basketball game. Hardly anyone ever shows up to any athletic event. Athletes, parents, and few fans show up to athletic games."
College Freshman,1,The student health center is terrible. I wen there on a Saturday said I needed to see someone told them is was urgent. Receptionist lady said I needed to wait till Monday or go to CVS. Other schools have 24 hour services when this when isn't even open on weekends.
College Senior,1,Not much going on nearby. DC is a hassle to get to without a car
College Freshman,1,"EagleSecure is a JOKE on laptops/smart phones. Wireless access stinks. It is always going out when more than one person is online. Also, this makes registering for classes a nightmare. In terms of computer availability, this is not an issue because there are computers all over campus."
College Junior,1,The university is not helping with finding aid. I have exhausted my federal financial aid and school says oh well good luck finding a scholarship or loan. They do not give any time to pay for tuition. Most courses are 8 weeks long at $750 for 3 credit course. I take 2 courses at time. That is $1500 the university wants every 2 months! I don't know what to do as I do not have funds and credit not good for loans and no cosigners! The university is not offering any support.
College Freshman,1,They are popular because there is no where else for underages to party but they are all douche bags
College Freshman,1,Hardly any parking and a pass is extremely expensive. No freshman are allowed cars
College Sophomore,1,"Sports really aren't a focus at AU. The school does come together and show spirit at the occasional big game, but we don't even have a football team, which shows you how big sports are. Political speakers or rallies are like big sports games though!"
College Freshman,1,"In the beginning I gave TDR the benefit of the doubt. I've been here for a month and I have gotten sick so almost everyday, especially from Salsa and salads too!"
College Sophomore,1,"Basically Everyone Is White – AU loves to talk about diversity, and I think they might actually be trying to improve their ratio, but SO. MANY. WHITE PEOPLE. It's painful at times, and especially within the honors program. Most people are white, uppermiddle class, and painfully privileged. The one good thing about AU, however, is that many of the white people are at least open-minded and willing to challenge their privilege. The problem still remains, though."
College Freshman,1,The food here is not very good at all. If you decide to go to MegaBites or The Eagle Nest it can start to get pretty expensive. TDR is sooooo nasty!!!
College Sophomore,1,"Want to Park, Got to Pay – AU's parking is horrible, it cost a ridiculous amount of money for a parking pass for the year and if you don't have a pass then public safety officers give you a ticket. And if you really want a car and don't want to pay for the parking pass DC is trying to pass a law to make it nearly impossible for students to have cars in DC  by forcing you to buy DC car insurance and registering to car in DC so basically if your not from DC, and most people aren't, then you are screwed. Living on campus or around it you really don't need a car. You can walk to and from class and if you want to get into downtown DC the metro work fine and so does the bus system."
College Junior,1,parking is SO expensive because you are limited with space in the city
College Sophomore,1,"American University is not at all generous or helpful with financial aid. The personnel at AU Central are rude and incompetent. AU raises tuition and fees a lot each year and reduces its aid packages to students each year. As a freshman you may get a good award, but they will take it away for sophomore year. I would look for outside scholarships rather than counting on money from American."
College Sophomore,1,"Do not bring a car to AU. Parking costs at least $1000 for a pass, and you aren't even guaranteed a space. Parking and owning a car in DC is incredibly expensive. Use public transportation instead!"
College Freshman,1,"I graduated HS with a 4.5 GPA and taking all the honors and AP classes I could. American didn't even offer me enough aid to cover a semester of tuition, and were not very accommodating when I asked for an appeal (I come from a very low income family so I thought they could help). I think they're very over priced, especially with a 40%+ acceptance rate... its not like they're an Ivy. I really liked them though because their academics seem to be good, their location is great and the atmosphere seems wonderful. But if you're on a budget don't expect help even if you are a good student. "
College Sophomore,1,"Expensive and Unreasonable – Parking is available for sophomores and above. Freshman are not permitted to have cars. A parking permit costs around $1500 per semester, so If you don't really need a car, don't bring it. Parking Control tickets any car that doesen't have a permit every day, and tickets can be up to $500."
College Freshman,1,Lock up Your Belongings – So many laptops have been stolen this semester that they are offering a $500 reward to anyone with any information. It's ridiculous that they don't monitor the halls better. Be careful with your belongings.
College Freshman,1,"Computer Theft – This year there has been a ridiculous number of computers stolen, and AU security still hasn't been able to figure out who has taken them. If people merely lock their doors, but don't dead bolt them, it is not uncommon for people to break into their rooms, and their have been a number of reports of people waking up to people in their rooms at night stealing their laptops. I know, sounds ridiculous...like a rumor, but campus security posts notices everytime one of these incidences occurs and describes it, which is how I know."
College Freshman,1,"Overall Experiene – American University has no school spirit. If you are looking for the typical college experience....try again. Sports games are not a big deal at all, there is no football team. And most of the people on sports teams only hang out with each other. 
Greek life is also really big, despite what they tell you on the tours. For the most part, the greek community is really close despite what sorority/fraternity you're in. 
POLITICS. do not underestimate the amount of politics you will find here. you will find it in every class. even a statistics class, a psych class, a business class....EVERYWHERE. 
overall, I have not enjoyed my experience at AU, as you may be able to see from my post. I wish someone had told me the things i mentioned above before I attended, because I probably wouldn't have chosen this school if I had known. "
College Senior,1,"There are parking lots and garages available, but its expensive and annoying. Some street parking available, but most have meters."
College Freshman,1,"Youll never get over your high school boyfriend – Boys here are HORRIBLE. most are extremely unattractive and are douche bags. guys think theyre the s*** if theyre in a frat and they treat girls like objects. girls get really territorial if they find ONE ""au cute"" guy, which does NOT mean actually cute, so you'll basically never find anyone you would hook up with sober. there are some nice guys but theyre usually really weird or unattractive or both.  If you're a girl coming here with a boyfriend from home, you will never be tempted to cheat on him. and if you're a single girl, be prepared to drunk text every high school guy you passed up back then, you'll think everyone is hot when you go back home....or just get off campus.."
College Freshman,1,"Worst experience of my life. I was initially very excited to attend American University, but I soon realized that it would be not at all was I was expecting. Attending this school has honestly been the worst experience of my life. I have never met such rude students till I came here. Most of the faculty are awful at doing their job because for the most part they just don't care. I thought that by attending American University that I would have a college experience, instead this has been a continuation of high school. So, if you are looking for a college experience look someplace else."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are not great and very expensive. They are convenient and very close to classes. There isn't enough on campus housing so a lot of freshmen get put in triples which are the same size as double rooms and extremely cramped. The facilities are always breaking down and don't get fixed for months. The South Side of campus is fun and a great place to live if you like being social and going out. The walls in the dorms are so thin though, so you can hear everything your neighbors say/do. The residence halls are great for meeting and making friends though, they just aren't worth the price. The public bathrooms and lounges are cleaned everyday which is nice. But things in the lounges like ovens and heating will be left broken for months.
On the South Side:
Best Dorms:
Anderson, Centennial
Worst Dorms:
Letts
DON'T LIVE IN LETTS IT SMELLS WEIRD AND IS GROSS."

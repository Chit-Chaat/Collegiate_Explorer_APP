Niche User,5,The administration office was very helpful in helping me with my application. I got an instant response.
Junior,5,"Due to the pandemic, my spring semester on campus this year ended in the middle of March. At the time I was taking a Psychology class, and I had to do almost all of it from home, since I only had one class on campus. My professor was very understanding and met with us through Google Meet once a week. Since I really did not get a chance to get to know him in class, I had a lot of questions which I emailed to him.  He answered all of them. He constantly told us that if we had any questions or wanted to call him through video or phone he would make time to meet with us.  Right now I am taking two official summer online classes. I am really enjoying them because my professors are excellent at communicating with me through email. Everything that is expected is clear and whatever may not be is always made clear by my professors. The advantage of taking these online classes is that I can submit my assignments early and also have a job to save for the next year of school."
Junior,5,"The first reason why I really enjoy being a student at Grace College is because the school stands for the Word of God. It teaches the Bible not only in chapel bust also in class. I also greatly appreciate the fact that my teachers are wonderful. They not only care about me as a student, they also see me as a person. I can ask them for advice about personal struggles, and they take the time to listen to me. In addition, I can email them as many questions as I may have, and they will always respond. I also enjoy attending Grace because I have had a great experience working on campus. My employers are kind and patient, and they take the time to explain exactly what they expect of me. Another positive thing is that the campus library offers a writing lab that is very supportive. They answer their emails very quickly, and proofread my papers, offering feedback by telling me exactly how I can improve.  In addition, the librarians are very kind and are always willing to offer assistance."
Sophomore,5,Grace College is so welcoming. From the moment you step on campus you feel like you're at home. Everyone embraces you and you feel like you've known them all your life. The faculty is outstanding and are there for the students always.
Freshman,5,"It has been really good, the professor were really aware about the situation of everyone and in special with international students. The classes were really funny and the homeworks as well."
Freshman,5,"The o my thing that I would like to change is the campus. It's small. But the rest is awesome, the people and Winona lake is an incredible place to live because the peace."
Freshman,5,"They did really good despiting that it was their first time for some professors. Furthermore, it wasn't easy."
Freshman,5,"Grace College is the perfect fit for someone looking for a medium to small, united Christian campus. The students, professors and local members of the town of Winona Lake, IN are very welcoming and friendly to one another. About 5 minutes from campus, is ""The Village"" that borders one small side of the lake that consists of many different restaurants and activities. Before the beginning of freshman year, all of the incoming freshman join together and celebrate  a day out on the beach and lake of Winona."
Junior,5,Grace College has an amazing campus with great professors. There are lots of things to do around campus from going on a hike through the trails to visiting the lake for a swim! Every time I visited the students and the faculty were always really nice.  After visiting Grace College I knew it was the school for me!
Junior,5,"Grace College has a great campus that is near an amazing lake where you can swim, fish, and watch the sunsets! Grace College has great professors who you can tell really care about you and your success."
Senior,5,"Grace has taught me so much about myself and others. It also was a source of independence for me, and that independence would not have been achieved if it wasn't for my move to Indiana and attendenace at Grace College!"
Sophomore,5,They make you feel like family. The class sizes are perfect and the teachers help you in any way they can. I have never felt like a teacher cared so much about me and my education until Grace College. The education programs are amazing they taught me so much and it did not even feel like learning because it was such fun.
Junior,5,"I loved everything about it! The professors are very welcoming and informative. The campus is clean and fun. Athletics are a big deal and professors are willing to accommodate to games and matches. There is a lake nearby for fun and many job opportunities. I would personally recommend on campus living for a better friendship experience. There are various friend groups so many opportunities to fit in! On weekends there are many student scheduled activities that allow students to be involved. I have had the absolute best experience and could not imagine myself at any other campus. However grace college is very expensive. I would recommend finding as many scholarships as possible to help with the cost. I also would recommend going to basketball, soccer, baseball games to keep yourself entertained."
Freshman,5,Grace is a beautiful campus. It really feels likes home and has great successful programs. They have wonderful and loving professors. The dorms are huge and the while campus has a nice modern feel to it. Freshman may also have their car on campus for the first year!
Freshman,5,"I love the sense of community throughout campus. Since it is a small campus and small population, it is very easy to make friends and connect with people. It is probably one of the friendliest places I've been, especially one of the truly authentic friendly campuses I've visited, and I visited 8 during high school. I think the only thing I would improve would be the overeagerness of the campus safety to give out parking tickets. Campus safety also is a little bad at timeliness and being in the office when they should be. But the campus is very safe so this does not usually cause problems other than annoyances. I also love the professors."
Niche User,5,Have met with the Track coach and will be signing a Letter of Intent.  Like the small college atmosphere and the facilities and classrooms are a nice attraction.
Junior,5,I like the diversity and acceptance that is present on campus. One of my favorite parts of Grace is being a part of the soccer team and how we have built a family more than just a team. I also appreciate how the professors are always willing to help with any issues we might face with our busy schedules or language barriers that might raise along the way.
Freshman,5,"I am currently still attending Grace, and it is a Christian college that is very focused on God and I love that! The professors here are very caring of you. I am on the basketball team here as well and enjoying every minute!!"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Grace has been wonderful. Every one on campus is friendly and welcoming. The environment is wholesome and the professors are helpful. The campus is very safe.
Senior,5,I would not want to go anywhere else! There are so many wonderful things but the best aspect is definitely the community and welcoming people within. The professors willing devote time out of class to help students academically. They also intertwine each and every major or field of study with Gods word! Lastly to top it all off the opportunity to graduate within three years with a bachelors is a great opportunity.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely LOVE going to Grace College. The community is so welcoming and the staff and faculty are always there to help me when I need it. They all made adjusting from high school to college life easy and helped keep me on top of my grades and extra curricular activities.
Freshman,5,"Attending Grace College and Seminary has been an incredible experience so far. The people and professors are very caring and friendly. The atmosphere is so welcoming and the academics are of high importance. The scenery and culture Is what really sets Grace apart. The lake view makes college life very enjoyable along with the people at Grace. As well as the academics, the athletics are well-known at Grace. Many students attend games and events to support, and that grows the campus that much closer. Grace College truly is a family."
Freshman,5,Love the community and togetherness feeling g and atmosphere. I greatly appreciate the real ness of the professors and love from faculty! Attending and working here is a wonderful experience that I wouldn’t trade for anything!
Freshman,5,Love the small but strong community There is so much that you can be involved in. The facilities are nice and I learn a lot in my classes.
Niche User,5,"I am a incoming Freshman and I have visited and toured the school. With my time being there, I can see how hands on the teachers are and how friendly the students and community is."
Niche User,5,its an amazing community  they are such loving people. the campus is absolutely beautiful and magical. truly the best college you could choose to go to because god is so good and you can feel it walking through the campus there are numerous career options and great staff to help lead you in best possible decision making. Students are very caring as are the professors. great and god loving place
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the atmosphere at Grace College and can't wait to attend!  The food there is fantastic and the students seem very friendly.
Freshman,5,"Grace is a college where you feel like a student that matters, not just another number. They help you understand what you need to do to be able to go to their school and stop at nothing to make college a possibility even to those that seemingly can not afford to do so. They help to the best of their abilities. Not only do they have excellent staff, but they have many majors to choose from. Going to Grace is open to a wide-variety of students."
Niche User,5,"I am seeking to transfer to Grace College, to receive my Bachelors in Human Services and then move on to my MA in Counseling and Therapy"
Sophomore,5,Wonderful community and campus. The professors are amazing as well and go out of their way to help their students.
Freshman,5,Grace College is very safe and very community-involved. The area is full of opportunity for outdoor activities and is a great learning environment. The teachers are genuinely invested in the well-being of the students.
Freshman,5,Grace has a wonderful family and faculty to student relationship experience. I plan on attending as a four year student this Fall and am overwhelmed with excitement about becoming a Lancer! Their programs and majors are terrific and the application process is also easy and awesome! Grace College is a good school to choose and definitely one I would reccommend adding to your list.
Freshman,5,Grace College is an amazing college. The community here makes you feel like you are home. The professors and college employees are welcoming and encouraging to students.
Junior,5,Grace college has helped me grow in many areas of my life. I have learned to think about my own opinion on a topic and talking about it with someone while not offending them.
Freshman,5,I love Grace College. It's a lot of fun living in the dorms and having a bunch of people to grow with and live with. I don't regret coming here. Classes are a ton of fun and homework isn't' too bad. Professors are the best and they become near and dear to your heart. 
College Junior,5,I love everything about Grace College. It has helped me grow in my relationship with Christ.
College Junior,5,I feel really confident about my prospects after college.
College Junior,5,I feel extremely safe at Grace College and in  Winona Lake.
College Junior,5,I have loved living on campus. The community is fantastic.
College Junior,5,I have really enjoyed my overall experience at grace.
College Senior,5,"The school is amazing at providing incredible hands on experience. Even as a transfer student, I'm able to graduate on time. I'm also pursuing both aneed undergraduate and graduate degree at the same time!"
College Sophomore,5,Have never seen or heard of the presence of drugs on campus
College Sophomore,5,Campus is very safe and never have felt afraid or in danger
College Freshman,5,"I am a part of the varsity volleyball team, and it has really helped me engage in campus life and build relationships."
College Freshman,5,I feel a part of a community that is very supportive and wants me to succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"Grace College is in a small town that has little to no crime in the immediate area, however, we do have a campus safety that is constantly on the look out for potential threats and are in constant communication with law enforcement officers. In my year that I've attended Grace thus far, there has been no crime around campus."
College Sophomore,5,There is a zero tolorence policy for drug use.
College Senior,5,The professors are awesome! They really care about their students and they want us to succeed. Whenever I would have a questions about the class or life they were always willing to sit down with me and talk about it. Overall the class sizes range from 20-30 people but I have been in classes as small as 6 and as big as 250 for the freshman classes.
College Senior,5,Health and safety are two things that the campus does not take lightly. During my time there I never once felt in danger.
College Senior,5,Even though Grace may not have the best lab equipment or most unto date buildings the people and professors are genuine. There are opportunities for you if you are willing to look for them. Since it is a smaller school you are able to know your professor well. I cherish Grace College!
College Senior,5,"I am very happy at Grace. All the staff is very helpful, honest, and friendly"
College Junior,5,"I have experienced a lot of personal growth through my college, something that I wouldn't ever give up. I have also made a lot of great friends who share the same values that I do."
College Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and welcoming people that attend and work for Grace College.
College Sophomore,5,"My first year of school was a great experience for me. I was challenged mentally and spiritually and it has changed my life forever. I would recommend this school to anyone I know because the school is filled with great faculty, and staff and students."
College Sophomore,5,I love them all. They do a great job integrating following Jesus with course work.
College Sophomore,5,There are fun outdoor activities and great places to eat.
College Sophomore,5,"Guys and girls are attractive, smart, and nice."
College Sophomore,5,Safety is extremely important to Grace College. It had never been an issue.
College Sophomore,5,Our athletic teams are full of outstanding people.
College Senior,5,"I've yet to live off campus, but I've only heard good things about it."
Junior,4,"I think the possibility of a three year program is fantastic for the school, though the short blocks for STEM classes can be challenging to complete. The atmosphere and community aspect of the smaller campus is fantastic."
Sophomore,4,I have taken summer classes online through Grace and the professors still treat it as though you were with them in person which makes learning easier and more fun.
Freshman,4,I like the kind of people who lives here. They are really helpful especially with International students.
Senior,4,"Grace College has great professors who want the best for their students. There are fun activities on campus frequently, and the students are friendly. It's a really nice atmosphere and I have learned a lot!"
Freshman,4,The community here on campus is simply amazing. You don’t have to go far to find people who are actively trying to get you plugged into college life. Everyone is so friendly and they seem to really have my best interests in mind.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community and professors, but I think the school could be more inclusive to minorities. You often get the same professors multiple times, which I feel is very good for personal development and connections. Additionally, advisors are extremely helpful and willing to help you work around things that get in your way. The financial aid is average. It's a bit difficult to get extra aid from the school if you're having trouble paying. However, they do have payment plans."
Freshman,4,"Grace has an amazing campus. Everyone there is very encouraging and supportive. The worship at chapel is also amazing, its so awesome to get to praise God with a whole school of people. The fact that worship is student led is amazing, God has truly blessed so many people with inspirational talents. The dining experience is also great! There is a very easy flow to getting food and all the other students are very welcoming to any newcomers."
Sophomore,4,"The campus at Grace creates desire within you to walk around and talk to the people relaxing on the fields or walking past. The buildings are very comfortable for students and a lot of the professors perform with great fluency. The dorms also give a great college experience, dithered by the Residential Life Staff. Some professors, however, lack good teaching skill."
Freshman,4,"I like how friendly everyone here is and how easy it is to talk to professors outside of class. The profs really relate to the students and they try to make sure every student is dong well by providing free tutors and a free learning center/writing lab. The sessions are only 8 weeks, so if you are stuck in a hard class you are only in it for 8 weeks. Plus you never get bored or tired of the class because you are hardly ever in it. I do wish they weren't as strict on some resident life rules, but the rules are only for freshman so really they don't matter very much."
Junior,4,"I love how much the professors care about each student's academic and personal success. The campus is beautiful and perfectly located near a lake. The activities on campus are usually good, but the ones in winter aren't always the best just because it's too cold outside to do most fun things."
Senior,4,My experience at Grace College has been very good. Being an Athlete with a busy schedule it is very reassuring to have professors that will work with me to stay on top of my assignments. Housing on campus is very modern and spacious which is the best in my opinion in all the schools I visited before choosing to attend Grace. Overall the people at Grace College are very welcoming and just nice people. They make all people feel like they belong on campus.
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and has many new buildings.  Chapel is great and very God honoring.  The food could use some variety as well.  There are many good professors.
Junior,4,"I'm a transfer student; I came from Purdue University Northwest. Grace is an amazing school. It's peaceful, beautiful, and wonderful. The expectations are high, but not unable to be achieved. Everyone is so kind and they genuinely care about your success."
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my time at Grace. The res life is wonderful, the professors are great. I just wish they would have better communication between departments, studying in two different departments creates a bit of trouble."
Freshman,4,"I like how the professors are personable and approachable. But somethings that I would like to see changed are all the rules. Yes I get that it is a private and a Christian college, but kids need to make mistakes in order to grow."
Freshman,4,I like Grace College a lot. The professors are great and the environment is great if you like a small size college. The food is okay but they do have a decent amount of options. And you are only 40 minutes away from Fort Wayne!
Freshman,4,"I love going to Grace. There are so many welcoming and amazing people who help you grown in your faith. There are many classes and majors to choose from. The class sizes are also small, so the professors can focus on all of their students on a 1 on 1 basis if needed."
Freshman,4,"I really love the connection and communication between the students and professors. If you are ever stuck or in need of some help there is a Learning Lab in the library to help catch you back up to speed. One thing that could change would probably be more available parking spots, but that’s normal for a smaller campus. Overall my experience is going great!"
Sophomore,4,Grace College has been an amazing experience for me. I have had the ability to grow my faith in so many ways. It has been incredible to meet the amazing people on campus - students and staff - that take a personal interest in myself and my education.
Freshman,4,"I love the school. I think it was a great investment to me as a person, my faith, and honest relationships. I ran into issues that were not the school's fault but did effect my experience. This is a Christian institution and there are some heavy rules, but nothing that doesn't follow God's word and it seeks to build us up as Godly adults."
Freshman,4,"Great Christian atmosphere and community and an oppurtunity to grow in faith. However, with a strong Biblical basis, rules can be too restrictive at times."
Freshman,4,"Grace College is small. There are a lot of rules and a lot of things that you should know before committing to coming here. But it's a place where people love you. Everyone is going through something but everyone has an ear to listen. If you're struggling there is someone on campus that wants to help you out. It might be the people on your hall, or you RA. Whoever it is, they want to be there. That's something special. Also, the school is just small enough that you get to know people but you always end up meeting someone new. It's fun to meet people because it's more things to do. Another thing that's big at Grace is community. We are all about creating an environment where people are comfortable and they want to have fun. They want everyone to feel like they are in an environment where Christ can love on them."
Freshman,4,I'm going to be a freshman at Grace College in the Fall of 2017 and I couldn't be going to a better school. I love how safe the campus feels and how there's so much to do. I also love that the professors and students are so nice!
Freshman,4,Grace is a good fit for me and what I wanted in a college! It is christian but also a mission field. The student body is friendly and just a nice size where I feel apart of things. It is a small campus but part of a great town and there are lots of things to do on campus.
Freshman,4,"I do really like Grace. The classes are small and the professors are reasonable, and emailing your professors questions you have about assignments is encouraged. The advisors are very helpful, and they do their best to accommodate all students. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in clubs and intramural sports, as well as service project opportunities. The schedule is set up with eight week sessions, so that you have the opportunity to save money and complete your degree in three years. I do not live on campus; I'm a commuter, but I do have friends on campus and have spent time in the dorms. All of the dorms are well taken care of, but some of them are a little old; however,  they did just recently build  two new dorms, so those are very nice. The parking situation is a little frustrating, since they are in the process of expanding campus, so while parking is free, it is not always the most convenient. Overall campus is small but beautiful. "
College Junior,4,The athletics programs at Grace have been improving a lot of the past few years.
College Senior,4,Smaller school but adequate facilities
College Freshman,4,Grace College does a good job of encouraging student safety and providing student support whenever needed.
College Freshman,4,"Grace College is fantastic at creating a community of students that are actively engaged in class and strong in religious beliefs. The greatest part about Grace is that you can feel the bond between students. You truly feel like you are a part of the community around you while learning, which makes the classes and activities all the better. My only complaint is the website Grace College uses. The website is sometimes less than cooperative and some teachers prefer to use it as little as possible because of this."
College Freshman,4,"Grace is great at helping students decide a career for themselves and keeping them engaged in classes, activities, and even internships that will help prepare them for life in the workforce."
College Freshman,4,"Grace College presents a welcoming environment for all students and has certainly improved my views on the college experience. Most teachers are effective (though I won't say all are perfect). Most classes are made interesting. Work is challenging, but easy to manage. Classes are great at incorporating the student's active participation. It has overall been a great experience so far. My only complaint is the online mediums the college uses can sometimes be difficult for teachers to use properly which can greatly affect the student."
College Sophomore,4,Very caring faculty and engaged support staff.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are knowledgeable, prestigious, caring about the students, and friendly and personable."
College Sophomore,4,I am confident that I will be able to get a good job after school
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going to school here; however, the extracurriculars are lacking and generally, there's not much to do outside of school."
College Sophomore,4,"I love most all of my classes. Some of the Grace core classes I didn't particularly care for such as Freshman foundations. It felt like church camp class and made me feel like a little kid and not an adult. However, classes related towards my majors have been more enjoyable. I love all of the professors here. They genuinely want to see the students succeed at what they are trying to accomplish and will work with the students to the best of their abilities to help them do well. It is also easy to talk to the professors and get to know them. I wish there were more of an opportunity to take more diverse classes. Since the college is so small, this is lacking. The class sizes are wonderful. I like that I can actually get to know everyone in class and know most every one on campus. It's a lovely community."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally like living on campus. I currently live in Westminster Hall. It is one of the older buildings but has a ton of character. I also like that I have the opportunity to have my own personal bathroom. As well as in each housing building, since the emphasis on authentic relationships and feeling at home, everyone one the hall becomes super close to each other and making friends with the people from other halls is relatively easy. What I don't like about it is the fact that we aren't allowed to open our windows because of the heating and cooling system structure in the building and the fact the building gets centipedes from time to time and the don't do anything about it when you have a complaint. As for the rest of the buildings, most of them are fairly nice but some could use a face lift. The cost seems adequate, however their maintenance of the buildings could be improved. As well as the housing process, they have just restructured it, so I have not experienced it yet but I heard that it was awful and stressful for all parties involved. However, coming in as a freshman it went smoothly."
College Sophomore,4,Grace College focuses it's attention on leadership building and authentic relationships. You feel at home here.
College Sophomore,4,Campus life is mostly conservative.
College Sophomore,4,I've had a very enjoyable experience with a my professors.
College Sophomore,4,I will be able to leverage my academic experience in the local church and business community.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Grace College & Seminary! The entire experience has been awesome! I am an adult learner, and Grace is a perfect school for those desire to continue their goal as a life long learner. I am grateful for the staff who work diligently to ensure service excellence and a quality academic experience. The professors are a huge blessing and are faithful to academic excellence!"
College Senior,4,"Grace's business and accounting programs are excellent! Our science program is well known in the area. Grace functions on a quarterly system, so our classes last for 8 weeks at a time. This is a benefit because you can get through classes quicker and it also prepares you for graduate school were classes will be more accelerated."
College Senior,4,Some of the building are out of date but they are working on fixing them or adding new dorms/ buildings.
College Junior,4,"I am attending online. I have had full access to professors and staff via skype/phone. The professors have been very proactive in pursing my attention, which is a great motivator when life gets hard. The professors have been very understanding of my professional and personal life. They work with me to help me learn and achieve."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at Grace has been great. Even though at times I wish I picked a bigger school I am glad I picked the one I did. My school is very small which creates a great place for community. Even though it is smaller I am still able to meet new people while being there. My school requires us to experience a different culture in order to graduate, for this requirement I went on a trip to Fiji with other students from my school. I would say that has been my favorite experience so far. I was able to get to know more people at my school on the other side of the ocean. We were able to see how well we have it here in the United States and see how pretty Fiji beaches are. My school is unique because of where it is located. It is in a small town named Winona Lake, IN. It is a few miles from the lake there and we are able to ride our bikes down to the village and go sit by the lake and talk with friends. I would chose my school again because it has helped me grow in my faith and has given me tools to become a better person, friend, and to engage in relationships even when they are hard. My school has taught me to think outside the box and to try and understand other people and their worldview."
College Sophomore,4,People can hang out and get to know each other.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus my freshman year was definitely a fun experience. There are many different people that live on a hall and that means that you can have many different friends. If you wanted someone to go to dinner with, you could walk down the hall and someone was bound to be in their room. There were many different opportunities to get out and socialize with different people especially when there were all-campus events. You could see people that you never even knew went to the school. The cost was relatively good, and there was news that tuition will be decreased and there will be free textbook rental. The housing process was relatively good, but it ended up going really late because it did not start on time. The rules of campus are pretty well enforced, allowing for consistency in the schedules of the students. Some of the events, however, made it impossible for freshman to get back to their dorms on time."
College Student,4,The support here is great.  The teams are very important to the students.
College Student,4,"The dining options here are plentiful.  The food is better than most college food.  Still not quite like home, but that is to be expected."
College Sophomore,4,i enjoy subco because its a familiar eating establishment in that it resembles subway so much. however my favorite is the Westy Grill i hardly ever eat at alpha unless i have a group of people that will be there
College Junior,4,"Grad classes meet one or two days a week for 4-hour class blocks. The program is very hands-on. Homework is mostly reading, some writing, and lots of clinical application. Biblical themes are integrated into every class and applied to our professional field. The surrounding area has 100s of internship/job opportunities during and after college. Workload is what you would expect of a full-time Master's program."
College Junior,4,"There is a lot to do for such a small town. We have several beaches, the YMCA, movie theater, stage theater, roller skating, bowling, clubs, coffee shops, art galleries, parks, outdoor concerts, rec leagues, running trails, horseback riding, volunteer opportunities, the animal shelter, student activities, ice cream parlor, and lots more. I've yet to be bored because there is always something to do if you're willing to look for it. The people here are super friendly and LOVE Grace students."
College Junior,4,The financial aid office was very helpful in answering my questions and helping me get the amount I needed in loans after my scholarships were gone. The best thing you can do is go to the office and talk to them in person - they assess each individual case and make accommodations as necessary.
College Junior,4,"I love my off-campus apartment. Most of the apartments are a section of a house that you have to yourself. They are within 2 blocks of campus and the landlords are dedicated to leasing to Grace students. Having so many students living nearby one another makes for a great community and lots of people to hang out with as well. There are also many apartment complexes in Warsaw (right next to Winona Lake), but they increase in price as they are corporately managed."
College Junior,4,"We have very little crime, very few safety issues, and access to great services. We have a nurse on campus from the local hospital who can help students make appointments, do check-ups, assist in emergencies, etc. Our counseling services are excellent and provide a lot of support to our student body. Student Life plays a large part in helping to keep campus healthy and safe as well. We have emergency call boxes all over campus for timely response by campus security. Personally, my roommates and I never lock our doors in our off campus apartment building because there really is no risk."
College Junior,4,"Grace is most known for basketball and soccer, and we do really well at them. We are doing especially well this season. Our facilities are beautiful and well-equipped, especially for a D3 school. The Gordon Rec center is available for free to all students and has a good variety of equipment, machines, classes, and open hours. We also have the YMCA about a mile away for access to a pool, sauna, indoor track, etc."
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of places to eat off-campus that range in price and type of food. We have Chinese, Italian, Thai, B-Dubs, Mexican, Tex-Mex, fast food, hometown cafes, bar/grills, Steak n Shake, Applebees, Bob Evans, Bennigans, tons of pizza places, a couple clubs, several coffee shops/cafes, a Meat company, Amish restaurants - I am still never bored with all of my options!"
College Junior,4,"While some of the buildings are old, they hold a lot of history and are well-maintained for their age. The basketball arena was recently built and is absolutely beautiful; the outdoor sports complex is also very well-maintained and pleasant to watch or participate in sports. The library is well-stocked and has lots of study space, materials, free printing for research, computer labs, meeting rooms, and coffee. The campus bookstore and coffee shop is a favorite hang-out on campus and serves really great drinks and bakery items. The Student Activities Board has activities going on every weekend on campus and friend groups have a lot of fun around campus and in the community. We have lots of green spaces, beautiful parks and trails, a swimming beach and playground, the Village at Winona, and a quiet community, all within walking distance of campus housing."
College Junior,4,"As would be expected with a Christian school, we are required to live by the Grace covenant standards which includes abstaining from drug and alcohol use; abstaining from any sort of sex outside of marriage; dressing modestly; no R-rated movies; abstaining from viewing and creating pornography; etc. However, there are students who participate in these activities, and there are consequences for being caught doing these things deliberately. BUT if you talk about any of these things in counseling on campus, it is not exposed to administration."
Junior,2,"Grace College's academics seem very underdeveloped, I feel that they don't put equal effort into each program. I am a psychology student, and every single class that I took felt about the same, the same terms and studies being cycled. 
the financial department puts holds on your account without telling you, i chipped my tooth on uncooked rice, was fed uncooked chicken in the dining hall. if you plan to go here, make sure you have enough money for groceries. 
I wasn't informed w all of the rules UNTIL orientation weekend. i visited 5 times. curfew for freshmen, chapel 3x a week & a $25 fine if you miss more than 3 in a quarter, it made my relationship with God feel more like an obligation than a relationship.
the students are also not very open-minded, and if you are anything other than super conservative, you will be judged. 
the area is lovely in the first and last month of the schoolyear, but when winter hits, absolutely nothing. 
please consider other schools before grace college."
Sophomore,2,"Hidden fees, very undeveloped programs, make sure you are 100% on attending before you commit. Every year there are even more problems that we learn about as students. Everyone gets fined outrageous amounts of times, either by Campus Safety or RA's. A lot of rules that are not talked about until orientation weekend."
Niche User,2,"I’m starting my review of Grace with a 2-star rating, but may take the liberty to up or down-grade that report after we meet with the Dean of Education. I’m afraid that Grace doesn’t have the proper training to deal with students with anxiety disabilities. My daughter has struggled severely, in particular, with a very harsh and demeaning professor in the education department . She informed this teacher of her struggle with anxiety and, thus far, the teacher has ignored her vulnerable email and has went as far as to demean her in front of her class and in her meeting with the Dean.  There have been several other students that have had problems with this teacher, but are afraid to report it considering they want to be able to graduate. We will see how our meeting goes, and I’ll report back. Overall, our assessment is that Grace College has good, but costly, academic services; however, they offer little “grace” (in the education department)."
College Sophomore,2,"Too many rules such as curfew and dorm hours for opposite sex lead to people doing things off campus in an unsafe environment. Drinking will happen at any college and since you can't drink no matter what age you are or even if you are off campus, students go to parties off campus to drink and partake in drugs and then drive afterwards back to campus which is very unsafe. They just need to let students drink if they are of age because then students will be safe on campus and not have to commute but can walk. We have had over 20 students that I know of or more arrested in the past two years for ""DUI, DWI, Marijuana, Controlled Substance, Fake IDs, Rape."""
College Sophomore,2,I have known 3 girls in the past year who were sexually assaulted. Those are girls I know about so I am guessing there are more than 3. All of these happened when a male was drunk and the girls were sober and were over powered and assaulted. All 3 girls were assaulted by different males.
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol is prohibited. I was actually kicked out of Grace College for Alcohol and underage drinking. They didn't catch me but heard rumors and called me into the office and I admitted to it. We have some off campus parties with plenty of people showing up drunk or bringing flasks. We have had over 20 students expelled from school in the past two years for drugs and alcohol. The party scene may not be too relevant but people drink for sure in there rooms while watching movies or raging off campus or at other universities.
College Sophomore,2,"As a former Grace Student, the town of Winona Lake and Warsaw is very boring. No nightlife nothing to do. The movies latest showing is 8:30pm and the really only off campus thing to do is go bowling or get ice cream (no joke). Unless you live near by and can go home and hang out on weekends."
College Freshman,2,"They campus it not very diverse, but is friendly with anyone who might be labeled as different"
College Freshman,2,"It can be very inconvenient to get around Warsaw if you do not have a car. Everything is Winona Lake is within walking distance, but if you actually need to run to WalMart and don't have a car, it can be a pain. Freshman are allowed to have cars, although that rule might be changing. A lot of people on campus are very willing to take you places, though, and many of the people on my hall ask around before going to Warsaw in case anybody wants a ride."
College Freshman,2,"There is very little variation in student backgrounds. Almost all of the students are white, conservative, upper-middle class and were raised in the Midwest. Although this does not make them bad people, it makes the conversations on campus stagnant and leads to a lack of intellectual and political stimulation."
College Senior,2,"This school is very strict. If you are interested at all in drinking or partying, this probably isnt the school for you. You will get caught. Additionally, if there is a situation where you are suspected of drug or alcohol use, the administration manipulate you and others into giving information."
College Senior,2,"Living in Indiana, it is not uncommon for it to be snowing one day and 60 degrees the next day. Its even possible for it to be snowy and 60* in the same day....."
College Sophomore,2,"Here at Grace College, public transportation is non existence. But that is not a bad thing, because of how small the campus is. And a lot of students bring bikes or scooters to use. And students also walk, which is usually in groups, so students get to no each other well from walking to classes together. However, there is a bus transportation for students on Sunday for a church that is about 40 minutes away, but that was provided by the church."
College Sophomore,2,"As a small town in the Midwest, Warsaw does not have a lot of options for apartment type living. In addition, Grace has very specific ramifications for living off-campus, including being at least twenty-one years old, which makes it difficult to even consider living off-campus."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of grace shown when you break the rules (covenant) that you've agreed to submit to while at Grace College. However, the rules are pretty strict and when you agree to come to Grace you are also agreeing to live by the lifestyle in the contract."
College Sophomore,2,"This campus is very accepting for ethnic and racial diversity, economic background, and political beliefs. Were I rating just on that, it would be an A. But Grace College is a lot less accepting and diverse when it comes to different religious and sexual orientation. But then again, this is a Private Christian Grace Brethren College, so it can be expected to be extremely homogenous in these areas."
College Junior,2,"We are a Christian institution so clubs/bars, drinking etc. are not things that are the norm here. It can be pretty boring here on the weekends mainly because Winona Lake is a small conservative town. Hanging out with your friends, and getting coffee is what most people do as well as attend the Student Activities Board events."
College Junior,2,"I rate my school at a C because of the fact that I go to an extension school of Grace College and we have only been open for a year. The class sizes are super small so far, but so far we have been able to get through the different issues that have come up."
College Student,2,Either you walk everywhere or you don't go anywhere. There is no where to go and nothing to do.
College Student,2,"Girls and Guys – Basically everyone is from small farm town, which is what you get in the Midwest. Sometimes it's incredibly annoying because the people can be closed minded."
Graduate Student,1,"If you are military STAY FAR AWAY. I started last summer, barely started my second week and had to withdraw, mind you in this time frame, I had no grades, no feedback from professors, no nothing yet I get a va letter stating I owe x amount because the school took 50% of my GI BILL funds for absolutely nothing! They didnt offer me anything, taught me nothing and now I have to pay funds back ?! Mind you I withdrew because we were supposed to be sent to Germany, and they could not help me workout a way to finish the on campus requirements between then and our leave date, so I had to withdraw, they are the most unhelpful bumnch of people. This school is not a Christian kind of place. I would not send anyone here."
Sophomore,1,"Didnt like much with the campus and campus life. It wasnt inclusive and didnt live up to the Christian faith.  Basketball was ok but there were  players that also follow the Christian faith. Professor made comments that was very off putting to me, a student of color."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no parties on campus or off, no matter where you go. A weekend party is going to Walmart then heading to Steak n Shake"
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at all.
College Freshman,1,"Grace's campus is stunning in the spring, summer, and fall, but in the winter it definitely loses it's charm. The spaciousness stops being idyllic when you have to trudge through snow and ice to get to class. Although there is nothing Grace can do about this, people coming from warm states need to brace themselves."
College Freshman,1,Theres nothing ever to do. Im often stuck being inside doing nothing by myself
College Freshman,1,"Here, there really are not very many people of different races. The majority race is white, with some African Americans and other races, but they are for sure the minority."
College Student,1,The parking and other topics at Grace college suck pretty bad. There is barely anywhere to park and the campus safety officers patrol off duty to give off fines or even give one with reason. The students really need a car on campus.
College Student,1,"There are few students outside the Anglo-Saxion ethnic background, Grace is also a very liberal school with 98% of the population republican and anti-abortion."
College Junior,1,"This is a Christian campus, so drinking, drugs, and sex are all against the rules. You can get kicked out of school if you do any of these things. Campus police are kind and helpful, as are RAs, but they won't let you get away with breaking the rules. Chapel is also mandatory, and you get big fines if you skip too much. I appreciate these rules, but I understand that not everyone would."
College Junior,1,"Not a Joke! When you sign the schools covenant and you break it, you will be suspended and possibly expelled from school. If you are on athletic teams you will be kicked off because they don't want you representing their school because it's a christian school."
College Freshman,1,Not Enough Good Places – There is not enough decent parking for the amount of people.
College Junior,1,There Aren't Any – There isn't really any public transportaion other then a taxi maybe.  However the school is very small and there wouldn't really be a need for transportation other then out of town.  Even the grocery store is with in a 20-25 minute walking distance

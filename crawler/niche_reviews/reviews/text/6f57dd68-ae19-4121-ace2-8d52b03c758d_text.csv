Senior,5,I have taken online classes at North Central College. Professors are engaging and value communication. Professors use various modes to engage students during live classes. Professors are approachable and easily contacted via email.
Senior,5,North Central is a tight-knit community. They offer scholarships and various clubs in order to integrate and form connections. The school is located in downtown Naperville (IL) so it is easy to get around.
Niche User,5,"I did not take any courses online with North Central College so I can't speak for the academic experience during the coronavirus pandemic. However, having studied there with some of the educators, I can say that they are very dedicated towards their students and I'm sure they made the transition from a physical classroom to online smooth."
Junior,5,"I love that North Central is a small school and allows for very meaningful and helpful relationships with professors. All staff are friendly and willing to help you with any problem that you may have. The campus is basically in downtown Naperville so you have many options for entertainment, food or job opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"I am a transfer student, all of my professors and advisors are doing their best to help me accommodate to the NCC life"
Freshman,5,"North Central College is a wonderful college. I really like the way we have small classes ( 10-35). The professors get to know every single student. In addition, they are willing to have 101 meetings with their students, answering any questions about their subjects. In contrast with other colleges that are far from cities or towns, North Central College is located down town Naperville, the most peaceful area in the States. North central college doors are opened for International students. For instance, the international community is made of many countries from every continent. Athletes are more than welcome. I have no doubt, they will find any kind of sports  of their interest."
Junior,5,The faculty here are wonderful and truly care about their students. The community is very welcoming and inclusive.
Senior,5,"What I like about North Central College is the very tranquil vibe which helps students be more relaxed when the going gets tough, although one thing I would like to see change is more investment on athletics, considering the school has few athletic facilities"
Freshman,5,"North Central College was very helpful with the transition from high school to college. I am doing very well in sports and class, and I have found the major I want to take."
Junior,5,"I was a transfer student coming into my sophomore year of college, and the staff and students at North Central College made me feel so welcomed and at home right away which was what I needed. It is a college that helps you down your path of becoming whatever you want to be in life. I do not regret my decision to transfer, it is a great school with so many opportunities for everyone."
Junior,5,North Central College has great professors and the all of them are always prepared to help you when you are in need.
Freshman,5,It is very inclusive with a focus on growth and development. You feel the warmth as soon as you first step into any of its buildings. The people there all have a direction and are set to build each other up.
Freshman,5,Not only is North Central highly regarded for their education the campus itself is a great place to be apart of. The entire faculty is so kind and helpful and the coaches are extremely dedicated. I have only done a few visit days and an overnight but I am thrilled about attending north central this fall!
Senior,5,This is a really fantastic school. They have prepared me for my future and I am blessed to have been able to go here!
Freshman,5,"I love North Central College. The small town feel is great while living within a bigger city. The classes are all small, which means the professors know not only your name, but they know you as well. You can simply walk across campus and see a bunch of people you know, and everybody is super nice and understanding as well. It is a great place to go to school!"
Freshman,5,"I'm valued as an individual yet getting the education of a top notch institution.  Everyone here is so positive, welcoming, and supportive of each other.  Everyone wants each other to grow and succeed, and we are given the tools, resources, and opportunities to do just that."
Sophomore,5,"I believe that North Central College has a great community, with even better Professors and staff. The only thing I would change is some of the academic rules."
Niche User,5,"My father graduated from North Central.  He loved it!  I have looked at other private schools locally and have found North Central to be the best.  Fits all my needs.  Love the location and it's closeness to the beautiful downtown Naperville area (the suburban ""Chicago"").  It is a beautiful campus and has incredible teachers.  They work with you and get you the best possible admissions package they can."
Junior,5,"This college is amazing. It has a great location (right next to Downtown Naperville and a 30 minute train ride to the city). It is beautiful at all times of the year. In the classroom, the sizes aren't as big so you get a lot of one on one assistance if need be. There are also plenty of resources and opportunities in the surrounding areas as well."
Junior,5,"Nice, small college near downtown Naperville. Professors are passionate and helpful, plenty of opportunities for research and internships."
Sophomore,5,North Central College was my first priority college and I don't regret it one bit. Everyone is so focused on succeeding and helping each other out. You can easily make friends at this school.
Junior,5,The college is easy to navigate. Everything is within walking distance. Downtown Naperville is easily accessible by foot.  New buildings enhance one's learning experience. The professors are friendly and readily accessible for help.
Junior,5,I love this school. The student to professor ratio is perfect. Because the classes are relatively small the professors know the students by name and are always more than willing to help out when needed!!
Niche User,5,"North Central is quite the amazing college. The area is great, the students are fantastic and the food is tasty. Just doing a visit there makes you feel welcomed into the community and you feel like a part of the family. Everyone is so cheerful and awesome at making you feel welcomed. The athletics are also a great way to get to know people and have life long friends."
Junior,5,"This is currently only my first year at North Central, but so far it has been the most amazing experince having the privelage to attend here. The faculty and staff are extreamly helpful as well as fellow students, and the level of activities they put on to encourage student involvement is appreciated."
Freshman,5,"Great school and campus! It offers a close-knit community and courses that will challenge you. Overall, very happy with my decision to attend North Central College!"
Alum,5,"This is the perfect private college if you are looking to be in smaller classes. The professors are very nice and helpful, they will find the time to meet with you if you are having a hard time with an assignment or test."
Senior,5,I love how involved many of the professors are in their teachings and coursework. I have never met so many that are really engaged in their lectures and seem to always incorporate the students in their lectures!
Alum,5,Loved my experience at NC. The business program and professors are amazing and I truly feel like my education set me up for success.
Freshman,5,The amount of resources available to the students is incredible. Everyone does a very good job with making incoming students feel welcomed.
College Sophomore,5,cause there is always campus safety around
College Sophomore,5,"North Central is truly a unique school. With the great location in downtown Naperville, and its proximity to the city, it has many wonderful professors. It's a homey feeling campus, and one of my favorite things is the 'small school' feel- I see someone I know everywhere I go. I would not choose another school in a million years. The trimesters are another thing that makes the school unique, but they aren't for everyone. I really enjoy the quarter system because it allows me to focus on less at once instead of being overwhelmed with 5-7 classes."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school so much, and I really feel like I'm at home when I'm there."
College Junior,5,"North Central is one of the most accepting and tolerant communities I've ever been a part of. Because of the location, many of our students who grew up in town are white, upper-middle class straight people, but we have a large mix of international and out of state students who certainly shake things up culturally, as well as a large population of students who concern themselves more with creating diversity than on their own studies. Many students go out of their way to create a welcoming community for religious minorities, as well as LGBTQ students. Race has not struck me as an issue among students, especially after the march for equality. When other universities demonstrated around the country in order to bring attention to the problems at their own schools, we marched in solidarity, making the statement that we would never tolerate that type of behavior here."
College Sophomore,5,Provides excellent staff and a difficult yet learning experience
College Junior,5,I love living on campus
College Junior,5,"North Central has been the most challenging part of my educational career, but thus far the best. I came from a huge high school so coming to a smaller school was not ideal but I love it at NCC! I really enjoy my time there and am really looking forward to the Fall!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"I felt really safe while I was on campus. Campus Safety was always available to drive students to appointments off campus, to the train station, to class (if they had a disability/hard time walking to class), or to their residence halls after a sporting even if it got out late. Students receive e-mails concerning bad weather or events where campus safety had been called."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I feel like every penny I spent at North Central was well worth it. I had to work hard for the grades that I received, but I know that I received a quality education. The Career Development office is friendly and more than happy to help students and alumni. Unlike other schools, alumni can use the services of Career Development for as long as they live. The school hosts a job fair every year, so students, alumni, and others are able to meet with prospective employers."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved going to North Central College and even though I graduated, it is still my home away from home. It feels like a family and I have met some wonderful people that have become life long friends."
College Freshman,5,"I have never been a part of or witnessed anything bad happen on campus. Also, there are many organizations that give presentations etc. to prevent bad situations. Our most popular organization is called Green Dot. Green Dot specializes in sexual abuse prevention."
College Freshman,5,"Since most professors are actively working in their field, they have access to many connections to get a student a job.

All the student has to do is become liked by their professor."
College Sophomore,5,We have freat school sprit and all teams are supported around campus not just during the game
College Sophomore,5,It has been a great year and half. I am on the dance team that dance at all the basketball and football games to help create school spirt. The professors know the students on and one on one and help you get good grades.
College Freshman,5,"By rating 5, I'm really rating it 1. The school is very straight-edge. Alcohol is moderate, and people here really dislike weed for some reason."
College Junior,5,"The North Central science program has been the most rigorous experience of my life. However, It has been so rewarding.I have not only grown intelectually, but my understanding of the world and maturity have increased exponentially."
College Junior,5,"I can't say enough positive things about Al Carius and his XC and track programs at North Central.  Al is a fantastic coach and mentor, always positive and motivating.  He has been at NCC for 50 years now.  Imagine that!  He and the other inspirational coaches have experienced great success with their top-notch D-3 running programs over the years.  It's an honor to be a part of this great legacy with them, and I am humbled to be a part of the talented team of Cardinal guys and girls."
Recent Alumnus,5,very good teams in most sports
College Sophomore,5,The professors truly care about your success and are always there to help you.
College Junior,5,My school allows me to blaze my own path; success or failure - I have the flexibility I need to feel empowered and supported.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the community here! The professors are absolutely phenomenal, and it is great to be advised by someone within your field of study. You are not just a number here, and the focus is not just on your degree but on steps towards a career."
College Freshman,5,"They offer a ton of intermurals and free fitness classes, and sports on campus are great too."
College Freshman,5,"Campus is right in downtown, so there are a lot of good food options."
College Freshman,5,They give you the scholarships and tell you where you can earn more. It is automatically added to your account
College Senior,5,Downtown Naperville is obviously a great place to go out and visit bars or dine. It's phenomenal.
College Sophomore,5,In the athletic training program we have unique learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom.
College Sophomore,5,I would not change my choice in school to study athletic training. North Central's program is amazing and offers several opportunities in addition to keeping up with the certification standards of CAATE.
College Freshman,5,"The difficulties I have faced so far with this major is actually doing the coding. The computer science 160 course was the first time that I have done coding in my entire life. The only tips/ advice that I give is never slack up because it does not get any easier with time, that it progresses and gets harder."
College Freshman,5,The college is located in downtown Naperville so there are a plethora of different shops not to far from campus. Naperville is virtually a safe place with people that are friendly.The overall feel of the area around the school is great.
College Sophomore,5,"The local atmosphere in this city of great. The city of Naperville is often one of the highest ranked cities in the U.S., and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Our small campus is conveniently located right on the edge of downtown Naperville. This means numerous restaurants, food chains, shopping centers, bars, and even the Public Library are all in walking distance for North Central College students. North Central College has been around for years, probably longer than most of the stores downtown, so shops are very familiar with and friendly to students. There's the river walk, where you can take beautiful winding paths, passing by exquisitely designed fountains, gorgeous bridges, and plenty of statues. Centennial Beach, (a man made beach) is a hot destination when the weather gets warm. There are also various Carnivals happening downtown throughout the year as well."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID, all learning was moved online and the adjustment was made quickly and as efficiently as possible. The professors adjusted their schedules and some their grading scales to accommodate the students. Professors were very willing to talk and work through any issue that may arise such as WiFi problems or technological uncertainty."
Senior,4,Overall North Central  is a good school. The school is known for its multiple sports teams as well as its multiple academic achievements.
Senior,4,Online learning was pretty easy at North Central. The professors were always willing to help. Some professors didn’t respond in a timely manner. Looking on blackboard and keeping track of the due dates is key.
Sophomore,4,My online experience was very good at North Central. The professors kept in contact and continuously emailed me to be sure everything was okay with my family. Online discussions were organized and kept students engaged in the material even though it was online.
Sophomore,4,I love the environment at North Central College. It has truthfully become my home away from home and I am so grateful I made the decision to go here. The students/professors are extremely helpful and generous whenever I need help or have questions.
Freshman,4,"All of the people that I met are extremely kind and welcoming. I really enjoyed the events that the college's Weekend Programming Board put on and I enjoyed connecting with others via sports and clubs. The professors I had were always prepared, knew their subject well, and displayed passion for what they taught. North Central does its best to educate students on serious issues such as sexual assault. The college is sustainable too- it promotes recycling correctly. I would improve the food options--the food on campus is not bad, but there are not many vegetarian options and fewer gluten free options."
Sophomore,4,The professors at the school are very knowledgeable and always willing to help their students. The campus is well kept and close to downtown Naperville which makes the school feel safe.
Sophomore,4,"North Central College does a great job getting their students ready for the real world. They help set up students with internships that can be beneficial to them in the future. The surrounding area is a beautiful place. I think if North Central had more of a diverse population of students, it would be the be even better."
Freshman,4,The location of North Central is very ideal. North Central is surrounded by a great downtown area and is located close to the train station. So it's very easy to get to Chicago. The college also has a great community feel and it's very easy to be a part of campus life.
Niche User,4,"North Central College came to me by mail and i've been so glad I received a letter from them.  After that I have been helped with deciding on what I want to go for and my many questions.  This school has been very nice to talk to about my future plans.  They seem to have everything I am looking for and so much more. They have a great Pre-vet program that I will be starting this coming fall. Within this program I will also be able to major in Biology.  Overall, I thin this school has a great environment for all students and I can not wait to start school there."
Sophomore,4,I love the location. Downtown Naperville is fun of things to do al the time. The small class sizes allow for professors to really interact with their students and provide one on one help.
Junior,4,"I like the sense of community and the small class sizes that both can be found at the small liberal arts college. The one change I would like to see would be for the tuition to stop increasing by over $1,000 each school year."
Junior,4,"I love this school. Campus is the perfect size. Professors are very engaging and involved with students. If you commute, parking is a bit of a problem (speaking from experience)"
Junior,4,North Central has a great faculty that really cares about helping you succeed in your future endeavors.
Freshman,4,"North Central is a very welcoming place to pursue a degree. The classes are challenging, the people are friendly, and the atmosphere is encouraging. I would love to see a bit of a change in the performing arts department. They definitely promote the shows way more to applicants and when the actual show comes around, the quality is not as good as it could be."
Junior,4,"North Central is a very good school, with solid academics. The only real issue I have with it their website. It is hard to navigate, links do not always take to the page you believe they will and further links redirect you to the same page. The best way to find items is to simply google the college and the issue and the correct page will finally pop up. Beyond this issue, everything else runs smoothly and the professors seem genuinely interested in helping their students"
Sophomore,4,"I think that North Central is a decent division three school. The worst part is the food. Besides that, we are right in the middle of a town, so there are fun things to do downtown, since it is a five minute walk. The athletics are amazing and we are good at most sports. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus as well. The professors are kinda iffy, and you need to check ratemyprofessors.com because those are fairly accurate, so you don't get a bad professor."
Freshman,4,"This is a small school, that is full of incredible professors who really care about the well being and success of their students. If you know what you want to go to school for and they offer it I highly recommend attending (if you can afford it, it's pretty expensive even by college standards.) The class sizes are very small which makes it easy to actually connect with the professors and other students. Not to mention they just opened an absolutely incredible new science center. Also, the school is located very close to downtown Naperville which was excellent as I was living on campus without a car and occasionally needed an escape."
Junior,4,I liked this school. It was a nice school to commute to. Campus has a nice cozy vibe and usually amazing professors.
Freshman,4,"So far I really like North Central College. They really help get the students engage with something and the staff are very nice. The campus is very beautiful, especially in the fall, and the food is very tasty. I also love the community surrounded North Central College, which is downtown Naperville, a very beautiful location, especially at night. I can say that if you want a place that is very positive both aesthetically and mentally, then North Central College is the college for you."
College Sophomore,4,"Small, build relationships with your professors"
College Junior,4,"I've had some bad professors but overall they are passionate, interesting, and make darn good lectures. Class size is usually medium, but some niche classes have very small sizes, especially in languages when you get to the third year. Using Ratemyprofessor helps."
College Junior,4,Campus safety is almost always patrolling and they're always available if you need to get home at night but don't want to walk. There have been a few instances of non-college affiliated individuals compromising the safety of the campus but CS is on top of things and they take their job seriously.
College Junior,4,"It's got great spirit and most of my professors have been fun, dedicated, curious individuals who love to talk about what they know best. People... tend to not be great groups for projects. That, or I almost always get the horribly incompetent workers."
College Sophomore,4,"The rooms are spacious and nice, closet space is generally good. Despite the bad rep of community bathrooms, I would choose them over suite style."
College Sophomore,4,North Central is generally good at sports. I believe a lot of the students care a lot for the school and that shows through their school spirit. Our football stadium is awesome.
College Sophomore,4,I have a job on campus and I am apart of the school's cheer team.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at North Central are highly praised. The track and football team are the most achieving sports, but other sport do pretty well too. Not a lot of people go to the games so it never feels full."
College Freshman,4,loved it and would stay longer given the chance to.
College Freshman,4,You receive so much knowledge in areas of your career path that you're more than likely to obtain a job after graduation.
College Freshman,4,It's so serious to the point where meetings on the premise are had quite occasionally.
College Freshman,4,"I've enjoyed so much of my college as of yet and would really love to stay forever, but that's not realistically possible."
College Junior,4,"North Central offers a wide variety of majors and minors, but within programs, there is not as much. To major in English with a concentration in Writing, you take anywhere between 2/3 and 4/5 literature classes and just a few writing classes. The writing professors are my favorite, so full of wisdom and inspiring. They are what motivates me to get through English Literature to 1660, 18th Century Literature, 19th & 20th Century English Literature, 19th & 20th Century American Literature, Reading Literature, Global Literature, etc. These are not all the lit classes I have to take. There are easily three times as many. Definitely don't be afraid to change majors, but do so with caution, or else you'll be stuck taking all those freshman classes as a junior."
College Junior,4,"Campus safety may be a bunch of incompetent interns, but they're not needed very often for anything serious because Naperville is one of the safest cities I can think of."
College Junior,4,"The career center is focused on helping you find an internship or a job. In my experience, companies see that applicants are studying at NCC and choose them over others based on the reputation alone. The networking here is excellent in that you always have a good three or four professors you automatically put down as references."
College Sophomore,4,"Cross Country, Track, and Football are excellent"
College Junior,4,As an Athletic Training Student I attend a lot of sporting events on campus. All teams performance at North Central are at a high levels. There are many talented athletes at NCC. For a D3 school I feel that we have pretty good facilities. The athletes have the fans supports and give the student population an ideal school spirit.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I think that the rooms are spacious and I highly recommend that you bunk your beds or loft them. I lived in Patterson for three years and loved the rooms there. The rooms in Res Rec are nice as well, but the rooms on the 4th floor get cold since the only source of heat comes from the floor. For the most part, people will prop their doors open so that they can say hi to people walking past, but some people might prefer to keep their doors closed. I think that the cost of living on campus is a little high, but it is totally worth it. I commuted for one year, so trust me on this!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"One word: football. The football team at North Central is fantastic and most students are proud of our Cardinals. The basketball team is also good. One thing is for sure, students and alums are always at each sporting event to cheer on our teams and they are always loyal to our teams/school. The recreation center is really new, the equipment is always clean, and it is always a warm atmosphere."
College Senior,4,I love my teachers and their advice
College Senior,4,I love the small classes!
College Senior,4,Love all the security around campus
College Senior,4,North Central College is a great learning experience that helps us feel prepared in our career fields!
College Sophomore,4,I have been able to take a variety of courses to discover what my final major would be. There are many choices and I been challenge with all of them.
College Sophomore,4,School spirit is really high here at NCC. The football games are well attended with lots of alumni coming to games.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the classes and staff are wonderful. They are easy to get along with and very helpful. I just struggle with the social aspect of this college because I do not live there. I don't necessarily feel like I am an equal member of the community."
College Freshman,4,I only pay attention to Tennis at my school because that is the only sport I am interested in. And it is wonderful. I took a tennis class and participated in intramurals which were both led by the varsity tennis coach. It made me happy that I could still learn from an esteemed coach without having to commit all my time to being on an actual tennis team.
College Sophomore,4,We have no crime on campus. Our campus is really safe. Our campus safety is always driving away and can call them easy.
College Sophomore,4,Every class is different due to witch class you are taking and who the professor is teaching the class. The class sizes are very small but it is great to have small classes
College Sophomore,4,North Central is a lot of work surrounded by a friendly atmosphere. Plan smart to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,We have a great athletic sector here.
College Freshman,4,Most first year proffessors are new and others have been here a long time but both of them give a sense that you belong.
College Sophomore,4,"North Central College is a prestigious school with challenging academics and knowledgeable, passionate professors that truly want to help you succeed. There are dozens of free resources available to students, such as Academic Support, Career Advising, Counseling and Health services at Dyson Wellness Center, and Edge monitored study hall. However, North Central is also on an incredibly fast-paced trimester system consisting of three 10-week terms rather than two 16-week semesters. This means that there is absolutely no time for play. If you're not a serious student and really organized, don't put yourself in a grave stressing over EVERYTHING."
College Junior,4,"Our athletic teams are good, but I do not pay much attention to them. Our track and field team is superb and our football team is one of the best in D3."
College Junior,4,"I feel totally safe on campus.  I do worry about my car in the remote lot, though, especially with car parts being stolen  for the copper components."
Recent Alumnus,4,internship required in my major
College Sophomore,4,We have a very active campus safety organization on campus.
College Sophomore,4,There are many resources students can take advantage of concerning their future career.
College Sophomore,4,This was my first year living on campus. I have had a very positive experience thus far.
College Sophomore,4,There are many ways to get exercise and athletic activities that anyone can participate in.
Sophomore,2,"Online classes were a mess, partly because it was rushed to happen. Lack of motivation from students and profs."
Sophomore,2,"I was in community college for a year then got called up by one of the recruiters to transfer over. What they don't tell you beforehand is what courses transfer over. I wouldn't transfer unless if your college specifically has a transfer guide directly towards North Central. Professors are so so and that's disappointing considering how I thought with the higher tuition costs, they'd be better than community college professors."
Sophomore,2,"The professors have such high and unrealistic expectations for the students. They treat them as if their class is the only class they are taking. If you fall behind at all, you’re screwed because you have 10 weeks to learn the amount of material that is hard enough in 15 weeks."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Safety is very present at all times. It probably makes some people feel safer, but for most people they're pretty over-the-top and intimidating."
College Freshman,2,"They aren't really the chillest places around, but they're a place to sleep."
College Freshman,2,"North Central is not an ideal place to go to college. It's location seems appealing, but it's financially unrealistic to travel to Chicago often, and Naperville immediately gets old. It seems that a majority of people go home every weekend, and there isn't much to do. The classes are usually interested and most of the professors are very good. Overall, there is nothing impressive about North Central College."
College Sophomore,2,There is no greek life which I don't really mind. There are only honors academic fraternities and sororities.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not feeling like I'm fitting in. I'm actually looking at other schools currently, maybe switching at the term."
College Junior,2,"School is not NASM accredited, the faculty and student body are unsupportive towards you if you want to exceed musically."
College Freshman,2,"First year campus housing is awful. The dorms are extremely small and old. Our cable never worked despite constantly being to that is was going to be fixed and wifi is infuriating. It is NOT an exageration to say I fight to get connected to the wifi for 5 minutes every time I open my laptop. Then half of the time I try to print something, the printer won't work. They have unsatisfactory technology for the tuition I pay at this school. Also because the building is old the plumbing is atrocious. Usually one of the 2 toilets that 15 girls have to share is not working. The shower heads are so low I have to bend down it get under it and I'm not even that tall (I'm 5'6""!). Additionally the shower's water pressure is little more than a trickle of water which has so much chlorine in it that it has severely damaged my hair. Lastly the windows are so narrow practically no light gets in. The ONLY good thing about the Rall dorm, is that there is heating controls in each room. Also the cleaning staff try their best to stay on top of the bathroom issues but it is still majorly unpleasant. I would not recommend anyone stay here."
College Freshman,2,Kaufman is disgusting and there's only good food on campus visit days. Otherwise I just go to the Boiler House.
College Sophomore,2,I think there is a great compromise in the quality of food here. A lot of our options are starches and carbs. I don't know how athletes eat here and still stay in shape to be honest.
College Senior,2,"Again, I would not visit this school if I had known how terrible the support is for adult students."
College Senior,2,"The class size is so small (under 30 a room) that if the class fills up (for business majors they are always full) you will never graduate on time. I am constantly seeing people complain about not graduating on time because the college has an almost unwritten rule that the goal is to keep you here as long as possible to drain your finances. 

The people you will be paired with in group projects are usually lower than average intelligence and not ready for undergrad. Many are lazy, rude, and rich. If you are a hard worker, expect to be exploited. If you are in a group with international students, expect to do all of the work because many do not speak english to even a general conversational level and plagiarize their papers form the internet."
College Senior,2,"This school is not ideal or appropriate for business majors or adults trying to finish their BA in any business degree field. I would even go far as to say that even if you aren't an adult, it's a terrible place to finish a BA in business or related. The classes repeat each other and many teachers are incompetent and force self-teaching. They do not offer online courses, so you are forced to visit a class that could have been completed online. They find any excuse to keep you at NCC past your anticipated graduation date and have terrible support services for adults. By adult I mean anyone over the age of 25. Again, if you are reading this DO NOT attend this school for you Bachelor's or as a transfer student. Find somewhere that is not stuck in the 18th century and has more support for technical fields or advanced students that want to complete the degree quickly. The alumni network is a joke and you'll meet several incompetent faculty members that will make your life miserable."
College Senior,2,"Slow, incompetent administration that doesn't care to add new sections for full courses that are required to graduate. For example, the Marketing program has specific requirements that are only offered once a year, and the class is always full. You have to receive a waiver to attend and pray that the teacher will sign it. My experience trying to graduate on time here has been awful, and I'm not alone. If you are an adult student stay far, far away from this school."
College Senior,2,"The variety, price, and quality are abysmal. We also have very little variety in drink options - Pepsi has a contract with our campus but only regular Pepsi and Mountain Dew are available. Don't eat the sandwiches from the Boilerhouse they sit in the cooler past their expiration. The service and quality of food at the Cage is disgusting."
College Sophomore,2,Basically if you don't have a special major they don't have scholarships for you. There are a few grants but the scholarships you sign up for there is almost none.
College Freshman,2,Upperclassman to expensive. freshman site to far from campus and shuttle hard to schedule.
College Junior,2,"There is a remote lot which students can park in BUT a shuttle has to pick them up to bring them to campus.  

Parking passes for commuter students are expensive! And even if you purchase one, it doesn't guarantee you a parking spot in any of the commuter lots. 

Street parking is only allowed in 4 hr increments."
College Junior,2,This past winter was a nightmare and the school will rarely cancel classes in negative 50 weather and blizzards. Commuters are not cared about in that respect.
College Freshman,2,The weather is tough walking to classes
College Junior,2,"If you are able to find/afford off-campus housing near campus then you're basically set. However, off-campus housing goes fast, so you have to look far in advance. It's also good if you know the current residents of the place you'd like to rent. However, because of the area, it is usually really expensive and difficult to find, but if you can afford it I would definitely think it's worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've heard, it is relatively easy to find homes or apartments to rent. Unfortunately, it is very expensive, especially as you get closer to campus or downtown Naperville.
"
College Sophomore,2,"During the winter the walk from building to building can be brutal. Though the campus is only a few blocks the weather can easily get to below zero with windchill. For the most part campus staff does a good job of clearing the ice off the sidewalks. However, during the fall and spring there are always people outside doing homework, tanning, or playing sports."
College Junior,2,"Naperville is very white-centric. North Central is in the heart of Naperville and as such is subject to Naperville's egocentrism. However, the facilities and great shopping in downtown Naperville more than make up for the occasional priviledged valley-girl attitude."
College Freshman,2,"Parking permits are expensive and it's usually difficult to find parking in Naperville, especially during heavy class times like in the morning."
College Freshman,2,"There is not that much diversity, we are a smaller school so there is not that much room for diversity."
College Freshman,2,Don't plan on bringing your car to campus as a freshman. Freshman have a special off campus lot that you have to take a school shuttle bus to get to.
College Freshman,2,"There is a parking lot for students that want to pay a lot or a parking lot that is a few miles away from campus that is less expensive but not walking distance.  Being in the middle of Naperville, the second largest city in IL, parking is always tight."
College Sophomore,2,Doesnt Exist – unfortunately the program that I am interested in does not exist at the school! so i just retook some classes that I didnt do so well in from the previous year that I was in college
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much in Between – alot of them were poorly dressed, a few walked around without any shoes on their feet... im guessing to make some sort of a statement! but as far as a student body as a whole they either looked really young (fresh out of high school still living with parents) or they were alot older wit ha family of there own!not much in between"
College Freshman,2,"Dorms Are Relatively Nice, but Residential Staff Is Horrible. The dorms are relatively nice compared to others that I've heard about.  My friends that go to other schools complain about the cleanliness of their community-style bathrooms, but ours are cleaned everyday.  Most dorms have a computer lounge that is accessible at anytime of the day except for Geiger, which is closed during lunch/dinner hours and during the EDGE Study Program.  Residential life staff, more specifically the Area Hall Directors, are difficult to talk to about roommate conflicts.  One in particular handles her job very immaturely."
College Freshman,2,"Great, but Expensive! We have a ton of options in Naperville, IL within walking distance of the campus; however, it is expensive.  It's great for a once in a while type meal, but not something you could do everyday as a college student on a budget."
College Freshman,2,"Some High School Again – When you think of college, you think of skipping class now and then, coming late maybe, etc. But at North Central, YOU CANT DO THAT! The Professors care. One professor requested us to stay for the next class (same class different time) if we arrived late. Others would dock your grade if you didn't show up. They know who you are so they know if you aren't there. As far as grading goes, the teachers range from strict to pushovers. The campus police are strict on underage drinking, drug use, etc. I haven't been to a party on campus because of that. If you are caught, you lose and scholarships you had, even if they are not sports related. Also, the campus is small and surrounded by highly expensive residential area so it is nearly impossible to get to a party on campus. There are parties though, so don't eliminate the ability to go to one."
College Senior,2,"Mostly White Students – While North Central College prides themself on the amount of international students that they hold, the campus is mostly white.  I usually only see white people around campus and in my classes.  Every once and a while I will see someone of a different culture."
College Freshman,2,"I love the people to death. But everyone is SO focused on school. And there is friday's where I sit in my room trying to figure out what to do. Friday's at this school suck. There is nothing to do if you're under 21 and don't have a car. I am at Northern Illinois most weekends partying it up. If you like to party, don't come here..."
College Freshman,2,"Primarily white. My roommate is African-American, and that's the only reason I know the other black people at my school. There is probably less than 20 in the freshman class of 600 or so."
College Freshman,2,"NCC is located near a train, which is nice. However, if you dont want to be running back and forth to classes, you better have your own car, and be damn lucky. Spots fill up very fast, and your lucky to ever get a comutter spot."
College Senior,2,I think parking should be a  alot better and more availble for when school events come up. I dont think it should be fair that residents are asked to be moved from the spots  during these events.
Niche User,1,"North Central College is not the best school if you have mental health issues due to the pressure they put on you. Some of the professors don’t care about their students, and will not help you. Anyone who is unable to pay the fee for each term of enrollment can expect to not be able to pick the classes at the expected date they say you can. If you choose this school make sure you are prepared for college and have a clear idea of what you want to do, this school is not worth going into debt. There have been many students forcibly kicked out or left behind because they were not good for the school’s prestigious reputation. There are great opportunities at this school, but you have to make sure you are well prepared to be on your own and manage time wisely."
Alum,1,"Terrible college. Academic advisers are useless and change very frequently, doesn't offer medical withdrawal and professors don't care about students medical conditions."
Freshman,1,"It was an expensive mistake but transferred for sophomore year.   The school grants athletes and certain students privileges, in housing especially.  The dorms for freshman and the food are especially bad."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life because Naperville will not allow. I believe weekend life would be more lively if we did have them.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Senior,1,I don't like that type of life.
College Freshman,1,"There aren't a lot of parties in general. There aren't a lot of places to go, and most of the parties are pretty boring."
College Freshman,1,"There aren't a lot of parties going on, and if there are they're not very exciting. A lot of people looking for parties end up finding one at a different school."
College Senior,1,"we do not have greek life,."
College Freshman,1,"It's Chicago, you can't expect good weather. The winters are horrible, the spring is half winter and half rain, and the summers are boiling hot."
College Sophomore,1,I hate the midwest weather. It is always cold and snowy 
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible. Bad hours, not many options and the food is always average. "
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life
College Freshman,1,The drug policy is strict and tickets for drinking are often handed out.
College Freshman,1,"Extremely strict drug policy. Police and Campus Safety are constantly patrolling, and are always present. Consequences are strict."
College Sophomore,1,I paid for a parking permit but the lots are always full so i end up parking on the street.
College Sophomore,1,"It's excessively difficult to make any friends as a transfer student coming in for winter term.  Everyone already has their own cliques, people don't like to talk classmates they don't know, and no one wants to carry on a conversation with a stranger.  It looks okay if you come here as a freshman right out of high school, but as a transfer student it's just not worth it."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is very expensive. Freshman have to park at the ""Remote Lot,"" located a little over a mile from campus. There is a shuttle to and from the lot, but miss it, and you're waiting another hour to get to your car. Upperclassmen parking is not too inconvenient, it's just horribly expensive. Be vary wary of parking on the street as well, as most streets only allow 4 hour parking from 6AM-6PM. The cops are very on top of their parking tickets which run from $25-$50 bucks a pop."
College Freshman,1,Girls are annoying gossipy and obnoxious. I hate the dorms.
College Freshman,1,"The computers on campus are slow, unreliable, and annoying. There are not enough. The printers are never full with paper or ink. I hate having to use them."

Alum,5,"I only had a couple of online classes during my time at Augustana. Two of the classes were with the same professor, and she was always available to me if I had questions. She was quick to respond to and always helpful."
Alum,5,Augustana felt like home. Every professor I had cared about my success and well being. All the professors there knew you by name and would make time outside their visiting hours to chat with you if you didn't understand something. Going to Augustana was the best decision of my life.
Freshman,5,"The professors are incredibly intelligent and helpful. I love the close-knit nature of Augustana, the professors immediately memorize your name and it makes it easier to go to their office hours when they can remember who you are."
Junior,5,"As soon as you arrive at Augustana, you are welcomed into a great community of student leaders, professors that want to see you succeed, and so many others that are there to support you. There are so many opportunities made available to you and your professors will invest in you to see you flourish. My education is preparing me to go far and wide in my career and I could not have made a better decision."
Junior,5,"Augustana University is a place where you will build connections that last a lifetime. Not only does the community of Augustana create opportunities to establish close relationships with peers, but you will also establish relationships with your professors. That is what I love about this school. You will never simply be just a number. The University is invested in you and wants you to achieve your hopes and goals."
Sophomore,5,"Many aspects of my college career have created my positive experience at Augustana including real-world experience through clubs and the classroom, weekend life, and the community aspect.

I am studying business communications and marketing at Augie. Many of the business classes are focused on real world experience through creating marketing plans for local clients or hearing about a business professional’s experience in their position. 

Augustana’s weekend life options have also led to my positive college experience. With the weekend offering of other clubs on campus and new-found college friends, many students—including myself—find themselves WANTING to say at Augustana on the weekends.

Augustana truly is a community. With the small campus size, there is always someone you know and always someone new to meet. The professors care not only about your class performance, but also about your well-being—they become friends outside the classroom!"
Sophomore,5,Augustana is the epitome of an institution that cares about its students! The community of Vikings is strong and vibrant. Professors care about you and prepare you not only to receive a job after graduation but to succeed in that job after graduation. I am so grateful for the time I have spent at 2001 S Summit Ave!
Senior,5,"Attending Augustana University has been fundamental in my career development. The classes that I’ve taken continually challenge my perspective and are paired with meaningful hands-on learning experiences. More than anything, it’s the relationships within the campus community that stand out to me. The faculty and staff take the time to develop meaningful relationships with students. They remember the small details, making you feel like a person rather than just a number on campus. Ultimately, these relationships have helped propel me into my career and to discover where my passions meet the needs of this world. For that, I am deeply grateful."
Junior,5,"Augustana University is an excellent place to receive a quality education. The best part about Augie is that the campus truly feels like a community. The professors are friendly, approachable, and intelligent. They look out for you and will engage you in your learning. I would highly recommend this University to any student who wishes to be challenged academically, live in a welcoming and friendly community, and wishes to become involved on campus."
Junior,5,I love Augie! It is a thriving community filled with people from all different backgrounds. It truly is the place for possibilities. We have so many resources in place that allow for students to be true to themselves and discern their vocational calling.
Senior,5,"Augustana University is a college that is committed to seeing each of their students succeed not only in the classroom, but in all aspects of life. From the the Student Success Center which helps students discover their career path to mental health resources to supportive and invested professors, Augustana is an excellent university that will set graduates up for rewarding and impactful careers."
Junior,5,"Augie is all about what you make of it! Students get resources to plan their own vocational path. I love Augie because I can be involved in clubs, support Viking athletics and visual arts, study abroad, graduate early, double major, do research with professors, travel to academic conventions, and most importantly, engage in communal relationships with faculty, staff, and students. Augie truly is the ""place for possibilities,"" and the community wants YOU to leave as the best version of yourself."
Sophomore,5,"I have only been at Augustana for two years thus far, but I’ve loved it. Because of the size of the university, there is so much potential for relationship growth between students but also between students and professors. I have formed so many lasting relationships with my classmates and my professors."
Freshman,5,So far Augustana University has been a great fit for me. The professors are very knowledgeable and approachable. They have always been responsive to feedback and willing to help every student that comes to them. The community on campus is great and there are endless ways to get involved.
Freshman,5,"This school's small, community-oriented atmosphere makes you feel right at home. Professors are relatable, easy to talk to, and care about their students. There are so many opportunities to meet people and make friends. The only thing that can be tough to get past is some of the clique-like mentalities."
Freshman,5,"I'm very happy to get accepted to Augustana university. As an international student, the admission counsellors are very careful and helpful. They answer all my questions. I love the campus. The food is unlimited. This is perfect environment for students to grow."
Junior,5,"My favorite part of Augustana is the professors connection with the students. They are very involved in our lives here, and they truly care about or success. The students that attend Augustana are like-minded and share core values."
Junior,5,"When I came to Augustana University from India, I did not know what to expect in a new country, place and culture. The compassion, support and encouragement that I received from not only my peers but also my professors enabled me to get adjusted as well as engage in the community. Through practical application of what we learn in the class in labs, projects and outdoor learning, we not just earn credits but also strive to excel in our respective fields. As an institution, Augie understands the need to grow and change with time and I love that administration works along with students to hear student perspective. The constant strive for growth, and change while keeping the core  values of AU, I think is the #AugieAdvantage"
Sophomore,5,"I love Augustana, and being a student here.  The community they've created here is amazing.  It's a smaller school, which facilitates close relationships with professors and peers.  However, it's located in a larger city, generating tons of opportunities for students of all majors.  Professors here are some of the coolest people I've ever gotten to know.  They are all passionate about their subjects and sharing them with their students.  Professors strive to make connections and close relationships with you, encouraging conversations about school and otherwise, facilitating passionate future professionals.  The administration is easy to work with and concentrated on making life great for students.  I really couldn't ask for a better place to get my education, and to prepare for my future career.  Augustana is made great by the people here, almost all of whom have been exceptional.  It's an awesome school with immense opportunity."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved going to Augustana and my overall experience so far has been excellent! As soon as I walked onto the campus for the first time, I felt an immense sense of community and felt immediately welcome. Overall, classes are challenging but rewarding because the classes are usually relatively small so you really get that personal help and relationship with the professors. The campus is beautiful, and I have met so many wonderful people here. The nice thing about going to school at a smaller university is that I always see people that I know, however there are also so many opportunities to meet new people and build that sense of community even more. I highly would recommend Augustana University for anyone who wants an amazing Liberal Arts experience, and wants a loving home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"If I had to name one thing I love most about Augustana, it would be the 2,000 member family that I gained as soon as I accepted my admission to the university. At Augustana, not only are you a student, athlete, or activity leader, but you are also someone who is cared about by their peers and professors. Everyone on campus is outstandingly relational and want what is best for you in life. In my short time on campus, not only have I made lifelong friends within my freshmen class, but I have also gotten to know a majority of the upperclassman and faculty. While education may be the reason you came to Augustana, being a part of the campus family is what makes you stay."
Niche User,5,Augustana University instantly felt like home the first time that I set food on the campus. The people are so welcoming and I felt like I belonged.
Niche User,5,This school is a very high ranked school and is a very good school to attend. When I attended this school I was very satisfied with how everything when when I was there.
Freshman,5,Augustana University is an excellent college if you are willing to pay for it. They award very generous scholarships and the admissions staff is very friendly. The campus is similar to one big family. The professors are some of the best in the state and Augustana has even been awarded best college in the state of South Dakota.
Freshman,5,"Being my first year here, the welcome week committee made it very easy to transition from living in a small community to being here in Sioux Falls."
Sophomore,5,"Augustana University is a great college for any type of major someone would be looking for.  They excel in multiple areas, preparing kids for life after college.  Personally, I love the exercise science program I'm in.  The professors are amazing when it comes to giving extra help and assistance to the students when a student is struggling.  They care about how each individual student does in their class and is willing to give extra help.  The community is also a huge plus when it comes to the total experience at Augustana University.  The community pushes you to do your best as well as supports everything you do.  Overall, Augustana University has helped me grow into the person I am today and has helped me decide where I will eventually go with my life and job."
Alum,5,"Augustana not only satisfied my educational needs and major requirements but allowed me to indulge in my passion for travel.  It was a 4 year enlightening experience that I frequently revisit in my mind and wish I could go back and relive.  Being an Augie Alumni has prepared me better than I could have imagined as a professional and well rounded, traveled person."
Senior,5,"In my four years at Augustana University, I have learned so much inside and outside of the classroom. Wonderful academics, so many amazing opportunities, and insane college athletics make for a truly incredible college experience."
Junior,5,"Faculty and staff are truly outstanding. Not only will they do everything they can to make sure you know the content of the subject they teach, but they will go above and beyond to prepare you for life after graduation."
Freshman,5,"I am a high school senior that will be attending Augie next year and let me just tell you WOW!!!! It's an amazing campus that really focuses on the communication between a teacher and a student. Teachers are always available and there's not very many students in each class so you really get the most of your education. Great food and just an overall amazing campus that I am ready to spend the next four years of my life at. Some people can't handle the cold, but growing up there and having all of my family in the area really seals the deal. Also knowing that I get to play where I grew up and where my family is, is truly a blessing."
Freshman,5,"I like the enviromental, is a really confortable place, the food is good most of the time. Is a really good opportunity for international students like me."
Sophomore,5,Moving from California I thought I would be lonely. Early on I met great people and the incoming freshman classes are amazing. I would recommend the school and the town to anyone looking for a great education.
Alum,5,Augustana has a rich cultural and academic environment that allows students to flourish and gain necessary knowledge in a field of their choosing. The faculty beats any other faculty.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Augustana University has been everything I imagined and more. From the beginning of my relationship with AU, I have felt special and valued. The Admissions Department is superb - campus visits run smoothly, student ambassadors are friendly and helpful, Admissions Counselors are great and ready to answer any and every question. Campus life is great - first year residences are not too different from any other university BUT the free laundry is a major bonus! Also, free mini fridge/microwave units are available in every room. Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve. Professors are superb - open door policy makes visiting offices much more inviting and professors are so accessible. Classes are informative, relevant, and challenging. Professors will work with you in any way to help you understand information and better yourself as a student."
Freshman,5,I love the community feel at AU. Everyone is connected and it is awesome to be able to see a friendly face everywhere you go. The professors are incredible and truly care about their students' success.
Sophomore,5,Augustana University is a small college campus that really focuses on creating a close community. Professors are always willing to sit down and help you with any problems you are having in class and even in other future choices. Students put on so many events to promote that community atmosphere and makes it easy to make friends.
Sophomore,5,"Augustana University is a place where you can go to grow and learn more, not just about the world, but about yourself as well. It has a beautiful campus and wonderful professors who are always there to help. It a smaller University so it allows you to get to know your professors and learn from them at a personal level. This also shows you how passionate these professors are about their subjects and all they really want to do is to give you as much knowledge as they can so you can be just as passionate about it a they are. It is an academically challenging school and should not be attended lightly. Although it is on the more expensive side, the experience is more than worth it. Augustana gives its students tons of opportunities to travel abroad and to expand their knowledge."
Junior,5,"I did not expect to go to Augustana at all because I was looking at really big or really expensive schools, but when I saw the scholarship package that Augie offered me, I knew I had to come here. My experience at Augie has been great, as I have been able to take the money that I saved from not attending a larger state school (yes, Augie was thousands cheaper for me than any state school I applied to) and travel to 3 countries and 2 different continents. The students here are brilliant people--one girl who is in my grade was on College Jeopardy, and that's just one student that goes here! The professors here are great, as they definitely push you academically (like I didn't study before I came here) but also are some of the nicest people I know and are more than willing to help you out if you are struggling or just need another explanation for the material they are teaching. Augie is such a wonderful place, and you truly have to experience the #augieadvantage for yourself!"
College Sophomore,5,The professors on campus are extremely devoted and very unique. They are very passionate about the curriculum and especially the students. Some of the special study options on campus are the wide variety of tutors and the writing center. The writing center is a very useful tool for any class (not just English). Popular study ares include the library and the Huddle. The Huddle is a great place to grab a cup of coffee and bust out a paper.
College Sophomore,5,"Augie is such an ethnically diverse place. The only thing that isn't very diverse is religion. Since it is a private Christian college faith is what draws a lot of people to Augie. However, even though there are a lot of Christians, specifically Lutheran, it still amazes me how diverse people's beliefs are and how open and considerate they are when sharing them."
College Sophomore,5,"This was my dream school and I got everything and more than what I expected. The courses are really innovative and interesting. You can tell the professors are passionate about what they do and that they are very moral and respectable people. Even though it is a relatively small campus the courses offered are very diverse. Class sizes are relatively small, even in general requirement classes. The biggest issue I am facing right now is through the dining hall and campus life. There is a requirement that if you are a first or second year you must have ""The Unlimited"" meal plan which is quite expensive."
College Sophomore,5,There is very minimal campus crime. The biggest issue lately was a stalker on campus and that was dealt with VERY well by campus security. The campus safety service is great. They are not only there to keep you safe but they do other things like give your car a jump if needed or give you a ride late at night.
College Sophomore,5,"As a Religion and Philosophy major I knew that this would be the place to go. The professors are amazing in their fields and best of all, they are faithful. However, you do not have to be a religion major or someone of Christian faith to have a great experience here. The nursing major is very popular and there are many different faith/ethnic groups represented on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Many people, including myself, will tell you that Augie just ""feels right"". Why? Maybe, it's because of the small class sizes, awesome professors, wonderful campus setting, and welcoming community. Augustana is truly the place for possibilities. It's not just a marketing slogan; they're being serious. Heck, I'M being serious! 

You can double (even triple!) major in various subjects, there's no pressure to find (or keep) a major from the get go, and the staff (who you'd do well to get to know) are literally some of the nicest people I've met on this planet. Because it's a private, Lutheran-affiliated university, some people think that the fun isn't going to be so present, or that you have to be a certain type of person to get in. Not true at all! I work there (*ahem* work study, anyone?) and have seen all types of people walk through those doors. Plus, the place is totally happening. There are so many things going on there that I couldn't possibly list them all. 

You've got your intramurals, regular sports, tons of clubs, and general activities that anyone can join in on! Augie is all about studying abroad, and a great amount of people take advantage of that program. The dorms are, well, dorms. But, they did change one of the options to include a microfridge (a.k.a. a microwave/fridge combination) in your tuition, so that you don't have to bring one yourself. There are some funky old buildings from the 1800s still standing (Admissions and East Hall), and people usually just like to hang out on campus, because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many things to do. 

If you're already going to attend or are attending Augie, awesome! Go Vikings! If you're thinking about making Augie your next step, then I'd definetly recommend it.

Good luck!"
College Sophomore,5,Every augustana alumni i have spoken to has guaranteed their career exploration was easier because they attended augustana.
College Sophomore,5,This last semester I had to take a week off because of a death in the family and my professors were more than happy to accommodate my needs and offer emotional support.
College Sophomore,5,We regularly hold events in support of victims of sexual assault. We have a whole week dedicated to sexual assault victims where we dress up to different themes each day.
College Sophomore,5,The team and student body work together as one encouraging each other and pushing each other toward their goals
College Sophomore,5,"What makes my school unique is the pride we all take in our community by helping others and finding ways to better the environment around us. Augustana not only pushes the student body to lend a helping hand within the classroom, but also to be attentive to the needs of others wherever we go."
College Freshman,5,There is a very high placement rate and there is a lot of resources and great people working in the student success center.
College Freshman,5,I work at the Elmen center and we always talked high of and we people at Elmen are very welcoming !
College Freshman,5,I love Augustana and I want to be part of the graduating class of 2019! Augustana is great because of the people ! I have never meet a community that was as nice as augie.
College Junior,5,Professors at Augustana are tough but they push you to think beyond yourself
College Junior,5,Our college basketball team is No.1 in the religion.
College Junior,5,My college provides for me such a wonderful and friendly environment to study as well as make new friends
College Junior,5,"Academics at our school are some of the best in the Midwest. When we are given high ratings by business magazines/companies, it is for good reason! Our professors know their field and are always trying to learn more to better themselves every day. The workload can be hefty, but it isn't useless. If there is a program you want to go into but they don't have, find a professor and they will help you to accomplish your goals!"
College Junior,5,"I have learned a great deal about my chosen career path (education), and have developed a stronger passion for it every semester. The professors in the education department do what they can to make the course material relevant and beneficial to what we must do after we graduate, and we are complemented by schools because of it. When I leave Augustana, I am confident I will be able to get a teaching job because schools know Augustana professors give one of the best educations out there."
College Junior,5,"The variety of classes to take at Augie is great. And being a liberal arts college, students are given the opportunity to try their brains at all fields! I absolutely love this, because it gives me the chance to learn more about my interests and and talents. And the professors are amazing. I have only had one bad professor, and he was dismissed by the school. All of my other professors have been easy to understand and get along with, and leave their office doors open when they are available to talk to. They realize that college students lead busy lives, and are willing to give whatever help they can."
College Junior,5,"Our school is very proud of our athletic programs. We have an undefeated basketball team, and a nearly undefeated football team. We are a Division 2 school, but our athletes are good enough to be Division 1, and the Augustana community supports them!"
College Junior,5,"I have never found a place where I belong like I do at Augustana. The professors and students truly care about one another, and are willing to listen when you reach out to them for any reason. In my two and a half years, I have never felt out of place, worthless, or in danger. Augustana is a safe place that allows students to shine and succeed. I've made choices that I regret in the past, but choosing to attend Augustana is not one of them!"
Sophomore,4,"I took the second half of my freshman year online. It was very interesting, and although difficult, the professors made it accessible for all. It was a relief to finish it, but it was not a chore. I still enjoyed it."
Sophomore,4,The thing about Augustana that is the best is the professors. They truly care about the students and have enough time and energy to support them in their endeavors. The classes are small enough to make a personal connection with every professor. They want their students to succeed.
Junior,4,I am currently a junior at Augustana University. I love this school for the small class sizes and personal connections that are made between students and the professors. The faculty are all very supportive and understanding. It is extremely easy to contact them directly and get your questions answered. Augustana's faculty does a wonderful job finding internships and other career opportunities that further enable and encourage the students. All the academic buildings are located on one block and within walking distance. Augustana also has a fun and exciting social atmosphere where you can meet friends and build strong bonds that will last a lifetime.
Junior,4,"I have not yet taken any online classes through Augustana University; however, I have had many professors who took advantage of the technological tools on campus to further our learning outside of the classroom. Such techniques included: video lectures to summarize subject matter before class time, online workbook exercises, practice problems with immediate feedback, and comprehension quizzes."
Freshman,4,"I live in Sioux Falls so I have visited Augie many times! When I was younger, I did acting camps on campus so I am familiar with it. It is close to home for me. The staff and students are so welcoming and very good at answering any questions I have. They are really good about reaching out and sending emails or texts about certain events. I have had two professors email me and invite me to join a group video call to learn more about nursing. Though I have not attended there yet, I am very excited to go there in the Fall of 2020! The admissions counselor is very helpful and answers you quickly. If the staff isn't available, I can always ask attending students' questions! Skol Vikings!!"
Freshman,4,I had amazing counselors working with me every step. I was disappointed that while I got a great academic scholarship I felt that some of my other talents are not being rewarded. I am looking forward to the challenges of university and the opportunities I will have.
Junior,4,I have completed two years at Augustana University. I have enjoyed the two years so far here. The faculty and staff are welcoming and caring of our education and ensuring we are receiving a quality experience. Faculty from all areas of academic study are committed to our learning and are willing to go to great lengths to make sure that students are understanding material and exceeding academically.
Sophomore,4,"Augustana University is the perfect school if you are looking for small class sizes, committed professors, and a return on your investment.

 In the vast majority of my classes there are around 20 students allowing the professors to get to know each and every one of us. Compared to my friends at state schools with hundreds in their classes, that relationship formed with the professors is so valuable to me. Augie also has top notch professors in every discipline. From government professors that graduated from top Ivy League schools to Science professors actively doing research and publishing their findings, to art professors that do freelance work all over the world, AU has professors that will not only teach you but inspire you. Last but not least Augie has an astounding grad school acceptance rate and a job placement rate of 99 percent."
Niche User,4,"The educational opportunities offered here are good, however it is quite pricey. They have a few scholarships to lower the cost of admission, but even after those scholarships, the cost is still expensive. Although they have amazing laboratories for research purposes, they should spend more of their money towards student facilities, such as the student union and better dorms."
Freshman,4,"Augustana is a great university with a small school feel. It was exactly what I was looking for in a college. They have many different opportunities for their students to travel abroad, work with professors and community members outside of school,  and being involved with clubs on campus. Between the Recreational Services Program and the Union Board of Governors (UBG) planning events for the students, there is always something for everyone to do and keep busy. The classes are challenging, but the professors are fun to work with and will help you when you need it. I can not say enough good things about this University, and I am so glad I chose this university to further my education."
Freshman,4,"Being a freshman this is not easy yet, have made a lot of friends and like the groups they offer.  They also offer opportunities to travel, internships, work study etc.  They are very well connected in the community."
Junior,4,"I love Augie but the balance between doing what's best for students and what students want and doing what the donors want the administration to do is definitely being breached. Greater diversity is also needed, as is discussion about sexual assault on campus, because it has happened and the University has refused to discuss."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience so far at Augustana University has been enjoyable. I feel the institution has great resources for people in my field of study, which is American Sign Language Interpreting. The professors are friendly and qualified, and the other students are kind and intelligent. However what I would like to see changed is more of a diversity push, I feel the majority of the student population comes from the same white, middle-class America and I would like to see more of a diverse population at my institution, even if that means lowering tuition so students could have a chance to attend such an accredited institution."
Sophomore,4,I love the community at Augustana. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus and feel like you are making an impact. I always felt that I had a voice and that my opinion mattered.
Sophomore,4,A college that delivers! Augustana is a very good university with great professors and a beautiful campus. I had a good time here and I'd hands down recommend it to anyone.
Sophomore,4,Augustana University is a great school to attend for any Science or Business majors. The professors are very well educated and willing to help. Augustana has a very diverse campus. The only downfall is the dorms. They are very old and small.
Junior,4,"I like the small school feel Augustana has. Surprisingly everywhere you go it seems somebody knows a person who went to Augie despite only being a school of 1800 students. I love the fact that your professors know you by name given the small class sizes in general. Campus is safe, the academics are rigorous, and our athletic teams are some of the best in division II. There isn't much I would change other than I wish the food was better and that campus architecture was a little more diverse and not just a bunch of brick buildings."
Freshman,4,"Augastana is a great university.  Professor's expect excellence from their students, but are willing to meet with/help at any hour of the day."
Sophomore,4,Augustana is a great school with incredible professors and amazing opportunities. The classes are rigorous but rewarding and you really know you’re getting a valuable education.
Freshman,4,"I really love Augustana, the staff is wonderful to work with and the students really network among themselves!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Augustana's small size and beautiful campus. It's location in Sioux Falls gives it a nice balance of city amenities and rural charm. Class sizes are small, but that being said, it is very difficult to get into the classes you want. The professors are very caring and knowledgeable. The food in the cafeteria is average, and nothing special. It is a very affordable price for a private university (many comparable schools cost upwards of 50K a year) and the students are friendly, not snooty or pretentious. It is a good dating scene if you are interested in women, because they make up about 75% of the student body."
Junior,4,"LOVE the professors, somewhat difficult course load as a Biology major. Friendly people, small campus."
Freshman,4,Overall it is a good school. The major downside I saw from it was the campus food. The rest is Average or some Above Average.
College Sophomore,4,"Like every school Augie has its ups and downs but overall it is an amazing school that, especially when it comes to liberal arts and nursing, can't be beat."
College Sophomore,4,The dorms on campus are fairly nice. One thing that I don't like is that the freshmen get bigger rooms even if it is an older building. The process for receiving housing is very seniority based. To me this is not a very fair process because the older you get the more options you have for housing. The cost is relatively fair. The Towers have very small rooms and are very crowded. East Hall is by far the best dorm on campus. It has individual rooms connected by a bathroom. It might be an old building and it is sort of out of the way on campus but I feel it is worth it. Unfortunately it is only for upperclassmen.
College Sophomore,4,Sports are somewhat big yet a lot of students decide to take a lesser part and join intramurals. The intramurals are very good and have a wide variety of sports. There are the basics like basketball and volleyball but there are also lesser common sports like ultimate Frisbee and women's rugby.
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy the small class sizes, which allow for more 1-on-1 time with professors if needed. Each professor has their own method of teaching, but all the ones I've had are very approachable."
College Junior,4,"I love all my professors and the other students are, overall, very passionate about what they are doing. The only issue I have is dealing with Financial Aid"
College Freshman,4,"Last year, the Augustana basketball team made it to Texas. Go Vikings! Anyway, when it comes to sports at Augie, they've got it covered. Tennis, baseball, softball, football, etc. Intramurals consist of swimming, sand volleyball, touch football... and don't forget the mud! If you don't participate in a mud-version of one of these sports, then you'll regret it."
College Sophomore,4,"I never have to come home to a dirty dorm. the facilities are well kept, and we have advisers on each floor to talk to for dorm and safety concerns."
College Freshman,4,"I did not like class I had that was only based on exams. However, I love the class sizes, professors, and resources for the classes."
College Freshman,4,The campus safety is great! There are a lot of lights on campus and resources to use.
College Freshman,4,"Student participation in athletics is great. However, it seems that the student athletes are mainly invested in their teammates and not making friends with other students."
College Freshman,4,Augustana University is amazing! I love the small class sizes and the attention that professors have for individual students!
College Freshman,4,"The school offers a lot of recourse like tutoring, library, and teachers!"
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of diversity at augie which is awesome ! It's cool to see where everyone is from.
College Freshman,4,"Campus safety does a great job of make sure sexual assault doe not happen. Campus safety can walk you back to your dorm if students are scared to walk by themselves, which awesome and it shows that they care !"
College Freshman,4,The professor really care about every student. They do a great job of explaining and they welcome you to ask questions or ask them for help.
College Freshman,4,Living in the dorm is a great experience ! I just wish people would clean up after themselves in the kitchen.
College Freshman,4,"The Intramurals are awesome at augie, and their is always fun activity to do at the Elmen center."
College Sophomore,4,"Through consistent updates on campus safety and security, I can see that the campus is highly protected. I have never witnessed any crime take place on or near campus."
College Sophomore,4,"There is always someone waiting and willing to help if you are questioning anything about your future career, major, or internship prospects."
College Sophomore,4,"Though the courses can be demanding and difficult at times, I enjoy all of the help that I receive from my professors and the student center."
College Sophomore,4,There is a wide variety of activities and facilities on-campus and off for both the athlete and non-athlete.
College Junior,4,I have never heard any stories about sexual assault on campus
College Junior,4,Augustana give you a lot of opportunities for your future careers.
College Junior,4,Campus Housing have a lot of activities for us to do with our friends
College Freshman,4,"Every time there is a sport event, every body likes to participate and support the school team. It is a great experience too."
College Freshman,4,It is a great place to be considering the place where I come from.
College Junior,4,"I live in the dorms, and they are probably average quality. Some of the dorms are nice and spacious, and others are a bit more compact. It all depends on which building you live in. Regardless of space, all have nice furniture, clean halls, bathrooms, and day rooms, and a garbage room on each floor. I do not live in the apartments, but my friends do and they love it. Considering they are college apartments, they are really nice!"
College Junior,4,The professors at Augie are outstanding! With smaller class sizes it is very easy to make a one on one connection with professors. The campus is a great size and Sioux Falls really is the ultimate college town.
College Sophomore,4,Great school. Fun. Great professors.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Going to this school gave me some of the best classes and professors I have ever had. It also gave me the opportunity to study abroad for a whole school year, in my degree of study. If I had to go back in time I wouldn't take another path, I would choose this school all over again."
College Freshman,4,"I will be an incoming freshman, but my experiences thus far with admission staff, registration staff, and the wrestling coaches has been great. They were friendly, helpful, and seemed excited to have me. A favorite experience so far was  getting to spend time with some of the wrestlers on the team. It let me meet the guys, ask questions, and gave me a true feel of what being a part of the wrestling team and a student at Augie would be like. My sister attends Augustana College as well, and has only positive to say about her experiences the past couple of years."
College Freshman,4,"I have only gone off-campus to eat a few times with my friends because I don't have a car here on campus, but when we did go out the food was great and we have a good time"
College Freshman,4,"I submitted my FAFSA application around mid-February or early March, and I got back my financial aid letter about a month or so after that. Because of my financial situation I was able to get enough financial aid to cover most of my tuition, which me and my family were very grateful for."
College Freshman,4,It only took me a couple weeks to find the house I am going to move into after I move off campus and it was for a good price as well with a very relaxed landlord.
College Freshman,4,There are tons of restaurants around Sioux Falls that cover a huge range of different types of foods are within a 10 minutes drive or less from campus
College Freshman,4,Very few students pay full tuition at Augustana. It's very expensive to come here but the financial aid office does a great job of getting us the scholarships we need to make it more affordable for us.
College Freshman,4,The food is really good with lots of options.
Niche User,2,"An honest review... Depending on your major, there are extra fees- and depending on how you change your classes, you could be charged thousands extra. After handing all of my hard-earned money over for an experience I didn't feel was worth the price tag, I was very disappointed, not to mention completely broke. They make it out to be so great, but the attitude of the staff completely changes once they find out that you're not full of money. Now a big chunk of my life has been wasted, and I don't want anyone else to waste theirs.  I'm not the only one who holds this opinion- many young adults in Sioux Falls feel the same way (but are embarrassed to speak up because of financial reasons). Don't be intimidated. Make sure to find out where your money's going!"
Niche User,2,"I was only enrolled at Augie for a semester, but I met some of the best people I know at Augustana University. Great friends, some great professors, and great staff. Sioux Falls is a really beautiful place, but as time goes by, it gets really boring. If you are an international student who wants to go to Augie because of their dual degree engineering program, don't do it unless you can afford to pay the partner schools with no financial aid. Trust me. That was the reason I transferred out and I don't regret it. They only provide financial aid to American students in the program. I do miss some of my friends there, but I still talk to them now and then. Some of them transferred out too, claiming it was too boring.  This university shouldn't be your first option."
College Freshman,2,the 2013-14 school year had a great party atmosphere around campus and nearby campus. This year the party scene is awful and it always seems to be the same house throwing all the parties. Huge decline from last year to this year which is disappointing. Takes away from the college experience when you rarely have parties to go to
College Senior,2,"Some of the admins, esp. Residence life, are incompetent"
College Junior,2,"Parking is awful. The cost of a permit is outrageous. Of course campus security doesn't let you park in a parking lot without a permit. The only other place to park is the street, however those spots fill up quickly. Most of the time I end up parking blocks away."
College Junior,2,"There is no on-campus transportation. Sometimes, if you call campus security they will come pick you up and drive you somewhere else, on -campus"
College Junior,2,"As the school year is through the coldest time of the year it's difficult to have fun activities on campus. Most fun activities are outdoors, and even when indoor activities are scheduled, not many people want to venture out into the cold across campus to participate."
College Freshman,2,Everyone has to live on campus until they are a senior.
College Student,2,"The school will not allow students to live off campus until their Junior year, unless it is a special situation."
College Sophomore,2,"The buildings are very old. The science facilities are old. The science building was built in 1965 and it has not been renovated since. The dorms are also quite old, and some of them are without air conditioning. The athletic center is decent, and the football stadium is good. The college green is pretty in spring but brown all other seasons."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't really any transportation around campus. The buses are confusing and don't come around often, aren't convenient for the college student"
College Freshman,2,"The food is really good, but the price is too expensive. The cost of food for a freshmen, I believe is too much."
College Freshman,2,"While there are a wide variety of people from different religions and ethnically backgrounds, the majority of the student body is white middle class Christians."
College Junior,2,"We have a dry campus, but you hear about alcohol everywhere.  There are always students who are drunk on the weekend.  The school dances are where they mostly show up drunk.  Many students get busted for having alcohol in the dorms but peer pressure isn't too big."
College Junior,2,"It is windy all the time.  There doesn't seem to be too much rain or snow, but the wind can get really bad at times, which makes it feel colder than it really is."
College Junior,2,"They throw parties and then get mad when the party gets busted, and since we have a dry campus they can get in big trouble for that."
College Sophomore,2,"They changed the meal plan this year to unlimited. This may sound good, but it in fact limits the choices you have. You pretty much can only go to the cafeteria unless you want to pay for Viking Dollars or pay out of pocket."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of international students, but besides them, most of the population is white folks from a four-state region."
College Freshman,2,Private School – Augustana is a private school so it is going to be a little more strict on policies.  In the some dorms the peer advisors can be a bit strict about certain things like having the opposite sex in your room or hearing alcoholic drinks clinking or things like that.
College Sophomore,2,"As a college in the midwest, we lack much diversity on campus.  Up until this year, we had a small number of international students, those being usually Norwegian.  We are a predominantly white college community and could use more diversity here on campus."
Freshman,1,"Don't get sucked in by the amazing admissions team!  Once you actually get on campus, you will regret choosing this school.  I came to Augustana as a first year freshman, super excited to make friends (which I can usually do quite easily) and enjoy my college experience.  However, after my first two months, I realized I had made a terrible mistake by choosing this school. The students that I tried to make friends with were too busy stressing out over homework to hang out, and were rather stuck-up as well. They definitely judged me; don't expect to make friends if you aren't a rich privileged white kid. The professors are great, and I enjoyed most of my classes, but the FYS class they make you take is complete bullsh*t. It did not help me adjust to college life. There was no organization and the syllabus was constantly changed, making it hard to keep up with assignments.  I did not appreciate being treated as a guinea pig, as I came to college to learn, not to be a test subject."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life at my university. There are honor society but that is it.
College Freshman,1,I do not go to parties.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life in our college but we do hang out with different athletic groups
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Not because of lack of places to live but because of the difficulties that Augustan poses for people to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,not enough parking spaces on the north side of campus
College Freshman,1,"Not Much – There are not any forms of transportation besides personal vehicle, and the Augustana go-green bikes are a joke."

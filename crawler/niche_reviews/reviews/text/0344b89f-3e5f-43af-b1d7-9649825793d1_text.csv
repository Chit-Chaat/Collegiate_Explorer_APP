Junior,5,"This school is amazing. You meet some really kind people and the professors actually care about you. The faculty is amazing and they are so helpful. The campus is small so it is not confusing, it makes everything easy. Everyone on campus is so kind, the classes are amazing. You can always find a good class to get into, they have so many amazing choices that there is something for everyone. They have some good areas of study, they have so many that you will find something that you will like. WVWC is an amazing school and I highly recommend. The classes sizes are smaller so it is better to absorb the information.  The area is really good and everything is around you. The professors are always willing to answer questions and are always so helpful when it comes to academics. The academic advisors always make sure how school is going, grades and schedules. They always are willing to help if anything is wrong because they always provide solutions if something is wrong."
Niche User,5,"WVWC professors and staff are very connected online. They even recently partnered with an app for students to access schedules, grades, even a food menu and more!"
Niche User,5,I love the art department. I transferred from another university and am already being treated and welcomed way better at Wesleyan. So excited to be more involved!!
Freshman,5,"I'm only a freshman, but I love everything about Wesleyan.  The Biology Department is wonderful and the academics are excellent.  I would like to see the dorms improve."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far at Wesleyan has been amazing. I was quickly able to open up and find some awesome friendships, as well as, make connections with many professors and coaches. Wesleyan is my second home; everyone is welcoming with open arms to put me on the right tract for the real world."
Senior,5,The best part of WVWC are the people you meet and the memories you make. What I would like to see change at Wesleyan are updates on dorms.
Junior,5,"WV Wesleyan is my home among the hills. It provided me with some amazing opportunities and I learned so much. I met some of the best people including friends, professors, cafeteria workers, etc. I will never regret my decision to complete my undergraduate here."
Freshman,5,Although I am only a Freshman I have had many amazing experiences at WVWC in these past two semesters. The professors are all wonderful people that fully engage during classes and are always there to provide help when needed. RAs are always available to lend a helping hand and the dorms tend to be a very welcoming and happy environment.
Freshman,5,"Family culture college, for everybody to attend. It's a great experience to explore the campus it's just everything. You would really love it here, but sometimes it's a little boring because most of the people are gone most of the time. But you would love the sports team because you would have so much support from your friends and probably your family to. Overall, the food is not that good but the parties are lit as much as they say it up here. The education is on point just don't no early class."
Niche User,5,"I have been to West Virginia Wesleyan College on many different occasions. I have been there mainly for band and theater activities. Each time I have gone onto the campus the food, people, and overall scene of the campus has been excellent!"
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy attending West Virginia Wesleyan. Even though it's located in a small town, there are a number of things to do on campus and around town. The friends I've made here are truly some of the best group of ladies I've ever met."
Sophomore,5,"West Virginia Wesleyan is overall a beautiful campus that is very friendly and clean. There is diversity among students, organizations, and programs. It is the perfect home away from home."
Freshman,5,"I loved the overall demeanor at West Virginia Wesleyan. I also loved the people there, they were very accepting and helpful. The campus is very beautiful and it's very convenient so i loved it!"
Junior,5,"West Virginia Wesleyan is one of the top college in our area for Nursing majors, they except only the best students for Nursing. I have been a student for 3.5 years living on campus, being apart of the a sorority helps and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Our campus is beautiful with concerned professors willing to help at anytime. Dorms are upkeep, warm and clean. Campus food is nutritious and dinning hall, clean and spacious. Campus life has weekend activates of all interests. I enjoy my college very much, its a great place to learn."
Sophomore,5,I came to Wesleyan because they have a pre optometry program and their campus is small. That's not even the best thing about the school though! Everybody there wants to help you succeed! The departments are so small we're like families. I love this college so small.
Alum,5,WVWC is an amazing place! It has a unique culture of service and community that is far beyond other schools
Freshman,5,I play on the West Virginia Wesleyan College soccer team and I love the campus.   I am doing very well in my course work as I made the Dean's List the first semester.
Sophomore,5,"This will be my second year attending WVWC and I can't help but brag on my experience here! Ever since my first visit I knew this was my home among the hills. Everyone is so excepting and very helpful here on campus. They never fail to make someone feel at home and is it as if we are all one big family. The professors are unbelievable, academics are some of the best in the state, athletics you can't even get me started on, and the safety is just indescribable! I've never once doubted this college!"
Alum,5,"West Virginia Wesleyan College is an amazing school. It is comprised of a small campus, a dedicated group of faculty and staff, and vivacious students. It is a place where any individual can thrive, regardless of their interests. Both athletic programs and fine art programs are award winning programs with excellent professors, mentors, and coaches as the backbone. Wesleyan is the heart of the small town of Buckhannon, where the locals are friendly and almost everything is within walking distance. I would recommend WVWC to any student who wishes to thrive on a small campus with endless support."
Senior,5,"In my opinion, WVWC is one of the best colleges around. The students here get the best education and are more prepared for graduate school or the workforce."
Freshman,5,"It's a pretty good college. Though the college is a bit pricey, there is definite good reason. The campus is small, the professors are involved, and everyone is overwhelmingly nice."
Sophomore,5,"WVWC is a great small-town school, with a student population of about 1500. The classes are small and the professors care about every single one of their students."
Freshman,5,Being at wvwc has changed my outlook on life. I have met so many people from across the world and I have been blessed with all of my amazing professors. There is nothing I would change about my experience here.
Freshman,5,"I first visited West Virginia Wesleyan College through the Governor's School for the Art's and I fell in love with the campus. The campus is beautiful and the professors are always willing to help out. I was able to begin creating a new organization through the college thanks to two faculty members who were willing to become my advisors and help me get started. I am also apart of the marching and concert bands on campus and the members of each have very different interests. About 75% of the concert band is not a music major, which shows that there are a large number of people who love other things besides just music. Not to mention that nearly everyone on campus is very friendly along with being in a small town."
Freshman,5,This college is perfect! The campus is small and beautiful. The faculty and staff are very helpful and kind. I've never met any professors kinder and more student oriented than the ones at Wesleyan. This is a college that really cares about its students.
Niche User,5,"I wouldn't want to change a single thing about this university. I had a very good experience when I went for a campus visit. The campus is beautiful, and everyone is so nice. The staff is very helpful, and helped me chose the career that I wanted to study. I can't wait to attend this college next fall and get to experience the next chapter of my life at West Virginia Wesleyan College. I highly recommend this college. "
Junior,5,"I wish this school wasn't so expensive, but you get a quality education. The teachers in the science department are very helpful and always willing to give extra assistance. The fact that this is a small campus is nice and gives you an at-home feeling. The only downfall is there is not much to do in Buckhannon. "
College Sophomore,5,"Dunn Hall are what all of my answers are based on. I loved living there and will be doing so again this year. Some of the other halls are more run down and need help, but Fleming and Dunn are by far the nicest. I think the social atmosphere of the dorms is fantastic. Once again, I would not live anywhere else, unless that be off campus. As far as cost goes, I think room and board are absolutely ridiculous. I have a tuition waiver because my mother works at the college, but that does not include room and board. I could almost go to another university for the same price that I'm paying for ONLY my room and board here at Wesleyan. The prices keep increasing and I think some serious consideration needs to be put into this because students are not going to be able to afford this school if things continue, financial aid or not."
College Sophomore,5,"I just joined Alpha Xi Delta in the spring and I could not have made a better decision. Greek life has brought me so many more true friends and I could have not asked for better. Because of sorority, I have also been able to participate in many more activities, such as things for our philanthropy, or events we host. Mostly community engagement things that I had not done before. Greek life is somewhat indifferent to non-Greeks, I mean of course you have some that dislike the Greek students, but overall I think indifference is more of what I have seen. Greek life has brought me nothing but positivity and I would not change it for the world."
College Junior,5,Almost everyone that I know has had no problem finding good quality summer internships within their major.
College Junior,5,"Its a small school so everyone knows everyone yet there is a good amount of respect for privacy and for other people's opinions and differences. Very little gossiping and very few cliques.  Everyone is encouraged to be social and even really shy people seem to find their niche.   Lots of spaces to gather for study groups, social groups and clubs.  Its a really nice school. Very comfortable, beautiful older buildings surrounded by parks, walking trails and waterways. Really safe, nice neighborhoods. Safe community."
College Junior,5,Its a small campus so everything is really close together yet nicely arranged.  Its a great school!
College Junior,5,At this school I feel challenged and accepted.  Every one of my professors knows my name and really does care about my performance in their class as well as my opinion. The dorms are small but really clean with invitingly comfortable lounges on every level in every dorm. Great selection of room styles and accommodations.
College Sophomore,5,You will be very active on campus and meet new friends.  You get connections and the real world and get to wear letters.  Jump and getting new members are the best.  Having a little and big love is even better.  LIFE FAMILY
College Sophomore,5,EXCELLENT professors and students who really care about their grades!
College Sophomore,5,The campus offers top education and tons of honors and extra curricula's to add to a resume. It should be very helpful in making it into the career community with expectations that you have kept up with here!
College Sophomore,5,I have absolutely loved my campus since day one! WVWC was even greater than I expected! I love encouraging people to apply to my school and showing them around when they visit!
College Freshman,5,Feel like you can get any job with a degree from here
College Sophomore,5,"There might be a few things that could be better about the school (dining hall), but overall, the experience has been a great one and lifechanging"
College Sophomore,5,"When I first decided looking at schools, I never thought I would be at West Virginia Wesleyan.  The main reason was because of how expensive it was to attend there.  My grades and test scores ended up giving me a ton of scholarship money, especially through the school.  Then, my coaches helped me find some more money to make college more affordable to go there.  I have been here for three semesters and I never regret my decision to come here."
College Sophomore,5,"The classes at Wesleyan are fantastic.  The biggest class I have attended was under thirty students, so all of your professors know you by name.  There is a great variety of classes for the majors offered and the professors all have Masters degrees or higher."
College Freshman,5,"This school helped me out tremendously. I told them that I wanted to go to school here for a certain price, and they worked with me to help me receive the scholarships I needed."
College Sophomore,5,"Admissions at Wesleyan is the best staff you could ever ask for from a college campus. They do not make anything difficult, but as easy as possible for the students."
College Sophomore,5,I have had the privilege of having some of the best professors. Thankfully most of them are truly there to help you learn and are willing to teach you to your own benefits.
College Sophomore,5,"It is just the best living on campus. We have a small campus, but many things to do. Close to the school we have a trail to walk on. There are always activities offered on the weekends. We have a remarkable library, where they are very eager to help out any student with questions. There is a lot of green space, but we lack places to sit in the green areas."
College Junior,5,Wesleyan is great and I couldn't have asked for a better school experience.
College Junior,5,"The art program is amazing. The small student to teacher ratio makes one on one help available most of the time. All of the art professors work together to make sure students are getting a well rounded education and that they will be competitive artists once they graduate. The art department also takes trips to museums and other places, such as a three day trip to NY."
College Junior,5,I have three majors that all revolve around art. My professors have been great about working with me to juggle the three majors.
College Sophomore,5,"Wesleyan really is a community.  Entering as a freshman here was one of the smoothest transitions; everyone treats you like family.  The professors are genuinely interested in you and meeting the needs of your education.  Our campus events are out of this world (bull riding, aqua massage, a mini zoo, etc), so there is never a dull moment."
College Sophomore,5,"Because we have such a small campus, there is always something going on within ear shot.  Everyone is welcome to join any activity, and our entertainment director brings in GREAT things every weekend.  We love the outdoor beauty of the campus and do a lot to preserve it.  The emphasis on community service reflected by our school is evident in every organization on campus, as well as the students that organize service projects."
College Sophomore,5,"The biology program is amazing. The faculty really try to make you feel at home, and help you out more than many other science majors. Also, they are great in helping with your internship and research requirements to graduate."
College Sophomore,5,"People come to Wesleyan because they are intelligent and want a challenge. It is a difficult school, but you will be prepared for a career or grad school."
College Freshman,5,I have not had a single issue with safety.
College Freshman,5,Buckhannon is a small town with a big town feel. There are local museums and cultural activities nearby. Civil war re-enactments in the fall. There are local restaurants that have great food and deliver to hungry college students in the dorms. There is a Walmart in town. Elkins is about 25 minutes away. Morgantown (WVU) is about an hour away.
College Freshman,5,"I have a roommate from Japan, here for an education. This college and the students are very diverse."
College Freshman,5,For me financial aid was a breeze. I'm going to Wesleyan for absolutely free. It would benefit a student if he or she would do well on the ACT or SAT. It would also benefit if they did well in high school. You'll also need to fill out the FAFSA. 
College Freshman,5,"The diversity of students is more than what I thought it would be. I have learned a lot about other ethnicities and races, it's quite interesting. "
College Freshman,5,"I love my professors, classes, homework load, etc. when it comes to my major. "
College Freshman,5,I believe that the size of the classrooms are unique when compared to other Colleges. WVWC has very small classes so therefore students get a more hands on experience and communicating with professors is easy. 
College Sophomore,5,There are many organizations classes and activities that are provided for each student of all types to feel comfortable and accepted. The gender studies department provides many organizations that are for people  of sexual orientation and who wish to discuss issues surround these topic. We have a black student union group for all African American students and also many classes that deal with African studies. Also on campus we have nondenominational church services as well as catholic mass. Wesleyan also provides classes that relate to any ethnic background or racial diversity.
Alum,4,Most of my classes were on campus but they did offer online classes. There were a few classes I had to take online because they were only offered online. I enjoyed both on campus and online classes.
Alum,4,Wesleyan has a great community and most degrees and majors were very great. The professors actually wanted to help you succeed. The administrators themselves who run the college aren’t the smartest though. They spend money they don’t have and get rid of great professors.
Alum,4,Before covid the professors with online classes were prepared and I felt like I was involved and learning. After covid the sudden change made it harder to adjust but it is what it is.
Niche User,4,"I have not started attending college here yet, but I have been on campus twice and had an official visit.  I like the size of the college and the close proximity to all of the amenities they offer.  I also like the attentiveness of the staff and faculty that I had interaction with."
Alum,4,"Being that this school is small, i found myself surrounded by the right people. I joined many organizations and began to find myself and passions amongst my home among the hills."
Niche User,4,"West Virginia Wesleyan is a nice, pretty, small, and easy going campus. The professors are great and the students are friendly. The relaxed life style of the campus is wonderful."
Junior,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful.  I love walking around the river.  It's so peaceful.  It's also where they bring all of the agriculture majors to study plant life.  The people there are extremely nice as well.  My friends and I always have a great time, even while we study.  We live in the oldest dorm in the state and I love it.  It has so much character and charm.  The wood work is amazing and there is a piano in the lobby that I love to play.  I'm minoring in music so I go there to practice my songs.  My friends and I have made some great memories there and I'm sure we'll make more."
Senior,4,"I love Wesleyan! The town of Buckhannon is very small but it is beautiful! There are great restaurants and everything is within walking distance. Although it isn't known for a great social life. There are always things to do, campus hold events every weekend and there are always sporting events. The dorms are nice and clean, but they are still dorms. Overall I would recommend Wesleyan to anyone!"
Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan is a very welcoming college and make the transition into college life as easy as possible. For the most part, everyone is very helpful and friendly."
Sophomore,4,The college offers a nice atmosphere for students to explore who they are. Students are provided with a unique opportunity here to really get to know their professors and learn.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Wesleyan has been an incredible one.  Everyone is extremely welcoming and friendly.  I love the student:teacher ratio because it provides students with an opportunity to develop relationships with their professors and receive help when needed.  The one thing I would like to change is the course availability.  I understand to keep the ratio, less students are registered to each course, but I would love to see the courses offered at more times each semester.  If this were to happen, more than 20-25 students can fulfill this credit and it would be easy to fit courses into our schedules."
Freshman,4,"Nice and small college perfect to focus on studies. You can be in class faster than almost any other colleges because the campus is really small. It takes me 2 min to go to my classes every morning.

Professors are nice and they always have the door open to solve any question that you have, you can also email them and they will answer really quick.

It's an small campus so everyone know each other and also there is a lot of diversity. Everyone take care of each other. All people is nice there."
Junior,4,"What I like about West Virginia Wesleyan,  is that the class sizes are small and allows personal relationships with professors to develop. I enjoy knowing my professors and being close with them. The professors are so supportive and will help you achieve any goals that you put your mind to."
Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan truly has become my home among the hills. I have met amazing and talented people and did rememberable things throughout my freshman year that I will never forget. The close knit campus made me feel right at home when I first moved in. The food is a little too much, but nothing a trip to Walmart can't fix."
Freshman,4,"West Virginia Wesleyan College provides an excellent academic environment for students of all majors. The professors work closely with all students, and the class sizes are generally small so it is easy to work one on one with a professor. Campus Life has scheduled  activities for all of Wesleyan's students that create a sense of community. The athletic teams are overall good and are involved in helping out in the community."
Freshman,4,"I think the people make it all the while ! Wesleyan is definitely my home among the hills. Since I've stepped foot on campus I have felt nothing but a positive and supportive atmosphere. It is a small and accesible campus which I love, makes it easy to get around. Buckhannon is such a safe and friendly environment. There are tons of little gems around town that is totally worth seeing. The athletic events are always super exciting to attend considering most people on campus are athletes. I can't even put into words how much I love it here at Wesleyan. EVERYDAY IS A GREAT DAY TO BE A BOBCAT!!! :))"
Junior,4,I like that West Virginia has helped me find who I am. I have been giving lots of opportunities on campus; Resident Assistant and Student Ambassador just to name a few.
Niche User,4,It was very welcoming and the school building was large and absolutely beautiful. It's small but it allows individualized focus and they'll make sure you'll keep up your grades and I just really enjoy that one on one learning.
Sophomore,4,I am very proud of this school. I love the at home feeling that this school is able to provide. The cafe needs some better food options but all around this school is very good school to attend. The professors get to know each students well and try to help them successed as much as they can.
Senior,4,"This college has provided a multitude of oppurtunities for me. From mission trips, local service, to internships an professional career preparedness.  The college I have come to find out has a national recognition and the students are placed on a high pedalstal when being compared to other students coming from different colleges. Yes it has its flaws but all colleges do."
Freshman,4,"Going to visit Wesleyan, they make you feel as if you are a part of the family. They give intimate tours that get you involved with the students as well as some of the professors. I will be playing softball there in the spring and the softball team made me feel as if I was already on the team."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Wesleyan so far has been amazing. My only suggestions, however, would be to provide better food options and to fix up the older dorms."
Freshman,4,"Wesleyan is a great school and I feel so lucky to go here! The students are all so incredibly nice, and it's great being able to know everyone on campus. The teachers are genuine and care about every student, and there are hardly classes with more than 30 people. It's true that you have to make the most of it, which is the case with any small school, but the environment overall is welcoming and friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small atmosphere. The classes aren't huge, but that enables the professors to be personable and really assist their students."
Junior,4,"I love the small campus. The professors are so helpful. they get to know you by name and they truly care about you. There are two nice dorms but they are very expensive. The affordable dorm rooms need to be remodeled. The campus is well lit and I personally feel secure walking on campus by myself at any hour of the day. Overall, Wesleyan is a great place with a nice atmosphere and I would heartily recommend it to anyone looking at colleges."
Freshman,4,"The school is not bad itself, the best part about it is the people. You make it as fun as you want it to be and I'm glad I met my friends. I like how the campus is small and that majority of people are in a sport. The academics are good, it have no spectacular things to say about it nor bad things. Overall it is a pretty nice school."
Freshman,4,"This website gives me a variety of scholarships to choose from.  I am given many options in finding scholarships that would suit me best.  I like how I am given the option to search for scholarships by state, major, minority, and so on.  I would like to be able to use the filters at the same time."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many different races and ethnicities. Wesleyan is expensive so many people are wealthy or are on scholarship for sports. Religion and political beliefs are diverse but neither are forced on you. The amount of diversity with out sports teams would be NONE. If it wasn't for sports that everyone would be white, wealthy, and smart."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is our ONLY form of social life at Wesleyan. I would say almost 70% of people are involved in Greek Life. It is the only thing we have that is fun or eventful for students. Our greek life does a huge amount of community service and loves helping directly in Buckhannon. Greek and non-greeks get along fine and often hangout. Events surrounding greek life are the only times something fun happens at school. We have no place to go unless its a frat house. We have nowhere to eat, dance, shop, meet with friends, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Academically WVWC is very strong, therefore many students strive to always do their best. Many students at WV Wesleyan are involved in the community and on campus. There are not many students at Wesleyan that are just going to school. Almost everyone is affiliated with a club, group, athletic team, or greek life. Wesleyan focuses a lot on community service and you can always find a way to help others. The cirrocumuli is very challenging but It appears to be positive for student long-term."
College Sophomore,4,"Students are very involved with athletics. Honestly, most of the campus population is on some sort of sports team. The school's facilities are great overall. They are now almost up to date on any and everything (they're currently building new tennis courts). Certain teams will go as a tem to other sporting events, but even if they do not you can almost always find individuals from multiple sports teams in the stands."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Wesleyan. I do play volleyball for the school, but I would have to say that the intramural sports (specifically volleyball) offered are my favorite thing to do. With that being said, the people that go to Wesleyan are unique within themselves, and I think that is why intramural sports are so much fun. The students and faculty at Wesleyan are so inviting and helpful. I also joined a sorority this spring (Alpha Xi Delta) and I could not be happier. When you hear of Wesleyan, you will also probably hear something about it being ""a home among the hills."" I live about five minutes from the school, but live on campus during the school year and it truly is my second home. I would have never imagined choosing anywhere else to attend now that I have completed my first year. I would absolutely choose Wesleyan time after time if I could do it all again, and would recommend the school to anyone and everyone."
College Junior,4,Greek life is huge on our campus and seems to be integrated highly into the community.
College Junior,4,The school is small enough that you are able to get the necessary one on one help for the more challenging classes but is big enough that it doesn't feel like high school part 2.
College Junior,4,I am in a sorority and I love it.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is super nice and you don't have problems with professors very often. Class sizes are medium and great you feel wanted. All my professors know my name and they actually care about me.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are very small but you learn to live with it. Housing is very clean and well taken care of. Very enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,"Being part of a sports team everyone is super involved and the fan support is amazing, People come to our games and cheer. Games are always packed with alumni or current students."
College Freshman,4,I really love this school. Being from another state it is hard being away from your home and family but Wesleyan makes its easy. Everyone here is super nice and amazing!
College Sophomore,4,"lawyers are in town

judges are in town

watch out for cops"
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part campus is safe, however for the rare occasions that it is not and a person is confronted with things such as sexual assault, I don't feel there are many support systems in play for victims on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I have had only one professor that I have ever really disliked but overall the professors really care about their students and the courses that they teach!
College Freshman,4,Only heard a couple cases of people getting anything stolen
College Freshman,4,Professors really want to help and watch you pass
College Freshman,4,Very popular and very inviting
College Sophomore,4,I have had no security problems while on campus.  The annual security report that is sent out every year shows that there are very few if any problems on campus.
College Sophomore,4,There are usually seminars and activities to inform students of jobs and internship opportunities
College Sophomore,4,"I personally am not involved in Greek life, but a ton of my friends are.  The Greeks do a lot for the school and community that some people might not notice."
College Sophomore,4,"The football field and track are brand new.  The only thing that would need an update is the athletic weight room.  Other than that, all of the athletic facilities are new and up to date."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors, curriculum, and registration processes are great.  The professors are helpful, the curriculum is applicable, and the registration process is smooth for students.  However, do not come to this school if you aren't prepared for a heavy workload.  The professors are willing to work with you if an emergency comes up, but this is not the school for you if you aren't prepared to do your work."
College Sophomore,4,There is a system of campus police that patrols campus at night and at certain hours during the day.  The campus is generally safe.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't looked into career services yet, but the majority of students who graduate from Wesleyan have a smooth time finding a job in their field after graduation."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not involved with the Greek life on campus, but there are many great opportunities to join Greek life or be involved for those who want to."
College Sophomore,4,Overall I have enjoyed my experience at Wesleyan.  The only downside to attending school here is that it is in a small town and it is difficult to get experience in your field without leaving town.
College Freshman,4,Incredible med school acceptance rates.
College Freshman,4,I love my college. The majority of students are athletes so I feel like I fit in. The level of play for volleyball is perfect for me to grow in my skills but still be able to play currently. The classes are close to my dorm and I have met so many people from different countries. It is wonderful and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty at WV Wesleyan is extremely caring about their students. They know their students personally and want them to do well in classes but more importantly after they graduate.
College Freshman,4,It's great.  The staff is helpful and knowledgeable with all aspects of the financial aid process.
College Freshman,4,The dining hall hours are limited by my schedule but the food is tasty.
College Freshman,4,Campus Housing is great.  The rooms in the older dorms are smaller but they are clean and well maintained.  I just started the housing process so I am unsure of the ease to which is will be for me.
Alum,2,The academics are horrible. I was challenged more in AP high school classes than most of my Marketing classes. It’s not a 1 Star because I made some great friends there but that can happen at any college. Don’t waste your time to come here if you actually want to learn something for your job.
College Sophomore,2,"Our party scene is positive because thats how many people meet since there is nothing else to do. Really the only semi large parties are at the frat houses. Its more socializing than drinking, dancing, doing drugs. Our parties consist of beer pong, music, and talking. The only nights people party is Saturday and some Wednesdays. Greek life events are the big social parties. All bars are 21 and older so half the students can't even go and be social and we have no clubs."
College Sophomore,2,There really is not much to do. There is typically one pretty good party on Saturday nights but it is mostly going to houses and socializing. We could definitely use clubs or hangout areas besides frats. There is no place to just dance and have fun. It can be fun if you make it fun but you have to be social. Many many many people complain about how bad the nightlife is.
College Sophomore,2,"As a person with a PTSD trigger of alcohol, I am pretty limited to my dorm room on campus due to the presence of alcohol on campus and around campus. I say alcohol is definitely a problem amongst the school as people are typically drinking or are drunk. But it's not anything like WVU!"
College Freshman,2,Campus housing is small and outdated.
College Sophomore,2,"Very few options for those who don't live in town.  Not many places rent for just the school year, and there isn't even a great selection of those that require year-round agreements."
College Sophomore,2,Basically there's nothing unless you go to a frat.
College Freshman,2,I got confuse on how the FAFSA system works. Until my mom showed me how it worked. It was still a hassle though. There were a lot of questions I had to type in. It got annoying at one point.
College Freshman,2,"Wesleyan is located in a small town. While the area is slowly growing, there are not many options outside of fast food that are very good. There needs to be more variety in restaurants."
College Freshman,2,Greek life groups such as fraternities seem to be just party spots. They do none of the right things and are a bad example of the other students at West Virginia Wesleyan College.
College Freshman,2,The college does not provide transportation unless you are on a sports team and you are traveling for a sports related activity. 
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly fast food, but there are student discounts."
College Freshman,2,"For people that don't have a car, it is pretty difficult to walk to any of the restaurants, except the ones on Main Street. There is a McDonald's, Burger King, Sheetz, and Arby's near Walmart, but that is a 20 minute walk. However, if you have a car, the selection is better. There are several Mexican restaurants, and other general restaurants. McDonald's gives a discount if you show them your WVWC school ID."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much in this town to eat or to go hang out. Its a small town one nice restaurant, one ok burger place and two or three Chinese places. Everything is in Clarksburg but that's a drive."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are nice. Though they have their problems, some of the rooms are only big enough for two people to live in. Things get crazy with your roommate if your in your room all the time with such little space. There is a lot of outlets though and you can have surge protectors if those aren't enough. Some times the rooms don't have very good wifi in them though and that can tend to be a problem. I have had many problems with my room because of the fact of mold and non working heating and air systems. My roommates have become sick and so have I because of this problem."
College Freshman,2,The safety at this school has been iffy my roommates and I have had some unsafe moments here and not much has been done to make it any better. I do not feel comfortable going out of my room sometimes without a friends.
College Senior,2,Criminal Justice is not a main focus at Wesleyan.  I was only introduced to 3 different crimnal justice professors which examplifies how much the school cares for the program
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, my high school athletic program was better. While the teams are okay or improving, there really isn't a whole lot of student involvement. I mean, sometimes people go to the football games, and there will be people at Got pride events (who, by the way, are required to go).. but they just aren't fantastic. Also. The football stadium is horrible. In fact, the team didn't even play on our field at the beginning of the year--they went to the high school."
College Junior,2,"Intership/Job Opportunities – Wesleyan does not provide diverse program for students for inteship and job opportunities. I am aware of many schools has programs connected with other countries and give you the opportunity to wok in a different place. However, Wesleyan is really small in this aspect and it should be changed after few years."
College Junior,2,Black Students – There are many different races in our school but especially black students make the difference in the school. Because they are loud and sometimes they do not respect other races just being themselves wihtout considering how other people feel about their action.
Sophomore,1,The food was terrible and there was little to know accommodations available to those with food allergies. There is little care for the health and well being of the students or the athletes. The athletes were injured more often then not and the staff provided to help them did little to care for them. The injured often never received the care they needed or often times were not believed about the severity of their injury. As for physical overall health. The staff provided did not know what they were talking about. The students have to pay for any sort of care they may receive. There is no counseling service provided on campus for student suffering with mental illness. Lastly the safety on campus is lacking.
College Sophomore,1,"I wish they allowed us to live off-campus, but only through beating the system can you."
College Freshman,1,There isn't a lot. If you don't live on campus you have to park on the street.
College Freshman,1,I hate the school food it always makes me sick so I don't eat it.
College Freshman,1,There is only 4 computers at the school open for the students to use. The learning center has computers but only to work on tests and things of that sort.
College Freshman,1,"I don't know of any buses that come into town, but if you really need to go somewhere, you are bound to find someone willing to drive, or you can just walk. Nothing in town is all that far. And campus is tiny. No need to drive across whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,"It is so easy to get into this school. If you get into the college, you can major in anything, including Musical Theatre. There should be an audition required."
College Senior,1,"Because the school is so small (1400 students), you see the same people everyday.  Some in which are attractive, but that is just a few"
College Freshman,1,There really isn't any off-campus housing available as far as I know.
College Freshman,1,I have to travel 15 miles saily to campus to home.
College Junior,1,"I Would Never Choose This College – 1. The campus is made to look pretty, but is completely impractical. 
A.The sidewalks all meet at right angles and flood with any amount of rainfall.
B.There is absolutely nothing for parking.
2.The internet speeds are comparable to dial-up
3.The only computers availble for free take 10 minutes to log into and are old as heck
4. The classrooms are stocked with broken-down desks and broken clocks. 
5. The food on campus is over priced, red bull is 5$ for the smallest can, and the tall boy was 12$ untill they stopped carrying them. 20OZ pops are $2.35    
6. The dorms are tiny and overpriced. Campus staff always ""out to gt you"" for a bonus.
7. there is no nightlife at all here. Fraternities and sororities exist, but the frat houses are too far to walk from campus (i guess to promote drunk driving) and the 2 frat houses next to campus always have fights and get shut down.

I would never choose this school again, and im going here for free"
College Junior,1,"There are two options - 1 The Cafe and 2 Sunnybucks.
1. The cafe serves food that is sub par from public school food. The noodles for pasta are overcooked, the pizzas are always old and taste like cardboard, never have actual good food unless visitors are coming to campus.

2. Sunnybucks is staffed by the same people in the cafe, and is open for more hours a day. They charge cash only for food and extort the students. An average meal will range between 8$ and 12$. The food here is horrible, far worse than even McDonald."
College Junior,1,"Nothing Here but Walmart – There are no shopping malls or stores other than wal mart and a few dollar stores.
The only attractions consist of a movie theater and an out-dated decrepit bowling alley. 
We have no sports teams.
The police here are more likely to arrest you for nothing than arrest a criminal for something. The cops are bored and very numerous with no criminal activity.

The local people hate college students. They like us for our money but really dislike us and think we are all snobs."
College Junior,1,"There Is Nothing – There are no public transportation at this school. No buses and no taxis. The closest store is an hour round trip walk or a 10-15 minute drive.

You must have a car, and be ready for fines."
College Junior,1,"It costs 75$ for a parking tag. The only parking lots that are  near the dorms are reserved for freshman. The entire college is surrounded by yellow sidewalks that only allow for about a quarter of the vehicles that the streets could hold. The city police drive around the campus literally three times a day to give out parking tickets. They range from 10$ to as much as 200$ and a possible car towing. The campus parking lots are arranged from comuter to facuilty/ staff to on campus student. Commuters have a 30 spot lot which is always full (generally by staff.) Most commuters will park anywhere they can fit their vehicles until they rack up a few hundred bucks in tickets. I personally park about 15 minutes from campus in front of random houses and walk. 

There are absolutely no taxis and nothing is in walking distance to campus. There are also no buses. an average ticket for parking in the wrong lot is 20$ and up to 300$ for parking on grass or a side walk."
College Sophomore,1,"Old and Outdated – Most of the facilities are extremely old and need serious renovation. Some buildings pose allergy problems because of the mold and mildew. The basketball gym is subpar and I had a better one at my high school. There is also no appropriate indoor facility for spring and fall sports (soccer, baseball, softball, track, etc)"
College Junior,1,Parking is really bad. THe school is receiving more students and we often have to park along the street or in front of other peoples houses. Not enough parking!
College Junior,1,"Housing Off-Campus – Unless the student is 21 or a senior, they are not permitted to live off campus. It is either that or the student has to commute."

Freshman,5,"The University of Sioux Falls has developed a strong community within and has developed many opportunities to become involved and create relationships. Just like most colleges and universities, USF has well established education program, but with small class sizes and very interactive professors, the atmosphere of classes is incomparable. An area for improvement is the situation of classes only being offered a select number of times. One solution to this problem is to create reciprocity with other smaller schools that have the same dilemma. Class schedules could be combined for maximum efficiency for their students. Overall, the experience at the University of Sioux Falls is wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Sioux Falls has inspired me to become the best that I can be. The school has provided for me many opportunities and I am beyond blessed to be attending this school. I love the Christian background and community it comes with and appreciates the diversity of the school. The one thing that I wish to see change at USF is that they bring back wrestling for men, and add a women's wrestling program."
Freshman,5,I just finished my first year at the University of Sioux Falls and I could not have picked a better school to go to. All the teachers truly care about you and your education and want to help achieve your future goals.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Sioux Falls is an amazing school! It is very hard to find something that I do not like about the University of Sioux Falls. I love the campus, the professors, and most importantly the community that is built on campus."
Alum,5,"The University of Sioux Falls was a perfect fit for me since day one. All of the Professors get to know you and want you to succeed in the things you do. I sent all four years of my undergraduate there, and during that time I have made great friends, as well as got a education that has prepared me for a career going forward."
Senior,5,"My professors care about my progress and want me to succeed. I love the small campus, it makes it easier to get around and find classes but big enough to have the college campus feel."
Junior,5,This school has a wonderful campus in the middle of the city and has a close-knit community. The professors truly care about your success and take the time to get to know you. There is always something to do around campus or in town. you are never too far away from some fun. The small picturesque campus makes it very easy to get to know new people. Everyone here is very friendly and there is a good mix of people from small towns and bigger cities giving a wide variety of experiences. I would definitely recommend people of any age to come to this school.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the family atmosphere at USF. I am going to play football there and compared to all the other colleges I visited USF was the obvious choice.
Sophomore,5,As a student who just completed their freshman year of college it has been a wonderful experience. I have met so many kind and caring people at this school and have been pushed further by my professors here.
Freshman,5,The community itself is amazing people are nice and very welcoming and honestly I wouldn't change anything
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at the University of Sioux Falls. The small class sizes made it easy to get to to know my classmates, my professors, and ask any questions that I had. The campus size is small, which was also great. My longest walks were only ever 5 minutes- and that was when I was not able to find a parking spot in the parking lot too! The activities that the school put on for the students were great. There was always something fun going on at campus a couple nights a week. Whether it was a sporting event or a gathering with snacks to meet up with friends or meet new people, there was always something to do."
Junior,5,Overall University of Sioux Falls is a great college. The professors here truly care about your education and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you succeed.
Junior,5,"The University of Sioux Falls is an incredibly credible Liberal Arts university that will not just only prepare you for your life-long career, but will also give you opportunities to better yourself and gain connections with active (and influential) professors in what ever field you decide to pursue. "
College Sophomore,5,"As of last year, 97% of graduates found jobs in their field of study."
College Sophomore,5,I love my professors and my classes.
College Sophomore,5,My school has a very welcoming staff and faculty that makes it an easy transition & makes it feel safe & comfortable.
College Freshman,5,The campus makes me feel safe. I'm not afraid to go anywhere.
College Junior,5,"This school has a welcoming community that makes it an enjoyable atmosphere. The people and the faculty are friendly, helpful, and want the best possible experience for you."
College Freshman,5,"I had a wonderful experience, they helped me get the financial aid I needed plus other scholarships."
College Freshman,5,Sports are very popular and the school has good school spirit
Freshman,4,"My two semesters at the University of Sioux Falls was a great experience. It is a private school, so the classes were smaller and students participated more. The professors were super helpful at all times. Most of the students were super nice and outgoing. 
The only down fall I found during my time is that when it comes to sports people, they were given the best treatment. Which, to an extent is understandable. I wish there could be change in some of the atmosphere because some of the students had their cliques and were not very welcoming."
Freshman,4,I love attending the University of Sioux Falls. The community surrounding the campus is unlike any other! The professors are amazing and really take care of their students.
Junior,4,"The small campus and small student size make everything so much easier. Class sizes are small, which helps professors seem more accessible, and it is easy to get to know professors and other students that way too. I think that the University of Sioux Falls is a great place if you're looking for a small university."
Freshman,4,"I have been really enjoying my experience at University of Sioux Falls. While campus is small, it is also easy to navigate and provides for a close knit community. The number of athletic teams also helps to create a sense of comradery between students on campus. The housing is nice if you are able to get into the New Residence Hall, Collier Baker, or Sullivan. The other dorms are not bad, just a little older and smaller in size. However, I typically don't spend much time in my dorm anyway. There are lots of events scheduled on campus as well as activities off campus to keep students busy. Overall, I believe I made the right choice by coming to USF."
College Sophomore,4,It's there but not very evident.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus, but I also known that if I ever do feel that I am in danger, campus security is always available."
College Sophomore,4,The support that the fans show is great but it could always be better.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great. They help us when we need it. They encourage us all the time.
College Freshman,4,They do a good job with having employers on campus. It gives us more opportunity.
College Freshman,4,"The campus life is great because where I love, people interact with each other. The cost is okay but the room could be a little bigger. The bathroom is okay."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is treated equally here even if we are different. The campus is very accepting to everyone.
College Freshman,4,Our school spirit is the best. The people and staff always try to get us involved and the events are super fun to attend.
College Freshman,4,I love my school because everyone is so nice and welcoming. I love the motto whichbis culture for service and I love helping people. In love how it is a Christian based school which is helping me grow stronger in my faith. My campus feels like home and the people here are like family to me.
College Junior,4,Campus security is always looking out for students safety. Sioux Falls is a bigger city than where I am from so it does not feel as safe as it does when I am at home.
College Junior,4,"There are many opportunities for internships, jobs, and alumni networking through the use of the career center and academic advisors. There are employers on campus almost every other day of the week looking to recruit students."
College Junior,4,The professors are very involved and want the best possible understanding of the topics for the students. There are many courses offered with very few that have large class sizes.
College Junior,4,"The community and students are very supportive of all school activities. School spirit is constantly shown by alumni, current students, faculty and staff, and surrounding areas."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school because the people are what make this school amazing. With its Christian values and Top-Notch professors, I have been receiving a quality education for a pretty great price! Not to mention all of the Financial Aid I have received from school and the personalized attention!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school, but I wish I would have looked at schools farther from home."
College Freshman,4,"I think the variety of options are wonderful, there are even a lot not to far from campus so if you want a snack but don't want to spend that much it's very convenient to hop in your car and get whatever your feeling."
College Freshman,4,I think they do very well at their job and are very kind and helpful whenever us students need a little guiding.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus, I get to meet and create wonderful friendships around me. Another perk about living on campus is if you wake up a tad late for your morning class you still have time to get there because you don't have to drive across town."
College Freshman,4,This campus is safe and it has great security.
College Freshman,4,Many options but probably not the healthiest.
College Freshman,4,I have a great roommate and we made our dorm room very homey. It's a good place to live and great experience for first year at college.
College Freshman,4,I am receiving great financial aid but it is frustrating that they do not cover housing under a scholarship.
College Freshman,4,I can work out and play sports year round.  Up to date equiptment and space
College Freshman,4,I would eat off campus all the time if I could!
College Freshman,4,Was very simple just filled out the aps and asked what was available
College Freshman,4,They do a great job of maintaining community!
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus! USF creates a great community!
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I received an excellent academic scholarship based on my ACT score and GPA. There are several grants and scholarships available for students, but there is a cap on how much scholarship money a student can receive directly from the school."
College Sophomore,4,"The freshmen dorms have no air conditioning and very limited options for rearranging furniture. They are kept clean though. The upperclassman dorms are excellent. They are spacious and comfortable. There are large lounge areas in most of the dorms, which are good for movie or game nights."
College Junior,4,USF Cougar football is a great sport to go and watch!  
College Junior,4,"The students are really nice and social, as for the living on campus i live off of campus so I can't comment on that on-campus living "
College Junior,4,"Very personable staff, smaller feeling college, christian based campus "
College Junior,4,The campus size to parking lot size I believe is a pretty good ratio and finding parking when I've gone to the campus so far hasn't been a problem.  
College Junior,4,"Great health and safety area on the campus, and with the nursing department right there and so many knowledgeable people makes you feel very well taken care of  "
College Sophomore,4,"The local atmosphere presents a rather safe environment. There are a couple times where our ""rival"" school tries to pull some pranks but we take it as a challenge and come up with something more civilized and clever. It is kind of fun to live in an environment where there is a safe feeling. Mainly because you are able to do more outside with friends, and actually have a better time doing activities."
College Sophomore,4,"Life on campus is really enjoyable. For one you have the community of friends you make over the years around campus, and you have the chance to meet others through the many different activities around the campus. Just walking to class you see all the people you know or have just met. On campus there is a strong sense of this community especially when you are able to talk to any of the people. Unless you are very shy, but even then this community encourages you to break out of your shell and live life to the fullest. I would know since this is happening to me. In the dorms, there is an even greater sense of community because it is as if you live in apartments. You learn to better respect the people around you and they learn to respect you. Overall it is a great community."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics are fantastic. All the professors that I have had really know their subjects and are always looking for a rousing discussion, not to determine if you are awake, but to get varying perspectives of some of the concepts being taught. Some are very affective at using this technique, however, not every professor has the same way of teaching. Some will challenge you by giving you critical thinking tasks and others will teach a lecture and note type of class. It all depends on the subject matter of course, but the are all effective to me. And the workload depends on the individual professor, but it is very manageable with the right time management skills."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is centered around many different food options that are all a fair distance from campus. Most of the food options around the campus are fast food, but there are many other restaurants that provide a sit-down meal. The prices range from like $5 to about $15 a meal, that is if you go to places that have lobster or something. But overall there is a nice selection of coffee shops, and other places that one could go and enjoy. Not to mention the places that deliver to the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"The process of getting into my program was hardly a problem for me. Although I didn't meet the required ACT score for the program they accepted me for my high school GPA. I was certainly lucky they did this for my program ambitions. A tip I would give is that even when you think that high school I a joke, take it seriously anyways. When those older than you tell you what you do now affects everything you do later, listen to them and think before you act."
College Sophomore,4,"The availability of computers on campus is actually pretty good. There are labs all over campus with a substantial amount of computers in each. In fact there are some labs that are rarely being used at different times of the day. So not having a laptop for homework and other things isn't a complete drag, but it is nice to have your own so then you don't have to leave your dorm room. You can just be stationary without moving all your sources around campus."
College Sophomore,4,For me the process of financial aid went fairly smooth. The people in the financial aid office really know what they are talking about and help you understand how you sign up for the several applications needed. They even send helpful reminders to you and make sure you are aware of the many opportunities that you can apply for.
College Sophomore,4,"While the weather cannot be changed, the buildings around campus are well placed so you don't have to be outside for an extreme amount of time when it is cold out. Also the Campus Grounds people keep the sidewalks as clear as possible so the chance of slipping is slim, unless you are clumsy or are not wearing a very wise shoe choice."
College Freshman,4,"The work load isn't too bad, unless if you're a procrastinator. There is a specific place to find out about jobs and internships here. "
College Freshman,4,I like the professors and the registration and cirriculum is good too. 
College Freshman,4,"The facilty are very nice and caring. The activities, buildings and services are acceptable but could use more personality. Lots of school spirit. "
College Freshman,4,The freshman dorms could use more spacing but i think sullivan is the best for campus housing.it's a small campus and easily walkable.
College Freshman,4,I stay away from the sketchy ones. 
College Freshman,4,"It's not too strict I think, but ive smelled weed smoke in the dorms which should be considered. "
College Freshman,4,No peer pressure or what i've seen. Drugs are for losers....
College Freshman,4,I have not experienced any problems
College Freshman,4,Dorms could use some imporovments
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of food places and one mall
College Freshman,4,I love the school and the baseball program is great
College Freshman,4,"Off campus dining here in Sioux Falls is great, there are many options to choose from if looking for a place to dine in at. Campus is near the central part of town so looking for a good restaurant is quite easy."
College Freshman,4,There is not much diversity of the campus of USF. We are full of great people who all share similar beliefs in religion. It is a very small campus so getting to know many people is a very easy task.
Freshman,2,"Everyone is very friendly and it has an overall good atmosphere. However, there are many factors about the academics that I am unhappy with."
College Freshman,2,The visitation is very strict and the curfew is way too early for college students.
College Freshman,2,The dorm I live in is very old and small.  Certain places are not kept clean.
College Freshman,2,"Campus strictness is pretty bad here, some days it is to the extent to me feeling like I'm at church camp all over again. This is college and i want it to be the best days ever, not days where i have someone watching my every move."
College Junior,2,No local buses. Airport isn't too far from campus. No train services
College Junior,2,Not enough parking. Parking lots will quickly AND heavily favors students in the dorms
College Freshman,2,"Just my opinion...most of the guys are the same in terms of looks and lack individuality, which is annoying. They're mostly obnoxious jocks who wear stupid snapbacks all the time and it's so dumb. for every nice guy theres a big load that aren't that cutlured. 
however the girls are pretty nice and more classier and respectful  than the guys."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a whole lot of diversity here, mostly because it's a small, private, Christian college in South Dakota.  Racial diversity is there, but it's small.  Political beliefs, if you're a democrat you usually have to stay silent, because you're the minority.  Same if you're anything besides cisgender and heterosexual or believe people who aren't cisgender or heterosexual should have equal rights and protections under the law.  A lot of people here are really religious, and they use that to base their discrimination.  This annoys me as a christian who wants equal rights for all, but it has strengthened my views and helps you to see other people's viewpoints so you don't live in a bubble full of people only with your view."
College Freshman,2,"Meal plan/flex dollars work well.  Can use them also at Java Cafe which is convenient.
The dining hall could use more variety of foods"
College Freshman,2,"There are two dining optiosn on campus.  Java city and the caf.  The caf food isn't terrible and the usually have a good variety along with the basics like a salad bar, sandwiches, pizza, and the grill.  You can only use your flex dollars at java so don't be afraid to buy a coffee or something else every so often."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of rules that affect social life and dorm life.  The RA's most likely will write you up for breaking rules such as intervisitation.  Guys in girls halls and girls in guys halls are limited between 11am and 11pm weekdays 12 to 12 weekends.  They also write people up for alcohol in the dorms since we're a dry campus.  After 11 all entrances except one are locked up.
College Freshman,2,"Winter time brings snow,freezing rain and strong winds. The avg. temp 20 degrees."
College Freshman,2,Find ways of paying for school can be really deficult.
College Freshman,2,It is a little inconvent to not have a car. the cost of a taxie can add upand the one almost has to walk 4 miles or wait for a ride from someone else who has a car.
College Freshman,2,"The college is located in the Midwest, so a majority of the students are white. However, many athletes come from other states so there is some diversity."
College Junior,2,Frigid Midwest. It is very windy in Sioux Falls and winters are cold and dark. It is also very flat so don't come if you like a lot of outdoor activities.
College Sophomore,2,"Off Campus Living – I've only lived on campus one year and I'm glad that I got the experience but I have really enjoyed living off campus because I'm more free to do my own thing. However the selection for places around campus aren't as nice as what I would like to live in. Although they aren't the nicest, they are still cheap which makes it affordable for me as a college student."
College Freshman,2,"Typical for the Midwest, but Athletic – Most of our students are white. Most students of other ethnic groups are here because of athletics. Everybody gets along very well with eachother and there is never any problem with racism. There is a lot of diversity when it comes to economic backgrounds and political beliefs. Diversity among religion is not really a factor. Most students would say they are Christians. The diversity comes in the different denominations. Sexual orientation here is very unified: heterosexual."
College Junior,1,Very few choices and some of it doesn't look edible or tasty!
College Sophomore,1,"USF has a no-alcohol, no-drug, no-anything policy. They are very strict and try to greatly enforce these rules (IF YOU GET CAUGHT!). They also have a very strict inter-visitation policy where boys are not allowed in girls' rooms and vice versa past a certain time of night. However, the RA staff is very understanding and as long as you're not stupid, you really don't even mind the rules. And like I said...just don't get caught."
College Freshman,1,"Students are not allowed to drink or possess alcoholic beverages of any kind on campus, which is standard prodocol for college campuses. We also have Intervisitation hours; girls can't have boys in their rooms after 11 at night and same for boys."

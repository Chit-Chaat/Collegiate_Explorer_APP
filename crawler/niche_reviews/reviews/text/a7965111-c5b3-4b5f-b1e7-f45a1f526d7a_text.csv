Sophomore,5,"I liked how personal each experience felt. Since the campus is smaller than one at a public college, the relationships you have with your professors and classmates have more of an impact. You're more likely to run into them since it's a small campus, so establishing good relationships help in the long run. The parking can be improved though, since it doesn't seem like there is a lot of spaces."
Freshman,5,Love BC and its atmosphere! The small campus and small class sizes allow me to gain the most from my education.
Senior,5,"My experience at BC was worth the investment and much appreciated! I loved the atmosphere and the college truly desires for you to achieve your dreams. As a small college, relationships were important and everyone loved to talk about anything. Everyone is very helpful on campus. It did not have the best buildings or food but it makes up for it through the ability to feel at home. Thank you!"
Niche User,5,"Well my experience at bridgewater started with a football coach back in September 2019. His name was coach Purk. He came to my school meade high, and started talking about bridgewater was all about. I liked the things he said, so I went and took a visit, it was like a football tour type visit. It was basically players who could possibly be an eagle. I liked it. While I was playing hs football, I kept in touch with coach purk building a relationship. So I went to do another tour and got even more impressed and thought to my self “ this is the place for me” and right on the spot, I told coach purk I’m committing to the school and he gave me a big hug. So yes I like what I see ahead for my years at bridgewater."
Freshman,5,Being able to play sports here at Bridgewater College is a very unique and enjoyable experience. The atmosphere is very positive and friendly which helps students get through their days of hard work. It can be very easy to make friends and be able to hang out with them.
Senior,5,Bridgewater College is a close-knit community where faculty and staff are invested in students' current and future success.
Senior,5,Bridgewater College is my second home. I have been offered my opportunities and gained more knowledge here than I ever imagined. I have discovered who I want to be and developed a path for my future. I would highly recommend BC to everyone!
Freshman,5,"Bridge water is not a ""party school"" it is a school for those looking to further their minds and who of which are solely focused on their academics our sports teams aren't amazing but they are not bad either. The food is amazing the people are friendly and everyone looks out for each other if someone misses the notes for a class we all share and learn together never leaving someone behind. Not only that but Bridgewater has some of the best teachers around with our average class sizes being about 15 students they have the time to go over notes with you. An overall Bridgewater college is a great place for higher learning I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a school for academics."
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at Bridgewater College has been wonderful. I have really enjoyed getting to know the professors at the college as well as the other students. The friends that I have met at this school are irreplaceable. I happened to meet my best friend at this school which happens to be my roommate Jacob.  The only problem I had with Bridgewater this past year was the food selection. It was good somedays but most days it was poorly made.
Niche User,5,Bridgewater College has a very welcoming atmosphere along with students and staff that are always willing to help in any way possible.
Senior,5,"Bridgewater College is an excellent small school with a friendly community and amazing professors. Bridgewater offers many scholarships to make school affordable as well as on campus jobs to make additional money. There are a variety of majors to chose from, small class sizes, and the opportunity to make connections with professors and staff members."
Freshman,5,I love the fact that the class sises are small because it gives you one on with with your professor. I also love the fact that there is such a small community because it reminds me of home.
Niche User,5,The college was clean and every student we passed was polite and respectful.  I like the student to faculty ratio and the Women's Soccer coach is very personable and engaged with his players and their success.
Niche User,5,It's a great experience being there all the faculty and coaches really care for you whether you are a recruit or if are a staff member.
Freshman,5,The Professors are amazing and it's easy to communicate with them. You become part of a big community of great students.
Sophomore,5,Bridgewater is a fantastic place to spend the most important years of your life. Student life does an excellent job of setting up events and getting all students involved. There are so many programs and clubs to join throughout this very diverse college. Professors bend over backwards to make sure you are prepared for the future and reach your goals! A prestigious college with high academics where the community gives everything to make the college a better place!
Sophomore,5,Love feels like family away from home I play lacrosse and they are like family I would suggest looking at this school have has great experience away from home
Niche User,5,I like how Bridgewater College is an opening book. Also that it's has friendly staff member at times.
Senior,5,"Great place to study and an even better place to live. Quality academics and plenty of opportunities for independent studies, study abroad, etc. Plus, class sizes are small and the professors really care."
Freshman,5,Bridgewater college has been the school of my dreams. It is so homey and welcoming as is every student I have met and staff here. The class sizes are small and personal and I adore it.
Freshman,5,I went on a college visit with the hopes of being on the football team.  The Campus was very nice.  The coaches were very nice and provided us with great knowledge that will help us strive in college life.
Junior,5,"Bridgewater College is a very diverse and accredited school. Personally, I love that majority of the professors want the students to succeed and they assist you in any way that they possibly can."
Freshman,5,"Bridgewater is a great college to attend because you learn so much from cooperative teachers, almost all the people here are so nice, and there are so many clubs/sports to join."
Freshman,5,I love the environment and how friendly everyone is. I love how your a name not a number in a classroom.
Sophomore,5,"It is a college that offers a lot and everyone is from different places but friendly.
The classes offered give you a wide range to choose from."
Freshman,5,"I like the people, everyone seems so nice and caring. They try to include everyone not just a specific club. Very friendly and relaxed atmosphere."
Alum,5,"I loved the experience I had at Bridgewater College. There is a very supportive and friendly atmosphere both on campus as well as in the surrounding town. Students have ample opportunity to meet one on one with their professors and to get to know them personally. There are many activities, sports, and student organizations to get involved with and meet new people. Bridgewater is also very close to the national forest, with opportunities to go running, hiking, and camping. I am very happy that I chose to attend Bridgewater College."
Freshman,5,"it is a really nice campus with nice people. you get to know everybody. I have made so many friends here, and the teachers are so nice. the school really helps make you feel welcome. they have a lot of opportunities for students"
Sophomore,5,I like the friendly and positive atmosphere that the school brings. I also enjoy the safety aspect of the school and surrounding area. 
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed the food and kind people and staff at this college! I do, however, wish they would add more activities to participate in on the weekends. "
College Freshman,5,They are very helpful with your field of study!
College Freshman,5,Super nice people and easy to talk to and accessible.
College Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are excellent at Bridgewater College, they are small enough to get the attention needed without feeling over beard and learn proficiently, but not large enough to get swept up into a crowd. The professors care about the well being and the success of each student and I really feel that upon entering each class."
College Sophomore,5,"From the time we take our first step into Bridgewater until the time we are heading out for summer, we are completing convocations, meetings, and having class discussions on the how to handle and what to do if we see or experience campus crime, feel are safety is being affected, and dealing with instances of sexual assault."
College Sophomore,5,"When I choose Bridgewater College, I could count more pros than cons. I know this because I weighed my options frequently of attending Bridgewater College and what use to be my first choice, The University of Tennessee. I was beyond excited when I was accepted into UT's pre-med program during the fall of 2015. After touring the college, I was no longer set on what I had thought was my dream school. It was much larger, busier, and rushed than I could have ever imagined. To further investigate my options for further education.I toured Bridgewater, a private college that I had recieved numerous emails, fliers, and postcards for since the beginning of my senior year. When I attended the tour at Bridgewater, that is when I not only found a school to attend in the fall but, I found what I can call home for the next four years."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love this school. It's close knit community really helps me flourish at this school.
College Junior,5,"Campus police are always so helpful and kind, they would do anything to help us out in any situation."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love how easy it is to approach a professor in and out of the classroom. They are so nice and helpful with anything I might need help with.
College Junior,5,"As a liberal arts school, Bridgewater requires a variety of courses to be taken. The classes are interesting and challenging. The professors really care about their students."
College Junior,5,Bridgewater is a dry campus.
College Junior,5,There are always seminars to discuss what it will be like after graduation. There are also graduate school visits and job fairs. Many of the job fairs include alumni connections.
College Junior,5,"Bridgewater is a warm and welcoming school. It is dedicated to its students and wants everyone to succeed. Students are not treated like a number, but like a person who matters. Professors know you by name and truly care if you excel."
College Sophomore,5,This school is a great place if you are an introvert looking for a school with good academics and professors that truly carea about you.
College Freshman,5,Bridgewater takes academics extremely seriously and is a deal of pride.
College Freshman,5,A Bridgewater College degree is one of the best to receive. Alumni does all kinds of events and getting a job out of college is easy.
College Freshman,5,Everybody supports all athletics and it creates a wonderful environment!
College Freshman,5,It's a great school that really wants its students to do well in their fields of study.
College Sophomore,5,I would definitely choose Bridgewater College over again.
College Freshman,5,"I have an excellent scholarship, and they give plenty of money to people to help!"
College Junior,5,"As much as I have bashed Bridgewater College for their terrible dining services, non-existent parking, and unnecessary rules and regulations, you will not find professors that care about you more. Even as I am transferring my favorite professor Dr. Strano is supporting my decision and looking forward for me. She is the greatest advisor and has helped me not only on an academic level, but on a personal level as well. I have learned just as much outside of the classroom as I have inside of the classroom, and that is how I picture all of the professors at Bridgewater College."
College Freshman,5,The Health and Safety of BC is very important to staff. During welcome week we are given ways to prevent and help out fellow students in the cause of anything bad happening.
College Junior,5,"Whenever there are games, especially basketball and football, you can always count on our student section being filled and participating in chants. School spirit is the main target at our games because we want crowd involvement. The teams usually perform exceptionally well. Many of us like to travel to the away games depending on the distance. Faculty, staff, and parents are always there to help raise money and support the teams. Athletic facilities are excellent."
College Junior,5,"Everyone has their own sense of style. You have country boys and girls who dress a particular way. There's beach boys who portray a certain look. Almost everyone has to have ""what's in"" and others just like what they like. But typically, the guys are more dressed laid back and the girls frequently dress up. You can always tell who's in a relationship by the way the couples engage in one another on campus. If you play a sport, your social life is particularly high."
College Freshman,5,"Overall Bridgewater is a generally safe campus. You have to be careful when walking alone at night, so it's always good to go in a group just in case. There are escort buttons around campus and police officers who are willing to help students out anyway they can, even if it's just to escort them back to their rooms. There are also self defense classes offered every semester run by officers who teach female students how to defend themselves from an attack."
College Sophomore,5,"If you have a good GPA, the scholarships are good."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus, even at night."
College Freshman,5,"I like the dorms. Freshmen housing, like many other colleges, are pretty small, but these are better than most I have seen. You'll sweat for the first two weeks (no AC unless you have a medical condition) then it's fine. The upperclassmen dorms are much nicer, entire apartments. All dorms, except the all-girls dorm, are really close to the dining hall, which is open until midnight. I love 11:55 ice cream runs!"
College Freshman,5,"You can get alcohol if you have the money for it. Other students are more than willing to buy it. Thankfully, many also volunteer to be DD. If you are underage, even if you are over 18, and you get caught, they WILL contact your parents (only if you are a dependent)."
College Freshman,5,"The office of admissions primarily focuses on grades and SAT scores, with senior grades being important as well as extra-curricular activities. My essay for the application was pretty terrible, so clearly that didn't matter much. I am exceedingly pleased with the classes available for my major, English. I couldn't have chosen a better selection if I had designed the classes myself."
College Freshman,5,"I love my program! It it my intention to graduate with a B.A. in English then continue on to graduate school and earn a M.L.S. The classes available to English majors are wonderful. I am taking ""Studies in the Novel"" next semester and ""Creative Writing"" the following semester. I couldn't have picked a better selection. Writing is a passion that I always have possessed, and I want to write novels for TOR Fantasy. However, it is I a competitive field, so I want to get a job as a librarian until one of my books are published. I don't think I will have too much trouble finding a job at a Library. I volunteered at one for three years, during high school, and if worse comes to worse I could apply there. I know they would hire me. As for the rest...we will see."
Junior,4,"At Bridgewater College, you have to want to be there. If you are looking for a big school with crazy college experiences this is not the school for you. BC is a small school, with tiny classes which are great for personal learning experiences."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Bridgewater is a school that deeply cares about it's students. However, communication could be improved."
Freshman,4,I like Bridgewater College's small campus and how I can form a close relationship with my professors.
Alum,4,Bridgewater is a great place to start out your college career. I learned a lot about who I was thanks to the professors and faculty there. They always cared for me and made sure I was taking care of myself.
Sophomore,4,I love how close the professor's are to their students.  Your professors will get to know you in a way that can not happen at a big school.  The class sizes are very manageable and overall the whole campus is very caring and connected.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Bridgewater is a great small college. Everyone there is super friendly, the food is decent, the campus is well kept, and professors are very helpful! I did not want to go, and am so glad that I did not let my fears get the best of me."
Niche User,4,Bridgewater College has a beautiful campus with small classes that making learning individualized. Bridgewater focuses on you and achieving your dream future. It is a pretty location with a dry campus but is close to JMU which has more of a party scene. The women's soccer program is wonderful with an amazing coach who focuses on his team and accomplishing goals.
Sophomore,4,"Bridgewater is a decent college especially when you get a good scholarship. However, while I heard it has gotten better than before but students are kinda treated like children. One wonderful staff member was actually fired for treating the students like people and socializing with them. Overall it's an okay college with a lot of room for improvement."
Freshman,4,I am almost complete my Freshman year here at Bridgewater and I can honestly say that I love it here!!
Freshman,4,"Bridgewater has given me a place that I feel extremely comfortable while being able to study. It is my home away from home. I have made so many new friends with the students and staff on campus, that I could not imagine going anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"The faculty, staff, and students are very nice and welcoming! It's an absolutely beautiful campus with a heavy focus into the academics taught by staff who have worked in the field of study they're teaching and/or currently working. It can be a bit boring during the weekends, but Harrisonburg is only a 15 minute drive away where there's loads to do."
Niche User,4,"It is a small college with about 1900 students, has a swimming pool, alumni give money directly to someone and not very far from my home which is appealing to me."
Niche User,4,Bridgewater is an amazing college with an even better campus scene. The classrooms are decent sized and the school has two lecture halls. The weight room for the athletes was renewed and the campus athletic facility is very modern.
Junior,4,"It is a small campus, which I really like. It’s big on sports with most of its small population being athletes. The classes are small, but the office hours for professors are very short as well. You know everyone in your classes and most are discussion based and small groups."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience is pleasant at the college, although there are majors that have their advantages there since there are more professors there, it is an excellent college overall, and I've enjoyed my time there."
Sophomore,4,"I like Bridgewater College, because of the one-on-one attention you can have with a teacher due to smaller class sizes. I also like that everything on campus is very close. What I would like to see change would be the limits they put on you. I believe ""dry campus"" is taken too seriously for those above the age of 21."
Sophomore,4,"Bridgewater is such an involved college. There are so many great opportunities, groups and activties you can be in."
Junior,4,"As a Junior now at Bridgewater College, I have had great experiences and seen some improvements needed by the school. When entering college my biggest fear was that I wasn't going to fit in. Bridgwater made this easy because the school is very diverse and students are very open to making new friends no matter their background or beliefs. I would like the school improve on the parking regulations. There are a lot of students with limited spaces for parking and a lot of parking infractions being caused."
Sophomore,4,"The things I love about Bridgewater is that it is a very small and family like campus. You know almost everyone there and everyone there is very friendly. The campus stays very clean year around, the yard people keep it very clean and presentable. The professor’s there are very understanding and helpful. They allow you to come visit them during office hours, other schools aren’t that close with their students. Most of my professors see me around campus and remember my name. The campus food there is very delicious and there are lots to chose from. The dorms are very widespread and clean. The bathrooms stay clean very often. Everything is great about Bridgewater college, were getting a new library soon which will just add to this great school."
Freshman,4,"If you like the smaller college feel, this is the perfect school! Safe area, smaller classrooms great for individual learning, many opportunities."
Freshman,4,So far my experience has been good. the school is small and quiet. Its easy to find your way and the people are always friendly.
Freshman,4,My experience at Bridgewater College has been wonderful so far. Everyone here is so helpful and there are many sources around school to guide you in the right direction. There are many different clubs and social activities so every student around campus can be included.
Freshman,4,"For a smaller college, Bridgewater has many opportunities. They offer many scholarships. They also have an environment that is very accepting and supportive. They push their students to better themselves."
Freshman,4,"I chose to come to Bridgewater College to continue my academic and athletic career. Bridgewater is small, but it is a very pretty campus. You can make it to your classes within 10 minutes, which is really nice! I would highly recommend coming to Bridgewater and taking a tour to see if you think Bridgewater could be your new home for the next 4 years!"
Sophomore,4,"Bridgewater is an amazing 4 year liberal arts college that has many great opportunities for its students.  Being a liberal arts school, students can engage in classes they normally wouldn't take.  This gives them the knowledge to engage in conversations with people outside their major and interests.  One thing that I would change is tuition and scholarship opportunities. Tuition will be about $46,000 starting in the fall of 2017.  It continues to increase in order to fund the major changes that the school is planning to make, but the merit scholarships and scholarship opportunities are not increasing along with tuition.  I believe that Bridgewater should consider increasing their merit scholarships in order to compensate for the rising tuition cost."
Freshman,4,"Bridgewater College is one experience I'm glad I have gotten the chance to take. This atmosphere of this college is friendly, homely, and encouraging. Everyone that is here, whether it is staff, professors, or even other students want you to succeed. The campus is small, about a seven minute walk across the school grounds. So overall I am very excited to continue my journey here as a student, to see where it takes me in life."
Junior,4,So far I love Bridgewater. I have yet to deal with any problems while on campus and for the most part everyone I have come across have been nice.
College Freshman,4,I'm a commuter but dorms seem nice and very close to everything.
College Freshman,4,I never hear about the Greek life.
Senior,4,"I am a current senior at Bridgewater College. If you're looking for a small school, this is it. Great student to teacher ratio if you prefer one-on-one time. It is a dry campus (no alcohol policy). Everyone is so welcoming and helpful, and I find it a very friendly environment."
College Sophomore,4,"The location of my residence hall during freshman year was perfect. I was a resident of Heritage Hall which was connected to the crimson cafe also know as ""the link"", as well as it being right in the center of my classes. The amenities were excellent, my roommate and I were near the 24 hour gym and study rooms. The social atmosphere was great, everyone on my hall became a giant family, the cost of room and board, however was pricey for the lack of air conditioning."
College Sophomore,4,"The majority of students at Bridgewater College are athletes. I entered into Bridgewater College as an athletic training major, in this major I had the gracious opportunity to work hand and hand as well as  on field with every sport on campus. The coaches were awesome, the athletes were respectful and the facilities were always well kept. School spirit for athletic events is in no short supply, Bridgewater is a small community in which everyone gets together for sporting events."
College Sophomore,4,I will have to say the coaching and athletic training staff are wonderful and easy to talk to. There may not be an abundance of people coming to see athletes play but the people who are have enough school spirit for everybody and even though there is barely anyone in the gym they make it seem like the gym is packed. There is however a few ignorant people here and there but you learn to ignore them.
College Junior,4,I believe that I am definitely getting good references and a good education that can help me become a great employer in the future.
College Junior,4,"Housing is currently being upgraded (air conditioning, renovations, etc.) So housing is improving. The normal sized dorms"
College Junior,4,People are accepted no matter what their background is.
College Junior,4,"Bridgewater is a safe place to go to school because it is nestled in a farming community. It is a dry campus, so a lot of the problems associated with alcohol are not present."
College Freshman,4,Everyone around campus loves making new friends.
College Freshman,4,"At this school, the athletics are one of the more popular parts of life. Most of the people that I talk to and hang out with are athletes. The facilities are very nice, and can be used for both athletes and non-athletes. As far as the team spirit and attendance is concerned, there is quite a lot of support for every sport. There is a strong combination of parents, students, and even members of the community that come out and cheer on our teams. Now shifting over to team performances, some teams are annually successful, while others are a little hit and miss. When our teams doing well, we usually win our respective conference, or make it into the top 3 or 4 teams in our conference."
College Freshman,4,The only thing I like about this school is the academics. The professors are great and so is the curriculum.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a huge part of our campus, last statistic I heard over 2/3 of our population were athletes."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy school and life at BC it is challenging but rewarding and my department is especially great at instructing their course material, and campus life does a great job at keeping the community involved."
College Freshman,4,I really like being able to live on campus. I am able to get to class on time without having to worry about being late. All of the academic buildings are fairly close to my dorm.
College Freshman,4,"I really like how easy it is to get into a routine, involving classes and extracurricular activities. Making and keeping friends has also been very easy to do. I feel like being on campus is sort of like a big community where everyone is knows each other and it looking out for one another."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are pretty nice. They are pretty spacious and if the rooms don't have their own bathrooms, then there are private bathrooms on the hall. There have been some infestations with bugs, but it was taken care quite quickly. The resident life staff are pretty great and there is always something going on at the dorm. People are pretty respectful of quiet hours and they are enforced."
College Freshman,4,Bridgewater does a great job about peer pressure and how it affects society and drugs.
College Freshman,4,Bridgewater is diverse but there are a few problem spots here and there.
College Freshman,4,Safety can always be improved on but Bridgewater takes good measures of what is needed to do. I feel safe to walk across campus at night.
College Freshman,4,Classes are more difficult but professors are extremely willingly to help!
College Freshman,4,Housing is great! The process to get housing isn't the best but the actual dorms themselves are good.
College Sophomore,4,It's amazing. I wouldn't be happier anywhere else
College Junior,4,"Bridgewater is the perfect school if you are looking for a smaller school with good professors that you can get hands-on experience with. The campus is beautiful and the food is decent. The dorms are a pretty good size compared to other schools I visited, which is good because you are not allowed to live off campus during your four years at Bridgewater."
College Freshman,4,"I, so far, love Bridgewater. I grew up in a small town so the transition from there to here wasn't very hard. The professors are great and very helpful. The people I've met here are genuine, and kind. Besides the fact that some dorms do not have AC, The facilities are good.  The food is good as well."
College Freshman,4,Bridgewater College has a beautiful campus set near Shenandoah Valley. Everyone is friendly and easy to get along. The application process was smooth and the staff was very helpful throughout. I feel at home on campus and I couldn't picture myself going to another college.
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of small restaurants near the campus, but also there are many spots in Harrisonburg which is about 7 minutes from campus with your typically chain restaurants."
College Sophomore,4,Many of the administrators are friendly and help make the campus a better place.
College Sophomore,4,"Process to receive aid was simple and painless. However, in my specific case the scholarship won't benefit me as much because I am graduating sooner than 4 years. I also dislike that you can't increase your scholarship via academic performance."
College Sophomore,4,Small campus with many good social areas. Lots to do around the area and easy to make friends to go out and do these things with. Classes are well rounded and the common areas are frequently used.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is actually great! I used to go to a community college where I had to drive myself everyday to and from school and that took up a great deal of my time. That time spent driving I can now use to study more and excel in my classes because I live on campus at a beautiful school. This is my first year at Bridgewater and I live in Wright, it is a newer dorm so it is nice inside. It is also close to most of my classes."
College Freshman,4,Most of the buildings are older but the rooms are really big. First-years like Heritage the most and Stone Village is where most seniors want to live. I did random roommate and we get along really well but some people didn't get as lucky in the lottery system. Some of the buildings could use an update but for the most part they're all pretty good.
Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do. Lots of good people go here, but it is so boring having to go up to JMU every weekend. It is so small, it is like high school. Everybody knows everyone and everything."
College Freshman,2,"They didn't have air conditioning in the building I was in and I almost fainted on multiple occasions because it was so hot in my room and my roommate wouldn't open the window. It took months to try to get a roommate switch because my RA, Nanii, did not want to let us switch at first. The housing process is terrible at the school as I still, along with others, have not received a place to stay next year as they accepted too many students and didn't have enough housing for all of them yet."
College Freshman,2,"The classes are okay, but the students really need to be open-minded and the diversity on campus could be improved."
College Junior,2,"I'm questioning the quality of education from how much tuition is right now, and I could probably do better."
College Junior,2,"I have no words really.  I'm not sure why the tuition keeps going up and where all the money is going into, except sport related reason, but we're division three...."
College Sophomore,2,more options and not so many repeated options. More polite staff that can speak English. Maybe add more dining options through outside sources.
College Freshman,2,"The KCC sucks. Be prepared to eat off campus or cook in your dorm quite a bit. There are staples like burgers, chicken, salads, and sandwiches but after a while it gets old."
College Junior,2,The set up of internships and job prospects is non-existent
College Junior,2,There isn't a lot of Business major internships/job opportunities locally because you live in the middle of nowhere.
College Junior,2,The only Greek Life at Bridgewater College is if you are able to find the underground fraternities and sororities within the college. Good luck and may the odds forever be in your favor.
College Junior,2,The strictness here is ridiculous. You get in trouble for the most asinine things and you'll be lucky if you can sit through a meeting with John Manson (the student affairs counselor) and feel like you have learned something from the talk with him.
College Junior,2,Most people party off campus. On campus parties are usually so small that they're only there for pregaming.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of usage on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Being in a small town, there wasn't a lot of options unless you traveled about 20-30 to Harrisonburg."
College Sophomore,2,There are great availability for computer access but the network connection sucks
College Sophomore,2,"To enjoy the nightlife, you have to find it or make it yourself. It also depends on your idea of ""fun"". There are a few bars around the area but you would have to be 21+ so that only provides that fun for a select group. JMU is right down the highway which is so convenient for under age students looking for parties."
College Freshman,2,"They're very strict about drinking on campus, even for those student's who are 21 and over.  They also take parking violations seriously, such as freshmen parking in upperclassmen spots.  I think they should relax about drinking on campus because at least if people are drinking here they're saving themselves from the possibility of driving drunk."
College Freshman,2,There are many different races. Religion is primarily Christian.
College Freshman,2,"If you buy a computer from the school, it costs just as much as buying a Mac and will work worse than a Mac."
College Sophomore,2,Computer Labs! there are a couple different computer labs you can use but they are usually jam packed and you takes a while to get to a computer
Senior,1,"Worst College Ever. Wish I had never applied in the first place. Everything during the tours is a lie. Food is terrible. Staff is terrible. (Watch out for student life as they only care about themselves instead of the students, i.e. Ricky Reiss is not one to rely on). Mandatory on campus housing (don't even think about living off campus because they will make it incredibly hard for you to do so)."
Senior,1,"I would like to see many things change like: the administration and staff actually caring about the students and their concerns, the dining hall getting rid of all the mice as well as making the food edible and not undercooked,  finally it would be nice if the school made credits easily transferable."
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,Bridgewater does not have any Greek life that I am aware of. I think they may have one fraternity that does some volunteer work but I'm not sure if it is an actual Greek organization.
College Sophomore,1,ER we don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,Most students live on campus because it is a residential college. They prefer not to have many students living off campus.
College Sophomore,1,We are not allowed to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I say it is the worst for Housing. The student policy does not have a policy for every type of student and the housing application process gives every student a headache. Not to mention that if a senior wants to live off campus, the school will not even let them."
College Junior,1,"Unless you go to JMU, there are 0 parties on campus and you'll probably just get drunk alone in your room haha"
College Junior,1,"There are many academic opportunities at Bridgewater, but it also could limit you. For example, Bridgewater does not offer nursing programs, etc. The registration process is always a pain because everyone is trying to register for classes and may not get in a required class because seats are already filled."
College Junior,1,Boring. Not endorsed by the college.
College Junior,1,Greek life at my school is essentially none existent.
College Junior,1,"There isn't any drinking nightlife. So if you come to party at Bridgewater don't bother. It is a dry campus, and no parties. In order to go ""out drinking"" you will either have to go to JMU to party. Bridgewater does have some nightlife programs where you can hang out with friends and watch a movie now and then, but other than that I don't think it is that entertaining, maybe if they would get fun activities it would be better."
College Junior,1,"At Bridgewater College, in order to live off campus, you must either live with your parents, be 23 or older, or be active in the army. I live off campus with my parents and would rather live with my fiance, however this is not allowed with the school rules and a student can be expelled from the school if they are broken. I think this is silly, because you made the choice to continue with your education, I feel that you should be able to make the choice if you want to go into the real world and get your own apartment and get a job as well as continue with school. I pay my own bills, and work a part-time job as well as go to school."
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – Dorms are dirty and RA's are Nazis, if they even see you with something resembling alcohol, you're going to get busted. It's a dry campus, no drinking allowed even if you're 21."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't enough parking on campus. Also, there are no benefits to being an upperclassman when it comes to parking. If you ever want to do anything fun, you need a car. There's nothing fun to do on Bridgewater's campus, or even in the town. Everything closes at 11."
College Sophomore,1,No Greeks – We don't have fraternities/sororities at my school. They're not allowed.
College Freshman,1,"There are no buses, not even to go to Harrisonburg, which is almost a daily necessity to escape the boredom of Bridgewater."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing in Bridgewater. Only option is Harisionburg, 10 mins away. No shuttles, bring a car."
College Freshman,1,"Sub-Par. Athletic center is old, stadium is outdated, worst athletic facilities in the conference. Student union has not been improved in years. Library is tiny and not often used. Campus lacks activities. Campus is as well-kept as the budget allows."

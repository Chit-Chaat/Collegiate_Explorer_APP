Sophomore,5,My online experience was great. The professors will help you if you need the help. It can be a little overwhelming but everything will be fine!!
Sophomore,5,"The college is small which is great for having a large focus on students. It does lack on the choices for degrees, but it does partner with many other colleges to help you obtain the degree you desire. The professors are stressful at times and courses are never too bad. When I need help, my advisor is there. Cost is minimal, but I dislike the price of college in general. East Georgia has been helpful in kick starting my higher level education and helping me focus on my career for the future."

I earned my Associates of Arts degree in Political Science and maintained my 4.0 GPA. Overall, my experience at EGSC was great. I had several wonderful professors, in fact, I can barely name one professor that was anything less than wonderful. The professors at this school truly care about your academic success, and if you need help, they will assist you without a doubt. I met more than just great professors at this school, but great people too. East Georgia States College is a small institution, so you get to know people pretty well. This school really furthered my education, and I have nothing negative to say about their efforts to do so. I loved my experience at East Georgia State College, and I would recommend attending this school to anyone that is looking for a higher education at a lower cost."

I absolutely love East Georgia State College, and I will be returning in the fall for another great year."

The feeling of being home sick, the loneliness of not knowing anyone can take a tole on you but at east georgia there were multiple individuals that made me feel welcome."
College Sophomore,5,"Just getting started. So far, challenging."
College Sophomore,5,It has been a learning experience.

Each student is assigned to wonderful advisers that help decide what classes are best for you in receiving your major. The school also has wonderful activities that allow you to interact with other students."
College Sophomore,5,It's a great college to start off your core classes.

College Senior,5,The campus has great extra curricular resources. 
College Senior,5,They make decisions based upon when you're available. 
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school was not my first choice and not on my list to apply to. Starting my first semester was diffcuilt because I was upset with myself dealing with my grades and not being able to get into a University. The reason why I said yes to coming to East Georgia all over again is because this instituion has helped me grow into a well prepared college student. This college allows more than enough opportunities to excel in your classes one choice being the acdemic center for exellence, The tutoring center. I now give tours for the admission's office and I love telling my story to students in hopes of them making the right decision in continuing their education."
Recent Alumnus,5,East Georgia State College is a wonderful campus in general. Being apart of this family allows the student great opportunities to suceed in their education. The academic center of exellence is the best place on the campus. It allows students to study with tutors and to excel in their classes. The professors that are here help their sudents as long as they seek help.
Sophomore,4,The classes are self-explanatory. The only inconvenience are the professors. I question why I am paying for online classes if the professor does nothing except grade. I have watched more YouTube videos about my courses than I have heard a single professor talk.
Sophomore,4,East Georgia State College has three area campuses as well as online classes available. The small size classes allow for more personal attention with professors. Administration and advisors are approachable and caring.
Alum,4,I loved that EGSC has a small tight-knit community feeling to it. The staff at East Georgia are always friendly and willing to help you.
Niche User,4,great for dual enrollment. the dual enrollment process was easy to complete smoothly with the college. the experience has been amazing so far and the tutors are outstanding.
Freshman,4,"I had really great professors  that wanted to truly see me succeed. If I ever needed help I knew I could come to them. Also, the campus was a small intimate campus unlike many large universities. The student center was within feet of the library as well as the academic building which was where my classes took place."
Sophomore,4,Everyone is very nice so far. They all know you by name after they've met you one time. Advisers are incredibly helpful and they definitely care. I have never been to a school that makes me feel like they truly want me to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"East Georgia State College is a great school. The college recruiters are doing a great job, but the student population is outgrowing the campus. We are in need of more dorms, more areas of study as in majors, more meal options and more student organizations to include Greek."
Sophomore,4,"The small student body and location (Swainsboro, GA) makes East Georgia State College a comfortable home for students to pursue their two year degrees. The friendly, accommodating staff is more than happy to help students find what they are looking for. Although the student body may be small, the access to great academic resources is not, as its library has a helpful staff ready to assist in tracking down information. However, East Georgia State College is not the perfect fit for those seeking to study in a large environment with an abundance of opportunity. If you love small town living, then this is the place for you!"
Freshman,4,"It was a good experience. East Georgia is a small school however with it being a small school, you get to know everybody. It has a  family atmosphere and the teachers work hard to not only teach you material but life lessons."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the new dorm as they have separate suites.  The school campus is nice and still growing.   I feel that they could have more food options, but overall, that was OK.  The learning resources available are great as well."
Graduate Student,4,East Georgia State College is a two year school. I loved this school because the classes were small and simple. The teachers were awesome and they are willing to help. They also have FREE tutoring to help with classes.
Freshman,4,"ast Georgia College is a great start-up school. It prepares students for a major university. The professors are very friendly and really care about each student's progress; sometimes, I think they care a little too much. It's a bit like highschool, but more freedom. The coursework is easy to me, but then again, some people complain about it being hard. The hardest classes to me are Biology and Pre-calculus. Comp 1 was the easiest. They taught us third grade material (like where to put a comma); sadly, some students couldn't comprehend that. It's in a small town, and it's a two-year school; so the social life is a little blah. If you're looking for a party school, this isn't for you. If you're just looking to learn and get in and get out and transfer, then this is the school for you. I would advise completing your core cirriculum here as opposed to a major university"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at East Georgia was pretty good for a Freshman. I loved the fact that the campus wasn't that big and it wasn't many distractions. Always that it took me 5-10 minutes to get to classes from my dorm room, that the dorm were apartment like and everyone had their own space. It was easy to get from class to class and not feel like I had to rush. Also the people their are so friendly and easy to get along with. Food was amazing, loved that we could choose what we wanted to eat . But what I think can change is the café needs to stay open 24/7 because on the weekends a lot of kids didn't have the money to get food or don't have enough grocery's for the week to make breakfast, lunch or dinner.  They also need more dorms because they are getting so many students now that I think a third building would be nice."
Sophomore,4,"East Georgia State College is an excellent college for people who want to get their feet wet before transferring to a bigger college.   It is not a diverse school, but it does have very cheap tuition rate."
Freshman,4,i like the campus the campus is very nice. its a welcoming school and a great start for your years of college
Freshman,4,"If you want a small town school, East Georgia is it. I go to the Statesboro campus. The building is literally one hallway. Some East Georgia classes are offered at GSU, so u get a feel for both colleges if you're thinking about transferring to a bigger school environment."
Freshman,4,"I love EGSC because they are the ""down-to-earth"" community, where the ""real world"" and higher education is combined. Your education is STRONGLY expressed, but also understands that situations arise. So, I am sending KUDOS to EGSC!!!"
College Student,4,"The start is kind of slow, but once you get used to it, it will help you in the future."
College Junior,4,It's a good school if you're looking for a associates degree
College Junior,4,They help you transfer or use your degree to find a job!
College Junior,4,It's been great although some professor could use some teaching advice
College Junior,4,"The class size is great. Not too big where you cannot learn but not too small where you feel like an outcast. I enjoyed all my professors, except math... She was very cocky and thought math was to come easy to us!"
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic program is great, and the professors are east to talk to."
College Freshman,4,The staff are very helpful when you are in need of any direction in every area. The professors are wonderful and easy to learn from.
Recent Alumnus,4,This is the best choice I could of made after high school.
Recent Alumnus,4,It is a best way to strengthen your academic skill and then you can obtain your major and career at another college.
Recent Alumnus,4,If you need anything the administration or the counsel office will point you in the right direction.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Everything is great except for the WiFi. Students that do not want to go or cannot go to the computer lab will sit in the lounging area and get on the internet.  There is a password to obtain the WiFi, but most of the students do not know what the password is."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Students can get some ""hands on"" work done.  There are not that many students in the class. The lesser the students the better you will learn."
College Freshman,4,This institution puts you in the right career path as well as accommodating your ideas on being academically successful.
College Student,4,The best fit for me
College Freshman,4,School  is amazing and entertaining because  it is different kind of students at school. You see so many kind of activities that  is never before. 
College Freshman,4,The student ethnicity  is great because it is so many different religions. People who have different styles to dress and very outgoing. Some are very arrogant but most are funny and have a great personality.
College Senior,4,The campus is very diverse and people interact with various people of different races.
College Senior,4,Most of the professors and students are very friendly. 
College Senior,4,"East Georgia State College is consistently expanding, and it's becoming more and diverse. The school is now on the university system, but it still has one of the cheapest tuitions. "
Recent Alumnus,4,The only thing at  this school and many other schools is the wait of fancial aid because of the many stdents applying for it.
College Senior,4,"The school is very reliable when it comes to internet access. The resources are also even better when it comes to the free tutors for different courses. However, there could always be two or three more."
College Senior,4,I enjoy all my classes and communicate with all my teachers. They have a great faculty and staff that don't mind helping students. Great school!

College Senior,4,The school has multiple computer labs and many resources that can be used.
College Senior,4,"East georgia has many different activities and clubs such as basketball,softball, baseball, tennis, flag football, clubs such as fashion club, and weight room , gay straight club ,etc"
College Freshman,4,There is a very diverse atmosphere of all race and religion which why i love going there. Everyone there is quite accepting and if there is not I have yet to meet them.
College Freshman,4,I would say im am getting a pretty good education from my school. I am going to East Georgia in Statesboro so I am basically going to Ga southern and i love that school. The financial aid and tuition is quite cheap but at the same time I do not get much at all for financial aid so most of the money I get back is goes strait to my apartment. The financial aid people in the office are very helpful and nice.
College Sophomore,4,I was able to get a lot of money from financial aid to pay off my living fees and to live off of for a semester. I can go to college and not worry about how I'm going to eat.
College Freshman,4,"I love online courses. I find it a little easy, but the best thing is that you do not have to come to class. You have to be aware of when you have online quizzed and test. You don't have a professor so you have to be your own teacher."
College Junior,4,Being an accounting major is like being a major at any other school.  The workload is pretty fair but time consuming.  I have not yet pursued any job opportunites yet.
College Junior,4,"Not Bad – Ive had a pretty decent time at EGS, mialy because I was on the Georgia Souhtern campus the enitire time. It has a small time feel while having a prett big campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I thought online classes would be much harder, but they were actually not that bad. The date on the syllabus that the professors gave you when something was due, all you had to do was have the work turned in by the specific time they gave you and hit send. If you had any questions about it, tou could aslways email them."
College Junior,4,Printing on Campus – Every semester you are awarded $60 to use toward printing. Each page that you print is 30 cents. I recommend using the computer lab as much as possible for your printing needs.
College Sophomore,4,With You Every Step of the Way – I had some problems with my prepaid program and the school was with me every step of the way and never gave up. Tuition was alittle more than expected but because the service and determination was so great it was all worth it!
College Freshman,4,Not to Bad! The university offers a ton of awesome and helpfull places. The Rac and the Uion are the most popular places for students to be.
College Sophomore,4,Help and Fun – I am a pre med/ nursing major and i love every minute of it. It is challenging and i can stay busy and whenever i need help i can always get it
College Junior,4,I love the computer lab and wireless internet here at my school. It took me a few minutes to set it up on my laptop but when i DID IT WAS GREAT.
College Sophomore,4,Working People – A lot of the students on the campus either had a job or like to party. I prefer to hang out with the job people because I too have a job and I like to work
Niche User,2,"If you like the country life, this is the school for you. There are barely any food places, no mall or shopping center, everything is literally on one main road and you have a Wal-Mart and Harveys . The School itself is somehwat decent, you can only eat two times a day with meal plan on mon-thurs and once on friday and no meal plan on weekends plus food is below decent. There are only two dorms, all four bed two bath. The school itself is two buildings for academic classes not including gym building. One building that consist of Financial aid, cafeteria and a very small and boring game room and book store. If you like small classes and small town and small school this is where you should be. But i can say the locals do know how to party,"
Recent Alumnus,2,Registering for financial aid is okay but the money that they give back is not enough.  I do not have enough to get to and from school for the whole semester.  I wish there could be a financial aid office there every day.
College Senior,2,"My experience was very poor in the end. a low percentile of students transfer and even fewer graduate. I do have friends graduating, both have been there 4 years. The instructors from my perspective know their subject well, they just do not know how to teach it. In the beginning, I was advised to take a 6 class course load. WHO DOES THAT?I have transferred elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,Not Much of an Option – My major is in the Veterinary department and unfortunately it is alot harder for me to get classes before they close because there are not that may to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,"Some academics that are offered are great. I want to transfer to a University but my science credits do not transfer over, that is the only thing that I do not like."
College Freshman,1,I have no way of contacting my family due to the horrible network reception.
College Freshman,1,"This school is unorganized, and they are no help with financial aid what so ever. They not only forgot to send my application for a loan out, but they didn't approve it for almost a month. I almost got dropped from all my classes last semester because of it."
College Junior,1,The carrer service choices at EGS are very limited.
College Junior,1,The financial aid process for my college is very hard and complicated. Trying to get in touch with any department is nearly impossible.
College Junior,1,"CAMPUS ACTIVITIES – THERE ARE NO CAMPUS ACTIVITIES BECAUSE MOST OF ACTIVITES ARE SPONSORED BY GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIV.  EAST GA COLLEGE SHARES A CAMPUS WITH THEM, SO WE HAVE TO PAY HIGH FEES FOR ACTIVITIES EVEN IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO ATTEND .  WE PAY EXTRA FOR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS, WHICH I DO NOT ATTEND."

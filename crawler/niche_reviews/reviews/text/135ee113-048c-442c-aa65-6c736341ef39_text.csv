Freshman,5,"As a college freshman, I can say that my experience here considered the circumstances has been nothing but amazing.  The faculty is great and there is so man ways to get involved.  There is always something to do on campus that is covid-19 friendly and everyone here is so kind.  The facilities are phenomenal and there are so many resources for whatever you are looking for."
Junior,5,The professors at Sacred Heart make online and virtual learning very engaging and worthwhile. Online classes are very convenient and not overcomplicated by instructors.
Niche User,5,I’ve been browsing for the perfect program for me. I came across SHU and read about the program and went to an information session. I fell in love. I am eager to start soon and can’t wait to get into the field and begin my career.

Alum,5,I took some of my courses online. They were very easy to navigate through and the professors were very helpful and attended to all of my needs.

Alum,5,"My experience at Sacred Heart University was better than I ever imagined it would be. From the time I began my education there to now an alumni, I have seen so many positive changes to the school. One of the reasons I went to SHU was because I saw the impactful changes and was able to experience it."
Sophomore,5,All of the teachers have been so beyond helpful when it comes to online learning. Most of the professors have personally emailed students checking in to see how they/their families are doing. They’re extremely easy going and understanding.
Sophomore,5,"Once I saw Sacred Heart, I fell in love. The campus is always being updated with the highest quality amenities and the best of the best buildings that when my friends from other colleges came to visit their jaws dropped. Other than the fact the rooms and food are something like no other college can offer, the people here are amazing. The staff gets to know you. No matter where you go, you will always find someone who knows you and says hi. I love the feeling of community and happiness that’s always present around the campus. Everyone wants help each other. I couldnt be happier with my decision."
Alum,5,"College is what you make of it, and SHU has everything to offer. The campus is so beautiful, the professors are caring and accessible and the food is great! Campus life is vibrant if you want to get involved - there are so many clubs and activities. There are even awesome performing arts events all throughout the year."
Alum,5,"I've taken online classes and the technology is great and the faculty are really well equipped to use it. Faculty use it in different ways, but it's always been a good experience and I'd recommend it if you can't be in the classroom."
Alum,5,"Most SHU professors utilize some form of online platform in the classroom - especially Blackboard for posting grades, assignments, the syllabus, etc."
Alum,5,"The minute I stepped onto the SHU campus when I toured the University, I knew it was the best fit for me. Everyone was friendly, the campus was just the right size and there was a bunch of different majors to choose from. I was a work-study for all 4 years and upon graduating, was offered a full-time position at the University. It's been my home ever since! My decision to come to SHU provided me an education, positive college experience, work ethic, and eventually gave me a career."
Alum,5,"A true rising star in the Northeast, Sacred Heart University is an incredibly welcoming school with plenty of extracurricular activities and strong academic programs. The school continues to grow year after year and has a bright future ahead."
Alum,5,A good mix of online course offerings that have discussion boards and guidance from your professors.
Alum,5,"I didn’t need to take online classes, my major wasn’t one where that would be applicable. I know some students who did and said they had a good time with it."
Alum,5,"Sacred Heart has truly been my “Home Away from Home”. The friends I have met will last a lifetime, the experiences were life changing, and every time I think about my time at SHU, it’s filled with nothing but awesome memories."
Alum,5,I have taken several online classes and I am impressed. The professors do just as good a job with online learning as they do with in person. They don’t waver from the values of Sacred Heart.
Alum,5,"Sacred Heart was by far one of the best decisions I ever made for myself. It exceeded all my expectations in all aspects, academically and socially. There are so many opportunities to get involved and make a difference in the community. I was able to hold numerous leadership positions and grow immensely as a person. I even returned for graduate school. Wish I could do it all again!"
Alum,5,"I wouldn't be where I am today without Sacred Heart, it has given my my life long friends, family, career, and I a grateful for every moment."
Alum,5,"As my SHU experience dates back to before COVID and honestly just at the beginning of online classes, I took a couple of them and really enjoyed it, professors were still very hands on and available and truly taught the courses, regardless of not being in a classroom."
Alum,5,"Sacred Heart University is one of the greatest places and communities I’ve ever been apart of. The education was top notch, but the community and the sense of compassion and joy that the entire campus encompasses is truly unique. I cherish my 5 years there and look back on them as some of the best days of my life. I recommend this university to everyone I talk to. There are constantly new programs and buildings on campus and you truly know where your tuition dollars are going. If you’re a senior in high school looking for a good education with professors you genuinely care about your future, a wholesome experience college experience between D1 sports, community service initiatives and just amazing people to become friends with for life, SHU is the school for you."
Alum,5,"I took a few online classes while I was an undergraduate and graduate student. I was not a fan of online classes because I wasn't motivated enough to keep up. However, even though not an in person instruction, my professors were always available for help and guidance if I was struggling with a particular assignment. Blackboard can be a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's fine!"
Alum,5,"I had the most wonderful experiences at Sacred Heart. I had great professors, was given plenty of opportunities to network and be involved on campus and I met some of my best friends. They say home is where the ""heart"" is and Sacred heart was definitely home for me. Everyone was always so welcoming and there to help, no matter the situation. Sacred heart helped shaped the woman I am today and I am forever grateful for my time there."
Alum,5,"Sacred Heart is one of the best schools in CT you can go to. There are tons of activities to do, there is usually something going on during the weekends (knowing people can help), the food can get some hate but I always liked the options. Professors in my program (criminal justice) were all cool and super understanding of things. The school continues to consistently grow and become a better place for students."
Alum,5,I thought online classes were easier and more convenient than in person classes. The professors usually made assignments clear and were always available for students if needed.
Alum,5,I love how sacred heart is growing and their sports too. Home away from home environment. The food is good too!!
Alum,5,Great atmosphere. Made friends for a lifetime. The experience is what you make it. Be activate and get involved. Go Pios!!
Alum,5,"Easy. Smooth no issues. Best part about these course were professors, were always on hand to handle any issues that occurred. Professors were always understanding with technical issues."
Alum,5,"My experience at SHU was fantastic. I was heavily involved in extra-curriculars, and took advantage of every opportunity."
Alum,5,I took a few online courses at SHU and they were great. The teachers answered questions quickly and I learned a lot.
Graduate Student,5,"Sacred Heart is great about taking care of its students. Whether it’s a worldwide pandemic, bad weather, or something tragic that happened within the community I always know that students and teachers will band together. There are also an astonishing amount of resources at Sacred Heart that are by no means hard to come by."
Graduate Student,5,I only took online classes at the end of my senior year due to the pandemic but my professors were completely understanding and worked hard to make things comfortable and to also make sure that we were still learning.
Alum,5,"My graduate school experience at Sacred Heart University changed my life. They not only want you to concentrate on the academic and real-life aspects of your chosen field, but make sure that you understand the ethical and social impact that your actions have on your industry. The faculty was outstanding."
Alum,5,Sacred Heart is actively working to create optimal learning experiences for students during this time of crisis.
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about my university. There is an activity for every type of person. No matter what you are into, there is something for you. Everyone is nice at the school and the environment always makes me want to stay."
Sophomore,5,"Flexibility would be the one word I would use to describe the sudden shift to online learning during the Coronavirus epidemic. The university understood that in order to make ""distance learning"" work that they would have to become flexible, and this approach to online classes paid dividends in the end. Given the short amount of time professors had to adjust to distance learning, they really did a phenomenal job teaching. I actually feel that, given the circumstances, I well this semester because the professors made it a point to be as accessible as possible in order to help everyone through this unprecedented process. I am considering taking online classes at SHU in the future simply due to the fact that they really have it down pat. Would highly recommend the online program to anyone interested!"
Freshman,5,I loved the Chapel and the warm welcome that I received from all the students and the staff. The classes were very beautiful and they were easy to navigate.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a rising sophomore, here at SHU. I am African-American and commute rather than live on campus (I live 10 minuets away). I absolutely enjoy everything about this school! The staff, faculty, administration are all so welcoming. They are very helpful and want the very best or you. I appreciate all of the friends I have made and relationships I have built here. They are becoming more diverse each year. Overall, you form a family and grow to love it here."
Freshman,5,I like the campus. It is very modern and they are currently building new dorms and dining halls. The professors are very nice and DR.P does a lot for us students and really cares. There is always something happening on campus and everyone is very nice. SHU is constantly expanding and is currently in the process of building a hockey arena on west campus and a parking garage for students on the main campus. The food at linda's is very good however the food at 63's is not very good. JP's is by far the best dining at SHU. SHU has also a bought a theater in downtown Fairfield for the theater arts program.
Freshman,5,It's a very nice college with nice people in it.  The college looks well done and created perfectly. The college has a lot of good features in it.
Freshman,5,Sacred Heart University is best described as a hidden gem. I had never heard of the school but upon seeing it and experiencing an overnight I knew I belonged here. I am confident that the education I receive will be an excellent investment for my future !!!
Sophomore,5,"Overall, Sacred Heart is a terrific University that I am proud to attend. This college is constantly upgrading itself and has impressed me with the amount of constant care given by the staff there. They have a new athletic building new dorms and are even building a new parking garage, what else could you ask for?"
Sophomore,5,"Sacred Heart was my first choice and is the perfect school for me!! I love the campus, greek life, classes and professors.  The dorms so far have been clean and perfect for me."
Niche User,5,"Sacred Heart is by far the best school I have ever seen, all the staff, professors, students and admissions make you feel so welcomed. The campus is beautiful and offers a variety of sports and extra curricular for everyone."
Works Here,5,"Sacred Heart has done nothing but impress me over the years.  the academic buildings are state of the art, the dorms are immaculate and nothing like dorms at other schools, and food and amount of dining options surpases all our competitors."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Scared Heart was very memorable because it was above and beyond. Everyone was helpful and answered all my questions. The overall, school was very nice. The environment was relaxing but not boring. The campus was very relaxing and extremely heartfelt. I had a really. good connection when I got there and when I left."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience in undergrad at Sacred Heart University. It's a school that really takes good care of its alumni, and really cares about their students. I even met my fiance there!"
Freshman,5,"At Sacred Heart, everyone is welcome. You truly have a home at SHU always. Here, it’s almost impossible to never be happy. The professors, the students, and President Petillo are the nicest people you will ever meet. What I would like to see change is the class selection. Although there are many classes that you have the option to take, there could be more diverse courses. Overall, i’m so happy I get to spend the next four years here and I am proud to be a Pioneer!"
Freshman,5,"I am at Sarced Heart now, and I feel like I'm at home. It is amazing that I can walk on campus and everyone is so nice and helpful. I feel like I never left my hometown. At this time I wouldn't change anything."
Senior,5,Sacred Heart is unlike any other university in the country! Take one step onto campus and you’ll know exactly what I mean! Everyone here genuinely wants to be here.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Sacred Heart University. From the first open house my mom knew it would be the one for me and she was right. SHU offers so many opportunities and resources ranging from academics to student life. The Sacred Heart community is so welcoming and I could not imagine myself anywhere else.
Graduate Student,5,Great community with dedicated professors and small class sizes.  Campus continues to open new innovative facilities.
Sophomore,5,"I like that there is plenty of help with tutors, professors and the library.  The professors genuinely want to see you succeed and pass the courses.  The summer sessions have smaller class sizes, which is a better environment to learn in."
Freshman,5,An amazing school with tons of updates! It’s growing tremendously and has up to date modern features! Just purchased GE headquarters to help expand their college!
Freshman,5,"As a freshman. I love the school close to NYC and great town. School
Is helpful love it so far. Lots of clubs. Greek life too. Professors are helpful too"
Sophomore,5,"Sacred Heart is a great school with a nice campus, new buildings. It has supportive professors. It is a smaller size school, with approx 1300 students per grade. Great student body, friendly."
Niche User,5,This college is very friendly and has new buildings to suit each of the students. I visited my friend here and I felt very safe. The students that she is friends with are very friendly and made me feel welcomed. The food is delicious and the dorms are a good size.
Freshman,5,"Our Nursing program is what Sacred Heart University is known for. We have an increasing reputation for the Business program. 
The staff is great, they make us want to push ourselves. There are resources all over campus. If you need help signing up for classes anyone will help. All students seem to care for one another, it's a door-holding community. Everyone here wants us to succeed. 

SHU is my home!"
Freshman,4,"I have taken some classes online.  As difficult as online learning is, the professors here are definitely great at communicating via email and the use of our learning website, Blackboard.  Ive had a positive experience with my online learning."
Junior,4,"Sacred Heart is a constantly growing and evolving campus. Overall, its a fantastic place to go if you're looking to get a solid education, get involved, and have a fantastic undergrad experience!"
Alum,4,"I took a few online classes during my time at Sacred Heart University and they were very on top of things. Professors assigned projects or papers on a weekly basis and were very receptive to all our questions, whether through email or office hours. Because there weren't very many classes offered online during my time there, it was more of a niche and very convenient for my lifestyle and responsibilities."
Alum,4,I loved my experience at Sacred Heart University. The education I received has helped advance my current career in ways I coud have never imagined. Different professors assisted me in finding great internships and opportunities along the way.
Alum,4,"I only took a couple but they were decent. I think professors could have been more flexible but overall no complaints. I  had a full time internship my senior year and SHU accommodated my internship and prioritized my classes all online, which was very helpful."
Alum,4,Sacred heart is a very great school but a couple of things need to be done to make the student life great
Sophomore,4,It was difficult but the professors made everything easier. We were all new to the learning process but we did it together and that's what made it easier to finish off the school year because the students really had to work with the professors.
Sophomore,4,"In 10-15 years, SHU will be among the top colleges in the northeast. I'm not talking about ""Ivy"" status, but they are certainly on track to become one of the premier Catholic universities in New England, and rising admission standards are proof of that. Sure, they may have some stiff competition, but with the rapid expansion and renovation of the campus going on, they'll eventually stand out as a university. They'll eventually be in the same conversation as say BC or Providence College. 

For the time being, however, keep in mind that attending SHU right now means you're caught in the middle of this expansion process. Be prepared to face constant construction, structural changes, and a growing student population (meaning less on-campus housing available). The education is still great, as are the professors, and most certainly a degree from SHU will appreciate in value over time. If you have this mentality going in, you most certainly will have a much better appreciation for SHU."
Freshman,4,"the number of clubs and activities available make it easy for you to make friends and get involved. The professors are nice and make plenty of opportunities to help improve your grade and or help you succeed. The food is pretty decent, the dorms are decent, although the Toussaint hall is very very nice. the sports are pretty great, the greek life campus is fun and open to everyone, especially Kappa Alpha Theta. All in All, great job SHU we love you."
Junior,4,"It is a very close community, however, there is not a lot to do especially on the weekends. There are also a lot of academic resources for those struggling."
Freshman,4,I love this university and how they are constantly improving the campus. The university offers so much to the students for educational opportunities and extracurriculars.
Freshman,4,"Everyone is very nice and helpful! I feel at home on the campus and like I can go to anyone for help and advice on something. The professors, coaches, and other administration there are amazing  and understanding of all problems. They will do anything to insure you do your best. One of the things I would change would be the parking situation. Freshman are not allowed to hav e cars if they live on campus and I feel that makes it very difficult for them."
Freshman,4,"Sacred Heart University is very welcoming to their students. There are many events at the school.. helping the students stay  working rather than being bored in their dorm. It's a great school overall, but the problem is the price tag that comes with it."
Sophomore,4,"Sacred Heart Univeristy has provided their students with one of the best faculty to student connections, in regards to the other universities that I have looked into. Sacred Heart University is comprised of many small class sizes to provide the best one-on-one relationships with the professors. Along with many positive aspects of the Univeristy, I would like to change the registration process that the school provides. With many students striving for space in their desired class, I believe that the University should adjust their program by allowing student with jobs and families of their own to be prioritized in the process."
Freshman,4,"Sacred Heart has amazing teachers who really care about your success at the school. The classes are interesting yet challenging enough that you learn. The atmosphere is inviting and inclusive, everyone has a place on campus. I will say that financial aid is one of the more challenging aspects of the school."
Sophomore,4,"As I first visited the campus I fell in love, it is a beautiful campus but small in size which you realize once you are in school for a while. The academics and professors are great and so are the coaches (if you play a sport) The food is okay but the school is a little over priced."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Sacred Heart University because when I first got onto the campus, everyone was extremely welcoming, and they made it a point to ask if anything was needed. The campus was large enough that you had different things to do and places to study, yet it was small enough that you wouldn't get lost or forget where you are. One of the things that the school needs to work on, is the amount of housing that they have and the amount of parking on campus. The class size, each year, keeps getting larger and larger and they don’t seem to have the housing, that they guarantee for four years, available to even the sophomore and junior class. The parking on campus also greatly needs to be expanded because most of the time you are left driving around the campus for an hour, looking for an open spot."
Junior,4,"Some of the teachers are good but the adjunct teachers are terrible and rude. The location of the campus is very good. The food, however, is very bad and makes you sick. The fees such as your major fee and sports fee.  they are terrible i don't play sports but have to pay 135 each year which is dumb"
Sophomore,4,"We have the average spread of professors and academics alike, but a truly great professor can really make the class, and luckily we have plenty of those. On campus, the dining options are decent, and the diner on campus is great food, despite the lacking service. There is not much to do on campus normally, but the Uber drivers love us because there is so much to do in downtown Fairfield, and on the weekends there are always parties just off campus that people go to and have fun with. Overall though, what really makes the University is the people, since there truly are so many great people and lively characters on and around campus."
Sophomore,4,I overall enjoy being a student at Sacred heart University. The teachers and the staff are very kind and helpful. The campus always looks clean. The students are  polite and you can see that they do love the university.
Graduate Student,4,"Sacred Heart University invites students into a small tight knit community feel. On this campus, there are endless opportunities to get involved in organizations that foster leadership skills. In addition to great extra curricular activities, each member of the faculty and staff go above and beyond for their students. I believe this coincides with the small community environment. Each professor I have come across has genuinely wanted the best for their students. One thing that I would change about SHU is the limited amount of scholarships offered to graduate students in need."
Freshman,4,I loved the family atmosphere that I felt as soon as I arrived on campus. It was an easy adjustment regarding fitting in since there are so many different faces to meet. Finding yourself is easy here!
Freshman,4,"As a commuter, I've been concerned about a harder time finding friends, being treated differently, or fearing of missing out. SHU taught me that the difference between me and someone who dorms is where we sleep. I have been accepted by an overwhelming amount of students who are now my friends, and by being involved in many clubs such as soccer, Love your Melon, and Students Nursing Association. Professors take pride in their lectures of teaching and do anything they can to help you pass class. The school provides a plethora of tutors that you can meet up with for free! If struggling with a paper, you can send it to online writing lab where another professor can look at it and provide advice to edit it before the it’s due! The best place to eat is Lindas, where you have meals ranging from burgers to salads to personal pizzas and sandwiches. Everything on campus is within walking distance. There is always some fun activities going on throughout the day on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I like the academics at Sacred Heart overall but the deans need to look at each professor and check to see if they are still fit to teach a course. I do not like how every year they have less and less housing options for students and it is almost impossible to get an on campus parking pass, even as an upper classman."
Sophomore,4,"To be completely honest, when I first arrived at Sacred Heart I was skeptical. However, what everyone tells you is true: you get in what you put out. By getting involved in just a couple things on campus your experience is exponentially better, and when you make an effort to connect with professors and other faculty they are very helpful."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the way that the Sacred Heart University teaches us to be a great profissional in our area, but I think they need to improve the interaction between the students and also improve its relationship with the international students, because the university give no attention to that type of student, and the international student need its atention because their families are so far away, so they miss this presence on their lifes, so i think the school should give more attention to this type of student, because they dont know anyone here and until get into the community here, they need the attention of the school to enter in the place of that."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the school is very well rounded and I don't have major complaints as far as my academic experience. I was given valuable resources for academic aid such as the OWL which pointed out flaws in my papers before I submitted them to get the best grade possible. The staff was also super helpful and where always willing to dedicate extra office hours if a concept wasn't understood. The social experience was also great as there where plenty of organized events run by students and the school. My overall experience could've been better if there was more diversity among the students and if all of the professors where equally great in assisting students understand the learned material."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my first year at Sacred Heart University. I think that it being a Division 1 school in sports makes the sporting games more intense and fun to watch. They have awesome opportunities for the students whether its a sport, greek life, clubs, or activities. Something I would change about Sacred Heart University is the timing of the dining halls. I sometimes had class until 8 o'clock and since the dining halls closed at 8 I was unable to eat dinner. Since I was a freshman with no car, it was very difficult to get food on those days."
Junior,4,"Iv'e been at SHU for about two years now. I played on the Men's Rugby team for one year as well. The professors aren't the greatest, some can be, but others you are better off getting extra help. The social life is okay. I made a decent amount of friends but the school is very clique like, so it can be a bit difficult at times. Overall it's a decent school, nice and small, with a beautiful campus."
Niche User,4,Sacred Heart has a beautiful campus and has a large diversity of majors. The University is well run and would be a great choice of schools a student to choose this university.
Niche User,4,"I have not started the Family Nurse Practitioner program yet. I am planning to start Fall 2018. However, so far I have had a great experience with professors from my interview."
Freshman,4,Its a nice school. Very modern and developing fast. For me the first year was mostly highschool review but this is because I went to a very good private highschool. Otherwise the academics are good. The professors  are very nice and you can do research with them. The people are super friendly and there are a lot of amazing people. There are always events going on and greek life is pretty big.
Niche User,4,Sacred Heart is a lively and friendly community. Their facilities are unbeatable and the campus is incredibly well-maintained.
Sophomore,4,"Since I have been a student a sacred heart univiersry the school has done nothing but impress me, I have been here for two years and they have added a new business building, new health science building, two new dorm buildings , a diner and are in the process to building a new gym. The classes are small which means the professors know each student they are teaching and they are very approachable with any questions."
Niche User,4,Really nice campus full of friendly faces. Help is always available and there are always things to do
Sophomore,4,"My time at St Vincents College has been considerably one of my most valuable experiences. It has provided me with the right tools I need to sharpen my skills in my field of choice (Nursing).  There has been many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my crafts as a result of my time in school, and for that I am truly grateful. For example, the assistance provided during clinicals from all the nurses has been remarkable—allotting us students all that they know in attempts to create the best future nurses. If anything can change, I would like to eventually see more professors teaching here at this school. For what the school has, they do an awesome job. However, if provided more staff, it will reduce the stress load drastically which will create an even better environment overall. Ultimately, I’ve come to find out that going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree and the college you attend truly does matter."
Freshman,4,I like how everyone is friendly and how they make you feel comfortable. All the professors are great and super helpful.
Junior,4,It is a beautiful Campus with a large amount of clubs and organizations to join. You should never be bored with all that the school offers as far as retreats and activities. Aside being very expensive it is a beautiful private school and you get out of it what you put into it as far as participation and social life.
Niche User,4,"Sacred Heart University is a beautiful campus with kind and caring people who are interested in you succeeding. While it is a Catholic university, there are multiple religions represented in this campus."
Alum,4,"Ended up with a job. Location is decent. Athletics is getting better. Dean's office is pretty bad. Business school is getting a lot better and the professors are great there.  Wish they'd skip the core, especially for students who know what they want to do and don't want to waste time ""finding themselves"" and answering existential questions."
Junior,4,The school is in a downtown rural area. Professors are well educated. Tuition and financial aide are pricey but the education and connection to the hospital are great.
Graduate Student,4,"SHU was the perfect college for a student like me. I remember touring campus I LOVED how everything seemed so close and personal. Professors get to know their students by name, since classes are only about 30 kids tops. However the university is going through a lot of growth over the past 4 years I've been here, and I don't really know what direction it is heading in. Overall, the campus is beautiful and there are always student events on campus to keep everyone involved."
Freshman,4,"I love it here at SHU. So far my college experience has been amazing. The reason I did not give it five stars is because sometimes the food isn't that great in the buffet style dining hall, and there is not much diversity in the people who attend the school."
College Junior,4,Online courses are very time cosuming however they work well into ones schedule.  There is a lot of self teaching witih online courses
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus but like anything else should always go out in pairs or threes always better to be safe than sorry.
College Freshman,4,The Varsity Sports are big at my school. But Their Club Sports are Just as Big. Its great that There is an option to continue to do a sport I love and to have the pressure of a D1 sport. Also intramural is great for the player who just wants to stay involved and active.
College Freshman,4,The best part of this school is how welcome they make everyone feel and that they are really involved in giving back to their community. They have a great community service program.
College Freshman,4,"I personally will not be housing due to the fact that it is very expensive and my family can't afford it. However during orientation, it made me realize how much I would be missing out on. Not only on having independence but on meeting so many different people and experiencing college so differently."
College Freshman,4,"They are very involved with the SHU community, and do a lot for their philanthropy."
College Freshman,4,"They are very engaging throughout the admission process. Along with orientation, they were very welcoming"
College Junior,4,Be nice to the professors and they will be nice to you
College Junior,4,"If you live in one of the new dorms it's great. Even if you don't they can be fun. There are lots of options, it's really personal preference"
College Sophomore,4,I love sacred heart so much my only issue is the price. it is extremely expensive and sometimes they aren't the best with financial aid.
College Sophomore,4,a lot of people i know have recieved jobs right after graduating
College Sophomore,4,I loved living in jhill its the best dorm i wish i could live there forever
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love this school but I wish it wasn't as expensive.
College Sophomore,4,Transferring my high school credits here was simple. The biggest frustration is trying to get a hold of financial aid.
College Sophomore,4,The degree from this school is the most important thing for me. I have a sense of pride when I can say I graduated from St. Vincent's.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing! They are all very educated in the field they are teaching (e.g., maternity, psych, etc). The class sizes are small, which is perfect for me. The professors really get to know their students. We are not just names to them."
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed how much general education classes are online. It makes nursing school that much easier because your time is focused on the in-class nursing classes. The workload is not too bad. Studying is what takes up most of my time.
Senior,2,"I can't recommend SHU. As a Theatre major, I have been left wondering why I didn't transfer three years ago to a school with a good program. Currently, the theatre program at Sacred Heart has stagnated and is poorly organized. There are essentially no technical courses (lighting, costume, etc.) and there have been no attempts to expand the class offerings. There are still only two concentrations: ""Musical Theatre"" and ""Acting,"" so don't hope to develop any other skill. Although the professors are quite knowledgable and likable, they are not given enough resources with which to work. There are very, very few networking opportunities offered by the University. When there are chances, preferential treatment on the part of higher-ups ensures only select students get to benefit. As a student, you will be told about ""all the great opportunities our growing program has to offer."" This is a lie, whether they are aware of it or not."
Freshman,2,"I'm limited to 1000 characters, but I could elaborate far past that. Here are the condensed reasons why Sacred Heart is a poor school in comparison to other local colleges/universities:
1. Poor return on investment; limited alumni network and few career connections.
2. CLIQUES; did not expect social cliques after high school, least of all at a mid-sized university. Student Gov, Res Life, and student admissions workers are some of the biggest cliques on campus. 
3. PARTY SCHOOL; parties throughout the week, easy access to hard drugs (and I mean hard drugs) and alcohol, will need to party to fit in unfortunately.
4. Student population dominated by New York/New Jersey students. If you are not from Long Island, Westchester County, North Jersey, you will NOT fit in. CT students will ironically feel out of place at an in-state school.

Save your money and go to a public school!"
Senior,2,"SHU is so damn expensive that it negates everything good about the school. They overcharge for absolutely everything throughout the 4 years. Tuition and every other fee goes up dramatically every year without financial aid increasing as well. Senior week is 600+ dollars, something that is free or significantly cheaper at other schools. Parking is expensive yet impossible to find. Housing is not great either. There aren’t many options for social life on the weekends unless you’re 21+ and willing to take a far uber ride."
Junior,2,poor management of the school and the professors are pretty awful. I would not recommend this school to anybody else. I definitely regret going to this school.
Freshman,2,"Professors are really nice and willing to help, although academics are not very challenging. The location of the school is suburban and there are not many things to do near by. The people on campus are overalls very nice and welcoming and the campus is very pretty there just isn't much to do."
Sophomore,2,Sacred Heart is a pretty good school but their academics are overrated and the price is way too high for the worth of the degree. As a commuter there are not many things to do and as a minority there are not many other people I can relate to. The diversity sucks here. All the Fraternities and Sororities are predominately white.
College Freshman,2,"I don't know too much about Greek life on campus because it's just not a huge deal here. Many of the people involved are fairly nice and usually let most people into their parties, when they throw them."
College Freshman,2,"Our teams are pretty decent while being in a low Division 1 conference. It should be exciting as most of our teams have a fair amount of success, however, no one goes to games, supports the teams, and when people are around there is no sense of pride in the community. There is never chants or excitement in the crowd. It would almost be more enjoyable to watch the game from home."
College Sophomore,2,The students are all very similar at the school and there re not a lot of different types of people here.
College Junior,2,"Varsity sports are not treated equally. Some sports receive more funding than others even when they continue to perform poorly. Athletic facilities are extremely inadequate and do not provide enough workout (gym) equipment availability to more than one varsity at a time. Also, varsity teams must share the same gym with club-sport athletes as well as the rest of the student body."
College Sophomore,2,"sacred heart needs another gym. Not that I have anything against sharing the athlete gym with the outside world, it is just not big enough for everyone. there is minimal play forms, and it is hard to get through a full college workout when there are 6 athletes to one platform. A new gym is a must"
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is a jerk to everyone, they do not care what you have to say and snap at you and do not treat you like a person but a number and a billing statement. You are only money in their pockets."
College Freshman,2,Usually can't get in. The parties are only ever good on Thursday so if you have a Friday morning class you are screwed.
College Freshman,2,"Not many options unless you're in a frat or on a meat-head sports team (rugby, football, wrestling)"
College Senior,2,"Not too many scholarship opportunities. I will be graduating with insane amounts of loans. If you dont have the money saved up, don't count on very much scholarship money. Be prepared to take out loans"
College Senior,2,"While the actual dorm building are new/renovated and very clean, there is very few housing. Most kids have to find off-campus housing on their own"
College Sophomore,2,"Wouldn't recommend living off campus. Not as safe, it's more expensive, you won't be able to drive to campus cause there is no parking, landlords are charging more since many people are trying to find houses"
College Sophomore,2,I am constantly battling with financial aid. Both of my parents are deceased so I really struggle trying to pay for school. Financial aid doesn't do anything to help my situation
College Sophomore,2,there are some nice places however they are expensive for the most part. Plenty availabilities however money is a high issue.
College Senior,2,"Places are far away from campus, and at night is dangerous to go out to find a decent place to eat at a reasonable price."
College Senior,2,People are pretty judgmental about other cultures.  Sadly there is no room for opportunities.
College Senior,2,"I think they can do better in the price.  I mean…Ge"" we are students, we should pay like 3-4 dollars for lunch and not $9"
College Senior,2,Ugly places around college.  Sad
College Junior,2,Did not provide financial aid for my post-bacc program and kept my refund money until I called specifically asking for it.
College Freshman,2,If you find your friends you can have a good time once and a while but it is def not worth the money.
College Freshman,2,Its 70% girls and 30% boys.  Its all rich catholic kids and majority athletes.  Almost no diversity and the diverse are cliquey.  Extremely republican if you like Obama and are pro-gun control teachers and students will shun you.
College Freshman,2,63s ruined my digestive system.  I usually don't eat because if I do I will be on the toilet for at least an hour. The other option is Linda's which is better but extremely overprices and the options never change.  So after your there for like a month its boring to eat there.
College Freshman,2,Its a joke. Its just a giant clique that steals your money.
College Freshman,2,Extremely unclear to declare and they make you take BS core classes so its hard to get all the pre-recs you need so people get stuck with horrible schedules because there are too many pre-recs.
College Freshman,2,Right near Bridgeport so its always sketchy and not fun to go out.  There is a Trumbull mall which is ok but gets boring fast.  If you don't have a car leaving campus is not worth it.
College Freshman,2,It is really cold and windy from november to end of april.
College Freshman,2,Everything looks good but once you use it sucks.
College Freshman,2,Classes are too easy and do not prepare you for what you want to major and teachers are pretty poor.
College Freshman,2,Barely any house parties. If there is a house party it gets busted in less than 20 minutes. Most students go to bars. Everything is off campus so you either need someone to drive you or take a cab.
College Sophomore,2,"Headline in the newspaper 2012: SACRED HEART IS THE MOST UNAFFORDABLE SCHOOL IN THE NATION. Not joking, it was in the paper. With this being said, no Sacred Heart is not generous with their scholarships. I graduated with a high GPA from high school and entered college with no merrit scholarship. They really don't tell you many options for grants and scholarships unless you are part of a sports team, or you directly go to financial aid. Do NOT attempt to call financial aid, just go straight to their office and ask for a financial adivsor. They are more than willing to help out there, but over the phone they come off as rude sometimes."
College Freshman,2,They are either bitches or douche bags.
College Freshman,2,No one pays attention to most athletics here because the teams are not awesome
College Sophomore,2,they dont give much academic
College Junior,2,"The transportation at school consists of the shuttle.  If you need to call a cab you do it by yourself, the school is no help.  The shuttle is not convenient, you never know when it will arrive.  There are also not enough shuttles running.  There is no cost to ride the shuttle.  If you have to go long-distance it is nice to have a car, if not a friend that has a car, otherwise you have to call a cab."
College Junior,2,"I do not like the Greek life.  I feel the sororities are fake and there is a saying that many people use, ""I am not paying for friends.""  It is very expensive to join Greek life and some people can't put up that money.  There is no Greek housing available.  If the guys or girls want to live together then just like everyone else they form a small group and look for a house.  When the fraternities or sororities have a formal there is absolutely nothing to do because many people will be at the formal.  However, even when a fraternity or sorority has a party they usually only let in other fraternities and sororities, they do not let in non-Greek members.  Some non-Greek students like the Greek students."
College Junior,2,"The campus is very strict.  This school is not fun and you are most definitely not allowed to have any parties in the  dorms or you will all get written up, that is not only including the freshmen dorms, that is for all of the school's housing.  There are barely any house parties and when there is a party going on they will get broken up and then your night is ruined.  Only when you are 21 is it more fun because you can actually go out.  I prefer to go home because there is nothing to do at school.  You usually look forward to going out on a Friday night, but here that is not the case.  We do not even have a college town, the closest thing we have is Fairfield town but that is really Fairfield University's town.  They are also strict with parking, they ticket students all of the time if they are parked where they should not be.  However, this school does not give us much of a choice because there is not enough parking for all of the students which leads to students being late to class.  No matter how early you leave, you are lucky if you find a spot.  Also, trying to park to go to the gym is a nightmare.  If I could choose all over again, I would not have come to Sacred Heart."
College Sophomore,2,"The classes and professors are some of the best but otherwise this school is boring. There is nothing to do on the weekends, and most people either commute or transfer after their first year."
College Sophomore,2,programs are so hard to stay in the school kicks everyone out so easily
College Student,2,"People are unfriendly here. The campus is very pretty but there's an unwelcoming atmosphere, especially if you didn't make a solid group of friends the first week."
College Freshman,2,The shuttles are never on time and make too many spots to go to one specific area.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not much to look at, let's just say that."
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the girls and guys just want attention
College Sophomore,2,There are a majority of white people here
College Sophomore,2,"When it snows, it's really bad. And when it's icy, it's worse"
College Freshman,2,"never go off campus, no way to get there"
College Freshman,2,half the time the shuttles are never on time or the GPS for them don't work
College Freshman,2,I was screwed out of the program after I was accepted
College Freshman,2,"Too much snow! I am not used to a lot of snow, but it gets really deep and really cold at Sacred Heart. It doesn't affect my campus experience in a negative way, because I would just play in the snow with some friends."
College Freshman,2,"The bar in the area has been shut down for allowing underage college students to purchase alcohol. The parties in the area of campus mostly get shut down. There are no parties allowed in the dorms. To enjoy the nightlife, you would have to go to a different city to go to the clubs or a rave, or maybe another University where it is accepted."
College Freshman,2,"The workload is laughable, the classes might as well be taught out of a textbook. There are mediocre job/internship opportunities. All of the ""work studies"" are minimum wage and god-awful hours and only a few hours a week."
College Freshman,2,"Very high parking costs, the school has a great shortage of spaces"
College Freshman,2,"Terrible campus housing, filthy dorms, poor overall experience. "
College Freshman,2,Typical new england weather with the addition of a great deal of rain and freezing rain as well as copious amounts of ice in the winter time.
College Freshman,2,There is mostly fast food surrounding the campus and limited options at that.
College Junior,2,not as efficient as I would like them to be.
Junior,1,"Please reconsider.... There is staff that truly care and then you have those who dont. (clinical instructors, such as Cometa, goes above and beyond for her student) instructors on the other half when it comes to lectures are clueless, like Petrokpa and aldo Professor L. They read off powerpoints and never have an answer for their students. Quizzes and Exams are made by other instructors, you will never know what to review. Everything is all over the place and its take more time teaching ourselves the materials. This place is expensive and you get terrible lectures. Save your money and go else where. Its not worth it here."
Niche User,1,"Awful experience. 

Potemkin Village of Educational Institution.  

Very concerned about the value of the diploma/degree from this school and how it will be perceived in job market."
Sophomore,1,"Biggest mistake of my life going here. For the amount of money you pay you would think they would take care of the mold problem BEFORE students moved in. I lived in scholars commons and there was so much mold that we had to remove our belongings out of our room and wait hours for someone to clean it. When I first moved in our couch was so moldy that they had to give us a new one. The parking here is ridiculous for both on and off-campus students. Public safety does tickets you regardless of the situation. I bought a $250 decal for scholars commons and people park there with unregistered vehicles. This means they get ticketed or don't, never pay, and I have to find a different place to park. Everytime I would have to do this, boom another ticket. I explained multiple times that there was no spots because people who are not suppose to park there are taking them. Each time they would deny my appeal. How else would they get enough money to build all these new buildings."
Senior,1,"Worst college experience! Professors do not care and cannot teach because they don't understand the material themselves! Everything is superficial and aesthetic! Very unsafe campus! Do not believe the security lies! The dorms/bathrooms are never cleaned like they claim and students are always sick because of the sanitary issues! Parking is severely inadequate! They do not run enough classes for students to fulfill their major'requirements, so no such thing as true accelerated programs or pre-acceptance into grad programs."
Freshman,1,This school is very cliquey it reminds me of high school. It lacks diversity and school spirit and most of the kids are stuck up and rich.
College Freshman,1,Almost every employee has a horrible attitude with the students especially in the cafeterias. The admissions people were very good but then disappeared entirely once enrolled. The cleaning women are the nicest people in the world and probably the only nice people on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Despite what they say during the whole admissions process, it is not a campus filled with various types of people. Every one is from Long Island and if you are not, it is really hard to make friends. Also, SHU said it is very easy to get involved in intramurals, clubs, and with people in general. The intramurals are barely existent, clubs are limited and while some are very appealing to some, there is not a lot of options for all people. They do not run many quality events for the student body either. My main problem is the lack of school spirit. Many people are vastly unhappy with the school and the negativity is contagious and most people complain of how unhappy the environment is, making Sacred Heart an uncomfortable place to live. Classes and teachers are good and i feel the education is very good, however, it is just unbearable to live for a week, let alone 4 years."
College Freshman,1,"Scholarships are really only given for athletics and none for academic success, a campus runs on academics. The heavy value placed on the athletic department is upsetting."
College Junior,1,"SHU will not help you at all. I was put in a very tough family situation where I now have to pay 100% for my own school and they didn't give me one cent. Do not go to this school if you are in anyway need of financial aid they will ask for documents that are not even necessary and make trying to even apply for aid or an appeal near impossible. Once I sent them all the documents they asked for they then said ""Oh you didn't even need to send these documents...There this nothing we can do to help you we have used the rest of our money for students who applied sooner."" Well I applied as soon as I could and because they have little to no grasp of how to perform their jobs the process was prolonged to the point where there was no more money left for me even though I desperately needed it. I'm transferring after the next semester and will be saving a lot of money going to a much better school who have already agreed to give me four times the amount SHU did."
College Sophomore,1,"the registration is horrible, never enough room in the class you need"
College Freshman,1,No parties on campus.  Parties alway get blown up by 11 because the campus knows where all the house are they patrol the houses and call the cops if there are parties.  The school called the cops and shut down multiple bars because they were serving alcohol to underage student.  The school just wants everyone to jump around in bouncy houses and play bingo
College Freshman,1,No spots ever and they lots that are open are never open because the school decides to always hot events in parking lots and move all the cars to another parking lot which is full when the other parking lot it open
College Freshman,1,"I have more freedom at home.  ResLife searches your bag all the time.  Any noise you get a knock on the door, if it smells like weed they search rooms. It feels like a prison."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible!!!!! House parties always get broken up, all the clubs are in New Haven which is a half an hour away.  To get there you have to take a shuttle to the train station, train to New Haven, taxi to the club.  Then the trains don't run on the way back so you have to pay $60+ for a taxi back to school. This is why I don't like staying on the weekends"
College Freshman,1,hate snow but its fun at at times
College Freshman,1,its so confusing and doesn't make any sense
College Freshman,1,"The athletic center looks like it is from a 1970's sports movie. The weights are ancient, rusted and falling apart.  "
College Freshman,1,"I was a honors student coming from a very prestigious, esteemed prep school and yet received very little financial aid. The tuition is ridiculously, almost laughably high for such an awful educational institution.  "
College Freshman,1,"There is no campus police. However, there are far too many security guards that are improperly trained for disasters carrying only flashlights and a walkie talkie. The health center is appointment only, no walk-ins. There is no doctor and one nurse part time, the rest are student nurse- practitioners. "
College Freshman,1,"The only attractions are a sparse few ""dive"" bars that students seldom go to and overall the local city does not welcome the students from sacred heart graciously."

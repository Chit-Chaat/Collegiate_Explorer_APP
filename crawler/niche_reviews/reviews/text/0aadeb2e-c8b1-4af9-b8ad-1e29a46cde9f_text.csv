Senior,5,Took a database class in 2007.  The professor was very great!! It was a very interesting subject to complete my degree program!!!

Alum,5,"Tulane was the perfect place for me. I loved the extracurriculars offered, my professors, and the individuality of the students. Getting to go to school in the city of New Orleans made the whole experience even more unique and provided me with many more learning opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19, I finished most of my second semester classes online. These classes were good, but were really hard in an online format. For example, taking accounting online was really difficult."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here! The people are amazing and the classes are great. The new Commons has great food. The clubs are the best, there is always something to do."
Junior,5,"I have loved Tulane since the very first time I laid eyes on the school. The college experience found at this university is unlike like anywhere else. The campus itself is stunning and the academics are excellent. The students are intelligent and have well-balanced lives. The weather is beautiful and the campus is always overwhelmingly green (in the best way possible!). New Orleans is a diverse, culturally rich, unique and extremely fun city. There is not one weekend that goes by where I feel bored or wonder what I should do next. In fact, there are usually too many events happening where I leave the weekend wishing I could’ve fit it all in. I couldn’t be more proud of the university I attend and am so grateful for my life-changing time at Tulane."
Senior,5,Professors adjusted well and included syllabus changed. School could have better accommodated various time zones
Senior,5,Great sports scene! Love the city! Love the classes! Transferred to the right place for sure. Also the warm weather is a plus
Junior,5,"Tulane is fabulous. I love the professors and academic opportunities. The university is also located in a gorgeous part of New Orleans and there are lots of opportunities to get involved in the city. The campus is pretty and very walkable. It's an expensive school, but there is a lot of institutional support for students."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so welcoming and friendly. Environment is so lively. The city is beautiful. The students and faculty genuinely love this place, and it shows."
Niche User,5,"Tulane's campus is just about the most beautiful campus I've ever seen. Following my tour, I went to talk to an admissions counselor and he was incredibly helpful with my questions about being deferred from early action, merit based aid I could receive, and any additional information I could provide to the university that might make me a better candidate. I ended up being put on the waitlist in early marsh, and I once again reached out to the admissions faculty. They were helpful and understanding. I ended up not only being accepted off the waitlist, but I also received a VERY generous merit scholarship and will be attending in the fall! Roll Wave!"
Freshman,5,I’m infatuated with the culture of New Orleans but mostly Tulane as a whole. Academically TU is an amazing school with an inviting and unique environment that is unlike any college in America.  Socially the options are unmatched in one of the best party areas in the world. In every facet Tulane has impressed me.
Senior,5,"Tulane is an amazing school filled with incredibly smart, multifaceted students. It offers the opportunity to fully experience the ""fun"" side of college, while still being extremely academically rigorous and requires an immense amount of effort if you want to do well (academically). New Orleans is also an absolutely incredible place to be able to attend school. The professors are absolutely amazing and intelligent and if you put in the work, it will be absolutely worth it post graduating. I love Tulane so much and wouldn't have wanted to attend school anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here and could not love it more. The campus is beautiful and close-knit, the classes are small enough to build good relationships with friends and professors, there are always research opportunities and it's easy to get involved on campus."
Sophomore,5,Tulane is unbelievable. Best time of my life.  I could not imagine going to any other school. 10/10 would recommend
Freshman,5,"Tulane was and is my dream school. The education that I have begun to receive at Tulane is second to none. I love Tulane for so many reasons. I have amazing friends, committed teachers, and an environment that helps me thrive. Tulane is dedicated to helping its students achieve all that they can, and I have definitely experienced that just in this first year!"
Sophomore,5,There's no other university like Tulane. The rich New Orleans culture is so present on campus and the atmosphere is one of living life to the fullest. The students are insanely impressive and passionate but know how to balance their academics and extracurriculars with a social life.
Alum,5,"Going to Tulane wasn't my first choice, being a native New Orleanian I wanted to go out of state.  But circumstances led me to Tulane and I couldn't be happier with my choice.  New Orleans is the most European of all American cities and the food and the experience of living there as a college student is wonderful.  The professors at Tulane know you on a personal level, the small class size allows for excellent 1-on-1 learning opportunities.  There is no place like Tulane, wherever I travel around the world I wear Tulane gear and I am always recognized and told what a great school Tulane is.  The students, faculty and the staff (Housing, food services, student services, etc.) combine to make Tulane the best university in the Solar system."
Freshman,5,Really awesome experience when I visited last January. The architecture school was beautiful and the whole environment was welcoming.
Niche User,5,"Work hard, play hard type beat. Very smart kids who also know how to have fun. Use common sense and you'll thrive in this college town and college."
Alum,5,I loved Tulane! New orleans is the most fun city to go to college in and really adds diversity to the otherwise generic (student body wise) campus. The emphasis on community service and culture really help to embed the students into the city.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the unique mix of international and national students that flock to Tulane for higher learning. I have met some very interesting people of different backgrounds and cultures thanks to the extensive student network that Tulane has created.
Freshman,5,"Rich in culture, New Orleans offers students an experience unlike any other, from the jazz-filled streets to the all-popular comfort foods. The wide selection of majors and minors allows students to pursue not just one, but many of their passions. For example, the Creative Premedicine Scholars Program gives students the opportunity to major in the School of Liberal Arts while also fulfilling pre-medicine requirements. With automatic acceptance into Tulane University's School of Medicine, the program does not require students to take the MCAT. Tulane has a beautiful campus and is constantly adding to their renovations. The Commons, moreover, is an all new dining room that offers students with a wide variety of fresh, delicious food options. The dorms are a work in progress, as some are nicer than others."
Freshman,5,"I am beyond grateful that I chose this school. I can't imagine going anywhere else! In the college search process, I knew I wanted to live in a city but still have a campus to walk around. Tulane provides the perfect balance between the classic college campus vibe and the amazing city of New Orleans right outside the campus fence. Tulane in a word is: balanced. Everyone studies hard and cares a lot about their grades, but at the end of a long day of studying everyone loves to go out, whether at the fun frat parties or plethora of college bars. You'll never run out of things to do, on or off campus. The weather is great, the students are all happy and kind, and the place is always just full of good vibes. I have not met a single person who wishes they went somewhere else. If Tulane is right for you, you'll know because when you visit you'll feel the same passion for the school as every student. And if you don't feel passionate about Tulane, it's just not for you."
Freshman,5,The expierence you obtain coming to Tulane is like nothing else. It's reputation as a party school is not overwhleming to the people like me who like to study. You party as much as you want to party. It is an amazing school with amazing professors I can't wait for my next 3 years here.
Alum,5,"Tulane was one of the greatest experiences of my life. The cultures, the food, the vibe, the music, the art, and the University itself is an amazing package. Unique to the college world, Tulane is the best in my mind and always has a special place in my heart."
Sophomore,5,I love Tulane because its a wonderful chance to be in a city rich in culture as well as on a campus at a great university. I love that there are graduate programs available and amazing opportunities to contribute and get involved in the city as well as on campus.
Senior,5,I love Tulane. I have had the best experience here. It has great academics with an amazing social and cultural scene. I love that we have a campus but are still in close proximity to the city. There are lots of restaurants and bars in New Orleans and amazing music festivals. Tulane has a small class setting in the school of liberal arts so you really get to know your professors and it's a great learning environment.
Sophomore,5,Tulane provides great education as well as a great college experience. I have never felt more at home at a school. Tulane has a great balance of academics and social life.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Tulane University. Anyone there is passionate about learning and achieving their goals and all faculty are passionate about helping students achieve those goals. As long as the university continues to diversify, it will continue to be a wonderful school."
Freshman,5,"I went to Honors Weekend and everyone was very friendly and professional. I also sat in on a class and the teacher was engaging, knowledgable, and funny."
Senior,5,Tulane food gets a bad rep but the new primary dinning hall is about to me amazing!! And Tulane hillel works as a fulll restaurant and is some of the best food that you can find at any school in the usa
Niche User,5,Tulane University seems very welcoming and has extremely advanced academic programs. I am extremely interested in attending this medical school.
Freshman,5,I love Tulane and I cannot imagine myself at any other institution. The energy and spirit of New Orleans is unmatched and I am never bored. I love every pat of this city and of this school and I believe this is a once in a lifetime experience.
Freshman,5,"Contrary to what most people think, Tulane isn’t a crazy party school. The academics are tough and the professors are great and always open to hear questions."
Freshman,5,"Tulane provides an academic environment that encourages and supports students to work hard to achieve their goals. The professors are excellent, the campus is perfect, and of course, NOLA is so fun!"
Niche User,5,"While visiting everyone was very friendly and made for an incredible stay. I think for people planning to apply, there is a good chance they will get a clear idea if they visit. My visit showed me a lot about the university and made it clear to me that this was the perfect fit for me! I am so excited to be attending the school, many of the people I have met that will be in my class are very friendly and incredibly intelligent. There is also a lot of girls which is so cool! I love the liberal and open environment of the campus!"
Sophomore,5,"Tulane provides many majors and minors.  Work study they place students in a local business's that the student wants to pursue as their career.
What I want to change is they don't provide on-campus housing for transfer students.  The students are forced to rent from slumlords.  These houses are filthy, with cockroaches and other bugs."
Freshman,5,"There aren't words to explain Tulane; it truly is the most unique place in the world and I can honestly say I couldn't have chosen a better place. The social scene is amazing, absolutely nothing is exclusive and there is ALWAYS something to do. While there is always something to do there is also no pressure to go out if that isn't your style. Everything about this place is one-of-a-kind and I cannot imagine what I would feel like somewhere else. Tulane is special in a way that can't be put into words. You just have to feel it."
Senior,5,"Tulane has a variety of options for research, community service, and student organizations. There’s plenty to do both on and off campus."
Freshman,5,Tulane is awesome and an absolute party school. Kids go out on average 4 times a week and every day during syllabus week. It is normal to see the boot crowded during finals week as well.
Freshman,5,"very fun and hardworking students... play hard study hard is the unofficial motto... campus is nice and there's always something to do. if you're bored in New Orleans, it definitely isn't for you then."
Alum,5,"Going to Tulane University was a fantastic experience. The location...living in and with New Orleans for 4 years... was unique in the best possible way. You can never be bored or stop learning new things in a city like that. The school itself was challenging, beautiful and rewarding. Make sure you go on a tour if you can, the place is immaculate. It's a rare find when you can go to a school and your friends and family are entertained at the Graduation ceremony. Tulane has everything you could want in a small-ish manageable package."
Junior,5,"I am a rising junior at Tulane and thus far have had best two years of my life. I am in love with the academics, campus, and just general attitude throughout the university. I have no complaints and have held very high regard for the university and will most likely continue to do so for the next two years and years following as an alumni."
Sophomore,5,"So far, this place has been better than anything I could imagine or expect in a college experience. It's my summer going into sophomore year and I just can't wait to get back to school. There is a crowd for everyone, a major for everyone (except if you're in math), incredible staff, and a beautiful campus. Oh, and it's a f******* blast."
Sophomore,5,"Tulane University gave me the best freshman year I could've imagined. The university offers incredible professors and courses that allow you to test out your interests and explore them without being forced to commit to an area before you know you are sure. More than that, the social atmosphere is inviting and offers friends and groups for every kind of person. The city of New Orleans provides an amazing cultural and diverse setting for whatever you want to pursue."
Graduate Student,5,The knowledge of the professor in subject matter is very deep. The school value education very highly to meet each individual student needs to be successful in the classroom and beyond.
Senior,5,"There's just something different.  People are happy, not tired and grumpy like they were at other universities I've attended.  The teachers and other staff genuinely care.  I love it."
Freshman,5,"I love Tulane! It certainly is a big party school. Im sure there are other colleges that have bigger parties, but I think what makes Tulane such a party school is the frequency of going out. Typically people go out tuesday-saturday and most people come here knowing its a big party school, so everyone is always down to go out. Also greek life is pretty big here too. The frats are super fun and the sororities are very much tiered."
Senior,5,"Tulane is a wonderful college that has the perfect balance of rigorous academics and fun. Being in the heart of New Orleans offers a cultural experience like none other and the learning continues outside of the classroom. When a break is needed there's always a festival (French Quarter Fest, Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Voodoo Fest, Po-Boy Fest). The faculty really cares about student well being and feedback is translated to real change in the university."
Senior,5,"I like my major and my faculty within my major. The school is great overall, but needs to allocate more funding to science and research. Plus, a lot of students are entitled and sometimes all people care about is partying."
Niche User,5,Tulane U has been a fantastic developmental experience for me. I have learned so much about others as well as about myself.
Freshman,5,Absolutely amazing college. There is something for everyone. Real potential here for a truly transformative experience. New campaign also has potential to turn it into a top 10 school
Freshman,5,"Tulane University is an awesome school. I love the fact that I have the chance to take classes across multiple disciplines, and the emphasis on educating the whole person. The focus on public service is truly amazing, and there are a variety of opportunities to get involved with the community. The location is also a huge plus, because New Orleans is a city that is very fun to live in, and the culture is so rich. I love it at Tulane!"
Freshman,5,"I like how close it is to the city. I like the people and fun, party scene. I also like that it is still very academic and everyone I know tries hard and studies and cares. It has a good balance."
Freshman,5,"Tulane is more than the party school that it is known for. The professors are all invested in the achievements of their students, actively creating new office hours for those who need additional help. The quads and LBC are beautifully designed and energy and space efficient. The staff are all helpful and patient. 

I've never felt unsafe while on campus. There is always security biking and driving around, and I know that all residence halls have a security guard at the front desk.

I do agree with some of the other reviewers - this is a work hard, play hard type of school. Somehow, students do internships, have jobs, volunteer in the community, do well in their classes, socialize, party, exercise, and plan their future. The skills I've learned from the people at this school will certainly help me in my life."
Sophomore,5,"Great atmosphere , many activities, community service, brilliant professors, excellent advisors, love my major of neuro science !so many celebrations and resources . Beautiful campus"
Freshman,5,"If you can get over the tuition and the lack of diversity, this is a great school that is improving."
Niche User,5,"Tulane University was the most wonderful decision we have ever made.  Tulane includes the entire family in the experience.  New Orleans is the most welcoming place we have ever been.  My daughter graduated in May of 2016 with a Double Major Bachelors, with such joy and a great job waiting for her.  Roll Wave!"
Freshman,5,Tulane is a wonderful school where anyone from anywhere is readily welcomed and adds to the uniqueness of the university.
Junior,4,Tulane is a great school if you're pursuing either business or medicine. Tulane definitely needs more diversity; there is nothing but white students here on campus. The percentage of minorities here is very low.
Alum,4,"I took two classes online, both which were trauma-based. The instructions were very straight forward with videos, lectures, and articles to read."
Sophomore,4,"Once COVID-19 caused everyone to go home, nearly all of my professors were accomodating to the fact that I had to support my family by picking up two jobs (after I lost the ones on campus). Though my math professor was relatively awful, I had no worries finishing up my first year online because of how much my professors were understanding."
Sophomore,4,"I'm pretty happy with my experience so far, with academics and campus life. Though there is a lack of diversity, the multitude of multicultural organizations (at least this year) are really trying to support minority students. The most evident lack of diversity is in the socioeconomic status between students. You can find those who won't party/uber/eat out every day of the week, but they can be hard to find. However, the administration is usually pretty receptive when they're not sweeping things underneath the rug. Combined with Ivy-like academics and research opportunities, I'm not concerned about my future. We have a pretty decent alumni network and job resources when you're in school-- you just have to take the extra step."
Junior,4,"My professors were extremely flexible and understanding of the circumstances involving online learning. Some professors attempted to conduct class the exact same way over Zoom, to various levels of success, but many professors utilized other resources and were creative in making classes engaging and flexible."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy my time at Tulane University because they were generous enough to give me merit scholarship and financial aid to attend a prestigious private institution. I love the city of New Orleans, but the school lacks diversity and this causes issues, and it is very expensive and the school is not supportive of lower income students."
Alum,4,"Beautiful campus, service oriented, many courses of study to pursue- with approachable and caring professors."
Sophomore,4,"I have always loved that Tulane takes care of its students. Once students get in they really do try and make sure that they succeed as best they can. Part of that is having an incredible academic atmosphere with some of the best professors in their fields, which I am incredibly grateful for. I have found problems in Tulane's reluctance to acknowledge their faults and their privilege. There is the tendency to sweep issues under the rug to preserve their sparkling exterior. They don't want to loose donors and, I think, in the process they forget about the lives of their students, the prospectus students, and the surrounding New Orleans community."
Sophomore,4,Tulane sits in Uptown New Orleans and connects its students to the city in order to establish beneficial relationships.
Freshman,4,"Tulane University is a very good private university experience. New Orleans is a very friendly, welcoming, and historic city. This can be any type of school that you want, but it skews towards being a party school. Maybe this is just because I'm a freshman. Although there are many students that don't go out all the time, it can feel like that. There is a huge party culture. As a result, it can seem like no one really cares about academics.  The positive side to this is that it isn't a high pressure school.  You will have a happier existence than you would at UChicago or MIT."
Junior,4,"Tulane University is great academic institution. In addition to offering students an education that sets them up for success, Tulane provides numerous opportunities for students to give back to the New Orleans community. An aspect of the school that requires attention is its lack of diversity."
Niche User,4,"I attended school online and had a good experience. This was in the early days of online learning and there were no virtual classrooms.  Everything was via pre-recorded video.  However, the information I obtained continues to be relevant."
Alum,4,"Tulane combines a unique location, excellent educational resources, and a vibrant student life. The university only continues to invest in its campus, academics, and student life. As with any undergraduate education, students need to be active and make the school work for them. Depending on the department, disorganization can be a problem, but shouldn't stop an enthusiastic, proactive student"
Freshman,4,"Tulane University is a solid school. Thoughtful professors, a stunningly beautiful campus, and an overall laid-back mentality. It can also, of course, be a crazy, chaotic party school, but only if that's the side of the school you choose to pursue.

One of the most impressive things about Tulane is its willingness to acknowledge the problems it has yet to overcome: The lack of diversity, the way its party culture provides leeway for sexual assaults, and the like. The university doesn't just recognize its shortcomings, but strives to improve. And indeed, Tulane is continually on the rise, as it seems each year to bring in a more competitively-selected batch of students.

Oh, and the new dining hall? Fantastic."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed going across all the opportunities they offer to  foreign students like me and I will really like to become a student of their campus to enjoy their high quality professors
Niche User,4,"I appreciate the living spaces; the food. Although, I figure they could use more clubs. They have amazing cafeteria food, and being located near the French Quarter makes it a beautiful place to live."
Freshman,4,I liked pretty much all aspects of Tulane but the two main things that need work in my opinion are improving the diversity in the school and increasing the number of majors offered.
Senior,4,It is good. I. Like.it.here.it. Is.not.boring.i.cant.wait.to.graduate.and.go.on.to.medical.scjool.and become.a.pediatrician.the.food.is.good.
Graduate Student,4,"Tulane has excellent academics. It is a very fast-paced program but well worth it. The class schedules, I wish were a little better. Morning classes would be a great thing to have."
Sophomore,4,"I have met amazing people and professors and overall I love my time at Tulane, but it definitely is not for anyone."
Niche User,4,Tulane is my top choice right now. I just visited over spring break and it was amazing. I loved the positive energy and good vibes. The staff were very friendly and warm. The students seemed very happy and positive.
Junior,4,Nice school. New orleans is a beautiful city. There is always something to do. A big party scene with both bars and greek life.
Niche User,4,"The best thing about Tulane for me is the flexibility. Teachers and administrators will work really hard to help you accomplish your goals, even if they're out of the ordinary. With about 7000 undergrads (and growing) it's a good size and most classes are pretty small, allowing you to build relationships with your professors. It's also flexible in the sense that you can be as involved on campus and school-spirited as you like or you can run around exploring the city and both are completely acceptable. I tend to spend my time off campus because New Orleans has a fantastic, youthful energy and great alternative culture. Because the student body is so varied and people are off doing their own thing, sometimes it feels apathetic. For instance there has been a movement going on campus since 2009 to get fair pay for the workers in the dining hall, but the organizers have had a really hard time getting any kind of solidarity from the students."
Graduate Student,4,"It's been pretty great so far.  I've met nice people, liked my classes and professors, and felt like I was getting a good education.  I wish they had more internal scholarships though and I wish there were more opportunities to get involved in student groups."
Sophomore,4,"Tulane is providing an excellent education on a beautiful campus. I arrived as a frightened freshman as I did not come with others from my high school. After just a short time, I had plenty of friends and felt at home."
Sophomore,4,It is a great supportive environment but is very academically competitive. The professors are good and go out of their way to help you and class sizes are fairly small. There are lots of incredible clubs all over campus that cover all areas of interest.
Sophomore,4,"Tulane is a great experience overall. New Orleans is unlike anywhere else in the U.S. and you can go out literally any night of the week. The party scene is unmatched and the academic prestige is a plus. However, the food is absolutely horrendous and there are quite a few professors that straight up can barely speak English. It is also way too expensive and is increasing by the year. If you're looking for a unique experience and can afford it, I would recommend going here but beware the downsides."
Sophomore,4,"Tulane is a wonderful school full of people who love to party but also to apply themselves academically. They are lacking in diversity and food, and the campus can seem a bit small at times, but there is always something to do either on campus or downtown."
Sophomore,4,"Tulane has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I have learned so much not just academically, but in all aspects. The people here are great, the professors care about you and Tulane provides every resource possible to make sure that everyone has a safe and wonderful time at the university."
Junior,4,"Tulane has a great overall atmosphere. However, the majority of students are very affluent and often lack perspective. Similarly, the faculty in charge of financial aid can be less-than understanding of lower-middle class families."
Freshman,4,I am going to begin at Tulane University in January as a spring scholar. I am very excited to begin my life at this school. From the moment I visited I knew this school was the one from me.
Sophomore,4,Professors here are excellent and the learning environment is very good. I have always felt safe on campus - it is well lit and the police patrol quite often.
Sophomore,4,"Tulane is an amazing school and the location makes it prime. It's close enough to New Orleans to be able to experience the city but far enough for it to be safe. Only issues is that a lot of the facilities (housing) are disgusting, but Tulane is currently working to fix that."
Sophomore,4,"It is very lively and you will definitely have a good time. There are always things to do and New Orleans is just a fascinating city in general. That being said, the academics are still pretty difficult, so make sure you do not get too carried away with everything."
Junior,4,"Tulane University is a wonderful school but it does have flaws. It is definitely a school on the rise with great academics and does not fit into the so called ""party school"" ranking. Dorms and food honestly should be better but student life is great and most classes are really great with teachers that care!"
Junior,4,"I was unable to personally visit any of the schools I was accepted to, and I came to Tulane primarily based on the great financial aid offered to me. I didn't like the school as much in the beginning but it has slowly grew on me. I felt that the majority of students are affluent and I struggled to keep up, but you eventually find a your group that is best for you. The school is in a great area and offers so much to do on campus and throughout the city of New Orleans. The school is getting better and better every year and I think there is a significant culture shift going underway currently concerning the party culture."
Freshman,4,I love the Classics department. I think that a lot of their classes are challenging. I think that the school does a miserable job with acknowledging and helping chronically mentally ill students.
Sophomore,4,"Tulane was overwhelming at first, but the location, professors, and relaxed nature of the university eventually won me over. I'm a southern girl who loves the outdoors and doesn't want to party every night of the weekend, so it was initially hard for me to find people with similar personalities to mine. The beauty of this initial struggle is that I was forced to get involved in several clubs and now have friends from all different perspectives and backgrounds. I love that at Tulane you aren't confined to a particular college, and are actually encouraged to study across various disciplines. Tulane is what you make of it, and if you take advantage of the many opportunities (many students don't know or care about the many scholarships, grants, and research possibilities at Tulane) you will certainly enjoy a fine four years at this beautiful school. Plus, the surrounding uptown area is super quirky and green with tons of restaurant choices. I love it."
Freshman,4,Tulane while very homogeneous has a great community of students who want to work hard but also let loose.
Sophomore,4,Very fun school with good academics. Definitely get what you put into your academics. You could skip every class and pass with low grades or you could attend and learn a lot.
Freshman,4,"Tulane has excellent professors with great course variation and small class sizes. The school is also geographically diverse with the average student traveling about 2,000 miles to attend Tulane. New Orleans is a beautiful place and the campus is breathtaking."
Freshman,4,"Disconnect between honors and non honors students. Also, hard to find non-party night alternatives. Fun atmosphere and good classes, but hard to get classes you want. Dorms are ok. Close to City, which is nice."
Freshman,4,"Tulane is a good school for students who have a lot of money. It’s expensive, and is not worth all the money, but it’s a fun time and the teachers seem to care about students. Getting involved on campus is easy and finding a group of friends is rewarding."
Sophomore,4,"Love the campus, classes and overall experience. Multicultural environment and community service is great. Navigating financial aid has been difficult. The meal plan can be an unnecessary burden."
Freshman,4,"I love the vibrant student body at Tulane. I felt very welcome as soon as I stepped on campus and overall, my first semester there was great. The one thing I would change would be the party culture, especially since I don't like to participate in that sort of activity. If there were less alcohol, I would feel more comfortable."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus, it was beautiful and a place you could really feel at home at. I also love how diverse the education is, you can study almost anything at Tulane. I personally am applying for Forensics, but they have such a wide array of majors alongside minors. The sports team isn't too bad either!"
Sophomore,4,"Really fun school with great academics, but I wish there were more majors. Professors are all really easy to talk to, and the campus is in a beautiful part of the city."
Alum,4,"Tulane University has a beautiful campus that is easy to fall in love with in a city that is even easier to love. Greek life is a big part of the social scene, which heavily relies on drinking, but having a late rush makes it so people are able to make friends outside of that system. The pre-med classes were much harder than I anticipated, partially because of the professors and the large class size. Upper level science classes are much easier to manage while the information is more engaging and the professors are more available. The administration is not always transparent, even though they claim to be, but it is very apparent they care for their students."
Niche User,4,"Much of my life has revolved around Tulane, and I am currently taking classes there as a high school student. The amount of resources Tulane has to offer are astounding, and while I'm not sure if I will attend next year, a Tulane education would serve anyone well. Like any school, the Tulane experience seems to me whatever you make of it; some people try hard and do well, and others simply like to party. But overall, most Tulane students tend to work hard. After all, the admissions rate and tuition are steep."
Niche User,4,"Tulane has an outrageously diverse atmosphere, fostering both a healthy feeling of uncomfort but also the potential to thrive. The city of New Orleans offers many opportunities for service and learning experience while the outskirts of town provides a humble suburb feeling. Tulane tests your limits, but in a good way. It is definitely a place for those who can appreciate the Creole culture, good food, and academic challenges. The only negative feature is, unfortunately, the price tag."
Niche User,4,Tulane is a very impressive college.. It is expensive but definitely one of the top colleges I could recommend.
Senior,4,"I loved my political science education - the teachers were all engaging and the students participated to make in-class discussion lively. but as for my psychology degree, I felt that there was a lot more hype behind the program than I found. Unless you joined a lab, the classes just felt like review sessions and material was only presented to memorize."
Freshman,4,Tulane has a beautiful campus and is the perfect size (not too big; not too small). They offer relatively good financial aid and scholarship opportunities. Every professor I've met so far is passionate and helpful and they have a really nice library. It's a great place if academics are your priority. It's also right across from a nice park and the street car line. I've heard it's a party school but I live in the honor's dorm and find it easy to avoid.
Freshman,4,"Only four stars because administration seems a bit disconnected from the student body. For example: a few weeks ago, I attended a demonstration put on by the Black Student Union on campus that called for the Office of Multicultural Affairs to get more funding and more space, because apparently Tulane doesn't care enough to give ""the O"" anything better than a smallish room in the basement of the student center (the LBC). Also the students here are surprisingly apathetic- they don't care about the environment (@all the trash littered around campus literally EVERYWHERE) and a lot of them are douchey rich people who only care about getting wasted every weekend. But overall it's a fun time, and TU actually does care about providing its students with a quality education and a good future in the job market."
College Sophomore,4,Tulane truly does have incredible academics and professors once you move away from gen eds.
College Junior,4,"The atmosphere is good in general, however if you don't get involved in extracurricular organizations if can be hard to find people like you."
Niche User,4,"Out of all of the colleges I visited the one that popped out the most was Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. During the tour  the tour guide mentioned their psychology department and  personally I feel like they should have advertise their psychology department a little more but this was very interesting to me because I wanted to major in psychology. I also like the fact that you can study more than one subject because I was very interested in studying theatre."
College Sophomore,4,Great network and resources. Got internship Summer after freshman year and hope to continue a successful job search.
College Senior,4,I really loved the admission process with Tulane. I build a personal relationship with my admission counselor and it helped me get into Tulane.
College Senior,4,Tulane is a great place.
Sophomore,2,"Tulane University is where wealthy children from California and the East coast go to party. Tulane's student body consists of mainly liberal arts and business majors. Tulane's science and engineering departments are lacking when compared to other schools. Also, Tulane is way to expensive. The campus is in the middle of a congested, small part of the city. You won't find much hiking around Tulane. And when people tell you that New Orleans is a great college city, don't listen to them. New Orleans is a city full of poverty, crime, and disease. If you don't believe me, look at the statistics. The good thing about Tulane is that the weather is nice. Another good thing is that if you go to Tulane you can network with lots of rich people."
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little diversity here at Tulane. Geographically, I guess. Most are from NE area."
College Senior,2,Safety on Tulane's campus is a problem
College Senior,2,"Greek life negatively affects the social atmosphere on campus. It is not overwhelming, but provides a nonetheless noticeable pressure for students to shirk their work and attend parties. What is perhaps worse is that Tulane hires staff to clean up after the fraternities throw parties, refusing to hold these students accountable for their actions."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly upper class white kids. Pretty accepting white kids, but a bunch of white kids nonetheless."
College Sophomore,2,"We have pretty great facilities, but nobody really cares about sports too much here at all. I went to both the opening & homecoming games & hardly anyone stayed past the first quarter both times. Not a very athletically-centered school at all."
College Sophomore,2,New Orleans is incredibly dangerous and students have to remember that.
College Junior,2,"The mental health services are pretty bad, they need to stay open later. I needed emergency buttons once and they were all out of service."
College Freshman,2,"It's really bad. Almost no one gets into their first choice dorm, even during sophomore year, and getting a single is almost impossible. Dorms are old, moldy, and loud. Even the ""nicer"" ones, such as Wall, SoHo, or Willow are not that nice when you compare them to other dorms in America. If possible, get a doctor's note so you can live off campus your sophomore year. It's much cheaper and the houses around campus are way nicer."
College Freshman,2,"First and foremost freshman year is all about partying. Students go out on average of three nights a week. Yes there are some students who stay in to study on the weekend but these kids are usually heavily judged for not going out. This tends to be less true with engineering students. The school seems to be made up of mostly kids from the northeast in particular New York which really changes the feel of the school. There is a general culture of not caring and even though the administration tries to cover it up, the university puts higher priority into paying for our pathetic sports teams. Most of the professors I have come across are extremely dedicated to their students and are willing to put in extra time outside of class and office hours to help them. Overall the academics are amazing and if you can overlook, work around, or even enjoy the work hard play harder style. Equipment is old and science labs are outdated and useless."
College Freshman,2,"People just go to the tailgates, no one shows up for the games."
College Junior,2,"Tulane has taught me many philosophical things, but very little of that can I use applying for a professional job anywhere outside or inside of the state"
College Junior,2,"It would be cheaper to buy a car than to live in Tulane dorms. Not only are the exorbitant rates not worth the quality of life you are expecting, but the fact that it is a mandatory requirement to live on campus for the Freshman and Sophomore year shows that the University cares more about milking the students for their money than it does providing a wholesome college experience."
College Junior,2,"I would not choose Tulane again because of the nepotistic practices that limit the growth of programs and students. Professors are more concerned with getting recognition from the University than actually teaching. There is no universal grading scale, and each professor has their own grading methods, which varies from politically biased to practical and objective. Tulane's core requirements waste too much time on arts and humanities and not enough of mathematics and sciences. There is no ""Tulane culture"" to speak of, in fact the only thing that graduates might find unifying is waking up next to one another after a night of binge drinking; that is if they hadn't been mugged on the way to their dorms. Tulane is a University without discipline and without any standards besides what the government has told them."
College Freshman,2,Football is bad. No one pays attention to basketball. Baseball is my life.
College Freshman,2,"When you have neighbors that blare their music until 2am, living in the dorms isn't ideal... The attendance policy also could be worked on. 

A.B. Freeman School of Business's grading policies could be edited; they are very strict."
College Freshman,2,People don't seem to care enough about their work. Not enough of my peers are academically engaged.
College Freshman,2,"it's a LOT of snotty rich northerners, not many people from the south. not many black people either. All the asians stick together. People are very liberal compared to what I'm used to coming from a prep school in the south, and I was fairly liberal compared to most of my peers back home"
College Freshman,2,"The lack of school spirit can be honestly embarrassing at times, and as someone big into college football and basketball, the lack of attendance of the games is quite disappointing. Honestly if i could change one thing about the social scene here, that would be it for sure."
College Sophomore,2,Don't let anyone fool you into thinking Tulane is a football school now that we have a stadium. We're still a bunch of scrawny northeasterers whose only sport is drinking.
College Sophomore,2,Sociology does not have strong research atmosphere.
College Sophomore,2,"Until a few days ago, I thought this would be my last year due to a lack of appropriate need-based aid. Tulane cut everything after my brother left school (Harvard, for which he only paid $7000 a semester). I am able to stay only after months of fighting with the financial aid office, and I am just getting by on what I have received."
College Sophomore,2,"Bruff (the cafeteria) sucks. The food is always gross and the salad bar is always wilted and just nasty. The pasta bar is pretty good though. Loyola's cafeteria is 100x better even though both cafeterias hire the same company (Sodexo). Wavebucks can be used in the food court, which I do a lot and a lot of close by resteraunts take Nolabucks."
College Sophomore,2,"one of the most noticeable lacking aspects of tulane however the football team is on the rise and I would predict that well be top in the Big East, which we just joined, in the next 2-3 years. roll wave, baby."
College Sophomore,2,football team is getting better coming off our first winning season in a while. we made a bowl game but unfortauntely lost on a missed field goal. Still we should be steadily improving with the addition of a stadium on campus this coming fall. Roll wave baby.
College Junior,2,"The school will have a new stadium up this year, but our football team is not very good... so we'll see what happens. Club sports are very popular, and students are able to manage their time well while participating in them."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is super overpriced, and TUPD gives out tickets like they're candy."
College Junior,2,"The vast majority of students at Tulane drink, and you will most likely feel uncomfortable if you don't. That doesn't mean you have to drink in order to have fun at Tulane, but you definitely have to be okay with being around alcohol if you're going to be happy here. The drinking culture of New Orleans definitely rubs off on Tulane. Weed also has a decent presence on campus, but drinking is what dominates the social scene."
College Junior,2,"A large percentage of Tulane students are white kids from affluent backgrounds. Judaism is the dominant religion at Tulane, earning it it's nickname of ""Jewlane"". Tulane boasts that it's the most geographically diverse school in the nation, but the bulk of students tend to come from the NE (NY, CT, NJ, MA), IL, CA, LA, and TX. I wish there was more of a presence of international students on campus."
College Junior,2,"It baffles me how difficult it is at times to get a cab in New Orleans. The streetcar is more of a city icon than anything else, as it is constantly down for repairs and unreliable. As far as the buses go, they also tend to be unreliable and are difficult to figure out."
College Junior,2,"As expected of most colleges, the food isn't that great, which is ironic considering Tulane is located in the middle of one of the world's best cities for food! Tough it out until Junior year when you can move off campus and cook for yourself."
College Junior,2,"Still wishing for more Tulane team spirit/fan support at most varsity sport events. There are always a lot of people at the first home football game, the homecoming game, and the Tulane/LSU baseball game. Men's basketball is also pretty well-attended. Other than that, though, don't hope for much unless the new football stadium changes things up.

Intramurals are serious, especially basketball. Some teams even make their own jerseys to play. Club sports are pretty popular, too. Club teams travel and compete all over the country and they're usually a pretty tight-knit group of people."
College Freshman,2,It's expensive and if you park illegally you WILL get a ticket
College Sophomore,2,Students here don't have a passion for athletics.
College Sophomore,2,Safe rides is pretty slow but a decent option. Taxis and the streetcar are very unreliable.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the freshman and sophomore dorms that are considered ""social"" are very poorly maintained. Other dorms are much nicer, but farther from student center/ classes and considered less social."
College Freshman,2,"To the schools defense, we are in a dense residential area without a lot of public parking or a place to but a parking garage other than the one we have. Parking is expensive and exploring the city without a car is either vary time consuming or very expensive."
College Freshman,2,"Lived in Monroe. Small,loud, stinky, old, absolutely disgusting. Over $7k to live in a double. Puke and urine all over everything. Used condoms on the flood lights. You name it. Super social and fun. But gets old FAST. There are nice dorms (like Wall and Willow) that are usually dubbed less social but new policies are allowing students who reside in them to stay there so they may be even harder to come by if thats what you're looking for. It wouldn't be so bad if we weren't forced to live here and it was actually reasonably priced."
College Freshman,2,"Tulane definitely needs to work on the parking situation, but it's understandably difficult in a city like New Orleans. Just don't park in the neighborhoods behind Tulane because you'll definitely get a $40 ticket."
College Freshman,2,"If you decide to go downtown, unless you have a car, you must take the streetcar. It's historic and beautiful and fun, but it takes a really long time to get where you need/want to be. You really have to plan your trips ahead of time. Tulane also has shuttles that can take you for free different places, but the schedule of those pick-ups and drop-offs is extremely bizarre. Say you want to go to Target. The shuttle will take you there (for free!), but you might have to stay there for 4-5 hours in order to take the free shuttle to get back on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of diversity here on campus. It's an issue the school leaders talk about constantly, but it doesn't seem like it has been made out to be changed."
College Freshman,2,"""Rich and whiter than a cheesecake."""
College Sophomore,2,I have a single mother who has four kids to support and even with the various loans I have she is struggling to pay for my college
College Freshman,2,"No one cares, to be honest. Every freshman goes to the first football game, but we're an academically focused school, so sports teams just aren't very important to the average student. With the building of the new football stadium, that may change in the next few years, however, as of now, if you're looking for a ""football school,"" Tulane ain't your cup of tea."
College Freshman,2,Great scholarships are given but it is easy not to qualify
College Freshman,2,"As someone who puts a great amount of effort into making good food, having little access to a kitchen (one that is horribly stocked and despairingly messy) and getting the majority of my meals from a dining hall has been a struggle. I visit the Loyola University dining hall next door much more frequently than I do Tulane's."
College Freshman,2,"There is pretty much no diversity on campus. They call it Jew-lane for a reason. The average student is white, jewish, and from the tri-state area. "
College Freshman,2,"The main dining hall started off great, but it got very redundant and boring. There are great options off campus but other than that there aren't many good options on campus."
College Freshman,2,"It's easy to stay away from drugs if you're not into it, but you can feel left out, especially if you're not into partying."
College Freshman,2,"Most students are fairly affluent from the northeast, Chicago, Texas, and California area. Tulane definitely lacks diversity. With that being said, if you are not of the aforementioned group, you will not feel different or left out. Students are generally accepting.  "
College Freshman,2,Everything will change next year when football is brought on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Because it's New Orleans, it rains often and is always humid. But it's warm and shorts and flip flops are ok for a majority of the semester. "
College Sophomore,2,"As far as ethnicity goes and even distribution of students from across the U.S., the campus population is not diverse at all. As far as religion, the population is pretty homogenous in being Jewish though diversity does exist. Sexual orientation is diverse and there are many clubs and organizations which provide support. "
College Sophomore,2,Dining is very accessible and there are a variety of options both in the cafeteria and food court. The school convenient store has frozen meal and snack options as well. It's all average but convenient. 
College Sophomore,2,TUPD is pretty good about monitoring areas and responds quickly when called. I feel safe on campus at night. 
College Sophomore,2,A lot of people attend sporting events and they are just as important as intramural and club sports. 
College Sophomore,2,I was awarded financial aid but still struggle with loans. 
College Sophomore,2,There is an on-campus garage but parking permits are expensive. You have to be at junior credit standing or above to have a car on campus. Parking near dorms is full bu available. 
College Sophomore,2,"The guys and girls at this school needs to take schoolwork much more seriously, they party and drink way too much. I wish if this can improve because its a good school and i like it a lot"
College Sophomore,2,"The computers on campus are outdated and slow, its most beneficial to bring your own if you would like to excel. personally, I prefer my own computer"
Junior,1,Classes online are horrible. Students cannot learn these big topics and do all of the work virtually. Tests should not be online either. Students learn best face-to-face with the professor and engagements in class with peers. Online courses should not even be an option; especially for us pre-med students.
Niche User,1,"Zero ""stars"" would be more appropriate.  I wasted my freshman year at Tulane.  I transferred out.  Enough said."
Sophomore,1,"Absolutely hate everything about my time here. The people suck, the teachers suck, and it's just a total waste of money. DON'T GO HERE!"
Freshman,1,"As one of very few students who is not an alcoholic, I hate it here. There is absolutely nothing to do that does not involve drunken parties. Many of the professors in certain departments do not care at all and simply do not teach the course material. No matter how involved you get, if you're an individual or at all different from the norm, you won't find friends here because everyone is the same."
Graduate Student,1,"The costs far outweigh any benefits through relationships that you make with your time here. Most of the faculty administration are tenured, jaded, and riding this out until their retirement. Occasionally you might get a good professor who still cares about teaching, but they do not stay at the school long. The campus has multiple security contracts and a private police department, yet students are assaulted or mugged on a near weekly basis. Then on top of all that unless you go along with the popular, or the professor's politics you will be ostracized, bullied, and will probably fail out of your classes."
Freshman,1,Everyone parties and no one cares about academics. Kids basically take classes with a pass-fail mindset
College Sophomore,1,"Not even gonna pretend it's safe, everyone AND I MEAN EVERYONE drinks. A lot of people smoke weed often & cocaine is pretty prevalent as well. Aside from drinking, the other drugs can definitely be avoided, but alcohol will always be present at Tulane."
College Sophomore,1,Tulane is not a school one should go to if they enjoy going to excellent sporting games. Besides baseball. We're ok at baseball.
College Junior,1,"If the partying and social life don't kill you, then the gangsters and muggers will. I dread classes on the main campus because I know I have to walk around a dangerous area without the legal authority to defend myself if necessary. Goodness knows that TUPD won't show up in time, even though they are less than a .25 mi. away from all locations on campus at all times"
College Freshman,1,"Visited Tulane and thought it was the perfect schools for me, 5 months later and I've applied to 4 schools to transfer. I went out a lot in high school-saying this because I think a majority of the people who go out here did not go out in high school. The party scene is boring. Boot-Palms and the same 4 frat parties every weekend gets old fast. Plus, in reality, you don't go off campus much-total bubble. I love the people I've met here, but really not the school for me."
College Junior,1,The transportation to school is horrible and the parking will be filled by the time you get here. This makes it hard to park. I rather just stay on campus.
College Junior,1,"There isn't much diversity on campus. That's one of Tulane's biggest flaws; however, there has been an active effort over the past couple of years... so only time will tell I guess?"
College Freshman,1,Tulane is incredibly homogenous. I couldn't believe how homogenous it was when I got here... they really need to look into fixing that.
College Freshman,1,It's rather challenging if you receive no merit aid but are requesting it.
College Freshman,1,"Tulane boasts great geographical diversity but fails to mention a mostly homogenous population of rich caucasians. A large asian population keeps to itself, and the gender and sexual diversity is less than one would hope."
College Junior,1,I dont have any scholarship opportunities that are available in other colleges for students majoring in Masters in Public Health
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone here seems so fake and very judgmental, dislike the lack of diversity, hate the rude, self entitled attitude. Everyone seems so stuck on themselves. VERY HARD to make friends unless you're in a sorority and weigh less than 100 pounds. Cannot wait to get out into the real world and talk to genuinely friendly people not these stuck up rich kids. AVOID."
College Junior,1,Most of the students at Tulane University are rich white kids from the northeast so they are mostly snotty and bratty. There are a few cool kids but the few cool ones are the minority.
College Senior,1,"Freshman and sophomore year financial aid was somewhat helpful, but the older I have gotten the less helpful they have been. They also reduced the amount of my aid, and claimed it was because I did not turn my forms in in time."
College Freshman,1,"Our sports teams are abysmal. There's very little school pride. The school is currently draining millions into a new stadium for the football team, because we've been playing in the Superdome for the past couple of years. Overall, no one really cares and it has just gotten to the point where we laugh at the sports teams."

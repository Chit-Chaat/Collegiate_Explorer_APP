Junior,5,"Penn state York is a bit different from other penn state campuses. This campus is truly about its students. Besides the resources that penn state offers, the York campus faculty does its best to make
Students comfortable and at home. Diversity and inclusivity is 100% embraced here. I have attended, left, and returned to the York campus as I consider it a home away from home. Student life is scattered as this is a commuter based campus.
There are other campuses included penn state campuses, and other universities that you may enjoy student life. The housing is affordable but don’t be surprised if it looks questionable. Although campus is quite diverse, the area isn’t as much. It is beneficial to have a car to move around when grocery shopping and grabbing a snack off campus. However, there is a shuttle service. Downtown York has some great boutique shops and food spots to enjoy. This place truly is what you make of it."
Junior,5,"Although COVID-19 has shaken learning up, Penn State York has done its best to make it efficient and effective. I have enjoyed online learning a lot. I do miss the personal aspect of physical interactions but it is a journey."

Alum,5,"Great bang for your buck here, lots of free services. Makes a great transition between high school and college. Small class sizes, campus life is small because all are commuters. Wish they had more major courses here. The advisors here are really top notch, at least mine was."
Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student from HACC. So far my experience with Penn State York has been great. I attended a transfer student meeting and I was given a tour.

Sophomore,5,"I've been at PSY for 2 years and will be heading to main campus in the fall. I couldn't be more proud of being a pen state Yorker. We're a small commuter campus, and that is what makes it so nice. You start to get to know everyone and have classes with a lot of the same people. We're always starting new clubs depending on what students are unstressed in. I would definitely recommend getting involved in clubs and going to sporting events and campus events. It's just a good way to meet people who are into the same things. I really loved my experience at penn state york."

Like Penn State football some say it's a must to go to at least two games to see how much students show their blue and white pride. Also with THON people say it's such a loving event to raise money and of course alot of fun. When students say WE ARE PENN STATE they mean it and prove it."
College Sophomore,5,I'm feeling extremely comfortable at Penn State York. I'm taking five classes and each teacher is awesome! They explain their class really well and so far I've taken three quizzes and did well on them. I have the type of teachers that don't make their class confusing and vague.

The academics that are offered are great, there is the honors program a student can join if gpa is 3.5 or greater and the most popular one is the graham center which helps with networking and internships. It's great I plan to join next semester. The library is a great place to help with studying they offer laptops, cords, Chargers, pods and many more. It's a beautiful place and take advantage of free anything."
College Freshman,5,"Safety is great here on campus, there are always security guards that work 24/7 to keep the campus safe and they will assist you to your car if the student feels unsafe."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are very helpful and we also have a success center of students need help, I go there when I get stuck with math and even students tutor me for free!"
College Freshman,5,"The major key I've leaned in college is to always network with people no matter what. I spoke to the janitor and he was in the navy it was incredible to converse with an intelligent man at the campus. The degrees are very focused although many students do the 2+2 program which students start out at any campus and transfer after two years. The quality of anything is just great if you ever speak to Shelly drabik, she will make you stay!"

College Freshman,5,"The fact that there is someone on campus to help you get an interview for an internship or job, and the fact that, that same guy will do a mock interview with you is wonderful.

However, there are a few professors that have demonstrated they are not capable of educating their students properly. There are enough professors that you can avoid these if you ask around."
Freshman,4,Great student-teacher ratio. Clean and safe campus. Small campus makes it easy to navigate and find classes. Love the student life and there is always something to do on campus each week. Sports and party life lack due to small amount of students.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a Sophomore at Penn State York. I am enrolled in the 2+2 Program and Transfer to University Park in the Fall of 2018. 
The professors on campus are average, but so far I have only had great experiences with 2 of my many professors. Many of the professors on campus are involved in many other academic activities, including research studies, and I have found that they don't take their classes as serious as they should be. However, the campus is in a good location and it is a pretty campus as well."
Freshman,4,"Good college despite being a small campus with no on campus housing. Lots of foreign students, mostly from Asia."
Freshman,4,"I love the area it is in, very close to shopping. The teachers are generally very willing to help. Tons of clubs to choose from."
Freshman,4,It is very chill and the people in the college seems to be very nice. The professors are also very nice and are helpful when you have problems with something.
Sophomore,4,"Needs to get better at managing its budget so it doesn't go over as much as it recently did, and be more logical when funding clubs."
College Sophomore,4,"While the york campus doesn't have many sports, the main campus has many sport events, and people drive from all over to come and see them."
College Sophomore,4,"My experiences in classes are normally very good, with the exception of a few professors, but every school will have professors that are better or worse then others.

College Sophomore,4,The facilities for the athletes are really good.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not completely satisfied with this campus just because I don't have courses from my major, that's the only thing ó would change about it. If i could do this all over again i would just choose main campus from the beginning just because of that but if its because of the people and the way I learn then h would definitely stay on this campus. The people are really helpful and i like that."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are overall very reasonable and make an active effort to make sure you learn and not just ""see"" material. Many go out of their way to help you. 

The classes are of average difficulty. I'd vouch that any high school graduate (who made an effort) will not have problems with the difficulty. There is merely a greater workload.

The registration process kind of sucks because a vast majority or general education courses (particularly STEM majors) are semester-specific so if you do not pass the course perquisite or do not secure a seat in the class you're in big trouble."
College Sophomore,4,"There has never been any security breach as far as I know the three semesters I have attended Penn State York. I feel fairly safe. However, there are no on-duty officers on campus."

College Sophomore,4,"Our school is mainly for international students, and all students are accepted."
College Senior,4,The small campus allows students to get to know professors. Students also get more hands on experience with their majors due to there being only about 1500 students on campus.
College Senior,4,The campus is strict about things they need to be strict about on campus. This usually isn't an issue for students.
College Senior,4,They try to help as much as possible
College Senior,4,"Athletics are limited, but the sports we do have are good and receive a lot of attention"
College Senior,4,the worst our campus has experienced is minor vandalism
College Sophomore,4,The strictness at my school is great it's really high.

College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of options off campus. I live off campus (ten minutes away) and I am very close to a couple of restaurants and grocery stores. 
College Sophomore,4,"There aren't a lot of varsity sports at Penn State York. However, the varsity sports that we do have are quite huge around campus. For example, we always have a full crowd when our basketball team has a home game."
College Sophomore,4,I feel as though an A- is suitable as the safety of the school was near perfect.
College Sophomore,2,"If both of your parents work and make a decent amount of money, you will not get much financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,"The lions den is our school dining hall. I have to admit the food is good and is being cooked right there in front of you. However, the prices of the food are quite high on certain items. We have lunch specials daily which gives us more of a variety. We also have a mini coffee shop/cafe that is located across from the library."
College Freshman,2,Good gym. Coaches are not the best. For basically a community school coaches take it way to seriously. they think sports come before school.
College Freshman,2,"There is really nothing around. you have to drive out into york, which is the city and it is not a nice place to be. High Crime rates."

College Freshman,1,Nobody wants to stay on campus if they do not have to be. Not nearly enough activities.
College Freshman,1,Honestly I drove home at least 4 times a week for dinner and leftovers which I made last all week.  I wouldn't recommend going into any establishment in the area.
College Freshman,1,"I believe a branch college of penn state main should have on campus housing such as the other branch campuses like penn state harrisburg, penn state altoona and many more. Penn state york is the only campus without on campus housing and I think that is ridiculous. The lofts students stay in are okay but I think on campus housing would be alot safer cause the lofts are more in the city while the school is in the suburbs."

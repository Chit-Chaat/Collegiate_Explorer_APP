Sophomore,5,"I have been attending Morton college since fall of 2018, I really enjoy how the facility create so many events to bring students from different backgrounds together. 
the professor go beyond to try and teach lessons and make sure every single one of their students are capturing everything."
Sophomore,5,Good teachers and opportunities to learn. Good atmosphere and awesome students.  If you ever get the chance to take Dr. Kasperswicks he is a great teacher.
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed attending this college. There are so many events to attend, different clubs the school offer. The professors I had were great and always made time for students. Councilors and Tutors are very helpful. The campus is always clean and well kept."
Sophomore,5,"Morton College is an amazing college as they provide students with so many resources, they have certain universities come in on certain days, the events are so great as they do giveaways. They have so many clubs to join along with sports. The bathroom along with the classrooms are really clean. The professors are really passionate about teaching and are always willing to help and meet up with students during their office hours. I Would honestly recommend this school to all my friends and family."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at Morton College. Although it is only a 2 year college, I have learned so much. Starting out at Morton has made my life easier and more affortable to continue my education as a Registered Nurse."
Freshman,5,I am in my freshman year and the transition from high school to college has been very easy because of Morton teachers and staff.
Junior,5,Morton College has given me the opportunity to grow and learn at my own pace. I knew I wasn’t ready for a University and I decided to start in the hometown community college and it was the best decision I’ve made.
Freshman,5,"Morton College is a college I recommend anyone to go to, apply now. Morton College is safe , it's in the right environment I believe. The food is great, the professors will take good care of you."
Freshman,5,"Love the vibe! Pretty awesome college and lost of places to study, quite a diversity of student and very helpful teachers. Very easy to get use."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Morton College was exceptional. At first when I walked in I felt shy and weird of this new experience, but with the help of the teachers and meeting new friends it felt like a breeze those 2 years I spent there. I would recommend Morton College to anyone because it gives u a better understanding too any University."
Sophomore,5,Morton College is an amazing two year community college with affordable tuition and it is a good place  to learn your general college education. If you ever get bored of quiet old Cicero just hop on your car and drive one block to the entrance way of I55 and drive to downtown Chicago and experience the vast cultural diversity that the Windy City can provide. While the course load may get heavy at times you can be sure that the professors are always willing to help you during their office hours. The campus food is average but you can always go on a quick trip to one of the nearest restaurants.
Sophomore,5,"I had originally gotten accepted into Northern Michigan my senior year of high school. Unfortunately due to financial reasons I wasn't able to attend. I was given the great opportunity to attend and continue to attend to Morton college, and has been one of the best decisions I have ever taken. I have been given the amazing chance to have some very dedicated professors who are passionate about teaching; you can tell by the way want you to learn."
Freshman,5,"Morton College has a very friendly environment. The professors are very helpful and kind. One thing I would change about the college is the cafeteria food, I would add various types of food."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are great! Professors at Morton College are very helpful, even online professors will help you and let you have a one on one conversation about an issue. Morton College always holds events to help students learn about more activities at Morton."
Sophomore,5,I love this school! Second community college I attended and I love absolutely everything they have to offer!
Recent Alumnus,5,The course scheduling in this school is great. I've had to take night classes because I work in the mornings and also classes on the weekends so that I do not have to take casses in the summer.
College Senior,5,Morton College has a great network with the students who want to advance in their field of study.
College Junior,5,Unique aspects of the program include being involved with faculty and students in a hands on learning environment.
College Junior,5,The online courses are the best way to finish school work from home!
College Freshman,5,Online classes are very different from traditional class rooms. Technically you teach your yourself. It take double the hours of study from a traditional classes. What I like from online classes is that I can work around my schedule.
Sophomore,4,"I have has a good experience at Morton College. The students and staff are nice. The average class is about 25 students, but it ranges. If I were to change something about the school it would be the financial aid department. It is difficult to get good scholarships."
Junior,4,The current online learning experience was kind of weird just because it was towards the end of the semester and the class as a whole had to get use to learning online. The professor I had made it helpful by posting videos and explaining what our topics were on. Sending us notes and power points to review. He also had a virtual class that we could go onto and ask questions or anything that we needed help on. So overall my professor made it easy and was a big help through this experience.
Junior,4,"Overall I think morton college was amazing. The school itself is big and spacious. There’s a good mix of students to teacher ratio. The classes themselves are structured well in terms of getting assignments done and having enough time to learn certain topics. The pace for classes is definitely helpful for people who have responsibilities outside of school. Professors are willing to help.
Before morton I was at Depaul University but left due to little time on assignments, and the awkwardness I had with professors.
Depaul University goes by trimesters meaning you have a short amount of time to grasp concepts and do good. I had other responsibilities outside of school so I always felt rushed with my work and did feel good about the work I submitted. The professors I had didn’t care seem to care to help students. It felt forced so I definitely didn’t feel comfortable to ask for help.
Morton College and it’s staff helped me so that I could succeed and for that I’m grateful."
Freshman,4,"I would love to see a change in the blackboard app as it is not up to date and it's difficult to log in at times. Aside from that, I would love to see more updates with the courses in order to fulfill students expectations such as fine arts or diversity in courses."
Freshman,4,Teachers may leave a lot of work in a week but they help you and teach you everything that you need.
Freshman,4,"Morton College, despite losing credibility this upcoming winter, was an excellent school during the time that I took classes there. The professors are wonderful and it is a very opinionated school."
Freshman,4,Morton College is a great community college that is well and good to start a education. The staff are very helpful when it comes to needing help for anything.
Niche User,4,"Cheap and gets the job done. Like seriously, a lot of kids go here and end up doing to good universities and do not get into debt."
Junior,4,Most of the professor that I have had so far in this school are very kind and always provide help to students if asked. They always ask about what could be done better to improve our experience there. During the week of finals they provide fun activities to help students relieve stress.
Sophomore,4,I liked how they continue to improve the atmosphere every year. They try to make it a better place for students to have places to study and places to just hang out waiting for classes. I love the professor there as well who really care about their student's success.
Niche User,4,"What I liked about Morton is that there are a bunch of classes that are offered for   any major that someone would want to complete. And if someone doesn't know what they want to do, they can still get their basics done that is affordable and while getting their basics done, they can take other courses that might help them choose what they want to do in the future."
Freshman,4,"Morton College provides a quality education with price alternatives to pricey 4 year universities. What I really appreciate is how readily resources are available, and people do not hesitate to help you."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have never had a proffersor that wasn't truely passionate about the course he/she was teaching.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My school always has work fairs, college fairs, volunteer fairs. Thanks to them I was able to volunteer for the first time and it felt it great helping others!"
College Senior,4,The flexibility of the classes is great! The weekend classes help a lot with those who work full time like myself.
College Senior,4,The career center helps the students create resumes and advice for interviews.
College Senior,4,An average class size is about 20 students and the professor is usually very great about the teaching material.
College Junior,4,"Teachers want you to succeed, and they will make sure that if you put in the effort, they will too."
College Junior,4,"The fire science program is great, but it would be even better if they offered the students to partake in the local fire department's training academy."
College Junior,4,"The school has great teachers and faculty. They are very helpful, and put the students first. Very highly recommended!!!"
College Junior,4,School counselors help out a lot!
College Freshman,4,My class size are adecuate for the teacher to interact with students and answers any questions that we might have. I also love that some of my teachers also work at bigger universities.
College Freshman,4,I had the opportunity to practice with real cadavers in my biology lab assignments.
College Sophomore,4,"Is a small campus. Students range from Freshman from high school to adults looking for continuing their education. Class sizes aren't a problem. You'll definitely get a chance to get to know your class mates and instructors. My favorite aspect is the fact that the labs are very flexible.  You can do them when you have time, there is no predetermined time or day you absolutely have to complete your lab. You're given a week to complete it and the lab is open for the majority of the day. Being a small campus, it's easy to locate offices for departments and instructors. Friendly environment where everyone seems happy to be there."
College Junior,4,The tutoring programs that they have are great. They do the very best to make sure we understand the topic and give us that extra tip or help that we need.
College Junior,4,They do everything in there hands to help students get financial aid
College Junior,4,The campus is always clean and well taken care off
College Junior,4,I think I am getting my money worth at this college. And I am thankful to the college for choosing me as recipient for the academic excellence scholarship.This scholarship really helped my family and I and making it possible for me to actually attend school.
College Junior,4,"Even though I have not been inside all the buildings, I have found the library and student center  very helpful resources. My instructors are great. I like the fact that class sizes are small , so it makes it very possible to get help from your instructor."
College Senior,4,Always helpful.straight to the point.
College Junior,4,Its a small college. All the students there are happy outgoing but most overall they are there to get the job done.
College Junior,4,The school is focus in your academics and all your professors are willing to help you out with your work during there free time.
College Junior,4,I am perusing an associates in science. plenty of work in this major but very fun.
College Junior,4,From student to teachers and administrators the school is very student friendly.
College Junior,4,"flexible schedules,but also because i took my time to planned it out."
College Junior,4,Its a good cheap community college.But i cannot receive Financial Aid.
College Junior,4,"Luckily, I live in district for my school so I have managed to save and afford it out of pocket.  Books are still astronomical and I do not receive any financial aid or book vouchers.  One thing that was very disappointing was that there are only scholarships available once a year and they do not seem to advertise any deadlines.  Since I started school in the Spring, I had already missed the deadlines for the full calendar year and will have to wait to try again."
College Junior,4,Morton does have a very diverse student body with all manner of career goals and passions.  Everyone has been friendly and respectful.
College Junior,4,"So far I have had a great experience with my Instructors.  They recognize that I am a non-traditional student and have been able to provide valuable insight and guidance for my career path.  Dr. Stellmach is a wonderful science teacher with great ideas and a very challenging and rewarding course.  Because of her enthusiasm and love of the subject matter, I feel I have been able to retain more knowledge and have a clearer path of where I would like to go in my career."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is plenty of different types of people at Morton College also friendly. Most people have groups that are interested in the same things/topics. There are American, Hispanic, African, and possibly Asian people."
Recent Alumnus,4,Morton College helps you step by step and will attend you by appointment. Filling out applications and form are easy and if need help they can guide you. The academics are great and easy to pick also have advisers to help you with any questions or financial needs. They also have a study program you can take if you don't score so well on the placement test which can help you improve.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Morton College has great academic programs, but money is a problem. Campus is just awesome because there's people showing pride by joining school activities even helps you look for jobs from putting on job fairs. It has scholarship updates although some may have hard requirements the steps are understandable. There are many clubs to join and be apart of also show support."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus is clean and shows welcome to everyone. Also has different buildings labeled to be identified easily for help and questions. Morton College has many activities for everyone to join like boxing, basketball, and parades for the community. It has a student center where students can help one another or do research. The library is quiet and plenty of books to read or do some study time."
Recent Alumnus,4,"J.Sterling Morton East is a unique school because it has many historic pictures, and past how things were before including athletic trophies, teachers, and students. I would choose to go back and do it all over again because its an opportunity to be an overachiever and find a path for scholarships and college. Get a step ahead before college and give it my best shot."
College Freshman,4,i really like walking past all the auto classes. It's fun to see all the students working on cars.
College Freshman,4,"primarily latinos, because in a hispanic area, but also very accepting of other races."
College Freshman,4,the student union center and the library are helpful areas where i do my homework.
College Junior,4,"The student union is a nice place to relax, but doing any actual work on the computers is impossible because they are very slow."
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of classes to choose from, but signing up on time is very important to get a nice class time. "
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office can be useful at times and many seem pretty knowledgeable. 
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are their to push you but not break you. they want inspire you to fail and do it again. For without failure their can be no progress.
College Junior,4,"Classes at Morton College are very flexible. Yu can choose what time and what days to go to school. Also, the classes are great, most of the teachers at the campus are very helpful, which makes the school experience great."
College Junior,4,"The resources are great and handy. The only problem is that sometimes the whole campus can get overcrowded because everybody wants to be at the same place. Nonetheless, everything is great."
College Junior,4,"The computer network is great. The school has Wi-fi which is very convenient and accessible. Also, their are may computers for the students to use."
College Junior,4,Morton College has a Student Success Center in which it is very helpful because their are many great tutors for any subject that can help you succeed. Also the staff is very friendly and helpful. You feel welcomed.
College Sophomore,4,the resources on campus at my school aren't bad. the student center is actually a fun place to hang out and meet new people. the staff in the library and student center are nice and helpful. this is actually one of my favorite things that I like from my school.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I ironically took a speech class online. Communicating with the teacher was easy. There is a forum available on the school's website dedicated to taking online courses. Communicating with classmates was easy as well. There are two separate conversation forums for every online course you are taking. One is for students only and the other is like a classroom where the teacher can read all the threads as well and answer any questions. I had to be present in the classroom only five days in the whole semester and those days were only to present our speeches. I hear that with other online courses you do not need to attend at all. Although, I have heard bad reviews on other online courses. I think it just depends on who your teacher is. Because the main complaints about that class was the lack of teacher communication."
College Senior,4,"Campus life offers many opportunities to students in search of a job, leadership skills, getting involved in and off campus and even volunteering at other non profit organizations."
College Junior,4,Computer Network – Everything at this school was up to date. The techonology advaced along with the other resources they offered.
College Junior,4,The resources on campus are endless. Athletics are always going on. The student center was always helpful. The library is full of great stuff.
Recent Alumnus,2,"After you graduate, you are kind of on your own."
College Junior,2,The school does not have good post-grade.It is a small community college most of the courses there are only to get your associates.and poor post-grades services. That is why i want a scholarship to transfer to a better community college.
Recent Alumnus,2,ITS HARD TO FIND A JOB AFTER GRADUATION
Recent Alumnus,2,FOR REGULAR CLASSES YOU ARE ABLE TO PICK AND SELECT WHAT YOU WANT. THATS NOT BAD. FOR NURSING CLASSES ALL THE CLASSES ARE SELECTED FOR YOU AND THERE ISENT MUCH ROOM TO CHANGE YOUR CLASSES. NURSING CLASSES ARE ONLY OFFERED DURING THE MORNING. THERE IS NO NIGHT CLASSES FOR NURSING.
Recent Alumnus,2,"THE INTERNET IS SLOW, NOT ENOUGHT COMPUTERS WHEN YOU NEED THEM, PRINTING IS $ .10 PER SHEET NOT BAD! WIFI IS OKAY... "
College Junior,2,The internet is slow but gets the job done. Computers in the library are good to use but any where else is a waste of time. Printing here is easy and inexpensive. 
College Junior,2,There isn't anything to praise. There isn't a network of alumni and the career center is pretty much non existent.
College Sophomore,2,"The only reason why I gave it a 2 is because i have met some really cool people at Morton College but if it wasn't for these friends then it would have to be a 1 due to the lack of education, poor facilities, and lazy environment.  "
College Senior,2,"There isn't that many options available to students after graduation, unless they are going straight into a University or if they completed a program at the college."
College Senior,2,The school guidance counselors that are there to help students figure their way in taking classes are not that helpful. They limit what they say when a student asks about specific questions regarding what classes to take in order to complete their associates.
College Junior,2,"I've never taken online classes, but one thing i know is that if someone has online classes the probability of doing good is less than if actually going to school. This is because in school you can't really do anything else but sit and well do class work and in online courses means that you are in your house and sometimes rather do other stuff than do work stuff, saying they will do their work later, and they end up doing it in the last minute. The good thing about this is that if you take online classes and put all of your efforts, it will be a great way to get advance and finish your school goals faster."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are job fairs at least twice a year. The tutoring center is always willing to lend a hand with your resume. Most students aren't looking for a full-time job after graduating. They are looking to transfer to a four year school. So there isn't much emphasis on the career center. But if you're looking for work study, always talk to financial aid at the beginning of your semester. You should also ask around and see if any teachers are looking for student aids. I worked at the school as a student aid while being a full time student. I also had an outside part-time job and the school accommodated my schedule around my classes and my other job."
College Junior,2,There are some clubs such as the Philosophy Club that is very interesting.  I don't care for computer lab space being jeopordized by students taking up space checking their Facebook or the Anime club taking over the video game room.  They have put more couches and chairs throughout the buildings which are nice to accomplish some reading during schedule gaps and some really wonderful artwork on display that one can appreciate on the way to class.
College Sophomore,2,I would like the professors to have stronger expectations from the students here. A discouraging challenge I have faced here is that the professor's curriculum is unorganized and therefore they do not set a high level of expectation from the students. I also wish more students would take advantage of more courses because small class sizes usually result in professors who are not passionate.
College Senior,2,"Internet Connections – The internet connections are slow. two out of my four classes are mainly using internet but the wireless connection is very slow. It waste time for both the professors and the student, not allowing the professors to use the class time properly or making it unable for a professor to show the new students  how to use something online."
College Freshman,2,"Only 2 of Certain Classes – It seems that while there are many classes to choose from, that there are only a certain number of classes. If a student wants to take 6 classes, chances are, the times will overlap. It has been a problem for me more than once, or the classes that I do take, are too long so I can only take 2 classes, due to time constraints."
College Senior,2,"Always Full – Their software is always up to date,but their labs are always full though and it's hard to find an open computer most of the time."
College Senior,2,The lack of help I received when trying to get answers for things I had questions on.I also was dropped from all of my classes this semester even though I had paid the costs of my classes in full before the deadline.
College Senior,2,"I Have No Transferred – The main reason I chose his school was to get my basics.  I was able to work around my personal schedule, but by the second year in Morton, it got to the point where I don't feel I'm going no where with my education.  I'm currently still attending Morton College, but will be transferring fall of 2012 to Columbia College Chicago."
Niche User,1,"only tried teaching us with youtube, it was a disaster. definitely not my money's worth................................................."
Niche User,1,"horrible service!! the staff over there are completely useless and rude. they try to swamp me in debt. I'm so disappointed. expected better service, its the whole reason I'm paying them. smh do not send your kids here I repeat do not. pick a better school/college, you'll only be wasting your money and time here."
Alum,1,"There are a total of 15 weeks in a semester. Since the pandemic, students have spent 8-9 weeks adapting to online courses. Majority of my classes I enrolled consist of music private lessons. In the previous years I’ve been very successful. Music ensembles as well as private lessons are not offered through online nor hybrid courses. Resorting to online lessons due to this pandemic, have dimmed my ongoing learning progress as a student. These courses require face to face engagement, I am forced to endure these challenges throughout the rest of the semester. Furthermore, since the institution doesn’t provide tutors who can explain music theory, I am left to resort to YouTube for guidance. The changes I would like to see in this institution reside on the form of communication the school has with it's students. There has to be more reliable information delegated to the students."
Works Here,1,Strongly suggest not applying for any job there.  Re-organization can happen any time without any notice. Worst communication ever between management and faculty and staff.
Sophomore,1,"Not the best community college to go to, would not recommend to anyone. Professors are not willing to help you, it feels like you're back in High School and the student adviser's usually don't care enough to help you."
Recent Alumnus,1,NURSING IS VERY HARD THERE IS A LOT OF READING AND WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE CLASS. CLASSES ARE LONG SO ITS HARD TO CONCENTRATE. JOB OPPORTUNITES ARE VERY LOW AFTER GRADUATION WITH AN ASSOCIATE 
Recent Alumnus,1,"THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE ISENT VERY HELPFUL, IF YOU DONT APPLY FOR AID YOU JUST DONT APPLY AND THEY DONT OFFER YOU ANYTHING ELSE. NOT EVEN LOANS. YOUR ON YOUR OWN AND THEY DONT EVEN BOTHER TO LOOK AT YOUR INCOME OR LISTEN TO YOUR STATEMENTS. "
College Sophomore,1,It has been very difficult to receive help when it is needed.
College Sophomore,1,Registration can be a hassle when trying to get help from advisers or anything else at Morton College. Very minimal education takes place.
College Sophomore,1,It can be very hard to get useful information from the staff. One person will send you to the other and then the other person will send you to someone else and then you will somehow find your way back to where you started. 
College Sophomore,1,"Slow computers, slow WiFi, and printing seems to be more of a business to them than to have helpful resources for students. "
College Sophomore,1,"Teachers expectations from their students are set very low from day one. These low expectations transform into very low quality work and results in an environment where no one learns nor is challenged. Instead of studying, students spend their time lounging and in conversation due to the lack of school work. What sets Morton College apart from other higher educational facilities is that a student will actually be less prepared to transfer to a university than if the student went straight after high school since high school is much harder than attending Morton College. "
College Senior,1,The computer network is extremely slow and unreliable.
College Junior,1,"I attended Morton for three semesters and never had a problem with my financial aid until my fourth semester.  The entire department was replaced and changes to the information that needed to be turned in had not been brought to the students attention until the last minute.  Most of us did not get our financial aid until the very end of the semester because of their failure to alert us through usps, e-mail, or Panther Portal which the majority of returning students use to register for classes."
College Junior,1,The academic advisors often do a poor job and as a result most students have to stay an extra semester.  The school does not offer much in the way of career placement due to the fact the most students plan to transfer to pursue four year degrees at other schools.
College Senior,1,I have a really difficult time locating the staff and they never return my calls . They are not very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,1,I did not find a job with my degree. I feel as if I can't do much with it now anyway. I don't feel that the career center does a good job at helping graduates. it's a complete on your own matter.
College Junior,1,"Moderate Alternative to School – I started morton about a semester ago, now being my second semester there, unfortunately morton college lacks school pride. The school tends to fit the perfect criteria for a community college, emphasizing the point, by pointing out that most of the students go to morton to acquire their credits and go home. The way that i see it, i have to say the feeling is mutual do to the fact that i too simply go to school to get my work done rather than spending time around the campus. However on the other hand teachers are great and have a unique sense of charisma while teaching."

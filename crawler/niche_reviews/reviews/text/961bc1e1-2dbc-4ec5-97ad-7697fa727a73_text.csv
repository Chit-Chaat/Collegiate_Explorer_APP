Freshman,5,"Greenville Technical College has an amazing staff and professors. They are there to help you start, stay, and succeed! They really care about their students, and go out of their way to help when help is needed. Technical college was the way to go for me. It's a better way to go financially."

Junior,5,I take only online classes and they really are on point and the teachers are helpful and well informed.

The online center, Blackboard, worked well with learning and turning in assignments. Overall, my Greenville Tech online experience was great!"
Senior,5,"The teachers care about you, they will do anything in their power to make sure you succeed but you have to try.  My program teachers are amazing they know your name and where you want to do in life.  They care about their students."
Niche User,5,I have graduated from this college 2 times before and I am planning to attend again in the fall. They are wonderful at helping non-traditional students to obtain an education.

Alum,5,"The teachers and staff showed a dedication and care for the students that I have never seen before. Many teachers went above and beyond to help students in need, while still maintaining a professional environment and dynamic. Other staff are friendly, and will form a strong bond with students. Everyone from the top to the bottom are there to help the student learn and grow, and they reflect it fairly well. There are very few, if any, things which would need changing to improve the experience."
Freshman,5,"Even though all classes are online format, it still feels the same if being in a face-to-face class. The fact I have all my classes online, I would expect to get more homework because extends while being in home."
Freshman,5,"The ambient inside the college is very friendly. All the professors have been extremely patient if I do not understand at all a topic. It feels very harsh that every alumni that goes to campus has to take online classes due to what is happening in the world. Entirely, It makes me happy to assist to this college that is giving me the bases to be able to hopely transfer to Clemson University."
Sophomore,5,I just started my online learning and so far my professor have been very quick about answering emails and trying their best to give the best answer possible. Blackboard isn’t also very easy to use and very organized

Alum,5,"Absolutely wonderful! The faculty and staff are very kind and helpful. The courses feel just like any other college would, but you aren't in a huge class of 200."
Sophomore,5,The staff is friendly and great at replying. The staff works with you to solve any problems and questions that may arise.
Freshman,5,"This a great community college to attend if you want to transfer to a four year college, the professors are great, they are very understanding, the advisers are great. If something happens the school will keep you updated and if your failing a class or on the very of failing they will email you and help you out. The school has many tutoring option to help out students and if you enter the Trio program they will help you throughout the school year. They also offer amazing scholarship options, overall this school is great for a 2-year college."
Freshman,5,All the professors are nice and will work with you if you have trouble. The only thing is there is no food on campus. There are vending machines but no food. I would like to see a cafeteria be put on campus to help the students staying on campus.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Greenville was great. They have tons of resources to help you stay on top your classes. They have commune events on campus. The staff are friendly. They offer extra credit for volunteering. They don’t have a cafe, but sometimes Campus pointe will serve food from time to time. Campus life is fun. You get your own apartment 2/4 bedrooms. The RA’s help you make friends. Also there’s no curfew"
Freshman,5,"The class sizes are perfect, especially for someone returning to school later in life and trying to get back into the swing of being a student."
Sophomore,5,The professors I've had have all been spectacular. Greenville Tech has been such a wonderful experience.
Freshman,5,"Greenville Technical College is a wonderful two year college. It has small class sizes which allows personal, one on one communication with professors. I have had nothing but good experiences with all of my past instructors, and they were always very helpful. If I had a question they would answer it thoroughly and in a way that I would understand. All of the staff in the bookstore, financial aid office, and other areas are helpful and pleasant when I have had to meet with them. I enjoy attending Greenville Tech and I can’t wait to further my education there."
Niche User,5,Greenville Technical College provided me with the best opportunity and education to become a phlebotomist in the upstate. There are many opportunities that they give you to show what you have learned to those at at Prisma Health/Greenville Hospital. I recommend this school to others. I cannot wait to start my nursing degree in the fall.

Freshman,5,Greenville Technical College has the student's best interest at heart. A truly amazing place to further your education.

Freshman,5,"Greenville Technical College is a very good and affordable community college, with great academic rigor, attendance policy and Transfer System with very helpful resources available everywhere at any time.  It also looks very nice and beautiful on campus,  and is very organized. A very good aspect of it is also the improvements happening all around, both in campus and system or programs, digital and academic, all constantly being tailored to help give students the best academic experience they can get in Greenville with an amazing learning environment. When I first applied to it after High School I was not expecting much, but when I started doing tours, going to events and started taking classes, it all changed and it actually exceeded my expectations."
Freshman,5,I like Greenville technical because the teacher do care what happens with our class and work. They always ask if we are doing will. I have notice this college is low in coast then New York College.

The greatest fact about the college is that it consists of extraordinary professors that dedicate their time and patience to guide you in the direction of gaining the knowledge for your degree.

The staff around the campus so are very nice and helpful. I plan to apply to the Dental Hygiene program and finish my degree. I don't plan to transfer. I have met many different people at Greenville Tech that have helped me in classes. I live in Greenville, so the Greenville Tech is only 15 mins away which is great because I can go to work as well."
Sophomore,5,"I was nervous going back to school after so many years of being out of the school scene, but it was definitely the right choice to dip my toes in the water at a small, local college like Greenville Tech. I have really enjoyed the time spent in classes and even online. And also, their online choices for classes is very impressive."
Sophomore,5,I really loved how available everyone was to help; there are plenty of resources and encouragement to succeed.

Freshman,5,"When I went to tour the school , it had a great campus and the people there was very polite. Its really a great place to be."
Niche User,5,"I started at Greenville Tech as a dually enrolled Junior in high school. I am now graduating high school and let me just say, the past year has been amazing!! All of the teachers that I have had really care about their students and want to see them succeed. The only catch is that you have to actually do the work that they assign. However, the teachers do understand that life happens, and if you ask politely and with a good attitude, most of them will be willing to find a way to help you out. I highly recommend this school to anyone who is looking for a way to earn some extra college credits while still in high school."
Junior,5,"This is a small college, and very quaint.  In this area, Greenville Tech students have a good reputation for being well trained and prepared for their careers.  I love going to school here.  The Upstate area is growing rapidly, and Greenville Tech does an excellent job at keeping up with the demands, such as degree programs offered and class times, that come with that growth."
Niche User,5,My experience at Greenville Technical College was great! The atmosphere of the college was really nice! Every teacher I had was very helpful and there were plenty of resources offered for whatever need you had!
Sophomore,5,"My teachers were extremely dedicated to their job, they really came out of their way to help me and get the best grade possible in their class. The classes are small and most people take their education seriously. The Brashier and Barton campuses are clean and well taken care of. Happy with this college"
Niche User,5,My experience at Greenville Tech was amazing. The student life center is so helpful to newcomers and anybody who's struggling with financial problems. The TRIO program there is determined to help student's when they have problems with work and money. They told me all you have to do is ask and there's nothing impossible they can't do for you. The campus was so beautiful and full of life. I would like to visit or hopefully attend this college soon.
Sophomore,5,"Greenville Tech is a great school for everyone to study. I finish my second year, and everything is good so far. Because not anybody is really serious about studying, this school has no competition among students. However, the instructors are very nice and willing to help any student. If I have any problems, I can come and ask them. Each student has one adviser, so he or she can email or meet up with the adviser when needing a guide or anything else. I spent my time for studying , that’s all I experienced in Greenville Tech. Again, this school is good enough for everyone. I promise!"
Senior,5,"Greenville Technical College is a great college to attend for classes at the college or for online classes. All of the people in each office are willing to help you as much as needed; whether it be for financial aid, admissions, or general information about the college."
Freshman,5,"So far, the college has been very helpful in many different aspects. I have been able to set up my classes very easily, and have been able to choose from many different class options, including online options. Everyone I have met at Greenville Tech is very nice and extremely patient with questions and concerns."
Freshman,5,"I have just started at GTC, but find the staff very responsive and involved in student success. I received emails with feedback and my guidance counselor even called me to check in with me periodically. You don't find this level of personal attention and responsiveness everywhere, that's for sure!"
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love GVLTEC. This is the best school I have ever attended every. They offer so many resources and options with a very understanding staff. The school is extremely comfortable and I would recommend anyone looking for a good 2-year college to attend here.
Niche User,5,"Great professors, everyone really cares and wants you to succeed! There are plenty of resources like the writing and math centers if you need help with work, as well as 1-on-1 tutoring."

Freshman,5,I like greenville tech and how they take there time to make sure you fully understand the process.my advisor sat down with me to maje the best choice not only for current classes but furthering my career and educayion beyond greenville tech and the option i have. I will be the first in my family to continur my education through college and dont havd a doubt 8n ny mind i cant do it thanks to all the encouragement and support they provide. I definetly believe i mad the right decision starting at a local school like greenville tech.
Sophomore,5,"The teachers at Greenville Tech are absolutely amazing! They are so caring and are always pushing you to do your best. The classrooms settings can vary in size, but the teacher is always present with all the students. Amazing campus, great faculty."
Sophomore,5,"Hello,

I am currently a student at Greenville Technical College and so far my experience has been excellent over all. The professors were very good and attentive and I have learned a lot in all my classes. I think I will see a great return on what I invested in my education while attending there."
Sophomore,5,the teachers are all very knowledgeable in their respective fields. The classes are accomodating. they offer a multitude of learning options like online and written assigenments. Their tutoring services are better and more extensive than most colleges I know.
Freshman,5,"While this will actually be my 1st year attending  greenville technical college.  I have heard so many great things about this school.  I’ve had the pleasure of attending seminars and staying on campus. I found this to be a safe and nurturing environment. The staff and professors are helpful. Everyone was so helpful starting with registration, financial aid, housing and orientation. They tend to go the extra mile to ensure that you know what is expected of you. I’m very excited about starting here for the summer.  I plan to make this a positive learning experience."
Niche User,5,They have been very helpful and straightforward in what I need to do in order to become successfully enrolled in the college.
Junior,5,"Attending Greenville Tech has been a lifesaver for me. I was outed at my previous school and was expelled 6 months before graduation for being gay. Greenville tech accepted me as one of their own, and I am currently enrolled in their nursing school. I am so blessed to have the opportunity to learn here."
Freshman,4,Great School. They have a lot of different types of Programs to attend. Everything from Trade programs to 4 year transfer track course to finish out a 4 year degree at one of the many universities around the area.
Sophomore,4,"The college is great; facilities are clean and well-maintained.  Most teachers care for their students and are able to both challenge them and prepare them for the future, although some teachers, like in any college, are 'difficult.'  Many tutoring and help services exist, as well as the clean and organized McAlister Square, a building with a bookstore (for college textbooks), tuition and fee payment center, university transfer offices, testing rooms, and financial aid counseling services."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience at Greenville Tech was very rewarding.  I learned better than I thought I would in my online classes, and my professors responded to feedback, gave virtual lessons, and administered tests both professionally and efficiently."
Sophomore,4,It is affordable and the education is equivalent to something you would get out of a much bigger college.
Freshman,4,"At first, all of my classes were online until the corona virus came to America. My overall experience with the online classes was okay. It was difficult for me at first but I managed to pull through will passing grades."
Sophomore,4,"During COVID-19, my professors worked very hard to adapt to the challenges and instruct our classes as meaningfully as when face-to-face."
Senior,4,"I have always had great experiences with GTC, I started attending right out of high school in 2010 and have attended off and on ever since. I earned my Associates Degree in Accounting in 2014 and several certifications, have transferred many times but always seem to end up back with them and working towards another degree."
Sophomore,4,"I only took one online course while at Greenville Technical College. It was good and the teacher was kind. All my work was turned in at a timely manner however I did turn in an assignment incorrectly and let the teacher know. He knew this was a first for me and allowed me to turn it in again even though it was technically late. Providing you keep up with your work you should have no problem with the courses. Just make sure you do things before the last minute or else you will struggle. And take note of your teachers contact details in the event of you having questions or not understand assignments.
  I would not change much for the online classes except maybe adding a to do page where it crosses out assignments when you complete them. Not a necessity but could help."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked about Greenville Technical College was the helpfulness of all involved. From administrators, to teachers, and even students everyone works their absolute hardest to help you find any information you maybe searching for. The knowledge that the teachers pass on is great. Most if not all have worked in a professional setting for what ever careers you maybe attempting to start and can give you tips and stories from their own personal experiences. 
  The change I would like to see is more sports interest from the College. I understand we used to have teams for different sports and I would love to bring those back so as I can contribute and spectate our students representing the school in a fantastic way."
Sophomore,4,"I believe Greenville Tech was a great place to attend school. For one thing, you save a lot of money and the classes and professors are great to work with. Overall, Greenville tech is the perfect place to get a degree and not end up completely broke after graduating."
Senior,4,"It's the basic community college experience...alot of high schoolers, people that just got out of high school, parents and older people finishing their college degree.  But it's much more than that the teachers want to help you and want you to finish.  They focus more on you than money, they want to give a great experience."
Alum,4,"I took very few classes online, and the few I did take were well organized and enjoyable. I did have some problems keeping up with coursework, but that was an issue with my personal life, not the school itself."
Freshman,4,Greenville Tech makes it really easy to register for classes. The professors are always professional and thoroughly teach the material. The only thing I would change is that the professors be more informative when teaching hybrid online blend classes when it comes to due dates.
Freshman,4,"Online classes went smoothly, the professors just needed to be more informative on due dates and how to find the assignments."
Alum,4,I took a few hybrid classes that were all very well done. They work constantly to make the online learning platform more user friendly.
Sophomore,4,Greenville Technical School is very affordable and has great pathways for transfer to either clemson or usc upstate.
Niche User,4,i like the therapy section for students. I believe it is helpful for student because we come first and students especially in college can be stressed at times.
Freshman,4,"So far, I have had a wonderful experience as a student at GTC. I will state that the utilization of Blackboard could be better. Some professors do not put assignments in the same area on the website, making it difficult to see a streamlined display of due dates. I have found wonderful support there and look forward to my time preparing for a four year university."
Freshman,4,"Teachers are mostly nice, good rate. Changes their classes a lot, so be careful when regeresting. Nothing to really do on campus. A few good clubs, but most are not together any more."
Freshman,4,Greenville tech is a great stepping stone to start out if you're not ready for a 4 year university. There is a lot of diversity of students of all race and color and the teacher and staff are always available if you need any help. I highly recommend it
Freshman,4,"The campus is very beautiful. The students are happy, and seem to look forward to classes. If I were to change anything, I would change the teacher morale."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school for students who are in their first year of college. The professors and staff are very helpful and strive to make sure students can do their work and stay in school. Overall, wonderful school to attend."
Sophomore,4,"Greenville Tech is a nice community college. The atmosphere is more laid back than that of a four year university. The student services at GTC are generally very helpful when you need some help. College tuition is lower which is nice. Most teachers there are generally interested in helping their students succeed in their class. I have had a few teachers who weren’t very nice, but that’s everywhere. I do like going to Greenville Tech, however I have to transfer because of my major. Would recommend this college for people who don’t want to spend as much and are looking for a smaller more laid back community."
Freshman,4,Greenville tech is a wonderful school. Provides great academics at an affordable cost making it easy to start your degree or continue your education.
Freshman,4,The thing I love the most about Greenville Technical College is the small classroom size. It allows that one on one help between the teacher and the student.
Freshman,4,Greenville Tech has such a wonderful environment and all of the faculty are supportive and want each student to succeed.
Freshman,4,I enjoy Greenville Tech but often feel as if sports should be included whether it is a free basketball scrimmage where anyone can play or something of that nature. They do try to have events on campus but most of the time I miss them due to my classes.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience with Greenville technical college is going great. With my classes, the due dates are a little close together, considering that I have two classes a day, and a full time job. Greenville technical college offers a lot of tutoring and support for anyone who needs help in a certain subject. It's very important to speak up about any issues that you have. ""Closed mouths don't get fed,"" so make sure that you make yourself available when it comes to asking questions."
Freshman,4,I am liking my experience here at GTC. I love how the class sizes are not large and that there is opportunity for one on one student teacher tutoring. They also provide other tutoring services as well as help with academic coaching and helping with transferring to a 4 year university.
Freshman,4,"Easier admissions and financial aide assistance. Classes were easy to access on campus. Professors are willing to work with you regarding assignments. Campus life is not desirable. No sports teams, no campus after class life."
Freshman,4,"i haven't started attending Greenville Tech just yet,  but just being around everyone with such enthusiasm brings me joy. i love just walking through the doors and getting greeted by people who only want to see me succeed. i am forever thankful to have this school near me that i can attend that would help me with the career and education i want and deserve."
Freshman,4,"Greenville Technical College has been great so far! Their student website could use some help, but they are currently in the process of working on that. 
My math professor, Jihan Sarhan, is fantastic, as well as my English professor, Ms. Carbone. Everyone from my advisors, admissions, registration, student disability center, counselors, and even department heads have been so helpful and kind. The students themselves have also been nice and willing to help each other. If you are a dedicated student who needs to save money on tuition, this is a good place to go. They have so many resources available to help their students succeed!
(Any of the areas that I have only given a 3 star rating, is simply because I don't engage in those activities/haven't experienced them yet.)"
Niche User,4,"While most of the courses offered at Greenville Technical College are difficult, the teachers are more than happy to help you with any issues you need assistance with."
Alum,4,"Greenville Technical College is a great place to acquire specific career skills and/or general education credits for transfer. The course work challenges one to think critically while also producing an enlightening environment. There are some really good/dedicated professors and also some really poor professors. There are plenty of resources for varying student needs and  an abundances of opportunities for enhanced learning such as their honors program. Overall, It is a great place to start for reasons concerning cost, unknown major, career training, and plenty of other things."
Niche User,4,"While the classes may be difficult at times, the teachers are very helpful. You may need to ask them for help, but they are always willing to. The campus as well is very nice, but it can get very busy so plan to get there early for parking."
Freshman,4,I like the small college environment and the small ratio of teacher to students.  The college is a good investment for the return of a well-paying job in a technical field.
Freshman,4,Greenville Technical College is a college that is willing to help you with all of your needs and have staff and admistration who want to see you succeed. What I like most Greenville Tech. is that they have allowed me to notice the many other opportunities for my future career that I never knew I had.
Freshman,4,Its a great school for college students who doesn't want to attend an university or for students who just want a certificate and enter the workforce. It has amazing faculty and amazing resources for you to succeed in college and after college.
Freshman,4,"I recently started attending Greenville Tech, going on my second semester now and so far it has been a challenge! There’s very many hard courses that I’m currently taking however The instructors for the CET program  I’m enrolled for have been very helpful and willing just to make sure we as students understand what they’re teaching to us!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoy being a student at Greenville Technical College because of small classroom population. I believe it is both beneficial for students and professors, because it gives you more time to learn each other and be clear on the subject being taught. Unlike your average University where there is a tremendous amount of students being taught by one professor alone. Another reason I think Greenville technical college is great is because of its safety environments. They keep students up to date on things going on around campus and they also really care about student’s safety. Although Greenville Technical College is a safe learning environment I do believe we could make a couple of tweaks in our sporting actives. Such as bring more common sports to our campus for students to join. For example sports such as football, softball, lacrosse, soccer and etc. Other than that my overall opinion about my college is that it’s great."
Niche User,4,"I will be starting at Greenville Technical College this week and have had tons of help singing up for classes, getting books, and meting teachers. So far I have had little problems and cant wait to get started."
Freshman,4,"My, experience with Greenville Technical College was different. I didn't expect to meet new people and some friends, along the way. College, to me is just like going back to high school. The things I have a problem with is certain things that goes on with the housing on campus. I feel like some of the rules need to be changed or respected. Everything, else I'm okay with it."
Sophomore,4,It’s a small school with a big success rate. The teaching staff is friendly and are motivated to help you achieve stardom.
Junior,4,My experience at Greenville technical College has been great. I have had great professors and great academic advisers. They both have encourage me to do and be my best and have help me make clear decisions about my future and which career path to take . I have also had very great learning environments and everyone is very helpful in helping you do and be your best .
Sophomore,4,"They really do want you to succeed here.  It may be difficult at times, but if it were easy then everyone would have a college degree.  It is earned, but they provide you with all you need to make it.  My only complaint is that sometimes the administrative processes, such as getting enrolled and finding out information can be frustrating.  I recommend that every student take the initiative on finding which courses they need etc. and take responsibility for making sure all their paperwork is in order."
Freshman,4,"The college is a medium size community college and the professors are awesome.  They have a system set in place so that you are able to succeed.  If you find yourself needing tutoring, you can always come on campus to get help."
Freshman,4,"Overall, Greenville Technical College is a good school, and it provides many opportunities to students."
Freshman,4,"Even though I took some hard classes and it wasn't easy, my professors helped a lot.  The help I received from tutoring and TRiO was amazing!  I wouldn't have been able to get though without their help."
Freshman,4,"Greenville Technical College is the perfect college to go to if you are trying to save money and making a slow transition into college. I've been going to Greenville Tech for a few years now and I love the relationships I've built with my teachers while attending their classes. Even though college is typically portrayed as a place where you are completely independent, Greenville Tech has done a great job of making sure that students get the assistance they need."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the college as the program I am in, is very hands on and even though it is small scale, it relates in the field in many ways. Teachers are great, although some can be a nuisance."
Freshman,4,Currently enrolled and couldn’t be more excited for the fall. The process of switching here from another school was very smooth thanks to everyone at the school.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my first year of college. I think the campus pointe dorms need to invest in pest control. Greenville Tech needs better math professors. Everytime I got help from a tutoring representative, it was always very helpful."
Niche User,4,"Personally, I have not attended; however, those who have and enjoyed their time and courses that have taken there."
Senior,4,"I currently go for Mechatronics and GVT has a stellar program (best in the upstate). Teachers are very caring and push for your best, teach you what you need to know, and work with your outside life which can sometimes be a pain. I appreciate all the hard work and hope to see the program grow more."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing teacher and good selection of academic programs and opportunities, have some very challenging classes but offer amazing tutoring. Beautiful campus just wish that there was more parking spots available per building"
Freshman,4,"Overall, the school is a great school with so many activities and benefits on-site to enrolled students AND faculty!  For a small public, 2 year school, they have a lot of majors and certificates to go for, along with easy college transfer capabilities. Definitely check the school out."
Sophomore,4,It is currently my 1st year at this school and the people here are extremely kind. I feel different yet so welcomed. I love the diversity here. There are people from all over the world and it is fascinating learning about their cultures when we get the chance to talk.
Freshman,4,"I’m in the aircraft maintenance program here at Greenville tech. I love this program and it is held to the highest standard, for the rest of the campus is a different story."
Freshman,4,This is an excellent school to start at before going to a four year school. They have numerous resources for tutoring and academic coaching to help you succedd. The instructors are fabulos
Sophomore,4,"I am extremely satisfied with my decision to attend Greenville Technical College's transfer program. The classes affordable, but still offer enough of a challenge. The teachers and advisors genuinely want to help students succeed."
Freshman,2,"Awful school. It is a community college that tries to act like it is a 4-year ivy league. I came here to try to save money, be warned, it is not worth it. You get the education you pay for and since tuition is half price the teaching seems to be less than average. Teachers for gen-ed classes are spotty at best and some are downright terrible and should not be teaching at all. Social life is non-existent and the campus is decrepit and old. If you go here be sure to go on rate my professor BEFORE you sign up for classes, not all teachers are bad, but the ones that are are awful."
Sophomore,2,"There is no program in place if you drop below a 2.0 average, they leave you hanging out to dry until you bring your GPA back over a 2.0"
Sophomore,2,Greenville tech was okay. Some of the teachers are just plain bad. Always check rate my professor.  Other students are nice and the school is very accommodating and cheap.
Freshman,2,"I am a single mother and I did online school through Greenville tech. At first, it was good but it continually had issues with the calendar, for example, I would turn in my assignments into blackboard and then get told I turned it in late because of the calendar isn't correct and I would lose out on getting a grade. I also had a lot of trouble getting signed up for classes. Every semester I would try and meet up with my counselor after exams and he was the hardest person to get ahold of, he only communicated my email and even then he didn't respond in a timely manner. It would at least take him a week to respond to me."
Freshman,2,"I think they need more teachers, because I was lost on were to go to class and were to find more info about the class work."
College Junior,2,The services provided to find jobs outside of work study is horrendous.
College Junior,2,"Im just using this school for basic transfer credits, since the college specializes more in mechanical/engineering fields."
College Junior,2,"The college isn't really geared towards my major, but I make do with taking as many language classes as I can."
College Freshman,2,"Greenville Tech has the worse instructors, majority of them don't even know what thier doing. As well as my advisors never help me with anything, I had to get one of the math professors to help me sign up for my Spring classes because I was so confused  by what I should do or take. Hopefully will be transferring out soon!"
College Junior,2,It's a typical Technical College.
College Junior,2,They way the twist the way scholarships work is ridiculous!
College Junior,2,Not many internship of job opportunities. Programs are limited.
College Junior,2,Professors aren't the best. Seem like they hate their job.
College Freshman,2,My overall experience rating explains what i think about this
College Senior,2,The financial aid services are a major headache. They do not communicate with the advising staff so it is a hassle to try and get anything done.
College Junior,2,The process of trying to get aid is horrible. I have made multiple trips to and from the college and have been told several different stories and given different directions on what to do. I never get to see the same officer and they do not communicate well with each other. I have left the office in tears a couple of times because of the back and forth treatment.
College Sophomore,2,"I wish they had more scholarships available, also you have to pay a lot out of your pocket if your married."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like Greenville Technical College main focus is academics! We have all the main and basic resources a student needs, such as a library, computer labs, student center, and tutoring areas. We don't have an athletic center and campus activities are rare. Even though we do have some organizations you don't here much about it."
College Sophomore,2,I do not believe I have heard of one student activity since I began attending this school.
College Sophomore,2,"The student body is almost a reflection of Greenville county schools system itself, a lot of unmotivated and lazy students with a glimpse of hardworking students among the crowd."
Sophomore,1,"I didn't take any online classes, but if I they would probably be as horrible as the in-class classes. 

JUST STAY THE HELL AWAY!"
Sophomore,1,"When the pandemic happened Greenville tech was on spring break and the students was told not to return. We ended up doing online classes and at the time I only had 2 courses that I was taking which was English and Math. My English teacher actually got on the web came during our regular lecture hours and talk to us for about 45mins Tuesdays and Thursdays. My math teacher was older and the class was a fast track class which means that everyday we learned a new lesson and every week we had a test. Due to the teacher not really being tech savvy I did not pass . I went from physically being in a class to completely trying to teach myself, which did not go well."
Sophomore,1,"The only good thing about this school is the cost. The admissions process is slow and no one followed up with you. The housing is horrible.  If you do decide to attend I would only do online.
And who ever they contracted out for security at those so called dorms they need to do a background check on some of those people.  Dorms get broken into,  and even Flood. Horrible"
Niche User,1,"Stay away.  That's the only advice you need. 

Truly the worst institution ever. Refuses to answer phone calls or to return messages. 
Makes a decision without collecting all of the facts. 
Ignores common decency in favor of money. 
Believes that it is always right - will not make any concession for errors on its part. 

STAY AWAY - there is always a better alternative. Take a class online or find an actual college. NOTHING is worth having to deal with this lying, cheating and subpar institution."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have already earned a Bachelor's degree with a 3.8 GPA, so I'm accustomed to the Academic environment. I'm not complaining because I'm not doing well.  I am hoping to warn students who don't have a Bachelor's Degree and expect to reduce their college costs by going to Greenville Tech for the first couple years.

Background on my experience: 

I am going back to school, because I didn't want to pursue a career in the first fields I studied.  I am taking the prerequisite courses for a nursing program.  I am taking three classes at GVL TEC (one entirely online, one is a hybrid online/inperson, and one entirely in person).  

My experience: 

Two of my three professors are, by far, the worst professors I've every had. I am doing well in the classes, but they are very frustrating and are not providing anything that studying on my own would not.  

The hybrid class professor is disorganized.  She has sent out multiple documents that she requests us to print (i.e. syllabi, course schedules, etc.) then we recognize significant errors or typos that requires the document to be replaced."
College Junior,1,None. No services that I know of.
College Junior,1,"Logic is a class that is required for transfer to the college in which I want to earn my Bachelor's degree.  This class was only offered online, not in a classroom.  I paid for the privilege of teaching myself and the few times I tried to communicate with my professor it took days for him to respond.  This is the only online class I have taken at Greenville Tech, and hope to think this is not a regular experience.  However, I will NOT be taking anymore online classes because of this experience."
College Freshman,1,"My progress and success at the school has been wonderful but I don't account any of that to the school, most has been personal drive and family/ friend support. The school has no interest as a whole to keep students drive going and helping them be successful."
College Freshman,1,"Not Ideal for Intenational Business Majors – The only reason I came here was to take my general education courses so that I can transfer to the University of South Carolina - Columbia to major in International Business. While my freshman year's courses were available at the community college for transfer, they do not have many of the general business courses that I need, nor does Greenville Technical College offer French or any other foregin language past the 100 level."

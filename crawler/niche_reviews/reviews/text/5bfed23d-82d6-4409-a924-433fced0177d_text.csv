Junior,5,"Kuyper is a wonderful school if you are looking for a great community and caring faculty and staff. All of the professors know almost every student and are willing to work with the students. They want to see the student exceed in life and go off to have a great career after graduation. The staff at Kuyper are willing to have lunch with you in the dining hall and get to know more than just a student. The atmosphere on campus is warm and welcoming, there is always a smiling face on campus and someone willing to talk to you or help you out.
The academic offerings are amazing. I sit in awe during class as the professors know so much about what they are teaching and if it does not make sense to you they are willing to explain it better to you. They also don't make you feel dumb or stupid if you don't understand, they know that you are here to learn and that you are not going to know everything that they know."
Freshman,5,"Kuyper College is a place where you want to be! Culturally involved, building community, becoming a family around Christ. Everyone is welcomed with open arms and love here."
College Sophomore,5,Kuyper College is school that challenges you to think about you faith and who you are as a person. The courses are challenging but there is always someone willing to help.
College Sophomore,5,The professors at Kuyper are the best! They are all incredibly knowledgeable in their fields and know how to communicate that knowledge effectively. They treat their students with the utmost respect and look at them as individual people and not faces in a crowd. I feel welcomed and appreciate every time I go to class.
College Freshman,5,one building for academics if you have a class at 2 you can leave your dorm at 1:58
College Sophomore,5,"It's very positive to be in my major, I feel as though there is a small enough group of us that we can be close-knit and help each other along.  Also, the workload isn't unbearable and the professors are great."
College Sophomore,5,The parking fee is minimal (much less than expected) and I have yet to not find a spot and I never walk more than 100 yards or so.
College Sophomore,5,"Kuyper accommodates both hard work and needed rest very well. Former Kuyper students say they come back to the Zondervan Library because of its’ high quality staff; wonderful librarians are ready to “serve you.” The writing center and many electronic and hardcopy resources also aid in and enrich research and writing. Outside of the library, Kuyper’s wooded surroundings, chapel and various in/outdoor sitting areas help students re-zone and ease stress."
College Senior,5,We have a very high range of different personalities and backgrounds at Kuyper College. We even have people who come from other countries to study at Kuyper College. It is a very welcoming school were people are very accepting and loving.
College Sophomore,5,The students and staff are open to communicate with all races. Everyone is open to their own opinion.
College Junior,5,"I am an English major, and I have been very pleased with the program thus far. The professors that teach the main courses are well qualified and challenge students to dig deeper than surface interpretations of the reading. The workload can get a bit overwhelming at times, but nothing impossible. 
The best part about the English program at Kuyper is that it requires two semesters of internships, a requirement that I was unable to find at the other schools I had considered. It's nice to know that this program has a career path in mind."
College Junior,5,"Kuyper College is a dry campus, so no drugs, alcohol, or tobacco is present and students don't bring these onto campus."
College Junior,5,Kuyper College offers a variety of programs and they work hard to make sure all the programs are up to date and great. I love the small-ness of the classes and the professors go out of their way to help you succeed.
College Junior,5,"No matter what is going on with the weather, students always find a way to have fun. During the winter we go sledding at the dunes and in the summer soccer or beach volleyball. When it's raining, we dance!"
College Sophomore,5,"Always There – Kuyper College has a lot of options for students.  You can tell that the staff cares.  Most students eat food they buy themselves a lot, but the cafeteria is always there and the food is pretty good."
College Freshman,5,"Always Something to Do!! WE ARE NOT A PARTY SCHOOL!! We do good things to build community. Things like game nights, holiday-themed events, and so many other activities to get to know eachother and just have a good time."
College Freshman,5,"Every person has their own style and look and its pretty neat. No one is judging based on what someone looks like, people are kind-hearted and care for eachother. On such a small campus, everybody knows everybody and its great to walk down the halls and recognize every face you see- and know most of their names too. And honestly, there's great guys and girls here to date, but that's not the goal of the school-nor is having a relationship why we're at Kuyper!"
Junior,4,"We use a site called Sakia. It is easy to navigate and understand the student side. Some of the professors have a hard time understanding what to do. This is understandable because the staff wants to teach more in person and create a relationship with the student, which is hard to do over online learning. They also partner with other schools to offer classes online that they might not teach. They are willing to help you find classes that will help you with your degree online and help you get a more well-rounded education."
Freshman,4,"I love the close knit group of people. As well as the student-to-professor ratio is quite the advantage of Kuyper, to make the academics very focused and intentional."
Freshman,4,"I loved that as someone who is both working and married, they offered so much to do online and were so consistent, conscious, and intentional with their teaching methods."
Sophomore,4,"Kuyper College is an amazing institution. This is the place for those who want to be cared for and have the most personalized college experience. The community is superb and full of love. Communication for dual enrolled students is lacking, but is fairly there."
Sophomore,4,"Online experience is great! It is tougher when taking Bible and Theology courses, but is overall well."
College Sophomore,4,Drug use is a very minimal issue at Kuyper.
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the small-school atmosphere at Kuyper, and the ease with which I am able to build relationships within the student body. The students Kuyper attracts all have similar goals and passions, and it is a joy to be surrounded by a family that will both push me towards excellence and walk that same road with me. 

The professors are kind, intelligent, understanding, and well-equipped to prepare us with the knowledge we need to succeed. On several occasions I have had professors go out of their way to email or stop me in the halls to encourage me on a personal level. Not only do they each know me by name, but they remember details about my life and take time to invest in me both in and out of the classroom. 

The Kuyper campus is beautiful, and with only one academic building, all classrooms are less than a 3-minute walk away. 

Faculty and staff are also warm and engaging, ready to answer questions and point in the right direction as needed."
College Freshman,4,Kuyper has a wonderful close-knit community and all the professors are invested in the students success. Kuyper is preparing me and equipping me with all the tools that are necessary to succeed after college and everybody takes care of one another.
College Junior,4,They keep a good balance between justice and mercy.
College Junior,4,Grand Rapids is very welcoming and friendly atmosphere with a lot of fun things to do.
College Junior,4,"There is a huge range of off campus dining available, and a lot of unique and delicious and reasonably priced food."
College Junior,4,The dorms and apartments are very spacious. The housing lottery is easy.
College Junior,4,There is a broad variety and a lot of unique places to go that are not too far away.
College Junior,4,"The financial aid office was wonderful to work with, and when I did not have sufficient funds to come, they put together a forum to look over my situation and awarded me extra money to provide me the means to come."
College Sophomore,4,Grand Rapids has many great dining options.
College Sophomore,4,Because of the small campus the weather does not have much affect.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of places in the Grand Rapids area close to the school that are reasonably priced.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very accepting of race, economic status, and political beliefs."
College Sophomore,4,Ask for help from the wonderful financial advisors.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a wide variety of students at Kuyper. There are stylish, hipsters, nerds, jocks, and homeschoolers. Even with the variety and apparent differences, everyone gets along and respects each other."
College Sophomore,4,Kuyper College provides variety of majors that all have an integrated Christian perspective. I greatly appreciate having a Christian worldview applied in every topic. The History program is great. Even though  Kuyper does not offer a specific History major they have a collaborative program with Cornerstone University. This provides students the opportunity to take the majority of their classes at Kuyper but receive their major from Cornerstone University. I appreciate Kuyper's flexibility.
College Senior,4,"Amazing professors,  very available and very transparent."
College Senior,4,"Amazing professors,  Heavy workload, I feel ready for graduate studies."
College Freshman,4,"Nothing wrong with it, it is a small campus not much to do"
College Junior,4,"our school prides itself on diversity. we have a very diverse campus and though our school is founded on a specific Christianity, they are open and accepting to all genera of Christianity be in nondenominational, Methodist, or Evangelist. "
College Junior,4,"we are near Grand Rapids and there are constantly activities going on there such as Blues on the Mall, Art Fest, Laugh Fest, etc. There are also a lot of places to shop that are cheap and affordable to college students"
College Junior,4,"there is a lot of apartment choices near the college, there are also a variety of places to shop and eat in the area as well as a lot of entertainment including parks and movie theater."
College Sophomore,4,"Because I need to take the highway to get to Kuyper it can sometimes be difficult to get there in a reasonable amount of time in the winter, both because the road conditions can be poor and because of traffic through Grand Rapids."
College Sophomore,4,"There is hardly any public transportation available to Kuyper students, but it is not necessary because of the small size of the school."
College Sophomore,4,"Each of the dorm buildings has a community area that students can hang out, cook or study in. The pool table is a popular accommodation. Each dorm building also has its own lab with a few computers and printer, and all you need to use the laundry room is your own soap. The community atmosphere is casual, friendly and fun."
College Sophomore,4,"The Film and Digital Media major (a co-operative program with nearby Cornerstone University) has begun to open my eyes to the many ways and methods by which the media (print, radio, movies, news, TV etc.) often subtly but powerfully influence a person’s life, as they interact with and are exposed to them. A student in the program learns and practices how to use them to create and share messages in powerful visual ways; has opportunity to conduct their own research on select media and influence; and more."
College Sophomore,4,"I had a lot of stress and many incomplete, undone or late assignments due to trying to do everything perfect. I found it hard to understand that other students got their work done and still had time to enjoy things. Going to professors to talk helped me to better understand their expectations, and the writing center helped me greatly with papers. The on-campus counseling for students also helped me through. Finally, several wise and seasoned students (upperclassmen and RA’s especially) provided valuable insight, encouragement, and some quality mentorship. 
In summary, the work is doable; if a student struggles, help is there, if they go to the right places."
College Sophomore,4,"Grand Rapids and its' surrounding areas is full of all kinds of opportunities. If you're looking for entertainment, there's plenty to do such as movies & restaurants, festivals, the zoo etc. Grocery stores, supermarkets and ethnic shopping centers are plentiful. There are also plenty of places to look if you need a job (many of which post positions on the internet), and many ministries if you're interested in volunteering. Grand Rapids is a cool place to be!"
College Sophomore,4,"There is very little (if any) drug or alcohol activity on campus at Kuyper, aside from smoking, which is not much and kept out of main campus areas. To my knowledge, there is no drug or alcohol usage."
College Sophomore,4,"The parking situation is pretty good. A small campus, lots are distributed around the whole school. Staying ticket-free is pretty easy as long as you follow the parking regulations. Some primary tips are: 1) clearly and properly display your permit; 2) know where your permit type allows you to park; 3) don’t park in the lots at night where it’s restricted (times are given); and 4) keep your bumper clear of the sidewalk curb in winter (for snow blowers). Campus security should tell you all you need to know, and they're quite friendly and helpful if you have any questions."
College Senior,4,"The dining hall food is delicious. However, like most colleges, it does get tiring and it is nice to make your own food too. Get a smaller meal plan after freshman year so you can make your own healthier meals."
College Junior,4,"One new thing about Kuyper that is kind of unique is Scholar Day - and event that is held at the end of each semester in which presenters talk about and discuss projects that they have worked on, papers they have written, and so many other awesome things related to scholarship. One semester is dedicated to student scholarship, while another is for faculty scholarship. It's a great opportunity to gather together as a community and be excited about scholarship."
College Junior,4,"For the most part the academics at Kuyper are wonderful. I feel adequately challenged in most of my classes, and the professor's do a great job of teaching in a way that gets you excited about the material. The only classes I have not had such a positive experience in were classes that aren't exactly standard at a Bible College, but are required for general education credits (i.e. human biology)"
College Sophomore,4,It has been snowing a lot lately but there is not much of a problem. Students just have to becareful when walking and driving. Classes are walking distance so there isn't really a complaint to make.
College Junior,4,"The program is great, I'm learning a lot, would definitely do it again! I'm a Music and Worship major and they prepare you well for leading worship in a contemporary church, though not necessarily for a more traditional service, which isn't a good thing in my opinion. It's a fairly small program at Kuyper so that limits some of the things we would like to do, but overall its good. Every program is going to have some requirements that are kind of silly, and this one is no exception, but it's not too many ""useless"" credits."
College Junior,2,"Its average.  Not terrible, but they don't have tons of variety or good quality food. Pretty typical cafeteria food."
College Senior,2,"Slow networks, firewalls crash server all the time."
College Freshman,2,not a lot of school spirit or student involvement 
College Sophomore,2,Not Much Option – The school has four cars you can rent if you really need to. Everything a student needs is only about four miles from the school so a lot of students that don't have cars end up walking.  Most students have to carpool.
College Freshman,1,the only Greek we have is the class

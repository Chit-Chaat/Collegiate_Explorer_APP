Junior,5,I took classes online and in person and I think all of the professors were very open and willing  to work with you. They are all easily approachable with any questions and adjustments.
Junior,5,"I love that st. cloud state is very close together, everyone is willing to help out anyone. I love that the university is close to the city. I think the school is very inclusive and has something for everyone."
Niche User,5,I had to finish all of my spring semester classes online due to COVID-19. I did not have any difficulties adjusting to the online format because my professors were very helpful and understanding.
Senior,5,I felt that St. Cloud State University has been very good at helping me and other students with pursuing their college careers. All of the professors and educators want to see me and my peers succeed.
Junior,5,I recently transferred to St. Cloud State and my experience was very satisfying. The staff in charge of transfer students were very helpful in providing instructions for tasks that needed to be completed as well as providing great academic counseling. I am excited to finish my undergraduate schooling at this university and I can't wait to take on the full experience.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy St Cloud State University. It somehow is a combination of the college experience and the smaller ""family"" feel. I get to know almost all the students in my classes and often times have multiple classes with the same people. The professors are very dedicated to helping their students be successful and work extremely hard to work around real life issues their students are trying to attend school around."
Freshman,5,"It was super fun and I recommend St. Cloud to anyone who wants to go to college, everything about it is so beautiful whether it's about the people or the environment, the dorms also are small but they are comfortable enough to live in, I live with my friend and we have been friends since third grade but I would recommend doing that or getting a random roommate even if that is scary, it gives you a chance to meet someone new and make new friends."
Freshman,5,"I'd Like to see Garvey get an upgrade. It is a very nice campus for the scenery. There has been multiple sexual harassments which id like to see go down but, all in all, a very nice place. The professors are always helpful and always look out for you."
Sophomore,5,"It's a very accepting and welcoming school! Most professors are great, and the campus is very accessible."
Sophomore,5,Loved my professors and the atmosphere of the college. I feel that you have to get involved with meeting people early on or you will stay isolated for much of your college experience.
Junior,5,"Coming to St. Cloud has been such a great experience for me. It was a little bit of a shock coming from a different state and not not knowing anyone here. Luckily ""Minnesota Nice"" is really a thing, I made friends within my first few hours on campus and haven't had a problem since. The small classes are extremely helpful in terms of learning and being able to get to know your professor and peers around you. The buildings are well kept and the school does an excellent job at keeping you involved. On St Cloud's campus they are always doing farmers market, barbecues, raffles, special late night events just for students, sporting events and so much more. There is always something going on, on campus! And even if you miss it, they do a great job of advertising for the next upcoming events. GO Huskies!"
Graduate Student,5,"I like the classes and the extracurricular activities a lot. I would like it if St. Cloud State University had more cameras on the outside of their buildings, especially by the student parking lots so it'll catch thieves on the cameras."
Junior,5,"St. cloud state University is a very Diverse and accepting place to go to college, The programs and majors offered here have professors that really care about your education and your future success in your field."
Freshman,5,I am having a great experience with St. Cloud State! My professors are very friendly and willing to help me work hard to get better. I have had no problems with the university.
Freshman,5,My overall experience there was amazing. The environment is very welcoming. People there are very open to getting to know you. There are so many organizations you could join and I guarantee that you will never feel left out. I am currently in an organization called ASA and we throw a lot of fun events and activities. I wish it was more diverse though.
Sophomore,5,It’s grate you need to work hard and try your best and they will help you as best they can. The people are grate and you can get scholarships. There are a lot of resources here for you successfully have a grate year.
Niche User,5,currently im a freshman in high school so i havent ever been to st.cloud state but we have had college repersentitives in our school couincler room and from what i hear it seems very plesent campise life seems good and the cost with finantial aid should be affordibul im looking forward to going there!!!
Sophomore,5,"The thing I love most about St. Cloud State University is how diverse it is here. I see everyone of all ethnicities walking past me as I go to class. I believe the diversity here is amazing because you get a different point of view from every person you find, and all the stereotypes about different races go away in your head when you actually get to speak to them and learn about their experience and choices here in St. Cloud. 

Something I would love to see be improved would be the way students cross the road. There has not been one time besides late evening where I see students cross roads without looking or without walking on the white lines. But other than that, St. Cloud State University is an amazing college and I’m very proud to be attending and to call myself a Husky."
Freshman,5,"There's a large, diverse, supportive international community which allows most students to involve into cultural affairs. St. Cloud State University also provides several study-abroad opportunities and encourages student exchange."
Senior,5,St. Cloud is a good university! Very diverse. The professors I’ve had are great and very helpful! Great university to attend.
Senior,5,"I personally have been to 4 different colleges, two being in different states. I have never felt more welcomed or more supported with my education. I am currently enrolled in the nursing program and the professors are amazing. They truly go out of their way to help a student succeed. I cannot speak more highly of the nursing program here. 
A major downfall of the campus is the parking situations (as almost all colleges), but this college has worked out a way for it to work better. They have a shuttle that runs from the furthest lot into the Wick (the science building) which is close to most of the academic buildings. If you do not want to park on campus or cannot there is a drop off at the library for the city busing services."
Niche User,5,I love St. Cloud State i will be attending this next fall. The city has a very clean layout and the people in the town are one of a kind.
Freshman,5,I liked all the opportunities the university had to offer. I especially liked the fact that they partnered with my high school to allow students to start their freshman early through their PSEO program.
Senior,5,"Honestly, I do not understand why there is so much criticism towards St. Cloud State University. Coming from Florida, I moved here for the hospitality program and have been nothing but successful. I left behind my family, friends, and comfort of everything that I knew. I completely started over with nothing to work with, but this school has been great to me. I have worked multiple jobs full-time throughout my time here, so I haven't been involved in much on campus, but there is so much offered that I could participate on any given day. The campus is beautiful, the dorms are actually much nicer than they are given credit for, and the academics are definitely worth what you are paying. I have loved every minute of this school and hope others in the future do too."
Niche User,5,About to transfer but looking into the program. It looks excellent.  I've been looking at the Real Estate program and it is the most affordable and gives me the best opportunities to excel in my career from all angles.
Freshman,5,"Now that my first year is almost over, I absolutely love this college, and I am 100% satisfied with my decision to come here for college."
Freshman,5,iThereis 1 thing that I wish would change at the college and that is the cost. It is pretty high and I'm worried about not having enough money for my second semester. Niche please help me I would greatly appreciate that.
Junior,5,It is a great university and am into my 2nd year and hopefully expecting to accomplish something great here
Sophomore,5,The best thing I liked about St. Cloud State University is the diverse communities of the student from all around the globe.
Sophomore,5,saint cloud state university is the center for international students. the university provides lots of opportunities including abroad studies. as i am an international student; i felt like i made the right choice for my first experience.
Senior,5,"St. Cloud State University is a diverse and welcoming atmosphere that challenges students to become the best they can be, academically as well as personally. The professors, students, advisors, and so many more easily help you become the student you are destined to be."
College Sophomore,5,My school is very diverse and they are people of all different sexual orientations. They are accepted and they have many clubs for them to participate in.
College Sophomore,5,Our sporting events and games are the best and I know our school is very popular with athletics because my school is always on the radio or big screen.
College Junior,5,"The Hockey team is amazing and does very well every year, students get heavily involved."
College Freshman,5,I had a very pleasant experience with my campus housing at St. Cloud State. The rooms were very spacious and had great amenities. The social atmosphere is really enjoyable and the people were great to room by. The cost was very reasonable and wasn't a concern for me.
College Freshman,5,Wide variety of classes and the teachers are great. All the people that go to class are atleast trying to have an education.
College Student,5,"As a freshmen in my first year of college. I found this experience very surprising, because this changed my mind of what I saw in this town. A bunch of my friends were very encouraging for me to see the different side of the town and I did many different clubs that I had so many friends and I got involved to help my community to make my campus a better place to live for everyone. The professors I have taken were very helpful and guileful for my successions this school year. The classroom size is a good size for understanding, these professors will remember the students names. I would tell my friends from Minot North Dakota to go to my university and enjoy the life of a college student. Do it at SCSU!"
College Freshman,5,Public safety is always around.
College Freshman,5,I am a part of Delta Zeta and I love it!
College Freshman,5,"Our athletics are fairly important to the students. We have a very successful Division 1 hockey team, and a facility named after one of the most famous person in Olympic history. Most of our athletic focus is on hockey due to their success and facility."
College Freshman,5,Huge variety of classes. Professors are passionate with their work.
College Freshman,5,"D1 hockey is great SCSU. The student section is always packed. I'm friends with athletes and nonathletes, so it isn't really big on campus."
College Freshman,5,"It is a great experience. The classes are very informative, and the professors are very passionate in their work."
College Junior,5,The students show a lot of school spirit at the hockey games.
Recent Alumnus,5,"SCSU takes safety and security very seriously. Drugs and alcohol are barely noticeable on campus, except for hockey games, but they have a permit to legally sell beer at games, and all ids are checked to verify age. SCSU even has a UChoose Program, which is a policy enforcement to put ""caught"" students on probation, and to discuss how to stay sober. Depending on the severity of the crime, students may or may not be charged for a drug or alcohol violation."
College Freshman,5,I feel the security really tight over here in saint cloud. Sexual assault is almost gone here. If it happens than the victim would be justified.
College Freshman,5,"This school has a lot of extra curricular activities to do. Professors are friendly so, its easy to communicate with teachers. It is very diverse, a lot of people from different countries so i can learn new culture and thoughts."
Recent Alumnus,5,SCSU is a very diverse campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are accredited programs offered.
Recent Alumnus,5,This school is very welcoming and cares about the students.
College Freshman,5,"Although Greek life at SCSU is not very big, it is something that still impacts many people. As being a member of the Greek community we do many things for the school and the community. We often encourage each other in our academics, as well as our non-Greek friends. We put on many philanthropy events for the community to come see what it is exactly that we wish to achieve. Non-Greeks many times miss interpret t Greek life and the Greek as a community. As a Greek Community we often make it very clear what we are all about and what our mission really is. We make sure students know Greek life is not how it is portrayed in movies, or whatever else they may thing. Greek life really is another family, who come together to make our community better."
College Junior,5,Affordable education that covers a wide variety of classes; You get what you put in and it all depends on how are you are willing to work.
College Junior,5,"Great community feeling, it's a large school that feels small!"
College Sophomore,5,My professors made learning very easy and enjoyable!
College Junior,5,I really like the staff. In general they are helpful and know what they are talking about. The campus is pretty diverse and accepting of differences between people.
College Junior,5,I have nothing negative to say about the school. A couple of the teachers need to retire.
College Freshman,5,"I really like the teachers and most of their methods of teaching. You have to work hard and be independent to get good grades. I think they are pretty good at transitioning you into college classes, in the 100 level courses, from high school."
College Freshman,5,They have a great career center that will help you with anything from writing a resume to applying to graduate school.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. They put a lot of effort in making it a safe environment
College Freshman,5,There is no reason to live on campus and pay through the nose when there are so many options off campus that are really cheap. Maybe not the safest but you learn to lock things up and take precautions to protect yourself and your possessions
Senior,4,I have taken a variety of classes online and most of them have gone very well. Most of the professors are very good at having the correct content up on the online page (D2L) in a timely manner.
Junior,4,"As Covid-19 hit, our school worked hard to give students the best possible experience as we had to transition over to virtual learning. Obviously, we all had to learn as we went along, so it wasn't perfect, but it was the best it could have been."
Junior,4,"I went here for my first two years of my college journey. It is always scary to go somewhere new, especially when you're use to a big city like Minneapolis then transitioning to a smaller community and different environment. Once I arrived on move in day, that fear went away. I was welcomed to a very diverse student population, open minded individuals, and a staff and faculty that care a lot about the success of their students. I was very happy I started my journey here. There are so many opportunities for students to get involved with their peers, events that give you a reason to get out of your dorm room, and so much fun to have. On top of the many perks this school has, the education and teaching style here is equal to some of the best universities in the country. Class sizes aren't overwhelming, professors care about the well being of their students and push them to their maximum potential, and you will never be left behind if you aren't catching on as good as other students."
Niche User,4,"I had a great experience at St Cloud State. I was able to take all the classes I wanted, and I learned a lot. I enjoyed studying at the library, which had nice quiet spaces. However, some of my professors’ teaching styles were not as engaging and hands-on as I would have liked."
Freshman,4,"Even though Saint Cloud State was not my first pick for a college, I rather enjoy campus life and being a college student there. The dorms are nice and almost everyone around campus is super friendly! I've met a lot of cool people and it's been a really nice experience overall! The only part I'm not too big on is the campus dining hall, the food is okay at best, but most of the time it's pretty bland. I'm not too much of a picky eater though, so it doesn't bother me too much."
Freshman,4,"Initially, I did not start out taking online courses. However, because of the covid-19 virus hitting my first semester of college, all of the students were kind of forced to resort to online courses for the remainder of the semester. I think my school adapted very well for the most part. It was stressful, and obviously communication online is not nearly as effective as person to person, but my professors did well in contacting us by email for updates as well as just checking in with how we were doing in the course."
Junior,4,I enjoy the classes. I also enjoy how easy it is to talk to advisors. They are very helpful and you can really tell that they want you to succeed.
Junior,4,I take all online classes. I enjoy how the classes are structured. You can tell that the teachers want you to succeed and they do everything they can to make that happen.
Senior,4,"I went to SCSU for two years to get a Bachelor's degree, majoring in Economics and minoring in Finance, so I'll only really be speaking about those classes. Overall, the teachers felt dedicated to their students and were very approachable when you had issues with the materials. A lot of my professors even went out of their way to meet with me on days they weren't supposed to be there to help me with confusing material. Overall, great teachers, but food options are very lacking and dorms are expensive. You won't find much to do on campus except schoolwork, unless you're in a club."
Niche User,4,"I liked all the interesting classes at St. Cloud State. I also enjoyed meeting many new people from different backgrounds and being part of a diverse group of students. However, I wish the school was cleaner and more modern."
Freshman,4,"I like that the tuition is not very expensive and the University has many tutoring services and great professors. There is some diversity, but not a lot. The food at the cafeteria is ok and doable, but some students do not like it. But I like the food there. Food is diverse and has sections."
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a ""bang for your buck"" school. The academics aren't the most challenging but you can't scrape by without putting in an effort. My classes have been very interconnected, with one concept from one course bleeding into other courses. The staff are very helpful and respectful. Campus hours are very flexible as are the professor's schedules for meetings. I live in an off-campus apartment affiliated with the school and the staff here are very supportive and responsive. They let you know well in advance of any rule changes, room checks, or vacation break rules. Overall, I would recommend this school to anyone who's looking for a well-rounded institution."
Sophomore,4,My experience with college is I have to have a good effort by getting good grades. SCSU is a very fun school to stay for 4 years. You can go to tutoring for homework help on the subject you get stuck on. I will you can make friend on the first of the college year.
Senior,4,"St. Cloud State University is a great college for many reasons. Some of the reasons being, how diverse it is, the different career paths they offer for each major/minor, the helpfulness of faculty/staff to students, the activities around campus to get students involved and the overall atmosphere of the university. One thing I would like to see change at SCSU would be that universities approach in athletics and how they view student-athletes."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Saint loud State University. It was the best two years of my life. I met my best friend through this university and got a well rounded education. If you are looking for  great and affordable school, this is the place for you."
Freshman,4,"My experience at SCSU has been good so far. With all the online tools, its easy to be in the loop on everything."
Sophomore,4,"Campus can be tricky to navigate.  Profs are very good and easy to work with.  Was pleasantly surprised with the veterans resource center.  Being a veteran, tasks can be difficult to manage."
Senior,4,"I chose St. Cloud State because I wanted to swim in college somewhere not around my hometown. I like the campus because it isn't as big as a lot of other schools where I'm from. I love being on the team there, they have become part of my family. The classes are decent, depending on the major. I'm a biomedical science major, so my classes are pretty nice."
Niche User,4,"I studied here through their PSEO program and overall I am very happy with my time here. The PSEO coordinators and faculty were very helpful and informational guiding me through my transition. The professors that I had very very educated in what they taught, accessible outside the classroom, and truly cared about me and my classmates. The campus is decent, very pretty in the fall, but kind of monotonous during the winter. The food offered in Atwood is pretty good, limited options albeit, but you get what you pay for. Overall, I'd say my time here was pretty good; it wasn't exceptional, but it did the job."
Freshman,4,St. Cloud State is a great school with fun activities for their students and great opportunities for their futures. Many of the professors are upbeat and advisers are always there to help. The buildings on campus are a little but out dated but can easily be looked pass. Overall I enjoy my time being a huskie at St. Cloud State University!
Alum,4,"This is one of the larger schools outside of the University of Minnesota. This is a diverse community allowing lots of student interaction. The school has been working to upgrade facilities, allowing more resources for students."
Alum,4,"Very accessible professors, many choices for classes and set on the banks of the Mississippi River. If you like hockey, then this may be your place."
Freshman,4,"I admire that, the helpers are very helpful. I also love that they have tutoring centers for those that need help with their academics and those that get very distracted easily in classrooms. It's also very affordable for a 4 year college specifically some people are in the low income range."
Senior,4,"St. Cloud State offers a very close community when you find involvement on campus. My experience here was very worthwhile even I had faced many challenges during my college years, there were so many outside resources for students to reach out for any help needed. The faculty/staff and advisors do a really great job mentoring the students here and guiding them to the right path.  
On top of that, SCSU's president, Robbyn Wacker, is truly a genuine, caring, and supporting leader who cares about the students on campus. She has created a welcoming atmosphere for us students on campus that helps create a close community among each other."
Alum,4,"I appreciated the diversity of students and teachers and the convenience of classes and times offered. It is a commuter school so you can find the classes you need, when you need them."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great smaller campus. It has decent food options, great administration and is very affordable. Rated one of the top 25 colleges for veterans. It has 200 plus programs. It also has lots of online classes and programs."
Sophomore,4,I really like St. Cloud State University. They make you feel included. I transferred here and I was assigned a peer mentor. This person made sure I was involved and taking advantage of all the resources the university had to offer. I've had a great time so far! St. Cloud State University is constantly improving.
Niche User,4,I loved most of the staff and the community. The campus itself is a little outdated and is relatively small. Overall I enjoyed my time here but just didn't have a very strong program for my choice of study.
Freshman,4,Great vibes!!!! Nice people. Visually satisfying campus. Beautiful colors. The cafeteria is clean and school spirited.
Junior,4,"It is a very diverse campus, to say the least. There are students of many backgrounds attending here, most are very friendly. Personally, St. Cloud Sate University is a great place. I am satisfied with my learning experience here so far and am excited to finish my degree here, too. Places are not too far away from each other, the atmosphere is safe and inviting.  The professors here are willing to help you succeed in your academics and genuinely want to help you in your career goals."
Junior,4,Great professors. Staff is very willing to help with student concerns. There are plenty of employment opportunities close by that are more than willing to work with students' school schedule.
Junior,4,Very diverse population. Lots of majors. Transferring here was a fairly simple and easy process compared to some.
Senior,4,St. Cloud State has helped me find who I am currently and helped me in finding the path I want to go after graduation. My professors are great and very supportive. There is also a lot of diversity on campus that is celebrated through culture nights.
Freshman,4,"I really like Saint Cloud State, it's a great size not too big and not too small. overall experience was all depressed professors have been has been good. My only complaint is the parking, unless you want to pay a couple hundred bucks a year you end up walking aways."
Freshman,4,I am still going to St. Cloud State University. It is only my first year. So far It is pretty fun and challenging at the same time. So far everyone that I have met has been super helpful and nice.
Graduate Student,4,I like how St. Cloud state is so affordable and provides a good education. I wish there was more communication among educational staff and administrators.
Junior,4,"there is alot of different things to do on campus and the classes offered have always been reasonable. teachers are always accommodating and willing to help out, and the online portal is easy to use."
Junior,4,What I like about St. Cloud State is that the professors are always willing to help their students and try their best to keep their students engaged in their studies.
Freshman,4,I go to St. Cloud state university online and I am enjoying my experience. The teachers are very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus. Saint Cloud is definitely a college town. There are many opportunities for student work. I love the professors, they are very dedicated to see you succeed."
Junior,4,"I enjoy most of the professors, although the math department seems to be lacking in good professors, and I have made many new friends who share the same passion for weather that I do!"
Graduate Student,4,I liked how easy it was to find my classes and how easy it was to rent out rooms in the library to have a quit study space. I wish they had a better system for advising. My advisor never had time for me.
Senior,4,"I began my schooling at St. Cloud State my junior year as a transfer student. From day one, SCSU was extremely welcoming and helpful with my transition. My application was processed and accepted within a matter of days, and I was immediately able to make contact with advisors and professors who provided me with guidance about courses and campus life. The campus itself is a very welcoming place to be. The professors are eager to help and knowledgable in their fields. There are many resources available for students from all walks of life, including countless clubs and organizations for every kind of student."
Freshman,4,"Culture nights, students body, the professors, and the organization on campus. The St Cloud State University have different diversity of students and professors."
Alum,4,"People here are awesome if you put yourself out to meet people.  I was part of a small cohort, and they will always be there if I need them in the future for job opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"I chose SCSU ultimatley because it was the only school in Minnesota that offered a degree for my major, Nuclear Medicine Technology. After my first year, I am very happy to say that I am glad I chose SCSU. It has given me the resources and opportunities I don't think I would have been able to get anywhere else- the main example of being able to spend a semester abroad as a freshman. The professors I have had genuinly care about me and my education and they have been very approachable. As a Minnesota state school, I believe it is a good bang for your buck."
Junior,4,"It was good. I liked the safety and most of my processors. The food is not very good, but the staff are really nice and helpful with food allergies."
Sophomore,4,I loved the hustle and the good vibes of campus! I transferred from the technical college and loved the big campus filled with students working hard and chasing their dreams!
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my first year here at St. Cloud State. I found it to be a very welcoming school and campus. There are many great opportunities on and off campus. I would like to see the food at Garvey Commons improve, they have good breakfast but everything else is not the best."
Senior,4,"Great campus with a lot of amenities to pass time and knowledgeable professors. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because it's not very online/commuter friendly. If you plan on staying close to campus or living in a dorm, you'll love this school."
Graduate Student,4,"There are many activities to attend or participate in, and there are many groups to join. It was nice to live on campus and be able to walk to my classes and be a part of the campus community. I now plan on returning, but not living on campus. It is easy to get to."
Niche User,4,"I personally love the people, the diversity of this campus is like no other. The sports teams compete like a major D1 school and are amazing to watch."
Senior,4,"I really liked my experience here. Not great night life, and many of the professors are hard to understand. Otherwise was great!"
Senior,4,This university is a not the worst school to go to. There are downsides though because there are a lot of people who do not like to be in St. Cloud because there are a lot of refugees/immigrants that do not speak English as a primary language. If you can look past that you will do fine at this school.
Junior,4,"Very diverse campus, very friendly staff and students, great place to meet new people and learn new materials."
Freshman,4,"SCSU is a nice medium sized university in Saint Cloud, Minnesota. It is a wonderful school to attend, the professors are great, sporting events are a blast, nice community, and so much more. I would definitely recommend SCSU to anyone who asks. It is a great place and it really makes you feel welcome."
Alum,4,"I had an amazing experience in the graduate program at SCSU.  Professors genuinely want you to learn and grow, not just to pass their class but to better your profession.  I always felt supported and understood, and my professor's truly cared about us all as individuals."
Freshman,4,"The St. Cloud State environment welcomed me right in. The first thing I noticed here is how everyone loves themselves for their differences and uniqueness, I think that is so important in the world today. And the amazing  friends you will make here are plentiful!"
Niche User,4,They aren't much help as you have to walk from building to building to finally find what you need. Most of the professors are wonderful because they just want to see you succeed. Parking is hard to find and there is no order as to how that goes.
Freshman,4,"The campus is large enough,  but a good distance so you don't freeze your butt off going in between classes.  The faculty and campus is very open and excepting for minorities."
Alum,2,"Basic online courses. More expensive than in-person courses for no reason. Sometimes allowed to self-pace, usually not. Professors often forget to post assignments and are slow to answer questions."
Alum,2,"Emails go unanswered by professors and offices. Expensive fees like parking, tech, and athletic, even if you don’t use them."
Niche User,2,"Expensive, teachers aren’t “for you”, and be prepared to have no life during each semester. 
I recently quit the nursing program due to how this nursing program handled COVID. Did not think about the well being of the students while going through the pandemic in April. All of March was taken off for quarantine and when class started via Zoom again, they did nothing to compensate for the lost time, but rather made us work double time in April. No material was to be missed. So this means I was cramming for each exam (3) a class day. THAT’S RIDICULOUS. My mental health was down the drain by mid-late April and I ended up withdrawing as my scores suffered very much from these decisions. I plan to attend a 2-year college in WA where I will be participating in “quarters” instead of semesters to accommodate my learning capabilities. Semesters are way too long, and by the end of it professors are expecting you to pull everything out of your head you learned 13 weeks back."
Niche User,2,"My online learning experience with SCSU I will rate as poor. I’ll give it two stars for their MNSCU system that was easy to navigate and get all my class materials from. When nursing school switched to online- it was a mess. I am a hands on learner- hence- NURSING. It’s impossible. You cannot get the full learning opportunity as you would in class or in clinical. My online “clinical simulation“ was just terrible to say the least. We got assigned a virtual patient and you were supposed to ask all these assessment questions- some were very relevant to me (because I was TAUGHT that in school!) that were not to this system! And because I would ask questions it didn’t like, I LOST POINTS. This program is unforgiving when you loose points for stupid sh*t like this. I am simply not impressed. I look forward to a school who has their marbles in a row."
Sophomore,2,"Great location and speaks highly about student success. However, they do not show it. Staff and administrative could show a bit of compassion to students."
Freshman,2,"St. Cloud State University isn't a terrible place to go learn, but it is a very diverse school, and they hire instructors with almost impossible to understand accents, instructors that don't care about their jobs, and other instructors that are just plain lazy. This has not been my entire experience there so far; most instructors really care -- but it has been annoying when I get up at 6 AM to drive to an 8 AM class and the instructor decided not to show up that day (this happened 10+ times in one semester). Overall not a ""top quality"" education experience, but most instructors are willing to work with you."
Sophomore,2,I found the s=hosing and meal plans to be way over priced. There is so many racist white people that go there.
College Sophomore,2,This school needs more variety of fraternities and sororities that reflect the diverse population of the school. I don't see much activities on campus with the Greek life community.
College Freshman,2,You're either doing your generals or you're almost graduated it seems like on campus. There really isn't anyone to talk to about your future and career that cares as personally about it as you do. All the jobs around campus are taken by people who aren't in school. Just public regular people taking jobs that us students need. Alumni is huge here if you are one or are apart of the alumni group. If you aren't then you don't really know what's going on.
College Freshman,2,We only have a few on campus and the ones that are are very lowkey. If you want to join a sorority all you have to do is look pretty and ask.
College Freshman,2,My personal experience with public safety on campus has not been the greatest.  There have been issues about getting a public safety escort back to my dorm during the night when I'm getting off of work or just finishing up with cheer practice.  I was in a car accident with a friend and it was about 11pm when we had finally finished up and got to the parking lot where she parks her car.  We called public safety and were denied a ride because they were to busy tonight so we were informed to take a bus.  After waiting 20 minutes for a bus we realized the buses weren't running and had to walk at 11:30pm in the cold icy rain from one end of campus to the other.  The public safety website clearly states that they give 24 hour safety escorts when they are needed and being denied that amenity was very frustrating and made me feel very unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,2,There are public security patrolling the campus but there is still an unsafe amount of crime that happens around and on campus.
College Freshman,2,Safety is the biggest drawback to SCSU. I don't feel safe walking around campus alone after 8 pm because of the relatively high crime rate in the area.
College Freshman,2,Many of the scholarships are for the areas of Sciences and Music. So if you are majoring in one of those areas you have a lot more options for scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,2,"After my parents did the FAFSA, all I received was federal grants and loans. There was no option for work study, even though I was told by multiple people I qualified for it. Very frustrating. Eventually I gave up and just accepted what I got."
College Freshman,2,Most things that go on in the dorms are set to strict standards and thats why people tend to avoid dorm happenings.
College Freshman,2,"Garvey is horrible, the food is bad and it is impossible to eat healthy there."
College Senior,2,"Only three places in Atwood that are decent, and one of them is Subway. Cheaper to cook at home."
College Senior,2,"Unless you want to go to a bar, with terrible music, and strange older men hitting on you, no thanks. Stick around for the summer, when the free music concerts happen, that's when it's a good time."
College Sophomore,2,"People are stuck up, snobby it is hard to make quality friends here."
College Sophomore,2,If you're interested in partying do not go here as the cops are very unfair and all they care about is busting parties and getting drunk students.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting financial aid for anyone is hard, it's especially hard for a middle class family who is viewed to have 'enough money'. Yeah, maybe my parents could pay for MY college if they stopped paying THEIR bills. 

It would help if the government saw that I pay for my own schooling as much as possible, live at home, and work a part time job to try and pay for the ridiculous cost of getting an education."
College Sophomore,2,"I have heard a lot of bad stories about campus. It could be worse, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be better. I choose to take morning classes to avoid walking along at night on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The winters are very harsh and since I have to walk far to get to campus, it can be dangerous and very cold."
College Sophomore,2,"I commute and I do not have to money to spend on a parking permit, so I am forced to find a spot on the street and walk. When the weather is nice, it is not a big deal, but spots fill up quickly and in the winter, walking on the sidewalk is very dangerous."
College Freshman,2,I didn't like applying for financial aid because I didn't receive any. It seemed like a waste of time for me.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best, the professors are not the smartest."
College Freshman,2,I wished there was more diversity
College Junior,2,Parking spots fills up quickly.
College Sophomore,2,"Garvey commons is the main dining hall on campus, and it is pretty bad. They serve the same food every week with little to no variety."
College Freshman,2,sometimes they are a little to strict on students.
College Freshman,2,I received not enough to pay my tuition in full
College Senior,2,I have been able to avoid buying a parking permit. There is free 4 hour parking available so on days that I need to drive I get to school super early to find a spot there. Parking prices are around 100 dollars for the year and that is in a lot that is in the opposite side of campus from the building that I am in most of the time. So I hate the parking situation on campus but there are ways to get around it.
College Sophomore,2,"My summers are generally full so I lack the time to have an internship, but I would definitely consider taking one. I have not gotten any information about SCSU's internship program, so I am unsure. I know other colleges offer internships through SCSU, usually involving travel to a different state."
College Sophomore,2,majority of them are not very nice. There are a few exceptions though.
College Senior,2,Very stretched out campus and no good parking areas. Not real pleasant in the winter.
College Senior,2,Very difficult to find engineering internships locally!!!!!
College Sophomore,2,"Advice: Buy a parking pass right when they let you buy them. Parking on campus is free every day after 3pm-6am (I think it's 6) and on the weekends. There is the parking ramp (which is $500) on campus, A-Lot, which has two different lots. One is on campus and the other is across the street from campus. If you do not park here, getting to your car is a total pain. Parking is so limited at SCSU and all of the other lots are far off campus. Thank God for the buses because they will take you to your lot and pick you up from your lot. If you buy your parking permit late, you will end up in Q-Lot which is a dirt lot next to the hockey rink. This is the worst place to park because on Sat & Sun, you have to move your car out of the lot and you have all these kids from Q-Lot trying to find the best parking spot on campus. "
College Sophomore,2,"C'mon, we're in Minnesota! The weather fluctuates and changes like crazy! My freshmen year, it was snowing until late April! And classes don't cancel for lots of snow, unless it really interferes with driving. It can get blazing hot here too, and in a dorm without A/C, it can become unbearable!"
College Freshman,2,The bus service is okay but they only run on campus clipper routes till 5:00 or 6:00. Drivers are not very friendly.
College Freshman,2,"It is hard to approach professors, because many of them seem to not care about establishing a connection with the students.  Many of the professors are also hard to understand."
College Freshman,2,"It is hard to approach professors, because it seems like they do not care about establishing a connection with the students."
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol, a starting occasion get together for some"
College Freshman,2,"SCSU is strict about alcohol and drug use specifically.  This can take away from other issues that need even more supervision on campus.  Also, campus police are quick to write tickets and give out boots as well. They tend to assume many people don't have permits without checking sometimes as well."
College Freshman,2,"Parking is available, however it's expensive.  Also depending on the lot you choose, you must move your car daily or weekly or you'll get a boot.  The location of the lots is available according to the housing you choose as well."
College Senior,2,Small campus with a large off campus student body makes parking terrible. 3 block walks at -10F are no fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Bar/clubs are almost right by the campus is the campus is fairly close to downtown St Cloud. But, at times you will get bored."
College Junior,2,I am an online student who only comes to the campus for proctored exams. Parking is a hassle!!  I drive  an hour to spend  30 min to take a test and rarely can get a close parking spot. It is frustrating.
College Freshman,2,As an athlete and a student i got zero scholarship. I got help from FAFSA and the rest i took out student loans.
College Freshman,2,Way too many people get jumped or even worse raped. S**** Sketchy man.
College Junior,2,"Lots of snow and cold during winter months - as a commuter, it is a concern. Driving in MN during these months can be dangerous, and the wacky St. Cloud street system doesn't help. Walking to class from a far parking lot can be an issue in cold weather - slipping on ice patches is another concern."
College Freshman,2,"St. Cloud has a lot to offer as a city. There are many places to shop and places to go for fun. There are also many cultural events held. Most students attend football and hockey games. Many students place a large emphasis on partying so the local attitude toward students probably isn't the best.As far as safety goes, it isn't the most safe environment. However the public safety on campus and the St. Cloud police do their best to patrol the area."
College Freshman,2,"It's Minnesota....so the winter season is always harsh. It snows a lot and classes sometimes get canceled because of this. The dorms are close proximity to classes, however. The fall and spring are wonderful because there are fountains and plants around campus that are nice to look at when walking to class."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Classes are rarely cancelled for weather.  But when they are, you are not notified until you show up and there's a note on the door."
Recent Alumnus,2,They are pretty strict on drug usage...no second chance to continue to live in the dorms.  A few warnings are given for alcohol and noise.
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere at St. Cloud is definitely not for everybody. I personally do not enjoy it, but there are thousands of others who do! It's a small campus filled with diverse people and the Mississippi River is my backyard (If you live in Mitchell.) It's nice to walk around, but never walk alone at night. It's no University of St. Thomas, so expect a lower-middle class lifestyle. (Clothes, cars, streets.) It's pretty noticeable. Once you walk off-campus, there are small, little historic homes that college kids rent out. You can walk from Thursday-Saturday night and walk from house to house to a party, but expect a tiny, packed house that's probably dirty. There are certain homes that have names, such as, ""The Castle"", etc. Walk a little farther and you've reached downtown, which is perfect for 21+ students who take advantage of the bars. Downtown is super convenient and you're literally five minutes from everything. It's fun to just walk at night with friends and to meet new people, but always be aware of your surroundings. "
College Sophomore,2,"Apartments Vary! There are a lot of apartments and houses off campus that are within walking distance of campus. Prices vary. It is a good idea to look for apartments a few months before the semester begins, because towards the beginning of the semester finding off-campus housing can be difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"Spacious, but Not Luxurious – As the 2nd biggest university in state, Saint Cloud State has enough parking space for its students and staff- off campus. If you're looking for a parking space by the library, student center, or by the dorm good luck. Most of the parking is off-campus and a good walk away. Although the parking ramp is helpful, the cost is too high."
College Freshman,2,"It's stupid how much they charge for parking. It's like $400 for the year to park in the ramp. $300 something for A lot (right on campus). I'm out in K lot which is $175, but thankfully the husky shuttle drives from K lot to campus so students don't have to walk."
College Junior,2,"I am bias because I moved to Saint Cloud from Texas but I think they do a poor job at keeping the walk ways clean of ice and snow and classes rarely are cancelled because of the weather which is annoying when it is -14 but hey, in the fall and late spring it's awesome outside."
Alum,1,You need to be politically correct (liberal) or you will not have a positive learning experience. If someone I knew wanted to to SCSU I would what I could to talk them into going some other school. Avoid send your loved ones to this university.
Graduate Student,1,"School has SERIOUS governance issues to start with. 
As far as student success is concerned, you have to select the right major and the right professors. 
Word of advice is stay away from the Economics program UNLESS you are male or a local student.  You can survive if you suck up. I personally know students who hangout with Professors to secure graduate assistantships. Requires a lot of sucking up. There are also students who study hard. It’s not worth it because they have spend months to find a job. 
I also have had Professors who have changed my life and most of them are STEM professors. 
Please consider paying extra to study in a good school. At least your return on investment won’t be negative"
Niche User,1,"The college visit that I was on was very lacking to say the least.   There was a group of 5 of us all with Engineering, or medical interest.  The tour guide skipped right passed all of the building to show a liberal arts building as this was her major.  This school could learn from Clark University or Waldorf College on how to give a proper tour."
Senior,1,"Not a good school. I would just pretty much focus on getting my degree and moving to another area. A lot of the professors won't help you even when you ask for help, and to be quite honest the students seem to be more intelligent. At first the school wasn't that bad, but the more and more I realized it wasn't  a good school ""culture"" I had been going to the school for a year which isn't to bad but now that I've finished I'm grateful. All in all, please don't waste your time."
Niche User,1,"The school went through a 19 million dollar loss because of embezzlement. This resulted in the staff engaging in very unethical business practices since the school budget cuts started with staffing. They misuse plagiarism to fail students so that students take classes again. They also have hidden policies for example you can be failed at any point as long as your enrolled. Any teacher can use this on any student based off of there own individual prejudices. Some dislike Germans, Canadians, Mexicans, Veteran, too young, or too old. I was failed a year later for a class i passed. Adviser says, ""The board is made up of teachers so there is really no point in fighting it."" He told me students suffer because the departments don't get along. 
 When I would walk by groups of students I would hear, ""I don't get it. I have never failed a class in my life"". I empathized because my experience was the same."
Freshman,1,Good school but some hall directors are just terrible and can not do their jobs correctly falsely accusing people of stuff and then will not care about the info they give them. Especially shoemaker kicked a student out and didn't give them any information that is proper.
College Sophomore,1,Campus dining is terrible. I am very disappointed with the lack of options and the price of the meal plans. The quality of food is also very low. One time i got 2 day food poisoning from the dining hall.
College Sophomore,1,"I do not like the Music Program here. It basically, SUCKS."
College Freshman,1,Public safety here is way too strict.
College Freshman,1,Don't live in dorms dorms suck.
College Freshman,1,"Way to strict, I'm most likely transferring schools because it is so strict."
College Freshman,1,Not very good. If you want to have a fun time on the weekends go somewhere else. 
College Freshman,1,"Not very good, if you need to go to a target or something alike you really need a car."
College Freshman,1,This school is just not up to par for the money. I do not recommend this school to anyone. 
College Sophomore,1,"We never have snow days. They have plows out every night when it snows, so there is no excuse to miss class."
College Sophomore,1,I dont think its good. 
College Freshman,1,I never see public safety at night
College Freshman,1,"High school was harder, and I got terrible grades"
College Sophomore,1,The parking at St. Cloud State University is too expensive and etc.
College Sophomore,1,"Very cold throughout most of the year, lot of snow"
College Senior,1,"Policies are there and you see most of them being followed, but I feel that they are not really enforced. Students know about them, but do they really follow them? At times there doesn't seem to be any follow through from the administration or ""public safety"" on campus. Seem to be more worried about giving out parking tickets."
College Junior,1,"Severe Punishments – SCSU has strict enforcements of rules. First-time offenders have to attend a program that teaches them about alcohol and substance abuse. They are placed on academic probation. Parents are notified. Second and third time offenders may lose their on campus housing and have a hold placed on  their class registration. In severe cases St. Cloud police are called to campus, the offender is suspended from SCSU and is arrested. The offender is then transported to the Stearns country jail! Follow the rules SCSU has and you will not have any problems!"
College Sophomore,1,"If you live in Minnesota and say ""I'm going to Cloud,"" most likely someone will respond to you with ""That's a party school."" It is not so much a drug school, but alcohol usage is pretty prominent. It is a dry and tobacco free campus, but that does not stop anyone. It is a prime location for parties because you have campus with all the dorms in one area, and college homes surrounding campus. There is a party going on every night. Peer pressure depends on who you surround yourself with, but you will definitely feel out of place if you don't drink. A lot of students smoke weed, but you won't find many people snorting coke at a party. I never have. I'm not saying people don't do drugs, because they do, but it is not a big thing to brag about at St. Cloud."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is HORRIBLE if you don't have a parking permit, though the parking permits are a bit spendy. The officers love ticketing people; I swear it's their favorite thing to do. There are no free parking spots on campus for people to park in for class. Parking at Saint Cloud State is the only downfall of the school I can think of, and it's a doozy."
College Sophomore,1,"Let's be honest. St. Cloud is called ""Ratchet Cloud"" for a reason. You will find the girls at the parties with the teased hair, cheetah print top, old Miss Me jeans and a water bottle of Phillips Vodka in her hand. There are very sweet girls, but a majority of girls are party animals. The boys? It is a sad place. The only good-looking guys are some athletes, or you will have to search real hard to find one. Most of the boys at this school are party animals or stoners, and would bang anything that walks. Granted, I made some GREAT friends and have had the best experiences with people like this... but if you are looking for a relationship, better hike over to St. Joe's."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is nothing in St. Cloud. There are three or four fraternities and three sororities and people don't even know we have a Greek life. It looks good on your resume, though."
College Senior,1,far away from campus. Have to take a bus to campus. Need to arive early to make sure you arrive to class on time!
College Freshman,1,"SCSU is renown for the amount of students that smoke weeds on and off campus. People planning on living in dorms, be prepared for people smoking in them. Also, this campus claims to be tobacco free. This couldn't be further from the truth. Endless amounts of people smoke and chew on campus and during class."
College Freshman,1,"The police force is pretty strict on drinking and drug use. the policy and parking ramps are not good for commuter students. Because it costs to much money to park in the parking ramp and in the Miller Center parking lot.
The campus has a no smoking policy but it is not enforced very well. the financial aid department is not very accommodating to getting you extra financial aid for summer sessions it is credit based and goes by your grade level in college."
College Freshman,1,"You can tell that the facilities are very old.  The dorm building that I live in is very old and worn, the rooms are very small for two people to be living in.  As for the sports facilities they are also very old and worn out.  the basketball court is worse than the one that was in my high school.  the hockey arena is the nicest facility on campus and that isn't saying much."
College Freshman,1,"If it was not for the hockey team no one would care at all about the Athletics.  Football games reminded me of when i went to watch my high school team play football, i was very disappointing by this because i was expecting a lot more for my first college football game.  Although the hockey team is very good the facility is very sub par, at least until the renovations are done."
College Freshman,1,"Food on campus is very disappointing.  The food in Garvey Commons is very  unappealing, everything is frozen or comes out of a box.  As for Atwood they have very little selection, it is also very overpriced."
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for hot broads and gorgeous boys, let's just say St. Cloud should not be on your top ten colleges that you should choose. Head over to College of St. Benedict's/St. John's for that... I know I do."
College Sophomore,1,Garvey commons gets old. They need to start changing up the menu
College Freshman,1,unpredictable. never know how its going to be. can be sunny and 60 in the morning and 40 by 2pm.
College Senior,1,Cops have gotten really bad off campus and campus safety on campus will do anything to give a ticket out. and in appartments we have a team called GSSC to troll them seeing peoples tvs and parties are too loud to find an excuse to call the cops
College Senior,1,"Leave Your Car at Home – first of all, there are lotta parking space no doubt..but you'll have to pay $200 buck a semester to park it which is quiet expensive in my view and the public safety distribute the parkin' violation lyke there's no tomorrow. u leave ur car w/out proper permit and it is already ticketed within second however, if you come early in tha morning you can find free parkin' on tha street. guudluck"
College Sophomore,1,"Kind of a Joke! The campus security is kind of a joke on our campus. They don't do much. There is a major incident, such as someone robbed at gunpoint maybe two to four times a year, and it'll be right on the outskirts of the campus, where public safety should have been. If you're looking for any sense of security from these guys, you probably won't get it!"
College Freshman,1,No Clue – I haven't heard anything about them while in school here. I haven't gave them really a thought.
College Freshman,1,"Off Campus Safety – I am a sophomore this year and my first year renting a college apartment.  I've had a bullet shot through my bedroom and some random dude was drunk in my kitchen when I got home one night.  Although I like the apartment and am only a few block from my classes, I'm not liking things that have happened here."

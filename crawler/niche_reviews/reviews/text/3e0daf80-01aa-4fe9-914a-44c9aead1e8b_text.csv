Junior,5,"Since it is a small college, it is easy to get in touch with professors, academic advisors, etc. Small class sizes give you a sense that you matter and your professors actually care about you. I have been able to gain the right experience in order to further my academic studies. Courses have been rigorous but allowed me to challenge myself."
Junior,5,"My experience at Florida Gateway College has been strictly online. However, the professors make sure to connect the class and allow us to participate in weekly discussions and peer reviews of the course material and assignments. It is a local college so I already know many people in my classes, allowing me to feel comfortable in the class. While technical issues are common in online courses, professors are very understanding and will work with you."
Alum,5,Online learning is one of the best through Florida Gateway College! The online professors provided us with applications that better helped us understand the curriculum.
Alum,5,My experience with Florida Gateway College was AMAZING! The professors truly cared about what they were teaching and wanted to make sure that you understood and grasped every lesson they taught! Even despite going through a pandemic the professors did their very best to help us achieve our goals.

Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience during my time at Florida Gateway College. I loved it so much that I did dual enrollment there all through high school, obtained my AA there, and am currently working on my ASDN."
Sophomore,5,FGC utilizes Canvas for all of its online classes. It is a very easy system to use and is good for interacting with our professors.
Junior,5,"I love everything about Florida Gateway College! They are always super helpful, the classes are challenging and the professors are wonderful."
Freshman,5,I would recommend this college to anyone trying to obtain a two or four-year degree.  The professors are experts in their line of teaching and very helpful and nice.  They are very dedicated to making sure you succeed.  The campus life is very diverse and offers many student activities.  They have a great athletic department.  The food on campus is quite tasty with many options.  The dorm life is kept up very nice and campus security is around the clock.  I feel this is a very safe college especially for someone being out on their own for their first time.
Niche User,5,"As a dual enrollment student here, I was to relieved to find that each professor was extremely helpful."
Junior,5,The teachers are great in some courses not all they are very helpful and willing to help you on campus

I must add the friendliness of the staff and teachers at this campus.  The staff is always willing to help; making it feel as if there is no ""stupid"" question.  With many studies to choose from and the local team, you can count on succeeding if you attend this college.  Every day this college is looking for ways to improve the overall happiness of the students.  This college consists of free tutors, advisors, and common areas to relax.  Florida Gateway College has created such a friendly environment that it feels like anyone is welcome."

Freshman,5,I will be attending this fall and so far everyone has been so helpful during the enrollment process.  I am excited to meet new friends and begin my path to the future.
Sophomore,5,"I have only been at Florida Gateway College for the Summer term. What I like at FGC is how kind and helpful all the staff and professors have been.  They are always willing to help or point you in the right direction.  My adviser has helped me in choosing classes to reach my AA and towards my Bachelors degree. She also helped me apply my prior transcripts towards my AA.  I also found the tutors at the Student Success Center so nice and knowledgeable.  They all gave good advice and went above and beyond to help me with a class I was struggling with.  Since I have only been there for a short time the only thing I've had problems with is locating the correct building.  But all I had to do was ask, and I was given great directions.  My experience so far has been a great one."
Freshman,5,I'm a new student love the programs they offer happy to be part of the wolves family  I've been trying to go for years something always come up everyone is so nice on campus nice place it has everything you need is quite a bit of an exercise which is ok also love the fact that they have work study as well as being able to do classes online
Freshman,5,Florida Gateway College is the Lake City's local community college. Academics here are great. Awesome staff. Super duper friendly environment. You feel welcome as soon as you step onto campus. I haven't yet ran into anyone who was rude or unhelpful. Keep up the great work FGC!
Niche User,5,Its easy to connect with the professors and students. This way its easier to complete work if you can have some input on it.
Sophomore,5,The faculty is super nice and the online coursework is user friendly. FGC is the better of the two colleges I've dual enrolled at

Sophomore,5,"This is a great college for anyone just starting to further their education, or  returning to school after a period of time. The teachers are great!"
Junior,5,This college is really great! It is inexpensive with small class sizes so you really get the most out of your learning experience.
Junior,5,"Florida Gateway College ( FGC) is an amazing school. There 60 + more programs you can choose from. The class size is small, there are tutors in every subject that can help you and the professors are great and understanding. There are flexible course offerings as well. FGC has a friendly environment. The campus is very clean and beautiful. There is a lot of Student Support services. Additionally, a lot of financial help is given out at FGC.  I would recommend this Community College to anyone who is pursuing there goal to becoming anything they want. You Start here and you can go anywhere."
Junior,5,Since signing up at fgc I have overall love the experience . It‚Äôs small enough for one on one but it‚Äôs large enough to give you that real college feeling . Everyday student activities are putting on something different to draw students in to something new and it always turns into a learn experience . I‚Äôm very glad that I signed up and are attending fgc.
Freshman,5,I'm sure you wondering; Why such high marks on the subject of my college. They give you the best sense of hope.Even when you're failing or discouraged opportunities to get better is always a option. I'm in my freshman year and I have experienced a whole new world of possibilities.Thank you for listening
Junior,5,Florida Gateway College has helped and encouraged me to go further than I ever thought I could go. I am only a few credits away from my AA and am actually thinking about going on to get my Bachelors all because of the encouragement and help I have received from my Trio coach and others at FGC.
Freshman,5,"My College experience through Florida Gateway College has been great so far. I will start my second semester February 28, 2018. I am glad I enrolled in this college as the professors have been awesome and helpful with all my questions. The library, advisors and staff have also been amazing."
Sophomore,5,Everyone was friendly and understanding. All my professors understood that as a single mother I would miss class and that didn't effect my grade. The cost was also cheap! With many scholarships availableüòç
Graduate Student,5,"I love the environment and how nice the staff is. No one judges you and the class rooms are perfect size!! I got to be the student speaker at my graduation, I can‚Äôt wait to continue my education there this spring!"
Sophomore,5,"This is a great college to get started with. The teachers are okay overall, with a few that create problems. I haven't spent much time on campus as I am only a part-time student through dual enrollment."
Junior,5,"I love that the faculty and staff are excited about your success. In my two years at FGC, I have had zero bad experiences with professors or other staff members. The campus is beautiful, and the programs the college offers are top notch. However, I would love to see more programs added. Especially medical programs."
Sophomore,5,"Florida Gateway College was absolutely the best choice I could have made.  Coming out of high school, I was a bit weary about how I was going to transition between a really small school to college level work, but FGC was extremely helpful.  I love how hands on the professors and guidance counselors are.  The facilities are nice, open, and clean.  My surrounding classmates were very friendly and willing to help me with any trouble I had.  My favorite experience being at FGC was when I got to work on a  cadaver in Anatomy & Physiology 1.  I knew I have always wanted to work in the health field, however this was my first hands on test.  Thankfully, I could not have loved it more!  One thing I would like to see change at FGC is the athletic programs.  I know it is a small college, but we still should have some indoor sports for us students. All in all, FGC is the place to be!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Florida Gateway College has been very rewarding so far. As a freshman, college can be a little overwhelming; however, FGC has been very welcoming to me. While, I love this college, I would like to see some sports teams at our school!"
Freshman,5,I love the campus and everyone there have been really knowledgeable. Can't wait to continue my education there!
Sophomore,5,The campus is bigger than most expect but it's still small enough that your professors remember you by a first name basis. They're always open and available to help you. The campus is every to navigate and the online work is user friendly as well. The professors and advisers respond to emails in a timely manner.
Freshman,5,"One of the best schools I've attended! Offers online classes which is exactly what I needed. Has a great atmosphere, great students, faculty and positive vibes."
Junior,5,Florida Gateway is an amazing college the professors work with you and do everything they can to help you succeed the staff is amazing and will explain things to your understanding! Couldn't ask for better!
Sophomore,5,"My experience as Florida Gateway College has been a superb one. I've yet to have any issues with anything, with classes, financial, books , ect. My questions are answered within a few hours via email. I've even received personal phone calls to answer my question. FGC had been nothing short of a pleasure to attend."
Niche User,5,"I have been enrolled as a dual enrollment student at Florida Gateway College for the past two years. I take a lot of online classes, which can sometimes be a hassle, especially with a busy schedule. The teachers and staff have always been so kind and helpful towards me. No matter what the question was, they knew the answer. The teachers are the best. If I was struggling with something, they always took time to help me understand.  I recently was invited to be a part of the National Honor Society. This club has helped me connect with my peers and other staff members. They have been nothing but nice to me and I love going to college here. "
Senior,5,"The staff is very friendly and knowledge, they take the time to explain what is needed of the student and what is required of them.  I wish they had a Master's program for me to attend when I graduate next semester."
College Junior,5,Florida Gateway College is very helpful and is willing to help you get where you want to be and support you through it with every opportunity that they can provide to you as a student.
College Freshman,5,"My experience with the courses at campus from the beginning was a love-hate relationship, but since then I've been managing my classes very well thanks to my teachers (and to Disability Services). My experience with my professors is nothing short of positive, they excel at what they do, which is make sure that students receive a quality education from whatever subject they are teaching. 

Every instructor I've had in the past and will have in the future have done all they could to make sure that I pass their classes, even when I failed, or was struggling with the required material or overall pace of the class itself they found a way to help me to succeed and move on to the next level of my academics, and I greatly appreciate it."
College Freshman,5,"When I first came to the campus, I was very nervous and barely spoke to anybody, but after having a conversation with a student all of my anxiety went away and she really made my first day of college special. It isn't just the students, the teachers are amazingly friendly as well. Words cannot describe how much I enjoy Florida Gateway. I can now see why it's so highly rated."
College Junior,5,"Great college with friendly staff, amazing professors, with a wide variety of students looking to further themselves! So many great study choices and places on campus to visit. If they had my next degree, I would stay!!"
College Junior,5,The professors are great and very helpful. Everyone is always willing to help you
College Freshman,5,I like how helpful they have been. to be honest though there were two people that were very unhelpful and kind of rude. But the others I worked with went above and beyond and made up for the other two. So overall I am very pleased.
College Junior,5,Its been great so far everyone is very helpful considering i have not been to school in 18 years
College Sophomore,5,I have visited other colleges and found that Florida Gateway is run exceptionally well. I left feeling like I knew the path I needed to follow and the staff really helped me set a goal.  I look forward to my new career and cannot wait to get started.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the topics we have to research.  My favorite class so far is the computer resources.  I thought I knew a lot about Excel, but I am learning so much more that it has driven me to surpass the chapters and jump ahead on my work."
College Sophomore,5,"So far, the program is very interesting and a little hard too.  This peaks my interest and keeps me wanting to learn more each day."
College Sophomore,5,"With online classes, you can work at your own pace, even with deadlines.  You can access the discussion board at anytime of the day or night.  You can upload your assignments anytime before the deadline and know that it will be submitted.  The peer-to-peer interaction is nice because even if that person is not online, the next time you get online, the answer maybe there. It is worth it to me to save on gas money and enrolling in the online course helps with expenses."
College Junior,5,The tuition and financial aide process works out pretty smooth. I experienced a hiccup with financial aide and  the matter was dealt with quickly and the financial aide adviser was extremely supportive and helpful
College Junior,5,My school is unique because of it's small classes and because the teachers care about the student. I love the small town feel and love how nice everybody is.
College Junior,5,For the money this school is awesome! Financial aid is very friendly but scholarships are limited due to it being a small town. Loans or grants I do not know about because I have never applied for. Lauren Pope in financial aid is super duper good at helping you find money for school. I am definitely getting my moneys worth at FGC.
College Junior,5,"Class size is small, max 30 people. The teachers are very nice and want you to succeed. Just about everyone of my former professors knows my name when I pass them in the halls. (That's how friendly they are!) There are a variety of courses you can take at FGC. For example you can take early childhood classes, law enforcement, golf course management, agricultural, nursing, physical therapy assistant, cosmetology and the arts classes and many more!"
Sophomore,4,"Like I mentioned above, my online learning experience with Florida Gateway College has been wonderful! The courses are great and so are the professors are always willing t help you!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Florida Gateway College. I was able to complete my AA very quickly, are it was at a very affordable cost. I took many of my classes online, but I enjoyed the few classes I took in person. The professors I had were nice and friendly, and always willing to help. 

The only problem I had with FGC, is that the campus is very secluded. When the sun goes down, I do not feel safe being alone on the campus. It is located far away from the city and feels like your in the middle of the woods."
Sophomore,4,Math professors were great! Florida Gateway had lots of extra help available for students. It is a friendly place.  Could be a little better at community and communication with the students.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were good. Instructors were avaible by email and phone for questions. Math tests were done on site, though."
Sophomore,4,"Florida Gateway College is an excellent college and very affordable, well as much as a college can be anyway, and the staff are very helpful to all students who go there.  They have free tutoring for whomever needs it as well."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are relatively easy while thorough. 

The math professors are hit or miss, often lacking true teaching capability, and many focus on a teach yourself style.

The anatomy and physiology department is excellent. There is a cadaver lab, along with advanced lab technology for such a small school.

Being a community college, it is relatively small, meaning the biggest class size you typically see is around 30.

There are plenty of student involvement events. Guidance is very thorough and people will sit down with you and talk you through whatever you need assistance with."
Sophomore,4,This rural college with a small campus. Every one here seems so willing to help you in any way they can. The faculty and staff make you feel like family here. I have made many great connections at the college.
Niche User,4,I am a dual enrollment student at FGC and I love the professors. They are very helpful and are willing to help you. Administration is always available and are easy to access and there is always tutoring and help that is offered.
Sophomore,4,I love how helpful the staff is. I also like that a lot of the classes are online. The professor I have had so far have been the best . They are very understanding and will help you any way they can.
Junior,4,For a small community college it's nice. The only downside it that it's located far so it is a commute. Professors are great throughout all the classes I've taken.
Junior,4,"Online classes 
Mr Haynes is very helpful 
Excited to enroll
Career change
Financial aid 
Scholar ships
Convenient"
Niche User,4,I have very helpful instructors. My instructors go out of their way to help their students succeed. My instructors have been known to stay well after hours to help their students.
Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience at FGC . The teachers are very helpful and straight forward with what they expect from students and the resources there are very useful .
Freshman,4,"Florida Gateway is a great college with great professors who are there to help you. Every professor I have had in the past few semesters, have proven they are here to help everyone through the challenges than watching us fall. I have always noticed the cleanness off the area. They also provide certain days where they give away free items or drinks. Somethings that I would like to see change at the college, is seeing more academic sports. For example, having a baseball/softball team or a football team. Over all Florida Gateway College has been a great experience around the students, professors, and all around the area."
Junior,4,I attended FGC to get my ASN in 2014 and I was very disappointed in the program.  The turnover rate for instructors was very high and 2 weeks before our semester final the school fired our instructor.  The clinical opportunities were a joke and it was obvious the school didn't care about our program.
Sophomore,4,"For a small community college, Florida Gateway is a good starting college.  The atmospehere is friendly and people are generally willing to help.  The same is to be said for the Counselors.  They're incredibly helpful and they really try to get you in classes that you nees and will benefit you in the longrun."
Freshman,4,I like the campus at Florida Gateway and the small class sizes. I think that this college should keep growing and building  because it has a lot of great students and a lot of potential
Sophomore,4,I would definitely recommend Florida Gateway College to local students looking for a quality education to better themselves as they advance towards their career goals.  FGC has many programs that are highly rated within the school grading system throughout the state and southeast.  I personally have attended the LPN program and was highly satisfied with my education within that program.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed attending Florida Gateway College. Most of the professors there want to help you succeed. Also, the tutors there are very helpful. It's in a small city and not every diverse, the staff are very nice. I never had a bad experience with any of the professors I had. It's not a huge campus like most colleges/universities but I would definitely recommend it to someone that wants to get their Associates degree."
College Junior,4,Academically Florida GateWay College is willing to help you in all aspects that they believe you may need help with and want to see you succeed and progress in all areas.
College Junior,4,Class sizes are good but I wish they had more classes available.
College Junior,4,The nursing program is a great area to go into and they have great passing rates.
Recent Alumnus,4,Registration process was easily accomplished and help was offered if needed.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Disability services are great, they aim for student success."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not had the opportunity to rate this, I am a freshman in college."
Recent Alumnus,4,Disability services are very helpful and their goal is success for the student.
Recent Alumnus,4,Many career opportunities arise as a result of the education provided.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Challenging, interesting since of accomplishment."
College Student,4,"My professors have always been helpful, organized, and have helped me learn a lot. They keep the classes interesting and keep you engaged throughout. When you need explanation on work they are there to help you."
College Sophomore,4,The atmosphere makes you feel welcome and the staff are nice when they helped your situations.
College Junior,4,It is very reasonable financially. It contains very friendly faculty and students I wouldn't choose to go to another school to complete my AA because of this.
College Junior,4,"This is my second and last dual-enrolling at Florida Gateway College and I love it. The dual-enrollment program has been such a great program that FGC has offered to my school. Everyone I have met has been very kind, caring, and understanding. I recommended anyone who dual enrolls to enroll there."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at this school has been great. They are all about the students getting an education to help further them. The advisers are very helpful, along with the professors."
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time at Florida Gateway College!
College Senior,4,"It might be a small college, but it has a nice library, fun student center with a gym, and has some sort of activity most weeks."
College Senior,4,I didn't really have much trouble making a schedule. There are lots of classes and options available to you.
College Senior,4,"I've had a pretty good time there. It was a fantastic beginning, and I'm lucky to have had the opportunities I've had there."
College Senior,4,For the most part I had great teachers and learned a lot from the courses I've taken.
College Senior,4,"For a small school, it is a great start for an education."
College Senior,4,"For such a small area, we have a diverse student body. You can find all ages, races, political affiliations.. you name it, we probably have it."
College Senior,4,"Most of the professors I had were fantastic, and I learned a lot from them. Unfortunately there were a few bad eggs, but only a few. There are tutors and programs to help you study an class registration wasn't too hard."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have witnessed, it seems to be very nicely run.  I have only visited the library once and do not involve myself in any of the other campus activities due to distance from home."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything went smoothly with FASFA, but I am still unsure if I also qualify for student loans to help with extra supplies outside of school and gas expenses.  I also am not working, so I would have hoped to be able to have some cost of living loan options. I am a single mother and trying to change career due to a work related injury.  At 47, that is a hard task and the staff has helped with making this process as smooth as possible."
College Sophomore,4,"There was some confusion about my high school diploma.  Other than that, the faculty have walked me through the process step by step.  All of my other credits were transferred for my electives, which allowed me to move right into the college courses.  One of my degree requirements was met with my last college and was allowed as a transfer to this college. It kept me from having to take the course again and will be added to my final degree."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, so good.  I am in an online class, however, we meet once a month to discuss upgrades in labs and activities that will enhance our education.  I enjoy the interaction through online education.  Even though we are online, we do interact with each other.  Students pass questions and answers through the discussion board. The teacher also interacts with us through the same discussion board, making it seem like your in a classroom setting."
College Junior,4,"The library is really good. The student center is good. There is a weight room, but that is it. I can tell they try with the campus activities, but it fails because it is just community college."
College Junior,4,I love my anatomy professor! Gives us the answers and is very nice. Thankfully I'm just taking three classes.
College Junior,4,The only hassles and/or frustrations I have experienced are outside matters that have pretty much been out of my hands.  I adapt and overcome the hassles but at times they can come back.  I do not have credits that transferred in.  The flexibility of my classes is pretty set in stone but the study times for me are pretty flexible.
College Junior,4,"The class registration process was considerably simple. I went to an adviser, discussed plan and then was sent to the registers office to finish the process. The workload for all my classes is pretty good. We are given due dates for the future and in an efficient amount of time they are due. No late work is to be accepted.  The EXCEL lab is there for extra help and then there is the campus wide learning lab there for other classes as well as the same special classes that the EXCEL lab offers."
College Junior,4,The student center gives a friendly atmosphere from the moment you walk in the door. There are a number of resources that are not advertised but are able to find out about it quickly and easily. Meetingss and other important happenings are easily accessible to find out information about.
College Junior,4,My experience was what I wanted to get from it. I did not have to attend class on campus and was able to work on assignment when it was convenient for myself.
College Junior,4,"The student body is very diverse. We have male, female, whites, Hispanics, African Americans, Indian, Chinese, and Middle east ethnic groups. We all get along very good."
College Junior,4,Job prospects are very good after graduating from FGC. Many former nursing students tell me they have found work within 3 to 6 months or less time. We do not get alot of alumni members coming back to teach because its a small town and alot of people move to bigger cities.
College Junior,4,"Very good at flexibility of classes and scheduling. You can take night, day, and summer classes. Most classes are every other day for example, Monday/Wednesday. You most always unless you have a lab have Fridays off! The guidance department is very help at explaining things. Mrs. Linda Williams was the best guidance councilor ever!!!! Switching my major was as easy as filling a form out."
College Junior,4,Being in the nursing program I have talked to a lot of nursing graduates who have said that finding a job was not hard for them because of the school they graduated from. (FGC) The former students say the road was hard getting to graduation but that this hard work paid off when it came to take their license exam because of the fact of them being pushed so hard in the classroom. In the nursing program you have to make a 75% or better to pass a test and if your semester average is less than 75% you are removed from the program. Very difficult to stay above a 75% average but it pays off in the end.
College Junior,4,"I am in the ASDN Nursing program and our work load is tough! Our facilities are super clean, new, and full of technology. We do not have internships but what we do have is clinical rotations. These rotations are at some of the best hospitals in Florida. The VA Hospital and Shands Hospital are a couple. Our program is hands on and incorporates visual, written, hearing learning aspects. I do wish we had more access to our Administrators of the nursing program though. We hardly  see our coordinator. It would just be nice to see her come around to the classrooms and make her self more available. Overall, its a good program, tough, but good!"
College Junior,4,Our professors are awesome! they care about you and the class sizes allow for more one on one time. My biggest class has been maybe 30! Registration is done online or with a councilor. (Very easy process) The curriculum is good too. We study what we need to know and it's not just busy work because we do use what we learn in everyday life. Tutors are available for almost every subject. The tutors are students like our selves and are very good at putting things in a college students perspective. you also have the option of having online tutors for online courses.
College Junior,4,"Have access to a new Library with rooms you can reserve for free to study in. Technology is big at my school and the learning lab has fast, good internet. There is also free wifi on campus. There is a weight room several clubs like phi pheta kappa and band. Very nice staff."
College Senior,4,I would choose my school again if I could do it all over because it's opened my eyes to how college can be. It's been very helpful in the things that I need. The professors look at you as an individual not just another student. I like that our class sizes are big so that we can communicate better.
College Senior,4,"The athletic center is small and have weights that people can use. The student center is nice, I only been in there a few times. The library is big and spacious. We have a cafe and nice study area. They have small classrooms that can also help with studying in groups. The campus activities are great they have events at least two times a month. They give out different things and have drawing to win a basket. The general campus aesthetics is great and very environmental."
Freshman,2,"I attended the paramedic program and was nothing short of a circus that was on fire, lots of miscommunication and low pass rate"
College Junior,2,The financial aid department is horrible and extremely rude. Will not help you understand your options.
College Junior,2,Florida Gateway is a smaller college that consists of mostly dual enrollment students along with students working toward a certain career path in one of the specific programs. Student body is not a top priority here.
College Junior,2,"For the most part, FGC's academics need reviewing. They are outdated, the materials such as books are poorly written, and the instructors need to be evaluated about the subjects they intend to instruct before they are hired."
College Junior,2,"The computer labs are few and speed sucks. Costs are through the roof for printing, and the system is up and down. Due to it's location, FGC is a extremely small school with very few resources and has no sports programs. It is in a lower class community but is our only hope of getting a career that can place us in better places. I wish I had a better personal computer and my own printer but due to a lack of jobs here, I have to utilize my friends lap top. Having your own portable computer would make things more accessible on this campus with most of its courses being held on-line. Technology at this school is twenty years behind the majority of better quality schools."
College Junior,2,"The academics are great, but there is little learning. We learn just what we need to to pass the class and then discard the information. Some classes don't even have that much. Students frequently get test answers out of the books and never bother to ead the chapters."
College Freshman,2,Some of our student clubs are very oriented around those who are most active in the student government system. Therefore we have an Anime club and other such related clubs that are th emost active.
College Senior,2,"I have run into this issue a few times now... I have been taking some classes online, and some on campus, Unfortunately, I can't access some of the professors in person to ask a question, and sometimes it take quite a while for them to get back in touch with you when you message them online."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's Not the Easy Way Out ‚Äì Although online classes are convenient , they are not any easier that taking classes at the college. In fact, I believe they are harder. Since the teacher doesn't meet with you on a regular basis, they give you more work to make sure you understand the content. They are convenient but you have to stay on top of them or you can get behind easily."
College Senior,2,"Throughout my college experience I have received either very little financial aid to pay for only some of my books or none at all. Even though I fill out my fafsa every year I have been to college.  The deadline to apply for scholarships for the fall and spring terms is during the summer.  I did not receive my acceptance letter into the LPN program until November so, I couldn't apply for any scholarships.  I think they need to extend the application period for scholarships.  I have to apply for schlolarships since I have no financial aid or hardly any money to help me out with school.  My mother makes just a few thousand dollars more than the cut off for financial aid and the government thinks that's more than enough money for two children to attend college with. When in reality it isn't.  I'm very happy to be finally on the road to Nursing school."
College Junior,2,Could Be Better ‚Äì I think that the teachers could have better teaching methods and some better lesson plans.
College Sophomore,2,The process could be a lot easier by being better staffed and more polite to individuals that have been waiting in line for 3 hours.
Works Here,1,I loved my job as PTA Program Coordinator what I feel is terrible is being let go for no reason. Not able to defend my actions because the college refused to discuss it. So was it my two co workers who I put into their positions if so very unfair. Did upper management have issues with me then at least have the respect to discuss it. The way this college did me was very sad and I admit I cry about it every day.
College Junior,1,They urged me to get my AA degree when I did not qualify for financial aid. Now that I do qualify and have my AA (which ends up being unnecessary for my career plan.. they didn‚Äôt tell me that) I can not receive financial aid because I have too many credit hours.
College Junior,1,I do not like on-line courses. You wind up trying to teach yourself about subject matter that you went there to learn because you know little or nothing about it and there is no instruction from the instructors. It is time to get back to class room instruction and stop the dumbing of America.
College Junior,1,There are no post grad activities and the services are few and limited to who you know not what you know. This is a 'Good Ole Boy' Institute that leaves a lot to be desired.
College Junior,1,They do nothing for transfer student who have a B.S. or higher and will gladly take your money and use you time up but to help you find a source to assist you with paying for your college career is like pulling wisdom teeth. They are about getting a paycheck and going home.
College Junior,1,"There are some here that take their career goals serious, but for the most part, they are ""Rednecks with no idea of what they are here for or why"". The are more interested in having everything handed to them on a golden platter than working towards success. With the exception of those in nursing and medical fields, these students want the easy way out and feel they should be given the grade instead of earning the grade. The 25% of this student body need some hope and are for the most part praying to get to a four year institute where they have some chance of making their life careers happen."
College Junior,1,"FGC expects the students to pay for classes and then stay at home to teach themselves. other than my on campus classes within anatomy and physiology, the classes I have had here hold a lot to be desired in comparison to schools like Michigan State, Lansing Community College, University of Florida and Florida State, and does not begin to hold a candle to St. Augustine University when it comes to the Physical Therapy Program."
College Senior,1,I only had a few my first semester but soon learned to never again take them at Florida Gateway again. I had horrible experiences with both of mine and did not learn much from them. The Instructors I felt graded too harshly and didn't have their assignments in order. It could just have been bad luck on my part but I do not think so.
College Junior,1,There is little or none career services offered here as far as I know.

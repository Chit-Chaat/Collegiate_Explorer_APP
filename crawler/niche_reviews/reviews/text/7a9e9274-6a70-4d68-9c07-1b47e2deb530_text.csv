Sophomore,5,I took all of my classes online semester and everything is going smoothly. I've had no issues whatsoever.
Sophomore,5,I really love that the staff cares about the students. Everyone is super friendly and is willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"If you are looking for a local college with a great community of people then this is it. Indiana University Southeast offers smaller classroom sizes than the average lecture halls you would picture in movies. Depending on your degree your class sizes may vary, but mine have personally never exceeded 40 people! It’s the perfect opportunity for better learning and getting to know people."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken several online classes at IUS when on campus ones have not met my scheduling needs, and I must say that I have enjoyed every single one! Every professor I had has put in great detail in order to make the online learning experience easier."
Alum,5,"My professors expressed interest in my success and the school itself had a good air about it, lots of campus life activities available and a very open place for asking questions."
Alum,5,"Where it applied, the online courses were moderated by competent professors that were willing to make time in their schedules to ensure student success."
Freshman,5,"Although it is my first year at Indiana University Southeast, I already love it. I chose the school because it was smaller and close to home. I don’t think I would change anything about it."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Indiana University Southeast. It is a good school and I like the professors there.
Junior,5,"The teachers and faculty at IUS all genuinely care and want you to succeed. Teachers are passionate, knowledgeable, and experienced in their respective fields and topics of teaching. All of IUS staff does their best to support and encourage every single student."
Sophomore,5,"Fantastic Professors. Through my professors I have been able to meet successful businessmen in Kentucky, and make connections for future job opportunities! The career advisors at IUS have done a great job helping me explore internship opportunities. I am excited for two more years at IUS. I would like to complete my MBA at IUS because of how much I have gained in my undergraduate degree studying at IUS."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy how it's a smaller campus compared to any other university. You don't tend to feel out of place because all the staff is beyond friendly and they do care about your education. The professors there are understanding and I enjoy how the variety of things and announcements are online. One thing I do want to see change are the fraternity and sorority attitudes towards the rest of the student body. They should be making everyone feel welcome, not just whoever is apart of the fraternity or sorority. They shouldn't act as if they are superior. But I will say some who are apart of those are very nice."
Sophomore,5,I like how small the campus is. I also like the class sizes. They aren't too big and overwhelming. The class sizes are average and the rooms are smaller. I feel like I can focus more on what I'm learning. The campus is also in a safe area and I transferred here because of the safer route I take to school now. It's really easy to learn the campus too. The professors here care a lot about their students and want them to succeed. At the school I transferred from the professors had too many students so most of them didn't care as much but at IUS every professor I've met so far has been kind and cares about how you're doing.
Alum,5,"Excellent RN to BSN Program. Instructors are knowledgeable, seasoned nurses. They were helpful in many ways. The community projects helped to further develop my nursing and interpersonal skills with the public."
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere at Indiana University Southeast. I actually feel like the school wants students to learn. I feel safe going to school and walking around campus.
Sophomore,5,"IUS is a remote campus for Indiana University and is located in New Albany, Indiana.  It has experienced a lot of growth in the past 30 years (adding additional buildings and dormitories).  It is large enough to encompass many class and degree offerings without needing to transfer to the Bloomington campus.  Yet, it's still small enough that you don't get lost.  It's a very pleasant campus with friendly people."
Sophomore,5,"I never wanted to go to IUS, but I'm so glad I did! With it being a small campus, I didn't know if I would get the ""full college experience"" but I've actually loved its small size. It's so easy to get involved and feel cared for. The staff is always willing to help no matter how simple. Having smaller classes makes it easier because it's a lot easier to get help from your professors and they actually care about your success in their class. I'm so glad that I ended up here and I highly recommend it to anyone else!"
Sophomore,5,really great school. the classrooms remind me of classes in high school. i enjoy sitting by the pond to relax and do homework
Senior,5,They offer many classes and have wonderful professors. I have truly learned so much so far and I am so close to completing my degree there and it has been an amazing experience.
Sophomore,5,I love that my school has professors that are easy to connect with and learn from. My art professors are the reason that I am still in art school - or at least a huge part of it. I am really pushed to do my best and achieve my goals to have a successful career.
Freshman,5,"This school was bottom of my list, but I am very glad I made the final decision to go there. I just finished my first year, and it is very affordable, I'm finishing freshman year without any debt! The teachers are good, and the classes are challenging."
Senior,5,"I LOVE IUS! I am a non-traditional student and love the convenience, affordability, and quality of my education. Class sizes are small, teachers care about students, and the faculty really want to see students succeed. There are many social opportunities available (I am unable to attend most because I commute and have young children). The new on-campus housing is an added bonus. The apartments (not dorms!) are very new, safe, and well-kept."
Works Here,5,"It is amazing, the campus is beautiful and the professors are great. Since class sizes are small you get to be more interactive with your professors and feel like you aren't just a number. The student life organizations are amazing always hosting some event and its always a new experience."
Niche User,5,I love this school so much because everyone is super nice and there are so many great opportunities for everyone! The people there are always doing their best to help those around them in every way they can.
Freshman,5,"I am just a freshman at Indiana University Southeast (IUS), but I have loved the start of my college life! I started the year commuting, but was able to move on campus shortly after first semester started. This has helped me build relationships with other students at IUS. I have enjoyed living on my own and meeting lots of new people!
My professors and advisors have helped me get off to a great start. I have had a variety of classes so far-math, art, business, biology...I am finding that each class is different and pushing me to adapt and interact with not only fellow students by also my professors.
I look forward to continuing my education and graduating from IUS at the end of my four years there!"
Sophomore,5,"IUS and I go way back. I first started there fresh out of high school, not knowing exactly what I wanted to do with my life. After a 3 year hiatus from college, I briefly attended one of the larger local universities, where I was met with faculty who did not make me feel like they cared about me or my education. On top of this, I racked up a lot more debt than I care to say. Remembering my time at IUS, I decided to transfer back. The faculty and staff immediately made it clear that they were available to guide me and assist me in any way possible, and they helped me get on track to finish a degree program I am passionate about."
Senior,5,I am currently an active duty service member serving over seas.  I take as many credits as I can in order to obtain a Bachelors degree prior to returning to civilian life.  IUS staff has been amazing with working with me and the complications that sometimes occur from being a full time Marine and living over seas.  Whenever I need help or I have difficulty meeting a deadline they are more than willing to work with me.
Sophomore,5,"I am grateful for the experience that I have had here at IUS so far! I have made amazing friends and learned from amazing professors. The professors are willing to work and meet with you, something I respect and have not heard many students from other universities mention. Most of students at IUS are commuting, so you have to put more effort into on campus activities than at other universities, but it is welcoming regardless."
Junior,5,They are always there to see you succeed. They have supplemental instructors and the professors are always there to answer all your questions. The school is set to to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I was hesitant at first to attend school here for honestly reasons unknown. When I finally did decide to go though, I made a very smart decision. The staff at IUS are absolutely wonderful, and if you desire to learn, this university truly is worth your while. The campus is serene and flush with green, the professors are interesting in the subjects and the students. Couldn't recommend a better school  for anyone in the Kentuckiana region looking for a four year degree that is worth their money and time. A beautiful place to grow the mind."
Senior,5,"The faculty is great and treats everyone with respect. As a non-traditional student with a family, I found it easy to find the classes I needed at times that were convenient."
Junior,5,"This is my home away from home, this campus is beyond beautiful, perfect in size and everyone that works there are super friendly and very helpful. The only downside is that the tuition is expensive."
Junior,5,"IUS is very accommodating. The staff is friendly and helpful. There are also many different options as far as class schedules are concerned. A big bonus is that there is a flat tuition rate for anywhere from 12 to 18 credits a semester. There is not any confusion about what is expected of new students and all the paperwork, such as financial aid, etc., is processed quickly."
Freshman,5,"I just finished orientation yesterday.  So far, so good!  I have rated below based on what I know so far."
Senior,5,Indiana University Southeast has been a great fit for me and my college experience. I commute and this is a commuting school but they also have very nice dormitories. The academic advisers are extremely helpful with helping you decide a major and also planning out your college career. They have walked me through many career options and classes. This college has been a great investment on my future and has gotten me to where I need to be to earn a great career. This campus in named one of the safest campuses in the United States. The class size and professors also work out great. The class sizes are a reasonable size and many students can receive one on one help. People of all ages come to this school. I have a family of my own so this school really fit with my lifestyle. I love this university and would recommend it to anyone.
Junior,5,"Overall the school is amazing. Some of the professors in charge of the online classes can delay responses and some just post everything and pretty much say have at it, but this has only been a few out of the entire roster. Then again, you have this issue with any college."
Junior,5,"I love Indiana University Southeast. I have two semesters left after this one and I've been very pleased with my advisors and the professors. They are always open to help you in any way that they can. Being a mom and working while being in school is very hard, but most of the professors understand that and they are very encouraging."
Freshman,5,"I love the professors and people here, everyone is willing to help you no matter what.  I think the classes are challenging yet easy enough to understand. The best thing on campus is the views we have along with a touch of wildlife. The safety here is outstanding; however, if I were gonna change anything, it would have to be parking."
Sophomore,5,I am a student at Indiana University Southeast and I love it here. It is a great size and i wold encourage anyone to go to this school!
Senior,5,"I love this college!  The professors know me by name and do all they can to help and support me.   There is infinite assistance in the application process, study help, and scholarships.  The class variety is amazing, as well!  Everyone is loving and kind and the food is spectacular.  On-campus living is luxurious- with a full kitchen and living room and everything is furnished!"
Freshman,5,I can't wait to get started in January of 2017. I'm looked forward to all my Psychology Classes!! This is going to be an awesome journey and I look forward to helping more people in the future!
College Freshman,5,"There's a multitude of diversity in the students and professors which I think is great; if you are a conservative Christian like me however, prepare to have some of your beliefs challenged and to be outside of your comfort zone. Most of the time the campus will side with the more liberal of students so you will have to become comfortable with that aspect."
College Freshman,5,"VERY safe! The officers are always there to help you, there are emergency call buttons, and the campus is well lit at night! I am sometimes there until 11-12pm! I have never felt endangered!"
College Freshman,5,"There are always recruits, job postings alumni events, guest speakers, and many work/study programs!"
College Junior,5,"Personally I am not a member of the Greek life community however, my best friend is and she enjoys it. The Greeks are good people most of the time and are very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,I love everything about this school. I haven't had one bad run-in on the campus due to any infractions. My teachers were great and the class sizes even better. There was always time to go to talk to someone about your needs or wants.
College Sophomore,5,I think the safety of the school is amazing. School police do whatever they need to do to provide a safe environment. I feel extremely safe on campus and love it there
College Sophomore,5,There are plenty of posters that are posted around campus in regards to safety on every level.
College Sophomore,5,"I truly love IUS. It has a beautiful campus, helpful staff members, and teachers that put forth the effort to helping all of their students. I haven't had a class that I despise due to the teacher. I have been to several colleges being a transfer student and IUS has been the only one I have felt at home with."
College Junior,5,I love my professors. They understand that we all have jobs and other commitments as well as school so they make themselves available to help you whenever you may need it. Class sizes are small which makes it a great environment for class discussions. The variety of courses offered is pretty wide as well.
College Junior,5,"Safety on our campus is great. We have our own campus police who patrol often so I always feel safe and secure on campus, even at night. There are lit call stations all over campus that can be used to contact the police whenever necessary."
College Junior,5,"I think today students in college are more excepting to diversity then you think. our school started a Drag Show a few years ago, for example"
College Freshman,5,I love the class size. They are not huge. Laid back. The professors are professional.
College Freshman,5,It is very safe. If I need someone to walk me out security does not hesitate.
College Freshman,5,It has been amazing. Everyone from staff to other students have been so helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Being a part of the School Counseling Clinical Cohort, I know my internship and practicum experience will land me my dream job."
College Sophomore,5,Professors are the best I have come across
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the small, non-overbearing size of campus. Parking isn't even a hassle for my night classes."
College Sophomore,5,"I've been a part of a huge greek life during my undergraduate career. As a graduate student, it's heartwarming to see the difference IUS greek life, though small, does such huge things for the community."
College Sophomore,5,"The connections that I have made with my professors are invaluable. In two short semesters, I know my professors know my name, and even ask about my work and personal life to keep up with me. My professors have also encouraged me to connect to my community, and I have learned so much about the city I've lived in for over 20 years."
College Sophomore,5,"I've attended both a large university and a small community college. My experience with my community college has blown away every preconceived belief I had of small schools. Moving back home was not in the plan, but I am so glad it has led me to further my education at Indiana University Southeast."
Senior,4,"One of my favorite things about IUS is the smaller class sizes because it's easier to learn and it seems like the education is a lot more personable. Despite being a small campus there are options for literally everyone to get involved, no matter what your background may be."
Freshman,4,The class sizes are small and so you really get to know your professors as well as your fellow classmates. Professors are caring and understanding of you as a student. Campus life is always exciting and there are many fun events to attend.
Freshman,4,"I am a first year student at IUS and like all I was scared that I was going to get lost. I have come to figure out that the campus is very easy to figure out and it’s a fairly small campus so it’s easy to learn. Also, I learned that people if that’s teachers or student students or the officer they are all very helpful with getting around. The form rooms here are amazing and are the best out of any college that I’ve seen. There are also a lot of ways that people try to get you involved in campus. It’s a very open campus with people always trying to talk to you and get you to do stuff around with others. The professors are mostly very nice and will work with you. There’s also a lot of different free opportunities for help with school work. There are a lot of people willing to tutor or there’s certain places where you can go to get help on specific subjects."
Freshman,4,"I like how small it is. There are only about 6,000 people which is perfect for me. Also, they have an excellent nursing school program, and will give you in state tuition if you live in Kentucky. And their housing options are amazing for the price. One of the things I’d wish they would change is having more on campus food options. Specifically that are gluten free because I am celiac and cannot have any gluten, which comes mainly from wheat. That would be great!"
Sophomore,4,"I have only attended for one year, but so far I have loved all of my professors.  The school is small so they remember your name and make class fun by interacting with us.  All of my professors have been super caring and have helped me without question."
Freshman,4,"So far, it's a great experience. The Southeast Campus is open to anyone. They encourage you to get involved with the school. There are plenty of ways to get your name out there. Whether it's through sports or clubs or just taking surveys and helping other students out. The school is amazing."
Freshman,4,"I love that classes are small so you are able to have one on one time with your professor to understand the material better. Also, it is easy to get to each class on time since the campus is all in one area."
Senior,4,"Indiana University Southeast is small, friendly campus that caters to both traditional and non-traditional students. Class sizes are small enough that every student has the opportunity to experience one on one time with every professor if necessary. Every building is easily and quickly accessible. Resources for career development, resume building, and really any other need for steps beyond the university can be accessed, or if unavailable on campus can be found and provided through professor or other professionals' resources. Every opportunity is reachable here if the student is prepared to pursue it and work for it. The small campus does sometimes hinder the availability at which certain courses are offered and it is often times hard to find parking due to the majority of the student population commuting."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed the environment, academic and social. The school has wonderful student aid programs and is very supportive. The only downside is that for my specific major (nursing, BSN) there are very many Pre Requisite courses required."
Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed the campus. I have had positive experiences with all of my professors. The campus has a lot of resources to help all types of students.
Freshman,4,"IUS offers a great deal of programs, courses, and majors of which strive to help every student from all kinds of backgrounds succeed at their perspective courses."
Senior,4,"I love the small community at Indiana University Southeast. The small class sizes makes it easier to interact one-on-one with professors and develop connections with fellow students. However, at IUS the campus life is somewhat lacking. IUS is a commuter school and has difficulty promoting school spirit that you may find at a bigger, traditional college. Overall, IUS is an excellent choice for students interested in a small campus and focusing on receiving a great education."
Freshman,4,"For me, IUS was a childhood dream. My older brother attended this school and I visited it as a child. I fell in love with the campus, the surrounding community was amazing. Everything was so big and surreal. I enjoy the classes now, and the community is great but the childhood wonder isn't here."
Junior,4,"IUS has a very open and welcoming environment. I really like the face-to-face interactions with my professors, as well as having the smaller classes, which helps immensely when you are having a difficult time understanding a particular topic."
Freshman,4,"This school has a very nice atmosphere along with kind people and teachers; my professors seem to really care about me and are willing to work with me. Although I wish there was a bit more of a social scene, it's a nice little school."
Freshman,4,"I like how IUS is very organized along with having a welcome week where you are able to go and learn about different sororities, and how to get more involved with things going on around the campus"
Junior,4,"Comfortable campus. I'm very happy about my experience. I've changed my major once, and had great feedback. I enjoy the adult center that they have there. I utilize that the most. The library has plenty of rooms for study groups."
Senior,4,The campus is very safe and available to students 24 hours for studying and working on artwork. The teachers take the time to get to know you and help you if you're struggling or need guidance. I love how my art instructors help me progress in my work and make materials available at all times.
Junior,4,IUS has been a wonderful experience! I have had understanding and patient teachers over the past 3 years.
Junior,4,As a current undergrad I feel that Indiana University - Southeast has helped me in my need to grow in continuing to higher education and advancing my career. The advisors here are very helpful and knowledgeable which in turn helps every student advance better in their academic career.
Freshman,4,I love this school so much. It is large enough to meet a good amount of different people and new interesting people. But you still have small class sizes. I even live on campus and the dorms are amazing.
College Freshman,4,"Some students like to ignore the 'no smoking on campus' signs, and some students party, but it's not overly anundant and it does not define your experience."
College Freshman,4,Overall IUS is a great school!
College Freshman,4,IUS is an amazing school with so much to offer! I started as a kid who had NO idea what I wanted to do in life- it took me a while to find my passion and I've had some mishaps along the way but the team there has helped me through it and I am a better person for it!
College Junior,4,I have had amazing professors and while some were not using a method that worked for me and the course was a little crazy I believe that it could be a bit better. I like the size of the classes and the different courses offered as well as the different teachers there are.
College Junior,4,I am not a hundred percent sure about the value of a degree however the career prospects are amazing because of the ability to find internship programs or job shadowing.
College Junior,4,I think that this campus is a moderately safe place and people work to keep it that way. Nobody wants to be hurt so we work together to keep things running smoothly.
College Junior,4,Personally not an on campus student however I have visited the facilities and am impressed as well as knowing students who do live on campus.
College Junior,4,I think Athletes and other students find the Athletics building and equipment to be quite well. Sure there could be more but  the programs for athletes are wonderful.
College Junior,4,I like the school a lot and have had many amazing experiences there. Sure sometimes the burden of bills can be a bit much but we're adults and that is going to happen in life. Overall I think this is a great college and I am glad I chose to go here.
College Sophomore,4,I personally haven't looked into career options yet in my field because it requires a certificate but I have looked into getting a job at a hospital around my field to get used to it.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't personally live in them, but have heard great things about them and have seen pictures of them and they look really nice."
College Sophomore,4,"I've heard and read great things about the Greek life. They are nice people and do quite a bit for the school other than party or do the ""usual"" Greek life party options."
College Sophomore,4,"I would say that they are good or even great, but I have yet to attend one event. I have a one year old that has had some medical issues that overshadow the sports right now."
College Sophomore,4,I have loved my experience so far at IUS. The teacher and the people have been great. I wouldn't have wanted to go to a different school.
College Junior,4,"I start in the fall, but so far everything I have seen is great!"
College Sophomore,4,The student career prospects can be endless. The best thing you can do for yourself is make time to go to some of the Greek Life events. There are more than just the Greek Life booths there. That's how I discovered that there is a program that helps you specifically obtain internships.
College Sophomore,4,I do not live on campus but I do pass by them all the time.
College Sophomore,4,The two events that I have attended due to Greek Life have been pretty great!
College Junior,4,School security can be seen patrolling the school grounds throughout the day.  The campus has proper lighting so I never worry about walking to my car alone at night. The campus also has phones throughout the campus that can be used in case of an emergency. (There are two phone in just the parking lot on the side of the arts building).
College Junior,4,My experience so far at Indiana University Southeast has been great. The professor are welling to work with students one-on-one outside of the classroom when needed to make sure the student is successful in the class. The campus is well kept and the other staff members are nice and willing to help student in any way that they can. There are always interesting courses offered each year and the school even has distant education so a student can take an online class that they need that is being offered at another Indiana University campus.
College Junior,4,The career center is always willing to help you find and apply for jobs or internships in your field of study.
College Junior,4,"While it isn't for everyone, I love that Indiana University Southeast is a commuter school. I do not have to live on campus so that cuts out one big expense that comes with other schools. The professors are friendly and always willing and eager to help you reach your full potential in their class or in anything else you need help with."
College Junior,4,"for my degree, fine arts, I think IUS has alt of art class to take. the photography field is growing, so maybe more of those classes would be nice"
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great, the online classes are fun and high paced!"
College Freshman,4,"I do no live on campus, but everyone I know that does loves it."
College Freshman,4,They are involved with other students and genuinely care.
College Sophomore,4,"there are, I believe 9 Emergency buttons on campus. Also, all students have access to the campus police number"
College Sophomore,4,I just joined Phi Sigma Sigma at IUS this semester and it really is involved in school activities. we try to focus on growing our sisterhood as well.
College Freshman,4,My teachers are very focused on helping each of their students. Being able to message them whenever I have a problem is amazing. The small class sizes put a huge focus on the student and their learning. The downside is attendance is a huge part of our grades. But the greatest thing is getting involved is easy and it feels more like a family than a school.
College Sophomore,4,The professors really want you to succeed and will go out of their way to help you.
College Sophomore,4,We have had a few scares but they were false alarms.
College Sophomore,4,The professors go out of their way to help the students and the faculty in the offices are very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Ethnically and racially, our campus isn't very diverse. As far as I have experienced, we aren't very religiously diverse either. On the other hand, the administration and the students tend to make it a very comfortable environment where discrimination against minorities is not tolerated. While we are not diverse in these areas per say, we do have a good attitude towards diversity. We're fairly diverse in regards to political views and sexual orientation."
College Freshman,4,"Drugs and alcohol are not very visible at my school, or perhaps I just don't hang around people who use them a lot. Some people do talk about and use drugs, but that happens mostly off campus."
College Freshman,4,I'm not currently involved with the Greeks but we have 3 choices and all of them are involved in the community and seem inviting.
College Freshman,4,I really like this school. It's a small campus with a nice student to teacher ratio and all of the teachers seem to really care about the subjects they are teaching. The dorm rooms are amazing and the people here are friendly
College Sophomore,4,My professors have always been very helpful and understanding.
College Sophomore,4,I love the fact that my school is smaller so you get more one-on-one time with the professors.
College Freshman,4,"I have very much enjoyed my time here. Class sizes are small, which is a plus, and being involved in the Honors program at IUS was one of the best decisions I made when applying. The school is a little on the smaller side, and it is very convenient for commuters like myself. So far all of the professors I've had have been very knowledgeable about their topics, even if they might not have been the best at conveying information. Most class styles are either lectures or labs, but they also offer online classes, which I have not had any experience with."
College Freshman,2,"I personally think the Greek life could better serve its members; they pay quite a bit of money to be there and receive few to none in the scholarship department, and there is no housing option for them, members are also expected to do many service projects and boosters for the group- and are not reimbursed for their time/effort."
College Freshman,2,"IUS is more concerned with academics than sports. I feel lucky to have chosen this school, because academics should always come first."
College Sophomore,2,"Applying for financial aid is easy and takes very little time. The financial aid given to students is based on family iincome and even though I live with family, the do not financially support me. I pay for school and pretty much anything I want or need. Due to this, the financial aid I receive makes it hard to take classes. Recently it has gotten better due to the drop in my father's income, but I make 13000 a year and it does not help much."
College Sophomore,2,Ethnic and racial diversity is almost nonexistent here at IU Southeast.
College Junior,2,"The only party people really talk about are the frat TKE parties, or the 2 am parties hosted by TKE members. They cost money, but a lot of people go to them and enjoy them. Ladies can usually get in free before a certain time, and sometimes with a toy everyone can or get a discount. Outside of that it depends on whether you throw one with your friends, or go out to a club or bar yourself."
College Junior,2,"The only transportation available is public transportation. It is referred to as TARC and only one bus travels here across the bridge from Louisville, Kentucky to New Albany, Indiana very few times a day."
College Freshman,2,I assume that they are that they are okay. I don't go.
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing doing. 

If it is, it's exclusive, and/or uninviting."
College Senior,2,"The nightlife in the area surrounding IUS is not ""booming"". We are located in a small town so there aren't many bars in the vicinity. There are however, some activities such as the nearly naked mile, that go on at night. If students that are 21 do wish to go out, we are located about 5 miles from Louisville, KY, which has plenty of bars to choose from or the Bloomington campus is about an hour drive away as well."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a McDonald's, Taco Bell and Arby's down the street. Other than that, you have to drive a little ways to go to any actual restaurant. But there are some relatively good locations in the city of New Albany in general."
College Junior,2,"There are times that it gets very overcrowded, but many days there is amble parking. They keep it very clean and not much trash has been seen on the ground and they keep the grassy areas mowed and plants attended to."
College Sophomore,2,Being in southern Indiana it is difficult to find a good night life. There is an awesome night life in Louisville (about a 10/15 min drive).
College Sophomore,2,"They are trying, it says there are more girls than boys. But it feels about even to me right now. There are some international students but not much. There is no diversity in religion or political status where is a republican and a Christian."
College Senior,2,"They are helpful with the information, but when it comes to something complicated they are useless and misleading./\"
College Junior,2,"I've been lucky enough to have financial aid cover my costs the past two years. But the FAFSA process is just so frustrating, and you must have a certain amount of credit hours to recieve financial aid which can be very difficult to find time in your schedule for."
College Freshman,2,"Very cliquey, They dont really accociate with other people other than other greek life."
College Student,2,"The cost for the parking permit isn't too bad, but spots fill up quickly in all the lots so if you don't get there early, you end up pretty far away.  The only exception is if you take classes on the weekend, or later at night."
College Freshman,2,"Depending on what time you get to school will determine your parking spot. The earlier you get there, the closer you can park. Parking all the way in the back of the parking lot is a nightmare."
College Freshman,2,They throw parties some have inappropriate titles. They only hang out with themselves.
College Junior,2,We do not have a large selection of sports so there does not seem to be very much fan support or spirit in that way.
College Sophomore,1,"We have a dining hall but they do not tend to the late night students, like myself. I have attended this school for almost four years and never got to try the food."
College Junior,1,"Never open on weekends, closes at 7.  Those living on campus have to cook for themselves or go off campus."
College Junior,1,"New Albany isn't exactly a 'small' town, but it definitely has a small town vibe.  You know there isn't much to do if a Walmart trip is the most exciting thing to look forward to.  I do not personally have a car, and there is only one bus that services the IUS campus. Sidewalks are non-existent directly outside of the campus, so walking is very dangerous. Transportation is virtually impossible without a car."
College Junior,1,There is no on-campus health center and no school nurse's station.
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no help when it comes to finical aid. I had to call another school in the area to ask for help because the woman assigned to help me told me if I really cared about my education I could go homeless and not be selfish by asking for finical aid. Not even worth it.
College Junior,1,"Until recently, last 5 years, ius was a commuter school. until the 5 years ago there were no dorms at all. they are trying to get more students involved in on campus activites but far behind major schools"
College Junior,1,we have a bus stop but cannot easily find time and dates for the stops and there are not very many stops throughout the day either. there maybe 4 times a day the bus even comes and no other form except cars available. I do not drive so I rely on my family and friends with cars alot
College Junior,1,"There is only two apartments within walking distance from campus that we can stay in, and town has maybe 10 other apartment complexes even available"
College Junior,1,"Across the street to our campus is Arbys, mc donalds, taco bell, and Frishes. Not a lot of options, and definitely not healthy options at all"
College Sophomore,1,More restaurants would be better. We mostly have fast food and a few hole in the wall places.
College Sophomore,1,"They try but, they have no houses and that is a total buzz kill."
College Freshman,1,Unless you are in the greek system (two or three frats and sororities) you can't really be involved because it is an off campus community.
College Junior,1,"There is not much of a night life for IU Southeast.  The only night life includes meeting friends here at campus then making plans to go to the bars or club in Louisville. There are some parties held by the sororities or fraternities here, but they are usually lame.  The most fun I have partying is going to the sisterhood campus in Bloomington and staying there all weekend."
College Freshman,1,They is relatively no nightlife unless you cross the bridge to Louisville.
College Senior,1,"There is a strict policy of no drinking an not smoking on campus. There is a Campus Student Conduct System Hearing Commission for those who have broken the laws of the Campus police or committed infraction of the social laws of campus. The commission is made up of students, faculty and staff in order to be sure there is a fair hearing to the student who has come before the commission.."
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife does not exist.  There is nothing even remotely close to do and campus pretty much shuts down.
College Sophomore,1,"I just realized recently that IUS even offered housing, and I hear it's extremely overpriced."
College Senior,1,who knew? There is a baseball team but nothing is promoted.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office has made many mistakes for students at IUS. Fellow pupils often describe horror stories of financial aid not being processed for weeks after the estimated time. I too have had multiple problems with the financial aid at IUS.
College Junior,1,"Our parking lots are way overcrowded, especially at the beginning of every semester so your lucky to find a parking spot at all. The schools expanded tremendously over the last few years with no change to the parking situation..."

Unlike other universities, as a freshman at IUPUI, you’re required to take a course named “learning community”.

As a science student,  I got good practice in lab with resourceful equipment."
Sophomore,5,IUPUI is an amazing choice. I went into college without knowing anyone but came out with many new friends and experiences. IUPUI really goes the extra mile to make you feel welcomed and that is something they take pride in. They have many great resources available to make your college experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
Junior,5,"As a junior I have really enjoyed my time. One thing I wish anyone could have control over is the pandemic and being able to go back without a risk, but that is in the hands of fate at this point. I have made life long friends and memories."
Junior,5,"My overall experience about IUPUI is the diversity that is seen on campus. Along with the diversity that is seen among campus, there are different clubs and activities to get involved in with the community."
Junior,5,My online experience is great because the communication with the teachers is excellent and I am able to understand all material that is given through online courses.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are great. It's comparable to having one-on-one lessons with a professor. They have many online resources to help you be successful.
Sophomore,5,I'm a full-time student in Electrical Engineering who lives off campus. IUPUI is a very quality and professional university to attend. You'll gain a both valuable degree and experience in a real-world environment.
Junior,5,I love the academic atmosphere and the fact that everyone is there to accomplish something and succeed. I made really good friends there and hope to meet more people in my field.
Senior,5,My experience at IUPUI has been amazing. The classes have taught me material as well as how to think critically and formulate educated ideas. I have become more open-minded and a better person as a result of the education I am receiving.
Freshman,5,what i  liked the most was eveyone was super helpful and nice and very supportive when i needed help the staff was right there to help and answer any questions i might have.
Freshman,5,"my online experience was great the professors  where very helpful, my  advisors were very helpful with navigation everything when it came to classes i needed and staying on track with everything"

Freshman,5,It has a large campus but is easy to learn over time.  Buy a year long parking pass and get ready to search for a parking spot
Freshman,5,Fantastic urban setting rich with internship opportunities to really put your skills to the test. Faculty and Administrative staff have been nothing short of fantastic the whole way through. They are by your side in the admissions process and make sure you have everything you need to get a leg up on your college career. The atmosphere of the college is welcoming to all walks of life and they immediately make you feel right at home. I knew this college was my future the moment I stepped onto campus.
Sophomore,5,IUPUI has felt like home to me since I stepped on campus. I love the unlimited amount of opportunities they provide for their students to set them up for success. I have made friends and connections with people that will last a lifetime and I couldn't be more grateful for IUPUI helping me accomplish all my goals.
Alum,5,"IUPUI is a perfect urban campus surrounded by top hospitals, a peaceful city, and endless opportunities. I enjoyed IUPUI being a smaller campus because I found that it was easier to make relationships with teachers, stay more focused on my studies, and excel to the best of my ability. One factor I would like to see change is parking on campus. Parking was very difficult to find on campus. If there was a way to provide more parking for students, I think it would be very appreciated for all those commuting to campus!"
Graduate Student,5,IUPUI gives students the ability to focus on their studies and return to their daily lives seamlessly.
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautifully set near downtown Indianapolis. It provided close job or internship opportunities close to campus. The student life was abundant and never lacking. I can’t say much for dork or housing simply since I commuted, but I do know the dorms I busted were very modern and ideal."
Junior,5,"IUPUI has a diverse range of services available that are easy to access by students, such as computer access, tutoring, study areas and groups, recreational equipment, and food services. The professors are very involved in their students pursuit of knowledge and they make visible efforts to guide and extend help to any student that needs it. Classes are organized in a way that makes the student feel challenged, but not overburdened with assignments. It is possible, with the right amount of effort, to do well in classes at IUPUI and still have enough time for activities outside of school."
Niche User,5,IUPUI is my dream university and they provide everything I could possibly dream of from single dorms in the North Hall as well as being close to the bustling and quaint city.
Junior,5,I like that IUPUI is a diverse college. IUPUI offers many programs and clubs for all kinds of students. The environment is very friendly and welcoming. I wish that the counselors would be more helpful and connect to the students.
Niche User,5,I've visited the school once and I absolutely loved it. It didn't take me long to pick what school I would want to go to because I already knew where my soon to be home is going to be. The tour guides were amazing and answered every question that I have. I look forward to calling IUPUI my new home.
Niche User,5,The main trait that stood out to me was the urban and modernness IUPUI had. IUPUI is in downtown Indianapolis and gave me a city feel. I also liked it because the dorms are very nice and some have their own bathroom.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus! It was very clean and welcoming. The academics impressed me and their on campus jobs.
Freshman,5,I love the online opportunity to get my degree with this school.  I am a little bit further on in my professional career but a degree is something I am lacking.  The schedule works really well for being a full time employee and a mom.  I am also loving the challenge.  The online classes are setup very user friendly and the professors are very helpful and clear about what is expected.  I would highly recommend this University to anyone who is seeking an online education around a busy life.
Freshman,5,I love how diverse IUPUI is. the education is great and campus is a comfortable and safe environment. I wish I had enough funds to make it to my senior year.
Niche User,5,Great environment. The teachers there cared about their students and went above and beyond to help their students understand the material being taught.
Freshman,5,IUPUI is a great school if you are looking for an urban school and a great diverse community! The professors are very passionate and great at what they do! This is an amazing school.
Junior,5,I love IUPUI! The campus is beautiful and I have enjoyed all my instructors. The support staff at IUPUI are wonderful. I have every resource imaginable. I have enjoyed not only attending IUPUI as a student but as an employee also. The benifits are wonderful!!
Sophomore,5,"Very diverse. Literally in the city. Close to everything, close to many amazing restaurants with student discounts. Has a Starbucks inside student center. Provides tutors for many subjects, if you are struggling. Many scholarships as well. Many majors and minors."
Freshman,5,"IUPUI is a campus in the city. There are many activities and fun things to do around Indianapolis! Restaurants, the canal, Colts, Pacers, Indy Fuel, museums, and the Indianapolis Zoo. You honestly can't get any better when wanting to be able to balance work, school, and play. Great place and school for keeping your mental health strong."
Sophomore,5,I love that is in downtown and in the center of everything. It provides an immersive environment and we're surrounded by lots of job opportunitites. I've had mostly great experiences with my professors and classes and I look forward to the rest of my time there.
Freshman,5,The woman I spoke to whole helped me get enrolled and fill out student aid papers was incredibly helpful and nice! Overall my enrollment experience was very simple and not too time-consuming. I was expecting applying for college at 24 to be horrifying however she helped me see that I am doing the right thing to improve my life for myself and my family. Very flexible scheduling and tons of help available when needed!
Senior,5,IUPUI has many opportunities for their students both academically and socially. The professors are hard on their students only to challenge them and make them better both professionally and for personal development. I specifically attend the Kelley School of Business and I am definitely going to get a huge return on my investment when I enter the workforce. Kelley does not just teach the content but they readily prepares their students for the real world of business.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the campus setting. The teachers are extraordinary and the classes are fantastic! The campus has a nice down-to-earth feel and is very home feeling.
Freshman,5,IUPUI is really known for their diversity in students and staff. They make everyone feel welcomed and like they belong there. They have so many clubs and activities that you can get involved with. Every week they have movie night! Such an easy way to get students together on campus.
Junior,5,"IUPUI gives the students a real college experience while also letting them feel like they're being adults for the first time. The campus is downtown, so there's plenty to do! The professors are nice and are well-prepared to teach their classes."
Senior,5,"I have truly found my home in the community at IUPUI. As a transfer student, I always felt welcome and as if my professors really did have my best interest in mind. I loved it so much I have decided to continue my education at IUPUI, pursuing my Doctorate of Occupational Therapy in their program."
Niche User,5,"This downtown campus is a wonderful location sitting in the heart of Indianapolis, IN.  I was in the Purdue School of Engineering and really enjoyed the resources that the campus provided. A lot of cool lab space and the career placement resources are fantastic!  The only down fall to this campus is that it is commuter based so it lacks the traditional college vibe."
Freshman,5,"I would prefer other professors be hired. Especially if the said professors are doing a terrible job at teaching. When most students are complaining about the lack of information being delievered by the professor, than there should be some serious evaluations on the performance of the professor."
Niche User,5,I had a wonderful experience at IUPUI! I went on a tour of the whole entire campus and got to walk through all the buildings. The environment there was very appealing to me and I loved all the free resources IUPUI had to offer. I can that they want you to succeed there and they have every major you could imagine. I also love the city feel of the campus.
Freshman,5,"There are so many resources for Students looking for tutors, any type of help and support. I love the fact that I can do all my classes online, it’s very convenient. It works for my home life and work life."
Niche User,5,I am still a senior in high school and haven't started there yet but very impressed with tour we took back in October.
Senior,5,"IUPUI has been a great experience! The overall campus, students, professors have been extremely helpful during my 4 years. I've grown as artist but also I've grown into a different person. I view the world in a different perspective and understand and comprehend art in a different way for the good."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at IUPUI and I am having an excellent time thus far. I just completed my midterm exams, and of my five current teachers, I have issues with just one. The parking situation is sub-par but besides that, I am enjoying my time."
Freshman,5,"IUPUI really does feel like home. Everyone on campus, staff and student alike, are extremely friendly and will help you out with anything. It definitely gives you a feeling of relief knowing that even as a freshman everyone is willing to help you."
Freshman,5,"IUPUI is a wonderful university in the great city of Indianapolis. I always feel safe and can always find something fun to do. The opportunities for work are amazing and the chance for personal growth is beyond what I ever imagined. The dorms are cozy and the campus is gorgeous. The sky walks make getting around easy and the food is great. If I could change anything at all, it would be to add some more parking. It is such a busy campus that everyone wants to enjoy, but they need to be able to park to do so."
Senior,5,"The opportunities surrounding this campus are endless no matter what degree you are pursuing. Due to the campus' close location to downtown Indianapolis, business students and those alike have access to tons of Fortune 500 companies. Medical and healthcare students have three of the biggest hospitals located right off campus to find the career that fits their needs and desires. Campus is full of networking opportunities, endless organizations, and campus life that is beyond the typical college experience."
Freshman,5,"I chose IUPUI because of the combination of Purdue and Indiana University, I love the campus, and the location of the campus. The school could work on campus safety."
Freshman,4,Most of my classes are online this year and I do feel the professors are very understanding and know that we are new to this. Most professors are doing a really good job orienting themselves with the online resources as well.
Freshman,4,"Few struggles adapting and meeting new people, but overall the professors are incredibly helpful and are  really accommodating to the students needs!"
Sophomore,4,Due to COVID I have taken many classes online. It has gone a lot better than I thought it would. The professors have adapted so well and are making the process are easy and doable as possible. Great dedication.
Sophomore,4,I do not live on campus but everyone is very welcoming. There are a ton of ways to meet people and it is an overall great place to attend school.
Freshman,4,"Online classes are fairly easy to navigate. However, some of the assignments are more confusing through canvas."
Junior,4,"While the college has some glaring downsides i also has some really great faculty who are ready and willing to help they are also very cool and interesting. The only thing I would like to improve in IUPUI is fixing the cafeteria there are some serious issues there. If you are vegan or vegetarian I would not have your hopes up on options especially if you want the burgers, pasta, or stir fry. They cook that right alongside the items with meat in it."
Graduate Student,4,"My time at IUPUI was a great experience that I would love to do over. I was felt confident going to a school closer to home and thought that it'd be easy going without much going on, but I was wrong. IUPUI has so much life to it without including the fact it's centered downtown. Every walk to class had something entertaining or new to view. I enjoyed my long fast walks through campus trying to make it to every class on time without breaking my back or stumbling across the street. I appreciated the thought behind all the sit-down spots for students to study, eat or relax at. Some places had the perfect lighting, some had the best WIFI connection and other spots had the comfiest seats. It was all added to the experience at IUPUI down to the tiniest detail. It's a wonderful school."
Graduate Student,4,"My online experience at IUPUI was a hit or a miss most of the time. It wasn't until my final year at IUPUI (also when I went into a different program) that the online learing seemed to get easier. When I started at IUPUI I was dead set on getting a business degree in marketing, but sadly that didn't work out as much as I hoped it would.. My experience taking any business course online was tough even with putting the time and effort into studying. It was competitive and after a while I could tell some of my professors weren't interested in helping me out as much anymore. Some tried more than others and those professors I will forever be grateful to for giving me the confidence I needed to continue. I ended up switching my major to OLS and I excelled in it more than I expected to. I had amazing in class an online professors that wanted me to succeed and answered any question I had thoroughly."
Senior,4,Easy campus to get around. Always very clean and staff us very nice. PARKING IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Niche User,4,While doing online it’s hard to have the life one would have while going physically in person. That’s not to say that iupui doesn’t make the experience bad. They provide the needed materials and help work with you and your life.
Sophomore,4,They did a pretty good job with the unexpected transition from on-campus classes to all online classes. The professors were able to adapt to the situation and were very understanding. Overall the learning experience was enjoyable and still felt like I got the most out of the classes.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to transition completely online in my spring semester. However, my professors still worked tirelessly to provide meaningful lectures, assignments, and fair exams, considering our situations. I am grateful to have been a part of an excellent university and to have had the excellent professors I had during a time of crisis."
Sophomore,4,"IUPUI is an excellent school in many ways. I am very passionate about the degree I am pursuing and IUPUI is known for the program I am in. Consequently, I have had a challenging yet rewarding experience academically. Furthermore, being centered in the middle of downtown Indianapolis made the college an ideal pick for me as I loved the city. Lastly, the friends I have made through the school's Honors College and the variety of experience it has offered me has made my experience worthwhile."
Junior,4,I feel as if the communication online is a little more tricky than in person. other than that i have enjoyed it. Not having to commute everyday has been great for my mental state and i've been able to get more work done from home.
Junior,4,"Due to the coronavirus, we all transitioned to online learning. Although learning the material by itself was difficult, there was more leniency and more resources available."
Senior,4,"The online experience at IUPUI is more involved than other schools. I feel connected to other students and my instructors, even in virtual environments. I do not feel as if I have missed anything by taking online classes, as my instructors are available as much as they would be if i were in-person."
Senior,4,"During my three years at IUPUI, I have had a generally great experience. My classes have been designed to be more targeted towards subjects I am actually interested in, and my professors do an excellent job of communicating the subject matter. IUPUI offers a variety of services across campus that can provide guidance into applying for careers, creating a schedule for each semester, and finding out how to get involved. However, I have experienced a few professors that struggle to explain the material well, and it makes it difficult to stay focused during class. I can think of several instances where I have been unable to work through specific assignments because the professor and their teaching assistants do not explain well or answer back in a timely manner. Taking all things into consideration, my overall experience with IUPUI has been a positive one. Though I have some issues, they are minor in comparison to everything else."
Senior,4,"Whenever IUPUI decided to shift the learning to online after spring break this year due to COVID-19, I was a little worried about how effectively I would be able to learn the subject matter. The concerns that I mentioned before were still present online, but I would have a more difficult time accessing resources and keeping motivated while being away from campus. However, IUPUI did an excellent job communicating with their professors and providing assistance to make sure we were accommodated during this difficult time, and I was still able to learn a lot. Everything was organized well, and professors gave us plenty of time to work on assignments and turn them in with everything going on. Though I look forward to returning to campus next semester, my experience with the online teaching was a positive one."
Sophomore,4,"Overall I very much enjoy my academic learning at Indiana University - Purdue University. The professors are nice, they care that you improve in your career. The campus is very nice, clean, and I love that I can walk everywhere. My biggest  complaint is that I paid about $5000 each semester in housing and food, yet I got put with somebody random that I did not get along with. Plus I had to walk atleast 10 minutes to get to the only dining court on campus that did not have good selections, plates were dirty, and most of the staff was unfriendly."
Sophomore,4,"So far I'd say that the university has a good system set up. That said, most professors aren't equipped to handle the challenges of online learning yet. Other than the couple of hiccups, I'd say it's fine."
Sophomore,4,"Overall the university has most resources needed for the majority of people. That said, the longer one is here the more obvious that IU - Bloomington gets all the new and shiny things, and if IUPUI gets it... Well we call that a once in a blue moon issue."
Junior,4,"IUPUI has stayed dedicated to ensuring that my peers and I stay equipped with the tools we need to be successful, even through these trying times such as the pandemic."
Junior,4,My professors have done their best to ensure that we know what is required of us and that we receive all the information we need to complete our work as instructed.
Sophomore,4,I have found that the college offers good opportunities for higher education for a fairly affordable (for college tuition) cost. I have enjyed my time at the campus overall.
Sophomore,4,"As stated before, I feel that the learning experience of IUPUI was very good. The campus is also offering subjects from both Indiana University and Purdue University (as could be hinted at by the name itself)."
Freshman,4,"Iupui is an amazing university to be apart of. This university is full of diversity, amazing clubs to be apart of, and is in the heart of Indiana. I have learned so much about not only my major, but myself as well. It is so easy to get involved here because of all the friendly people. I would highly recommend considering IUPUI as your home for the next for years!"
Freshman,4,I came from a very small town and moving to Indianapolis was a big change. I didn't know how I was going to adapt but it quickly felt like home. The campus is very welcoming and I love the atmosphere. So far my professors have been great and very understanding. IUPUI has allowed me to become a much better student and I am doing very well in college. I know this school will help me to get a degree and a job in the criminal justice field.
Senior,4,"I loved how helpful everyone was at IUPUI. From the advisors to the professors, it seemed like everyone wanted to see me succeed, tried their hardest to help me achieve my goals. It felt like such a collaborative place to go to school."
Freshman,4,A huge university with diversity from all over the world. The change I would want is having more major degree fields available for those seeking in their goals.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at IUPUI. This is a great college for studies. The reason I have chosen to attend the university is based off my major and location. The downtown location is great for students to attend around Indy. There are a few things I wish they could change. First, more food selections. I feel as if I’m eating the same things over and over again. All students must admit we need more parking all around campus. We struggle finding parking."
Sophomore,4,I can't write too much about this. Since I have been here for about two years. So I have to wait till I graduate to be able to describe the pros and cons about this college. So far I am liking it.
Freshman,4,Its a good school. If compared to most schools in the United States its above average. Its a commuter school so if you are looking for a college life IUPUI isnt really the best place for that. But IUPUI gives a great education.
Freshman,4,"Although my first semester was cut short due to the Covid-19 outbreak, I really did make the right choice for myself as a student. For someone with medical disabilities, the universities AES and professors are very accommodating. The food is mostly always fresh with plenty of opinions for those with allergies or preferences. My absolute favorite part about IUPUI are my peers. Everyone at this university is striving to be someone great. There are plenty of opportunities for peer study groups and everyone I have personally met are mature and have their individual goals set. It is quite refreshing."
Freshman,4,"I love going to this school! It has a great location, right in Downtown Indianapolis. The staff is very helpful and personable and the classes are fairly small and easy to be in. The only downside to this university is that it does not have a lot of campus life. This is mainly a commuter school, so there is not a lot to do on campus apart from classes."
Niche User,4,"I had a college visit there and really loved the atmosphere! Also, the housing buildings are not like your average dorm room. They are very modern and up to date!"
Niche User,4,"Wonderful Institutions, however, housing is only available to college freshmen. Housing can get difficult to find around the heart of Indianapolis so you may find yourself rooming with somebody new or your family for the time being."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the classroom sizes, and how the professors actually care and want to help.  They are all willing to meet one on one and get you the help you need if you ask for it.  I would like to see more activities for students on the weekends.  I live over 2 hours away, so I can’t go home every weekend, so we resort to having to pay money to do something over the weekend."
Junior,4,"This school is great and their transfer program is amazing! I felt welcomed and supported during my transition there. Every student I asked for help during my first couple of days was friendly and willing. There are plenty of things to do to get involved, but also if you prefer to be left to your own devices there is space for that too. If you ever need help with anything the numbers to call are on the website and whoever you speak with will be more than happy to help."
Freshman,4,"What I like about IUPUI are the students, teachers and other staff. They are very friendly and I can approach them easily. I also like their big campus, it is very new to me but I think that it will help me learn more and be more diverse since it is a big campus. What I like to see change in the campus is nothing."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and housing, I am attending this Fall 2020 and look forward to learning more about the professors, classes and college life. This school is my first choice and has the computer programming major I have been looking for. While I was accepted to 6 colleges altogether,  IUPUI was and still is my only choice to attend. I will be attaining a four year degree and graduate in 2024."
Freshman,4,"College is very challenging in general  but with the help of my professors  , advisors, and other faculty members , some of the pressure has been lifted. There's always resources available  when I need them, such as free tutoring , office hours, career counseling , ect. That was what  I admired  most when I first started attending IUPUI.  There was always someone available to help me ,and  if they couldn't another person could. The enviroment is very nice also and allows me to feel safe and guarded. I feel very included, speaking that the school emphasizes diversity and inclusiveness and I appreciate that being an African American Woman.It's been a great experience  so far. I'm excited for what the future holds."
Freshman,4,"IUPUI is a great university with many opportunities to help you succeed like the MAC, which is the math assistance center that's on campus and free to utilize, along with the writing center, the university library, and many other resources to help with all your academic needs. It is very diverse and has many opportunities to meet other people and make many new friends."
Freshman,4,"There’s a lot of diversity in IUPUI the food chains are great, and especially the food made at Tower dining. Everyone gets along easily."
Freshman,4,"IUPUI is a great school with many opportunities for students to get involved and succeed. There are a lot of places to go and hang out with friends near campus. The dorms are nice and are relatively new. My only complaint is that the food isn't great and is overpriced, but there are some restaurants nearby that have good food."
Freshman,4,"What makes my school unique is the fact that is in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. The students and staff who attend come from all over the state, country, and world. I would choose this school again for its diversity and successful programs."
Freshman,4,"Well put together and everything had thought behind it. I love that everything that you do is connected somehow. Would love a bit more to do on campus, because it is easy to get bored at times."
Freshman,4,I just finished my first semester here at IUPUI and I am glad I chose this college. I love that it is close to my home and it is very affordable. I love the professors I had because they were mostly funny and made the class more interesting. I met new people instantly and it is very diverse.
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and has many experiences on campus and in the city. It can be difficult to be involved in events though if you don't live on campus. The faculty provides many resources to help you in succeeding in your career.
Alum,4,"Most professors really care about their jobs here, and also their students. Not a good school to go to if you're looking to make friends, though."
Senior,4,"I love attending IUPUI. Anyone attending here would most likely say the same, our peers as well as admins are great!"
Senior,4,I have really enjoyed my past 3 years here at IUPUI. I am a part of the cross country/track team and really had a positive experience with that. The professors are great also!
Freshman,4,"I love how connected to the city the campus is. There is always something to do! The professors all seem so willing to help and genuinely  want to see you succeed. However tower dining is pretty rough and definitely has to improve, especially for the price that you pay for the meal plan."
Freshman,4,"I love it here at IUPUI! There's a lot of classes offered, and there's so much to do and be involved in. The staff and professors here and geared towards your success, and there are so many resources here on campus to help you go farther with your education. The community that is built here on campus is very welcoming and inviting. My only complaint and the main reason I can't give IUPUI and 5-Star rating is the cost. Many colleges provide a lot of resources to students to help them fund their education, but the prices students have to pay for basic needs like meal plans and parking are a bit much."
Junior,4,I enjoy the diverse education available at IUPUI. The technological infrastructure is very strong and the courses provide skills relevant to the demand of our economy. I would like to see professors who are more engaged in teaching at IUPUI. The student community seems very strong and inclusive throughout the two universities.
Freshman,4,"IUPUI has a great sized campus with lots of easy ways to get around. Different campus buses and safe bike lanes to get you around campus. Overall campus is safe and everyone is friendly. However, parking can be difficult. Finding a parking spot during the peak busy hours (11-12pm) can take longer than needed. Other than parking, the campus is nicely laid out and easy to navigate."
Freshman,4,"I will enter as a freshman in Spring 2020, transferring from another college. From what I have seen thus far, the campus is warm and welcoming the communication has been excellent I really feel that I can thrive on the campus of IUPUI."
Freshman,4,"So far, I really enjoy the diversity and surroundings of IUPUI! I hope they can improve on the parking soon though!"
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and there are great food choices! Every professor I had was wonderful and they were all very willing to help if I needed it. The counselors were always very helpful and you were encouraged to go see your counselor regularly.
Sophomore,4,I like how racially diverse IUPUI is. And I also like how there are so many programs there are for students to study.
Freshman,4,I am currently a Freshman at IUPUI and I just love the atmosphere that the school brings. The school is located in Downtown Indianapolis and has a lot of places in walking distance. Other than that the whole IUPUI community as a whole has been very welcoming and has made the transition to college rather smooth. The campus center is my favorite place to hangout with friends and study or do homework. The campus center has 4 levels all with different things on each level. Overall it is just a great University.
Sophomore,2,"Many teachers did not know how to use online well. Having poor video quality made looking at a professor's notes impossible at times, and cutting out of tests hurt scores at times."
Alum,2,"Not great, too many obstacles and it was kind of a joke. Tests were either super easy or ridiculously hard using software that tracked eye movement."
Niche User,2,"I am a non-graduate student and therefore did not care about helping me as a student. I was told on the phone that because I am a non-graduate student ""nobody will want to advise you"". I ended up going to my Uindy advisor (I  have a bachelor's degree from THREE YEARS AGO). THIS Uindy advisor was able to tell me the course numbers of all the courses I need to take at IUPUI... The ""advisor"" IUPUI gave me NEVER responded to my calls and emails from over a week ago. I am an adult learner and have to quit my job to go back to school full time, so I am on a deadline of needing specific classes. This school doesn't care about you as a person. You're nothing but a number to them, and that is such a shame."
Junior,2,"I have personally hated my experience with every university office employee I have ever come in contact with. The quality of education and online resources for the cost is simply not worth it, yet it is the closest reputable school to me, so I stay."
Sophomore,2,Between the parking and commute you're spending exponentially more. They also tend to sell your parking spots to the public for public events. This happens during exams typically in Spring courses. They also have construction going on near Hine Hall which makes a lot of noise and rattles the whole building during classes and even exams. It's a fine school for new students but for the price and mediocre course rigor I would not recommend this to graduate students commuting to campus. They also tend to reject certain transfer credits and force classes that aren't required from other schools or pertain to your degree. Essentially taking more money from you for classes that you won't use in the field after graduation. Overall unimpressed.
Freshman,2,"The classes were so big, and I always felt like my professors did not care about how I did, or was doing. They only cared about their job and not how to help the students. The campus was not super large, but having to cross a busy street everyday for class was not the high light of my days. I almost got hit my a car multiple times, and the people on campus are very rude. The school is not a terrible school, but it was not the best fit for me. I know many people who like it, and have good experiences. I sadly was not."
Freshman,2,Commuter school.  Not the experience I was hoping for.  Not many activities unless you are in a Sorority.
Freshman,2,"Being in the city provides many opportunities for internships. However, it is definitely still a commuter campus despite them claiming not to be. It is very difficult to make friends and have much of a social life because of this. If you live nearby and plan to commute, this might be a good fit for you. If you don't, you will probably hate it."
Freshman,2,"There's  never parking, if you paid hundreds you're guaranteed to have it snatched from you if there's an event downtown going on. They close lots for sports games even though students are paying hundreds for a service they aren't getting. I've been late to every class and missed 3 classes due to lack of parking and wasted gas driving around searching. There are no activities on campus and it is a ghost town after 5pm. Weekends, no one is here. The school events you have to dig deep to hear about them, and no one goes. You have to try hard to make friends because you cant talk in classes being that the lectures are strongly informational, as most students dont live on campus. I consider myself to be very outgoing and i have only made a handful of acquaintances. academics are cool, the teachers know their stuff very well and are very willing to help. I would say if you're looking to just come to school, learn, and go home without saying a word to anyone then this is the school for you"
Graduate Student,2,"Overly priced, expensive parking paces with very very limited space and yet prices continue to go up and spaces continue to minimize."
Senior,2,"Different advisor at least every other semester, so no consistency. Part time professors are horrible, and don't even try to find any assistance with scholarships, you'll be past back and forth. Departments send you to scholarship office, and they send you back to the departments. All you'll get is frustration as you waste your time walking campus, end to end, because parking is atrocious!"
College Freshman,2,"The school is mainly commuters so I feel very disconnected.  I don't like the atmosphere as much as I would like.  The classes are nice, but I don't feel like I belong here."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics is not the central focus at IUPUI like other colleges. Barely anyone attends the sporting events. There is not a football or baseball team. The athletic department needs a lot of work in their marketing department.
College Sophomore,2,No football team. I think we have a basketball team?
College Senior,2,"Since IUPUI is in the heart of Indianpolis most of the schools sporting events are overshadowed by the major league teams. We also do  not have a lot of varsity sports, but the swimming pool is used for Olympic trials, and the soccer field is used for the minor league soccer team. Students also get discount tickets to some of the sporting events in  the city."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Generally the campus environment is safe.  Every now and again there is a rash of armed robberies.  The main issue regarding security that needs to be addressed is the widespread hacking of email accounts, and online activity that occurs while using computers at University Library- leading to subsequent stalking."
College Sophomore,2,"My school isn't big on sports at all, the fan support sucks. We don't even have a football team."
College Junior,2,Housing is alright but its overpriced either on or off campus. Not a great social atmosphere and not much to do unless you're 21 and can go to nightclubs a few miles away from campus.
College Junior,2,Greek life here is fun but only if you're in it and get super involved. It's stupid though because they don't even have actual houses on campus. People lease houses and pretend like it's the fraternity/sorority house when it really isn't.
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in Ball Hall for my first year and did not enjoy it. The social aspect was nice and the RAs were friendly and welcoming but the building was just not clean and a nice place to live. I understand that college kids have to rough it sometimes living in a dorm, but for the price, Ball Hall was not worth it. It was dirty and just dated. If the laundry machine was not broken, the sink was leaking or the shower was out of order. It is also kind of pushed off to the side compared to where central campus is but the buses come by to pick up which really helped."
College Junior,2,We do not get very involved in sports on this campus. I only recently discovered what our school mascot is. We do not have any athletic facilities besides a small outdoor basketball court that I am aware of.
College Freshman,2,"The cost of housing is terrible. It's really upsetting because I resort to off-campus housing which is farther away, thereby making it more difficult to get to campus in reasonable time. I didn't have the money to spend on on-campus housing, especially because of the value. I currently live off campus and pay less, and believe that I am getting a better value aside from being so far away."
College Senior,2,No one is really involved on campus.
College Freshman,2,I honestly do not experience this much.
College Senior,2,well the blacks are  not noticed mostly white....
College Senior,2,"If you are a Computer Science student, you could honestly get an internship right after your freshman year. As for any other field, good luck with that."
College Senior,2,"If you like paying nearly $1000 a month for an actual apartment that you share with another person who is also paying that much, go for it. They just built a new freshman housing building which will be more expensive than Riverwalk ($1000 a month). This is why 90% of students commute."
College Freshman,2,"Our Greek life is pretty poor. I am not involved in Greek life, but, I do know that we have no Greek housing and they just do a lot of volunteering."
College Sophomore,2,"No greek houses, all they seem to do is go to required meetings and volunteer. Pretty much everyone gets a bid."
College Sophomore,2,"Since IUPUI is a commuter school, we do not have alot of pride in our athletics. Not many people attend games, and there is no Football team."
College Senior,2,Even in this past semester there have been many reports about criminal activity on campus with no resolve. I am often at school late at night and while I feel relatively safe inside Herron I do not feel safe anywhere else on campus.
College Freshman,2,We are in downtown Indianapolis what more can they do. They have a escort program but when I tried to use it one night it didn't even work
College Freshman,2,Honestly there is no football team at iupui. All we have that people pay attention to is basketball
College Sophomore,2,"There's been many dangerous events that have been occurring on campus very recently. I believe there were armed robberies and assaults, including a recent rape. I feel unsafe walking to the parking lot after classes and I'm always aware and am always watching my sorroundings. I feel that we need more security because a lot of students don't really feel secure. However I do like the system that is used to contact students during emergencies. I always receive a text, phone call, and email whenever something serious happens."
College Freshman,2,"Very little housing options for non-freshmen, and the options that are available are way more expensive than necessary."
College Sophomore,2,"I hate college, I feel like my school doesn't help at all and a lot of the kids there are super unmotivated due to the fact we have no direction."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to get scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many housing options!
College Senior,2,"All the financial aid lady did when I visited was hand me a pamphlet to fastweb.com. I didn't expect a whole office was dedicated to redirecting people to google. Some people get this financial aid stuff to work really well, but I can't, and it's very frustrating"
College Sophomore,2,"Too many security and police for a very small on-campus housing school, but I predict more on-campus housing arriving soon."
College Freshman,2,I live off campus right now and its honestly ridiculous hoe much it is to live here.
College Freshman,2,"The Dining Hall food was good for about the first couple of weeks, but they repeat the meals a lot and no one likes what they serve.  It gets old really quick, I hardly ever eat there anymore.  I can't wait until I have a kitchen next year and can make my own food."
College Freshman,2,"I like in Park Place, & It's livable, but it's kind of gross. The carpets aren't clean, they're always bugs getting in (even when the windows are closed), the toilet leaks, the couch is tiny (& smells weird). It's just not what I was expecting."
College Sophomore,2,"I choose not to eat on campus or have a meal plan. Except for Einstein Bagels, since I am always in the IT building. Besides that, I buy my food from the store. This school really needs to reevaluate its food options and overall pricing."
College Freshman,2,I know of a few students who have gotten in trouble for calling for help when a friend was dangerously drunk while at a party. It's like they got punished for saving a friend's life.
College Freshman,2,"I was offered a scholarship upon my admittance and then they took it from me without telling me.  Whenever I realized and asked they said it was only for incoming freshman.  I was an incoming freshman, it was just spring semester."
College Freshman,2,"I am not getting the social college experience I was looking for.  It is very quiet and no one in my dorm acts like they even know each other.  I didn't think it was possible to be bored when away at college, but my roommate and I are."
College Freshman,2,It is extremely overpriced and the housing that is closer to being reasonable in price is of poor quality.
College Freshman,2,"The food is okay. The people are nice. The dishwashing is DISGUSTING. There are constantly food bits and particles on my utensils, and water spots are ever-present. You would be hard-pressed to find a clean fork."
College Freshman,2,"There's not really parties here because most people commute. If you wanna have a ""party"", you usually just hang out at a friends house and drink with friends. It's more of a kickback."
College Freshman,2,"I got no financial aid at all. Work study fills up fast. Awards that are supposed to be ""automatic"" are not applied to your bursar unless you go and bring it up first. I got about half of it covered by loans and the rest I had to pay out if pocket. I pay almost $400 a month on top of bills."
College Freshman,2,Can't do a lot you can do at other colleges
College Freshman,2,"Pretty confusing, and the Bursar (the software you pay to) is very confusing to use."
College Freshman,2,Basically if you don't get the Tower you are stuck with either a very old dorm with no AC or a very expensive apartment that isn't that great. The better option would be to save the money and get an apartment right off campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is not very prevalent on campus. You can find a way to join, but they are not visible on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There are almost no scholarships for anyone in my life description, and it has been the most unfair experience of my entire life. I do exceedingly well in school, never drink, do drugs, cause disruptions, or create any kind of negative atmosphere, but still am treated like a loser and a terrible person that has to pay for some kind of terrible act I've done, by slaving away my entire summer and school year working just to barely be able to pay for college and not even be able to have my own apartment practically by age 20. While all this is going on, people that drink, do drugs, do terrible in school, and give it a bad reputation are getting all of their school paid for and have the time of their lives living it up in their own private apartments and doing everything they can to trash their future, only because they are ""need based"" and wont have a chance without help for no reason. Guess what? I pay my dues and work myself to death constantly just so I can go to this school, while others are complaining that they aren't getting all the extra scholarship money they received for no reason put back in their bank accounts because they had more than enough to pay for school and their housing! I've only gotten one scholarship for $500 per semester at this school, when I feel that I deserve all my tuition to be paid for, as I have worked harder and more professionally than probably 90% of this entire school. I work hard in school, I work hard at a part time job, and I drive for hours each day to attend both. I feel that I deserve some kind of break, and I really just want to enjoy my time in college and learn to do what I love."
College Sophomore,2,"My major is almost a joke. The only reason I'm getting it is because it's the only major that allows me to somewhat do what I'm interested in pursuing. I want to go into music production and graphic design, but my classes for both fields are a total ripoff and are ruining my young life. I took the audio design course expecting to learn how to use current audio design and music production technology, but instead was forced into teaching myself how to use the most useless audio design software I have ever encountered, along with the teacher not helping or having any real skill in the area whatsoever. I seriously could have had a 5 year old teach me the same stuff my teacher in this class taught me because they knew literally nothing. I have hope for future courses to be better this year in the school of music."
College Freshman,2,The program is competitive. I will be going an extra year because I have a 3..38 and I need about a 3.8 to get in the program so I will be retaking some classes.
College Freshman,2,There isn't really a campus life because it is mostly a commuter school.
College Junior,2,Financial aid is a joke. The whole process is just government backed lenders that get first dibs on your paycheck after you graduate.
Junior,1,"This place is horrible every year that I have gone so far I have been screwed over by the university. This semester I had a professor who couldn't teach, one who didn't know how to make exams, but the last one was cool. I failed all those classes. Actually, I got a D- in one and the Financial Department is taking away some of my grant money and maybe all of it because my advisor doesn't do her job."
Niche User,1,"Horrid disability resource center. Terrible housing, miscommunication among branches, inadequate financial aid depart.. I had to drop classes, transfer schools, file a complaint, & threaten to sue university for the handling of my disability. My financial aid was messed up,housing assignment was a disaster. Housing was negligent when handling threat of physical violence. 
French class was taught by adjunct prof that did not meet my needs, but my only option was to withdrawal after semester ended. Disability center failed to meet my needs, failed to provide me with textbooks months after I provided proof of purchase. I did not receive my accommodations for another class for so long I dropped the class to avoid failing. 
Equal opp. department was unhelpful with complaint. They switched my case from person to person without informing me, closed my case without informing me  and only reopened it when I reached out to a professor & HE got in contact."
Freshman,1,"Do not attend this school if you are wanting to get the college experience. It is impossible to make friends here if you aren't from the Indianapolis area. I'm three hours away from Indy, and this has been the worst choice I've ever made coming to this school. 95% of students commute and of the 5% that live on campus they leave to go home for the weekends (I don't blame them). Making social connections is challenging. Great programs. That's all."
Senior,1,this school is absolutely terrible. I am a senior about the graduate in the spring of 2018 and the one thing that i can tell you about this school is if you want  a university that  has almost no idea how to  obtain professors that dont just care about their paycheck go to this school. Not to forget to mention the parking at this school is absolutley terrible for one because they have more parking passes than they do actually parking spaces available. the only way that you are going to get a guarenteed parking spot is if you go and get you a reserved space which is like 300 a semester smh. Avoid this school at all costs just a terrible experience all the way around
Senior,1,"IUPUI has been very disappointing throughout my educational journey. I am a senior getting ready to graduate in the spring of 2018. More specifically, I am in the School of Education. I would HIGHLY discourage students from fulfilling their educational career in the School of Education at IUPUI. I know many of my classmates would agree with my stance on the School of Education. Numerous professors have been unprofessional and unsupportive of our educational journey. My class has reached out for additional help with return of false promises. IUPUI does little to no research on student teaching school placements. I had planned to complete my masters degree through IUPUI, but after my horrendous experience with lack of communication and disorganization, I will complete my masters degree at another university. This review comes after 3 years (sophomore, junior, and senior year) of bad experiences with IUPUI."
College Sophomore,1,There are no actual frat or sorority houses due to the location of the campus. Most people think it's pretty lame to be involved in Greek life because they have no actual meeting place.
College Senior,1,Live off campus if you can afford it or live at home.
College Senior,1,There really are no organized sports at my school.
College Senior,1,"Everyone calls our weight room ""The Dungeon"", if that paints a pretty picture for how old and disgusting it is. The only good thing we have is an olympic swimming pool that we usually can't use because the Olympic swim team uses it."
College Freshman,1,Living in Ball Hall is not recommended.
College Freshman,1,"IUPUI greek life isn't really even greek life; they don't even have houses. However, we still have greek life. It's just not a big part of IUPUI."
College Sophomore,1,The food is absolutely disgusting in the Tower.
College Junior,1,"I might as well still live at home with my family until i turn 24 because I am still called dependent despite financial independence, and refused any aid other than loans."
College Freshman,1,"Applied for financial aid, but was not given the amount I should've gotten. They did not consider the size of my family."
College Freshman,1,It's god awful. I love my school but they are no help when it comes to paving a way to pay for school. It's a hassle and I feel like they'd careless if I got money or not.
College Freshman,1,"I'm not much of a partier myself, but I have heard that most of the parties are at 1201 and that they are super trashy."
College Freshman,1,"Not a party school, really, but I guess that's okay. I'm here to get a degree, not to do shots."
College Sophomore,1,"Athletics are not very big here. Also, our pool may be great, but other parts of the Natatorium are not good. No one wants to go workout there. It is probably the worst rec facility I have seen on a college campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I think campus is too strict. In campus housing, they called floor meetings on every floor when they found a beer bottle in the trash. Like, geez."
College Sophomore,1,"What parties? Seriously. There is a lack of social scene in on campus housing, and some parties off campus aren't in safe neighborhoods. No fraternity or sorority houses near campus, and if there are, you have to get invited. Partying here sucks!"
College Freshman,1,"The social life is practically nonexistant for me at IUPUI.  It is a huge commuter school, and it seems like when I meet someone, they are a commuter.  I am not a partier, but having social gatherings with other students  would be nice.  The University Tower is not at all like a dorm atmosphere."
College Junior,1,Never ever live in ball hall. I am so glad that I live off campus now
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing for anyone under 21 to do in this city at all. If you are under 21 and don't have anything fun to do at your place, you will be bored, and you will suffer."
College Sophomore,1,I wasted all my money on this terrible dining hall. I shouldve just saved all my money and got an apartment with a kitchen and made food that was actually edible.
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate campus housing. Yes, it's very convenient to be on campus and have an easier time getting to class. The downside is that we pay so much money per semester on apartments or dorms that are not worth the price. All of my financial aid goes into housing. They aren't built that well, especially when I can hear when the residents above me when they go to the bathroom."
College Student,1,This is my freshman year and I got into ball hall residence. For the most part the girls in ball are very snobby and judgemental and aren't very welcoming. The cleaning ladies are EXTREMEMELY rude as well. They have the attitude that they don't want to be there at all. My roommate is almost never here in my dorm either so most of the time I'm here alone.
College Junior,1,"The weather is Indiana is terrible.  The winters have gotten longer and longer.  Walking to classes in the freezing cold winter is terrible.  There are some tunnels available, but there are not very many."
College Senior,1,"Honestly, studying in a university campus inside a city is horrible. During the winter its cold and during the Summer there is barely any sun light."
College Freshman,1,There are no underage parties here. You basically have to be in a fraternity or sorority to go to parties.
College Sophomore,1,This is not a party school lol
College Freshman,1,The sports are nonresistant here. We do not have a football team or baseball. The only sport that is kind of popular would be soccer which still is not that good. I wish sports were a bigger part of campus life.
College Freshman,1,"I do not party and I do not like being around alcohol but honestly nothing ever happens here. I am very thankful because this means everyone is safe and no one does anything dumb but no one every socializes. It is very boring on the weekends, especially when it is cold and snowing."
College Sophomore,1,"IUPUI only offers on campus housing to freshmen, so you're really on your own trying to fine somewhere to live."
College Freshman,1,I rarely new that IUPUI had parties.
College Sophomore,1,"I cannot get any scholarships! Its horrible my family is well off, I'm not a minority, not disabled, and I'm a male so it is very hard to get any financial aid whatsoever.  Anyone who looks at my FASFA say that I do I need not need  scholarships but that is terrible because if there is money  out there why can I not get any? I am on the fast track to succeed so why are people wasting money when they can use it on the ones bound to succeed. I don't want to be weighed down by debt and it will just set me back. What happened to the trickle down effect? It works. Socialism fails look at France or GREECE! Prime examples why America is running itself in the ground. It starts with education and that includes the scholarships. So long story short my scholarship experience has been terrible."
College Sophomore,1,Between 10am until 6pm the parking is terrible. The spots are very close to the dorms and classes but its very hard to find one. The parking is usually reserved for teachers and facility. The rest of the parking is for the students which is always full. If you drive you have to be there early or you will not get a spot.  after 4pm the teacher spots are free to anyone with a pass so parking is perfect! Late classes are the best. Great parking!!
College Senior,1,"Even though the government has determined I am poor enough to receive aid, there is always some reason I do not receive any. I have never had this much trouble at other schools I have attended receiving aid. My advice would be to start looking for scholarships early."
College Freshman,1,"IUPUI is a division 1 school, but no one ever goes to the games because the teams always suck and the games are not announced to the students. "
College Sophomore,1,Too many people that make me concerned for my safety or they can't speak English.. 
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is so horrible, since the school was built, there hasn't been any expansion of parking, due to location.Yet, we have increased the number of students enrolled by thousands, but we can't expand parking?"
College Sophomore,1,We don't even have football or baseball. I am disgusted by the lack of sports at IUPUI. 
College Sophomore,1,"I love the summer, but I hate winter or any time it is cold. It also sucks walking around campus when it is raining--but that's mostly because I don't have an umbrella. "
College Sophomore,1,Parking is my least favorite thing about IUPUI. You have to pay a lot of money for a parking pass and then it takes you twenty minutes to find a parking spot. There should definitely be more parking lots or cheaper parking passes because it's absolutely ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is pretty awful because since the campus is so small you don't take buses everywhere you go, you just walk. And there are some all inside routs but it's still not that great. Campus is pretty but in the hot summers you sweat all day and in the cold winters you basically freeze to death."
College Freshman,1,I really don't feel involved in my schooling. I feel like I've made no new friends and that college isn't fun at all.
College Freshman,1,I have only gone to one party and it didn't seem like a party at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Snagging a parking spot on campus is literally a miracle. I know people who live 15 minute off campus and leave their houses almost two hours early just so they have time to look for a spot. It is absolutely ridiculous. Plus, the parking permits are outrageously expensive."
College Junior,1,Parking at IUPUI is terrible. I leave my house an hour before I need to and I'm still late to class sometimes. The new garages are even full already.
College Junior,1,Parking sucks there and they know it but they would rather increase parking spots for staff then add a few more levels to the already existing parking garages.
College Senior,1,"Parking at IUPUI is terrible. The only time parking goes smoothly is before 9:30 AM or after 4 PM, any other time is difficult. It's also very expensive and parking security is always on top of things! Make sure you're always aware of the type of parking place you are parking in."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The parking situation is horrible.  IUPUI is a commuter school and the number of students quadruple the number of parking spaces available.  And then when people park poorly, you find yourself getting a parking ticket because someone decided to take up two parking spaces causing you to ride the line.  Where's the justice in that?  Horrible!  Horrible!  I wish I could walk.  Not to mention, the parking pass cost is ridiculous!"
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is HORRIBLE!! If you want a parking spot at all you have to get there before 9am and even then it can be a total nightmare! There isn't enough E parking (general parking) for all the permits they sell and there is way too much of the B and A parking (handicapped/special needs/more expensive).  The ticketing system is fair because you can waive your first ticket and your first paid ticket only ends up being $20 then they get more expensive ending up in towing at some point, but at the end of the semester it starts over again (although you still have to pay all your tickets from last semester!) Parking permits are also ridiculously expensive and there are no perks for being an upperclassman when it comes to parking!! My advice? Take the bus or live within walking/biking distance of campus because parking is a huge stress you just don't need!"
College Freshman,1,"The parking permit has gone up to well over a hundred dollars a semester. I am not happy with that, especially since there are no open spots and they use our student parking lots to rent out for sporting events!"
College Sophomore,1,Overcrowding and over issuing of parking passes for certain areas. Also the parking might become privatized therefore skyrocketing prices for current continuing students and new students.
College Freshman,1,"There are approximately 30,000 that attend IUPUI and there are only about 7,000 parking spaces. This is nowhere close to being enough parking spaces. Most students pay $175 for a parking pass each semester and aren't even sure if they will find a parking spot for the day. Many students also find themselves leaving hours early just to find a spot."
College Freshman,1,"Its a commuter campus, so the night life is highly limited to scattered off campus parties at house and apartments"
College Freshman,1,The parking is horrible and as a commuter student I have to park. You have to pay an arm and leg just to get the worst possible permit and there are never enough spots for that certain permit. The only thing I HATE about IUPUI.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is horrible on campus. You have to have a parking permit that is expensive and they sell more tickets than they have space for. There are no free parking and they ticket quickly if parked in the wrong place.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus can be really awful sometimes. Classes at noon especially are difficult to find parking spots for because that's a time when most students are on campus. I've heard some of my friends have had to drive around for 30 minutes before they found a parking spot. Our school is, however, building more parking garages so that there's more parking."
College Senior,1,People do not really hang around campus at night it is not safe to do so. The nightlife is non existent.

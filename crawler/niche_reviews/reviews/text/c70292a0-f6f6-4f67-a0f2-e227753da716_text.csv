Freshman,5,I was enrolled in the University of San Diego during the pandemic. Although this time was chaotic and stressful University of San Diego perfectly responded with the proper measures to ensure academic success online.
Freshman,5,The University of San Diego helped me develop different perspectives and shaped me into a changemaking attitude. They go above in beyond when choosing faculty and their curriculum and networking is above and beyond to what is shown on their website when applying. This school set me up for success on such a grand scale that's bigger than myself.
Senior,5,"At USD, I feel as though I am accepted and encouraged to express myself. I am challenged to pursue my ideal career path and am given the necessary resources to do so from my professors, classmates, and peers."
Sophomore,5,"I have attended USD for a year and I have loved it so far! Campus is great and student life is too. Small classes make learning intimate, allow for student participation and discussion, and professors genuinely care about your learning and performance."
Senior,5,I love it here! I transferred here from SMU and I am so glad I made the switch. Students are genuine people and your teachers really care about your success.

Junior,5,"My learning experience was a very easy and smooth transition with many of my classes and teachers. We all used zoom and besides some technical issues here and there, things worked seamlessly. I actually liked the lenience that online school offers because sometimes school becomes very stressful and overwhelming, therefore, having longer periods to complete assignments/tests allows students to showcase their fullest potential and well-thought out answers to questions."
Niche User,5,"During my visit at the University of San Diego, I was baffled by how beautiful the campus was, and by the amazing scenery surrounding it."
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of San Diego, it has given me some of my best friends and helped me figure out who I am. Coming from Minnesota, I love the San Diego culture and ""vibe"" that I feel when I am out there. I couldn't recommend this school more to anyone else looking for a great place to go to school."
Freshman,5,Amazing education and even better location :).    I feel as if the teachers at USD really challenge their students and bring out the best in them.
Works Here,5,"Intellectually curious students, great professors, fascinating courses, and gorgeous campus! I can't recommend highly enough."
Junior,5,"Its a great location, small class sizes, and fantastic faculty, but with a very expensive tuition.  Along with that though, is easy access to administration as far as advisers, one on one with professors, and things like that."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at USD has been one of the best. Although it is a smaller school, it feels like you're meeting different people everyday. I'm glad that I chose this university to go to."
Graduate Student,5,"The student-faculty ratio at University of San Diego is 13:1, and the school has 41.5 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors at University of San Diego include: Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services; Biological and Biomedical Sciences; Engineering; Social Sciences; and Communication, Journalism, and Related Programs. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, is 89 percent."
Sophomore,5,Love the professors to student ratio. The professors are so kind and knowledgeable. It’s a great school and campus.
Niche User,5,I thought the campus was beautiful in every way. The people and the community were fantastic. I was thoroughly impressed.
Sophomore,5,"The University of San Diego exceeded my expectations. Being a USD student is incredible. It is the newest of the best schools in the USA. The campus is beautiful. It is an excellent college for for business related majors. I love the teachers. They are very supportive and provide many resources to continue learning and classes are never crowded. It is VERY expensive and difficult to get a scholarship. They should offer financial aid to international students, as they cannot get jobs in the USA."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the University of San Diego. As a freshman, I am looking forward to what the next few years have to offer. So far I have liked the professors. The university continues to grow in a positive direction."
Junior,5,"beautiful campus and lots of opportunities to get involved with something, however you definitely do need to find something to be involved with to find a group. for boys, you basically need to be in a frat to party before you are 21, after its mostly bars. frats aren't that fratty though, less douchey than other schools."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at the University of San Diego currently and I love the transition that I have had between high school and college. It is a beautiful campus with great teachers and academics.
Alum,5,"My experience with USD was amazing. Overall, the teaches, facilities, and academics were amazing. I would not trade my experience for anything in the world. I had so much fun at USD and would love to be able to go back and do it all over again."
Niche User,5,I liked my visit in University of San Diego when I went there to visit my cousin. The campus life was nice easy to commute with a bike. The dorms where decent  I really liked the library because of the quietness that it provides.
Niche User,5,"I went there on a field trip with my school, to the University of San Diego the medical part and I loved it. We did many things and talked about many department, some of which were cardiovascular, brain, neurology, and many others. From that point, I chose and determined  my future, I want to become a neurosurgeon, and hopefully enroll in the  University of San Diego."
Alum,5,"I loved attending school here. There is a huge array of clubs and organizations to join. I loved that it was a small school. While I didn't know everyone, it felt like I did. The teachers are incredible. The location is great. The campus is so beautiful. It is expensive, but that is to be expected with being a private school in San Diego. It was well worth the investment."
Niche User,5,"I attend USD part-time as part of a dual-enrollment program with my high school. In my experience, everybody is super nice and friendly. The campus is beautiful and the classes are great! In my experience, the lectures were easy to understand, and the small class sizes make it easy to ask questions and get to know your professors personally. Overall a really great experience."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred from another college and so far my time at USD has been amazing! Everyone that is associated with the campus is very welcoming, from the staff/faculty member to the students. If you have any trouble there are many resources on campus and they are always open to help. One thing I would change about USD is having air conditioning in some of the classes. However, they are renovating some parts of the campus so maybe in the near future, there will be air conditioning."
Alum,5,"Rigorous academics, friendly and very intelligent student body, amazing professors, great party scene, 5 star food, and did I mention campus is 10 minutes from the beach? The negative reviews here are probably from students who couldn't keep up with their course work, because USD doesn't go easy on you. USD grads always go far in the career department. Loved this school and my experience overall, wish I could go back."
Graduate Student,5,The University of San Diego has a beautiful campus and facilities. The staff are also very helpful and passionate about helping their students. I also appreciate how it is military friendly with their decision to offer the yellow ribbon program for all of their veteran students so our GI bill benefits are able to cover full tuition. I am attending the graduate program to become a psychiatric nurse practitioner and they effectively prepare us for clinicals by hiring actors to simulate patients. They also guarantee finding us preceptors.
Sophomore,5,"The University of San Diego has excellent staff that strives to accommodate to all academic needs. It is known for encouraging students to become change makers and merely by going on the campus, you can tell people have a driven spirit. I wish the campus was more gated or secured since it is an open campus, however the kiosk workers are friendly and do check parking stickers."
Freshman,5,"Everyone I have met and dealt with so far has been a knowledgable professional and super friendly and helpful. The campus is absolutely gorgeous with attention paid to the smallest details. Everything seems to be engineered toward giving students the best experience possible. The location is in the heart of San Diego and the views are beautiful. It's 10 minutes from the beach and there is so much to do that you don't even want to stay on campus, gorgeous as it is. The professors are all great and care about their students. And due to small class sizes, you get a lot of individual attention to ensure your success."
Senior,5,Beautiful and large campus. I love the sense of community that comes with this size of school. There are clubs and activities which offer students strong support and friendships. I feel students can really find their place at USD if they try.
Sophomore,5,"The small class sizes at USD are by far my favorite aspect of the academics. Because there are so few students in each class, lectures often become interactive discussions which truly aid in individual learning and make the experience much more engaging. USD also offers a number of clubs and sports that make getting involved on campus simple and fun. They put on tons of events throughout the school year that range from educational, to cultural, to pure entertainment. The overall vibe at USD is welcoming and friendly, not to mention the campus is extremely beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"I love USD!!!! There is a great balance of work and play. All of the professors are amazing and genuinely care about how you do in their class. They all are very open to help during office hours, or are willing to schedule appointments with you if you can't make office hours. USD also has a lot of extracurriculars. They offer a lot of sports, community service clubs, academic clubs, and Greek life. I think the party scene is pretty good. You can always party at state too.  People are super friendly and open. The campus isn't that diverse, but there's still some diversity.  It's pretty easy to make friends and thrive here, plus the campus is beautiful"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of San Diego was amazing. I loved the small school aspect of the campus. It allowed me to connect with my professors and get to know them. The campus food is pretty good and the people here are very friendly. During my first year, I joined clubs and organizations like the African Student Union, Changemaker Hub, and Intervarsity. These helped me to interact more with my peers. The things that I would change on this campus is Diversity. The school is trying to work on promoting diversity and inclusion but there are still some things to be worked on."
Senior,5,"Great location, close relationships with professors, easy integration, lots of opportunities for growth."
Niche User,5,"it has a welcoming environment, and religious. you will feel at home when coming to university of San Diego."
Freshman,5,"San Diego is a great school to attend because of its amazing classes, great atmosphere, and there is so much to do around the school. The class sizes are also perfect for me; I really feel that I get to make personal connections with my professors. The nature around University of San Diego is also so amazing, with the beaches and the weather and all the hikes that are so available."
Niche User,5,"The University of San Diego has very awesome features that make it unique and stand out amongst other universities. The view is beautiful, it offers excellent majors, and it’s a small to mid size campus."
Niche User,5,"The University of San Diego kept me informed before, during and following my application.  They used real students to share perspective and insight about the campus and allowed me to feel like I was welcome to their school."
Freshman,5,"Here is the tea on USD. I am a second semester first year and thus far I love USD. If you are looking for lots of school spirit...not here. If you are looking for cheap...not here. If you are looking for amazing greek life...not here. If you are looking for a ton of diversity...not here. Now with that said there are clubs and organizations here that are made for minorities and services like SSS which is an organization you can apply for that provides free printing and tutoring, but you have to fall into a certain category. I feel if you are looking to find yourself, learn a lot and trust the process then this is the place for you. I am a vegetarian so the food selection is a huge plus for me. You have many resources for mental health and support."
Alum,5,Class of 2012 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Love this University. Fortunate to have the opportunity to spend my doctoral years here at university of San Diego. Best investment I have made in my life. Would recommend this university with the highest recommendations. Gorgeous campus. Knowledgeable staff. Amazing experience as a student. Excellent projects as an alumni. Thankful to be a part of the university of San Diego family.
Freshman,5,"High level academics, small class sizes, and amazing instruction. Perfect for students wanting a hands on, in depth education."
Graduate Student,5,"This university is beautiful, diverse, and accepting. It is a private Catholic school, yet they are very open and accepting of all walks of life including other religious backgrounds, the LGBTQI community, etc. The nursing school is extremely welcoming and accommodating, and work with the students to help them succeed versus ""weeding out the weak"" like some programs do. The only downside is it is very expensive to attend."
Graduate Student,5,"The Campus is beautifully located in a prime spot in San Diego, with a clear view of San Diego. The school is among one of the most recognized schools in the world."
Niche User,5,I have two children attending this amazing school.  They are both having an incredible experience and are so happy they choose this school.
Niche User,5,The campus is stunning and extremely clean. The faculty is very nice and the surrounding area is perfect for a college student.
Freshman,5,I am a current student on the campus and truly love the experience I am having. My dorms are very nice and well kept. The food is great. There is a variety of options ranging from cultures all over the world to burgers and fries. This campus offers so much that help its students mature and grow as adults and students.
Freshman,5,"The University of San Diego is the school where they prepare students for becoming the best professionals in the future. The calming surrounding helps the students to focus more on their studies. Additionally,the people/students are very approachable where you won't feel that you're lost or set aside, but you'll feel at home."
Alum,5,"Attending USD was the best experience of my life! San Diego is beautiful, the campus was picturesque, the professors were top notch, and I made lifelong friends. I would recommend this school to anyone."
Alum,5,"I just graduated from USD, and man I miss it so much! The campus is stunningly beautiful, the professors actually care about you and know your name, the food is fantastic, and San Diego is such an amazing city. I know some people may think only rich snobby people go here, but I could not disagree more. Although there is wealth present on campus due to the fact that it is a private school in southern CA, there are plenty of down to earth individuals.  I myself was given a large scholarship to USD, and I know many others are in the same position. Additionally, so many opportunities were available to me through USD. I am pre-med, and I was able to work in a lab for 3 years and publish my work, have an internship in the trauma department at Scripps Hospital, and SO much more. Greek life is very present on campus as well and I highly encourage going Greek. I chose USD over a top UC for the personalized education and never regretted my decision."
Sophomore,5,"This University is great, lots of different classes to take good teachers and nice safe location.  Campus is safe and dorms are nice."
Niche User,5,"I wouldn't see change, because it's the best university i have ever seen before!
There is the best vibe i have got!"
Niche User,5,I loved how the campus looked. It seemed very modern and city like. At the same time it was close enough to the beach  so that you could see the view of the ocean. I love their programs and careers they offer
Sophomore,5,I really love the opportunities and the diversity at University of San Diego. There is truly a class or club for every outlet and passion you have as a student and member of the community. USD is absolutely beautiful and some of the best experiences I have had so far in my life have come from attending USD.
Freshman,5,USD makes the applying process easy.  I feel part of a family.  The campus is really nice and located in Beautiful San Diego.
Sophomore,5,Beautiful school. This is a very nice school and would recommend to anyone who can afford to go to this school to go. Not that big of a campus so it fairly easy to find all your classes.
Alum,5,"I was able to participate in a life-changing study abroad experience and connect with faculty who sincerely care about student's development. As a result, I was honored to assist in a groundbreaking research experience in India. Ultimately, throughout my four years, I grew both as a student, and as a person."
Junior,5,"USD is a wonderful school! The professors are outstanding. The Campus is gorgeous. The people are friendly. What more can you ask for? The only downside is that it is quite expensive. If you do not come from a wealthy background, you will require financial assistance."
Niche User,5,The campus alone is beautiful. The professors help out their students as much as they can. The students that live on campus are very supportive with each other.
Freshman,5,"I loved the campus the moment I stepped in! Although I was not a big Cali girl, USD takes a special place in my heart! So many things to do, so many spots to eat, the academics are great, and flexibility of the curriculum is just awesome! Go Toreros!!"
Senior,4,"Campus is best in class, definitely the best campus in San Diego, faculty is very inclusive and always goes the extra mile to make the classes interesting."
Senior,4,"Professors have been very generous and flexible when it comes to these changes, their instruction method has been great and engaging."
Junior,4,"Great small school, professors are really there to help you and always have office hours open for you. Lack of diversity on campus, so it can be hard to transition in and find your place on campus."
Junior,4,"Online instruction is difficult for me to engage with, yet the commitment my teachers have shown to quality education is amazing and I thank them for it. Zoom classes have continued since March, and office hours and other ways to connect have diminished, yet my teachers continually adapt to the ever-changing situation at hand."
Junior,4,"I have loved USD's academia and the relationships I have built with my teachers and peers. Unfortunately, USD continues to underserve BIPOC students on campus, and we as a community need to work on real change past just ""diversity and inclusion"" initiatives."
Sophomore,4,I did not take classes online until after the campus closed because of COVID-19. Many of my classes were done in video modules which were useful because we were able to go back and rewatch them.
Junior,4,"Overall, professors did their best to switch their class structures to online learning, especially for the classes that involved STEM, laboratory or community-based learning."
Junior,4,The campus lives up to the university's mission that a beautiful environment promotes the furthering of education. Professors are willing and encourage the education of their students. Financial aid and Student life (e.g. Dorms/Housing) could have been handled better especially when implementing policies that are intended to promote social distancing.
Senior,4,"It's been alright being online during this whole COVID thing. Since online school was never an option before this, people were really unprepared. After a couple months now the teachers have gotten the hang of it and I feel my quality of learning isn't suffering at all now."
Junior,4,"What I loved about USD is the campus and beautiful location. Additionally, I love the student-teacher connections that are made in small classrooms and the professors who challenge our intellectual curiosity."
Graduate Student,4,"I have really enjoyed taking online classes at university of San Diego. My professors have been kind, understanding and responsive for the most part. I have run into financial trouble and put school on hold temporarily."
Graduate Student,4,I really love the online learning experience the one thing that I can’t stand this discussion questions I wish that we could have an open discussion form that we met up and talked amongst each other other than that I think the online program is good for people who need to not have a schedule set for classes and just get it done in their convenience.
Alum,4,"USD's campus is absolutely beautiful--one of the best things about this university. The beauty of campus is supposed to promote a productive learning environment. The professors are friendly and competent. There is not a lot of diversity as the university has approximately a 50% white student population, but you can find your niche in student orgs. San Diego in general is a amazing city and a fun place to go to university. Great beaches, food, and fun events to go to. USD is expensive, but a lot of students do get financial aid. Just make sure you are not overpaying for your undergrad education, get as much aid as you can, and make the most of your experience there by being really involved to improve the return on investment."
Junior,4,"I love the class sizes at USD, that is on of the main reasons I wanted to attend. Furthermore, since the school is smaller than most there is a more friendlier atmosphere which makes people feel more at home. Academics on campus are very diverse and are engaging, the biggest class I have had is 40 people and the smallest has been 5. Professors on campus are always friendly and super accommodating towards helping you learn, office hours are easy to attend and they are well educated and happy to be at USD. USD as a campus is very safe, they have their own police who frequently make rounds around campus. At night, if you don't feel safe they can walk you back to your dorm or drive you to your car. San Diego is a great city, with many things to do ranging from the beach (5 minutes away from campus), to the mountains ( 1 hour away)."
Alum,4,"USD is a great school. The academics are very strong, the professors are great and take a genuine interest in their students. The food is ranked in the top 20 for best food on a college campus. The campus is ranked most beautiful campus in the U.S. There is a beautiful outdoor pool, which is not used as much as one might think. There are over 100 clubs and it is easy enough to start a new one if you want. The dorms are very nice and get even better as you become an upperclassmen. 

Of course, anywhere you go will have some problems. For me, the social initiatives were a little disappointing. Even though this school is more socially aware than most, their actions do not always match up with their self-proclaimed ""changemaker"" attitude. In many cases, the marginalized students are forced to do the work and the educating. This can become tiring as fighting for space and validation is hard work and often not welcomed by white students (many of whom are wealthy)."
Junior,4,USD has been a great place for me to continue my education in a small environment with supportive faculty and peers.
Freshman,4,"Love it!  Everyone is friendly, outgoing.  It's easy to make friends.  Has the best food on campus, lots of variety.  The dorms aren't the best - they could really use an update.  But the on-campus apartments are pretty sweet."
Sophomore,4,"This school is in need of some diversity and for me it was difficult to connect to others due to differing social and class status. However, students are still very nice and most professors do genuinely care and are good at their jobs (just make sure you look at rate my professor)."
Freshman,4,I like the University of San Diego because the counselors are very supportive during the entire college process.
Sophomore,4,"University of San Diego is an excellent school with overall good faculty and resources. It is in a good location and offers a variety of majors. The classes are hard, but many available office hours and free tutoring helps students succeed in rigorous courses."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love USD. The school is very supportive of its students and staff. The university really feels like a tight knit community. The dorm life is very good, big rooms, nice bathrooms, and nice study lounges."
Niche User,4,From what I want to peruse this is the best school to pursue real estate. Also the campus looks beautiful and close to beach and south from California.
Alum,4,"USD provided more than the typical college experience. With one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation, my college experience was filled with scenic views of the ocean from campus, La Jolla shores, Torrey Pines, and Sunset Cliffs. Being from Oklahoma City, this was somewhat distracting, as I wanted to run off to Joshau Tree or the ocean every moment, but I had excellent, engaging professors that kept me interested in my academics."
Sophomore,4,"USD is a very beautiful campus, with lots of great professors and classes, however it is lacking in some aspects of school spirit, student life, and diversity."
Freshman,4,"Going to the University of San Diego is like going to summer camp year round. By that I mean, half of the time I forget I'm just here for school! The campus is so gorgeous it doesn't feel like a traditional college environment at all, and I love that about it. The class sizes are small, enough so that your professor knows you by name. Being able to develop relationships with my professors has significantly helped my academic success in the classroom. I love everything that this school stands for. They are openly accepting of persons from all races and ethnicities, economic backgrounds, and religions. There are on campus resources for minority groups such as women, women and persons of color, and  LGBTQ+. The only thing I think this school lacks is the numbers of students with diversity in race and ethnicity as well as economic backgrounds. This school does much to support diverse communities on campus, but lacks in the actual numbers and representation of these minority communities."
Junior,4,"My experience here at the University of San Diego has had a great impact on me over the last 5 months. I am a recent transfer student, and USD has done a great job at helping me, along with other transfer students transition into a four year institution. This university is carried with such prestige, that it has helped me grow in character, and has also impacted me on how I think. This sounds like a silly thing to say, but I have realized how my point of view and perspective on certain topics discussed in class and about life in general, have been influenced from being here at USD. I have enjoyed meeting new people with very different ideas and life goals. I am amazed and motivated even more each time after getting to hear someone's story and their dreams, because although it might seem so different from where I come from or where I'm headed, we all share at least one important thing in common. We are all here for a good education and greater future."
Junior,4,"USD is a really beautiful school with a beautiful campus. The professors and counselors are always helpful. Being a small school, everything is intimate and feels more like a high school however academically USD is a great university."
Niche User,4,"I'm a finance major too, and I'm going to be a sophomore. The party scene is definitely fun, but its much different than most colleges. First off, it is a dry campus if you are underage. So, you can either drink in your dorm or go party at the beach. Drinking in your dorm sucks (RA's), so you'll find yourself going to Mission Beach. Unfortunately, it's tough to find parties as a first semester freshman guy (who really wants to invite freshman guys?). If you do find one, then you'll have to pay for a cab there and back. (The whole fare is $20 each way, but you'll split it with friends.) Solution: join a fraternity in the spring."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the experience in an environment that I felt comfortable in. Especially for living near the area, it was a great experience having a dorm and being on the campus!"
Junior,4,"Great school, small class sizes, and engaged professors who are willing to work with you and answer your questions. The campus is beautiful, and if you have the chance to stay in the dorms, do so! I especially recommend Maher Hall for the freshmen and for the upperclassmen, the Manchester Apartments."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere and environment at USD, and I have met some great friends and professors.  USD is beautiful and lively, but more school spirit and participation from the student body would improve the college life experience."
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience at USD has been great. 
Academically, the smaller class sizes create a great learning environment, as well as giving students access to the professors for aid or discussion. The courses that I have taken so far have been excellent and the information gained from them has prepared me for my future profession.
Though school spirit and the sports scene are lacking at USD, the proximity of the campus to downtown San Diego, the local beaches, and other locations allows for many opportunities to enjoy student life."
Alum,4,"Professors are very interested in the growth of their students. Classes can be found to be small, helping created a better connection with the teacher and other students. The campus is always clean from any trash and smoking. Students have many places to spend time, from terrace to the pavilion. Every student can find a place to fit according to their background and necessities."
Junior,4,"I entered this school in the spring of 2018, I was a community college transfer student. The process of transferring to USD was very simple and I was placed in classes with several other transfer students to help develop a community. The campus is extremely well taken care of. It is ranked very high on campus beauty. The professors are very professional and it is obvious they know what they are talking about. I feel as if I am getting a high level of education at this school. I would have rated it five stars however the price o f this school if very high. Also the diversity level is not very good. The school is mostly white kids and foreign students."
Sophomore,4,University of San Diego is a beautiful campus with unlimited options to be heard and get involved! USD has given me a strong sense of myself and what I want to work towards. Great programs assist you every step of the way.
Niche User,4,"I have been to the University of San Diego twice, once for a field trip and once on an overnight camp. Both times I enjoyed the campus and I had a lot of fun. During the time that I went there was construction and it made it more difficult to get around. If you decide to go to the University of San Diego it is because you are interested in academics not athletics. Their pool is very small and they do not have a track, but they do have a large soccer field and basketball stadium. Overall the University of San Diego is a beautiful campus and it is easy to get around with their shuttle and large sidewalks."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, hit or miss professors, TONS of core requirements, eh party scene, great food. Psafe roams around all the time, making it a safe campus, but also makes it seem like there could be an attack because of how many there are. Also, most of them I always see are on their phones and aren't doing much. Wish they would reallocate some of that money into athletic programs or something more for students."
Niche User,4,The University of San Diego is a very beautiful school and is academically advanced. It is a private Catholic school that offers many opportunities for its students to thrive.
Junior,4,The University of San Diego is one of the most beautiful campuses. It makes walking to class truthfully enjoyable. The teachers have actual life experience that makes learning more interesting. They keep the classes interactive and make one eager to want to learn. I love how small the campus is because it means you pretty much meet everyone. The food is also much better than the average college campus.
Niche User,4,Such a stunning campus in an amazing location. The academics are strong and there is so much to experience in San Diego. The student population is definitely pretty wealthy which can diminish diversity. Tuition is pretty outrageous.
Senior,4,"USD promotes positive change and healthy interactions (between people, and with the environment). It offers opportunities for personal growth and success, and fosters community due to its small campus. As an academic institution it sometimes fails to accommodate productive learning environments."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the University of San Diego wasn't thought of, it was amazing. It was quite a diverse community of people , along with the variety of different restaurants from different cultures. The opportunity to connect with others from different social groups and cultures is very incredible ! This campus brings energy and welcome
In harms into life !"
Niche User,4,"The school was beautiful, it was very clean and made you want to be on campus to learn and grow as an adult."
Freshman,4,"So far in my first four months I've really enjoyed my time at the University of San Diego. The classes are very interesting and challenging in a good way. The campus feels pretty small but it's beautiful and if you go off campus often then that helps. The beach is super close and the weather is great, not too hot not too cold. Getting involved in the school is not hard if you try and there are many opportunities that are offered to get involved."
Freshman,4,"Overall I had an excellent experience at USD. Excellent environment, professors, food, dorms. The only think I will change is more school spirit."
Graduate Student,4,"Beautiful campus. I’m in the masters nursing program which has an amazing lab and great teachers. It is on the expensive side, but I also believe that it is worth the investment."
Freshman,4,The campus here is beautiful and the professors are exceptionally helpful and understanding. The classes are small - my largest class at the moment is 35 people - which allows for more opportunity to have one on one time with your professors and to create a more welcoming classroom environment.
Junior,4,USD is such a beautiful campus! I love the campus itself as well as the size. I have never been taught by a TA or GA and I love having the small class sizes. San Diego is a great area and there is always something to do.
Freshman,4,"Great professors who are willing to help you succeed. Small class sizes allow for an intimate learning environment. Living community is healthy and empowering, especially the delicious food readily available on campus."
Junior,4,"I love the campus, very beautiful. The teachers are very helpful, some more than others. The food on campus is the best compared to other colleges. I wish it wasn't so expensive or that the financial aid office was more rewarding."
Sophomore,4,"The school has an incredibly beautiful campus. With the small class sizes, teachers are always available to help students one on one. Although the school lacks in diversity, the campus is very friendly."
Sophomore,4,"USD is a small, friendly campus. The class sizes are small and easy to get involved on campus if you want. What you put into it is what you get out of it. The area is beautiful and it's fairly easy to get around. Whether you're coming from the other side of the country of San Diego itself, it's a great school to get an education and fun social life at. I recommend it!!"
Junior,4,"USD is a good overall university, however I believe that like many schools it  is overpriced. The social scene is tough to penetrate after freshman year, due to the Learning Living Communities. These LLCs make the school seem very click-orientated, almost like high school."
Niche User,4,It is a very beautiful and fantastic college. It has so much to offer both with the diversity of the students and the academic factors of the school. I do not think that things should be changing there all that much.
Junior,4,"USD is a great school for those looking for a personalized liberal arts education. The classes and professors make for a rigorous, yet rewarding academic experience. Social life at USD has a niche for nearly everyone. There are a bunch of ways to get involved on campus, including, but not limited to a close-knit Greek system. While the campus itself is dry, the off-campus party scene is localized on Mission Beach (hello, day parties!), with a variety of delicious late-night munchie options, not to mention the sun, surf, and sand just 10 minutes away from the gorgeous Spanish Renaissance-styled campus that sits atop a hill overlooking the city of San Diego."
Senior,4,"Whoever that was from Texas writing about the environment at USD, I feel you. You should get in touch with me. Leave your info. at the advising office in Olin first floor. :))"
Freshman,4,"University of San Diego provides an inclusive community experience. The professors stress office hours and highly encourage students to take advantage of them. There is also free tutoring in any subject provided, and assistance from the writing lab. The campus is incredibly beautiful and everyone is friendly and kind, walking by students people say hello to each other regardless of if they know each other. Most people are inclusive but there are still clicks. The food is really good for dorm food and there is enough variety to keep things interesting. Public safety keeps watch around the campus 24/7 which gives it a very safe feeling. There is not much of a party scene on campus but if that is what you are looking for you will find opportunities off campus."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very secure, and there are lots of measures in place to maintain student safety. Police services are readily available at any given time, and there are emergency numbers that every student has programmed into their phone because its an absolute requirement. For example, there are police on campus that can be called at any time to escort someone across campus at night, etc. My dorm is in Maher Hall and at night they have a security guard that stays in the lobby by the entrance, so that puts the students at ease a bit. And whenever someone walks into Maher at night, the guard will ask to see their ID just to make sure they're really students. The issue of sexual assault still isn't taken as seriously as it needs to be on any given campus, but I think USD students take the issue more seriously than many other campuses'."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is fun and enjoyable overall. The campus is very easy to navigate, and it doesn't take long to walk to classes. For example, Maher is a freshman dorm hall that is located right in the center of campus, and this location is probably the most convenient. Most dorm halls are gender-integrated, although Camino Hall is all boys and Founders is all girls. There are little cafes near every dorm hall, which makes it easy to grab food or coffee whenever. Every dorm has sufficient laundry machines and dryers, so it's not too hard to get laundry done. There are also vending machines and communal study/ living spaces in every dorm hall that are used for various social events and just chilling out. The dorms are very social and everyone basically knows each other, but it's not rowdy so it's easy to get sleep and study time. There are doubles, triples, and quad options for dorms, but single options are also available. And it's relatively easy to get a single dorm if a student wishes to do so; the housing faculty is very accommodating and helpful. Some students even have their therapy dogs or cats with them!"
College Freshman,4,"Sports life (attending varsity games, tailgating, etc.) is definitely not the biggest part of life on campus, but nonetheless there is still a large base of fan support. Student athletes are treated well and are always taken care of when injured; winning never overshadows the importance of the athlete's health & well-being. Because of the close-knit community, USD's campus has a lot of school spirit. A lot of students are from out of state, and most make sure to represent their college when they go back to their home state. Students here are generally very proud of their school, and they're proud to be a part of any aspect of the Torero community."
Senior,2,"Online, I did not feel as motivated to try my best and complete assignments as timely as I usually do. I found it very difficult to learn properly from my professors and I think that hindered a bit of my learning experience overall. Not an ideal way to spend the semester."
Sophomore,2,"It does not have a lot of diversity. Many African Americans drop out or transfer after the first year due to feeling isolated and excluded. In addition, many of the minorities who attend the school are athletes. It's very sad."
Junior,2,Terrible value for the cost of this school.  For the first 4 semesters could only get into 2 of the 4 classes needed as they fill up immediately.  Was told by the consular to take the classes I couldn't get into at the Mesa the community college.  What?  No guidance or direction by advisor.  Your money is better spent at a different school
Freshman,2,"USD gives off the best possible first impression due to its physical beauty and good academic standing. However, I had an awful time as a freshman. Liberal Arts courses are taken way too seriously and you might find yourself just starting to take your major courses during your second semester of sophomore year. The majority of my professors completely sucked and were not appropriate teachers. The student body is extremely snobby and uncultured. There is a tremendous atmosphere of discrimination and it is impossible to avoid it. The school is also very very very expensive."
Alum,2,"People rationalize the  cost of education as an investment in their future career. I graduated from USD in 13 years ago. Im writing this in hopes it can help prospective students see it from that perspective.

Ive been fortunate to have had a lot of career success. BUT honestly, USD and its alumni network really did not help with that. Ive been more on the giving end than anything else. My experience is that the USD reach and resources are pretty limited. A lot of rich people send their kids to USD, but that doesn't  translate into having a lot of powerful and interconnected alumni. The reality is that outside of SD, being a USD grad doesn't hold much sway.

I had good times and met cool people at USD. Its a lifestyle school that is easy and nice. BUT, USD is really expensive and I dont think its worth it. If you get into a UC or other respected public college, go there instead. If you do go to USD, study abroad and do everything in your power to get a good internship."
College Sophomore,2,The greek system is very snobby and cliquey and one sorority chapter got kicked off campus last year
College Sophomore,2,"The athletic program at my school is very good! The problem comes from the school spirit.. It is very common for students to only attend 1 or 2 games of any sport over the course of the entire year.  I would give this a higher rating if my school cared more about sports. Even though I gave our athletics at our school a bad score, that doesn't mean that it bothers me. I don't mind if our school revolves around sports or not, that wasn't something that was important to me going into my decision of where to attend college."
College Sophomore,2,The school definitely chooses to focus a lot more on academics than athletics. Football won nearly every game this season and won our conference yet there were less than 20 students at each game. Our school doesn't have an awesome reputation for sports which causes fan support to be very low.
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly wealthy or upper middle-class, white students. Minorities are underrepresented. There are minority groups on campus (Black Union, LGBT, etc.) that are supported."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want a school with A LOT of school spirit and highly-attended sports events, USD is not the school for you. Big rival games sell out, but everyday games have really low attendance. All sports are D1 except football (D2) because it was recently implemented at USD. It will become D1 eventually. Overall, low school spirit except for when it really matters."
College Freshman,2,Sports at USD are not popular which are a shame because its a Division1 school. The athletes are very talented and deserve more support. I wish USD had more school spirit.
College Freshman,2,Our school spirit lacks in all aspects. Athletics are not a large part of campus life. We do have a good volleyball team though!
College Freshman,2,Students are not really involved in sports in terms of the amount of support and people showing up to the games. This is because our teams dont have much talent and lose most games so majority of students stop coming out to games.
College Freshman,2,Very little diversity on campus at USD. They are working hard to fix that.
College Freshman,2,"Nobody here attends games or cares about sports. I never know who is playing or how we are doing. The gyms are horrible, small, and have outdated equipment."
College Student,2,"I had one professor who was extremely misogynistic and unfair, and then another one who even though I was registered in the class, told me I was unwelcome and made me leave in front of the entire class on my first day. Some professors do care, and I was lucky enough that my advisor cares, but most teachers only care about tenure or reaching tenure rather than actually doing a decent job."
College Student,2,"My dorm is literally 6ftX12ft. We cannot have any kind of toaster or heater other than a microwave, and the microfridge that the school offers for rental is horrible. The washer/dryers will mess up your clothes beyond repair. For $12,000 a year, you would expect, say, heating or cooling in your dorm. Nope. They don't even allow you to bring in your own AC units. There was one point where my dorm reached 104 degrees inside. They literally sent out an email persuading students to stay out of their dorms because it was that unsafe. RA's all basically pull the ""hide everything!"" card when it's time for a room inspection, which is nice, but also don't do anything when it's 1am on a Wednesday and there are people playing their guitar and screaming Adele lyrics in the lounge."
College Student,2,Remember the high school cafeteria cliques? Raise their age by a few years and you have USD's greek life.
College Student,2,"Our best team is basketball and they lost their first game at the championships. I work at concessions, and the only people who go to our games are old people and the opposing team's supporters."
College Freshman,2,Alumni are only there to donate money but don't necessarily care about future students.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life on campus is centered around being ""popular."""
College Freshman,2,The gyms and equipment that they have on campus in minimal and only athletes have the ability to use high end equipment.
College Freshman,2,"I mean, we play some great schools. We hold our own, but very little of our students will go professional. Are sporting events fun outings? Definitely! Do we win? Not so much, but that is okay! Have fun, enjoy your Thursdays at the games, because friday is when everyone is off campus."
College Senior,2,"Great athletics programs, but no school spirit"
College Freshman,2,There could be a home football game going on and nobody would know about it. Sports are a very small part of campus.
College Freshman,2,"The rooms have black mold, the bathrooms are gross, the rules are so strict, and the rooms are outdated with no air conditioning or even drinkable water on the floor."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have much school spirit when it comes to sports, and things are very disorganized. The facilities are okay, but there is few space, and equipment available to non-varsity athletes, or just regular students."
College Freshman,2,"Regarding team performance, the athletic teams do relatively well in their divisions. However, there is very little fan support outside of team member's families. There is a serious lack of school spirit here, excluding one or two major games during the football and basketball seasons. The basketball stadium is up to date and looks nice. The football stadium could use some renovations to make it more spirit oriented and cohesive in fan sectioning."
College Freshman,2,The teams are great at USD but spirit lacks.
College Junior,2,"I hoped to receive more financial aid and scholarship opportunities offered by the school. I only received about $300 per semester of financial aid. This is such a small amount considering that tuition is $42,000! I also do not qualify for any of the scholarships as a transfer student."
College Junior,2,"I applied for federal aid and did not receive any. I also did not receive any merit scholarship money, which does not make sense given my high school GPA. This was the only school that did not offer me a merit scholarship, and I'm still very upset about it."
College Sophomore,2,Not very diverse as a whole. Some people respect diversity more than others but most don't care about diversity.
College Junior,2,"I'm sure there are some majors where the professors are great, but the science professors are lacking. Behavioral Neuroscience professors are hard to come by and the program is not well-established on campus. The university is very tough, tougher than need be, the school is not that good nor is USD ranked highly at all. Many science professors have poor teaching abilities and do not help their students. To succeed at a science major, be prepared to have no life, friends, or fun."
College Junior,2,"There are not many research options for psych or neuroscience students and if are not close with a professor it is very hard to get research. Internships are fairly easy to get and if you have money, you don't have to worry about anything. You have to start early, or you have to do most of the work to find research or internships on your own or from who you know."
College Junior,2,No one really goes to sporting events. Hardly anyone has school spirit. The sports teams are a joke and so are the gym and workout facilities.
College Junior,2,Transferred from a small school with a big party scene. The downtown SD night life is so good and the gaslamp district is  amazing and there's Mission Beach or PB when you want the actual beach night life. But a lot of people can't party or don't know how to party and it's hard because so many people don't ever actually go downtown/club.
College Freshman,2,"Typical blonde rich snobby girls for most of it. Some sorority's actually do good in our community, others are just the easy ones. Frats just focus on parties tbh."
College Freshman,2,We have very little school spirit. No one really goes to soccer games or football games so don't expect that. We mostly cheer on our basketball team.
College Junior,2,almost no party scene on campus. parties are usually thrown down at mission beach
College Junior,2,"School is way too harsh on greek life, big brother."
College Sophomore,2,People not in it look down on it and the people in it look down on the people not in it. Like Highschool.
College Junior,2,"Rich, white students dominate the campus so it's not very diverse. Not too many minorities represented or known here."
College Freshman,2,I know a few people who got scholarships however I did not. I received some financial aid money but nothing anywhere near I need it. I am taking out a tremendous amount of loans for this school and sometimes I wonder if its worth it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have sent numerous emails to admissions and advisors for aid in finding scholarships and grants. All of the replies indicate that I should fill out a FAFSA. I have filled out a FAFSA, but I'm looking for scholarships and grants so that I do not need to take out any more loans (I have enough outstanding loans from undergrad!)."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most of our teams are actually pretty good, but no one really cares. Our school spirit is almost none existent, which is frustrating because we have reason to have it. At most sporting events almost no one comes and when they do it is usually for the incentive that is offered (free t-shirts or food)."
College Sophomore,2,Very few minorities but it wasn't an issue for me
College Senior,2,"I would say 70% white and 30% (black, latino, asian). about 60% girls and 40% boys."
College Senior,2,Sports aren't really that important anymore since the school had to cut many sports a couple years back. To be honest I really only went to a couple sport games during my four years on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you're into frat parties, good luck."
College Sophomore,2,get there early or else you're screwed
College Freshman,2,"We don't have any varsity school spirit. However, intramural sports are commonly participated in. Sports are here if you want them, but don't have a part in your college experience if not."
College Sophomore,2,have to drive off campus and cops at mission beach are strict
College Sophomore,2,limited spots and parking tickets are common.
College Freshman,2,"again, not a member so I dont care."
College Freshman,2,I didnt receive any financial aid in terms of scholarships.
College Junior,2,I pay up to hundreds of dollars less a month living off campus. Not only do you get the incredible location of the beach but you also don't have to deal with the headaches of resident housing.
College Junior,2,"Last year our school made over half a million in parking ticket revenue. Permit costs are over $300 a semester. When the walk from off campus is shorter than the time it takes you to walk up that damn West Hill, then you know something's not right. Just another USD rips off its students."
College Junior,2,"Dropping was the best decision I could have made. Greek life at other schools may be fun but here it is muddled by controlling presidents, school politics and again the incredible lack of diversity. Negative stereotypes exist for each sorority/frat and they are pretty accurate."
College Junior,2,"Since the tuition is through the roof expensive, it's almost impossible not to have a student population comprised entirely of rich, white kids. If you don't fit the mold, it can make student life hard. The atmosphere is similar to that of an over-priveleged high school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The passes are expensive, parking tickets are expensive, nearby spots are hard to come by, and the large parking garage is at the bottom of the biggest hill on campus. There is an unreliable tram that takes forever or be out of breath by the time you reach the top by walking. There is really no where close to park nearby other than campus."
Sophomore,1,My professors did not make my online learning experience easier considering everything I have had to deal with regarding COVID-19.
Senior,1,I think that the University of San Diego is a horrible school. The staff there do not want to help you succeed in life. The language department and math department are so poorly run that it made me hate Spanish and Algebra. The school has never tried to help me earn back my scholarship. I have also had teachers that cuss at students and say they will fail all students because they have the power to.
Sophomore,1,"Coming to the University of San Diego was the worst decision I have made in my short lifetime. They advertise the beautiful campus and study abroad program to perfection so before freshman year you are led to believe that this place is heaven on earth. Now I can only speak from the perspective as a black male student which is one of the groups of people here who have no voice in a sea of rich white privilege. The academics are good and the classes will challenge you, but everything outside of academia and the delicious dining services is a disgrace to the college experience. The party scene only exists through Greek Life here at the University, which is in reality just a clique of rich white kids .The parties usually have poor ratios where shitty dubstep music is blasting.If you are a male and not in a fraternity you will be lucky to attend one or two parties a semester. Living on campus is a nightmare. You will get fined $300 if you have ANY drugs or alcohol in your possession."
College Student,1,"I came in this school thinking it would be my dream school. I was so excited to learn and immerse myself in college life, but was overwhelmingly disappointed. I am transferring, and personally know of 6 other people who are transferring as well. I have no idea how they maintain a 90% retention rate. I had major issues with teachers in the science department who lack necessary skills to teach. One of my ""professors"" didn't even have his PhD until halfway through the semester. There are a few professors who really do care about their students, but it doesn't make up for the crapshoot of registering. You will get a good grade if you get a good teacher. With the registration process, it's impossible for underclassmen to fill their GE requirements (which take an entire 2 years to complete). I couldn't even get into the math class I tested into. The social life is very reminiscent of high schoolers. Lots of cliques (sororities), jocks (the failing sports teams), and don't even start me on the amount of drama on the campus. Dorm life is horrible. My single dorm is smaller than a California prison cell. No one takes noise levels seriously, and there WILL be people blasting music and yelling in the lounges until 3am every night. I had two on-campus jobs, one of which broke multiple labor laws. Campus safety doesn't actually care about safety, just about making sure the school doesn't make headlines. People care about 3 things at USD: money, status, and whiteness. Don't even get me started on the racial issues that happened last semester. There was literally a noose hung on campus and major threats were being made towards members of the Black Student Union. I'm a white kid from a well-off family, but I was shocked by that. The mission statement of the school upholds diversity, yet no one was punished for the racial hate speech that happened on campus."
College Freshman,1,"I don't like greek life. I am against the principles of it (the ones of today...not the original ones that all of them were originally founded on), and what they do. At USD a better term for frat/sorority is ""turn up crew"", because that is really the only reason to join one. 

""Greek life participates in community service, did you not know that you ignorant non-greek student!?!?"" -Any person in geek life at USD

Greek life does participate in community service, if you call picking up a piece of trash (while they film each other for proof) community service. IT IS A JOKE. I stick to my previous words when I said they are simply ""turn up crews"". 

They eat dinner together because they think of themselves as an elite group of beings who can't lower their standards to sit with the peasants. 

ok...im done thanks for listening to my rant"
College Freshman,1,"It's pointless, and only for partying. It has nothing to do with community service, or volunteering or being a ""sisterhood"". All it's about is PARTYING. I can't take is seriously."
College Junior,1,"I wish my major was taken seriously by the institution. There was only 1 advisor this school year and I had no help with choosing my courses or figuring out my plan. My advisor messed up my DARS and also led me down the wrong path. The major on the USD website is also listed wrong, and it is so hard to figure out which classes are need to graduate. I can't believe this school with only 5000 students can't even give us the attention needed so we can succeed. The Deans are of no help and the school has such a hard time finding professors to teach the upper division Behavioral Neuroscience classes, which is nerve racking as a senior trying to get the classes. It's so upsetting because I am so eager to learn about my major and the school makes it difficult because sometimes the professors that they randomly have teach these courses don't know the material enough or do not know how to teach it properly."
College Junior,1,"I am a transfer student and I would choose to never come here again. I went through the admissions process thinking this school was wonderful and thought the school truly cared about its students. When I got here everything changed, and I was so surprised and so disappointed. This was my dream school, a school I worked so hard to get to, and it was nothing like I was told/made to believe it would be. I went through USD's website and read the mission statement and values and history of the school, and fell in love with it. The Admissions Office and my admissions officer were so friendly, caring, and delightful. They helped me with so much, and I assumed that was how the school would treat its students. But the school is so harsh towards its students and do not try to help them, especially the transfers. There are so many unhappy transfer students like me, and it is so hard to make friends. I am in a leadership position in Greek life and it is still hard to make friends, USD has done a terrible job with the Greek life on campus and it is very alienating and exclusive to other Greeks and non-Greeks. There are so many required general education classes that it makes it extremely difficult to graduate on time as a transfer. I am thinking of transferring again because I have had such a negative experience here."
College Junior,1,"I came here during my Junior year as a transfer and I am so unhappy here. I wish there was a warning label that came with USD. The school may look pretty but the classrooms in the Psych dept are horrible and many classrooms are very old and run down. The people here are so rude and unfriendly and I found it very hard to make friends because I do not party every weekend and I am a science major. There are so many general education classes and the science department is so bad, most professors are tougher than need be. The resident halls have no A/C, are run down and falling apart, and are so loud and dirty. The administration is so uncooperative and does not help students in dire need or try to work with the transfers to help us with our transition. I was not prepared for the amount of work I needed to do to succeed here and I feel like the courses are too hard compared to the ranking of the school. So many of the professors do not help their students and have very intricate and detailed course material only found by listening to their lectures or their lecture slides. Your grade in a class definitely depends on which professor you are lucky to get for a class. There are very few course offerings and they do not have enough professors to teach the classes for the current students. There are not enough advisors and DO NOT COME HERE TO MAJOR IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE. Go to a real research institution to major in that or have a concentration in that field. There are so many weird and unnecessary classes required for every student to take that it was not worth it to come here. I am pre-med and I have to finish these classes Post Bac because I can't wait to graduate just to get out of this school. I have joined Greek life and am in a lead position, but the Greek life scene here is a joke compared to how real sororities and frats are at larger/friendlier universities. This was not the ""college experience"" I signed up for when I applied here, academically or socially."
College Junior,1,"You will only have friends here by being here since your freshman year and living on campus and making friends with the people in your dorm. That is seriously the only way, or making friends freshman year or joining Greek life. People pretty much know each other and it is hard for you to meet new people. Transfers have a hard time meeting people and making friends, but some transfers get lucky or party a lot and meet people that way or join Greek life. People are generally rude and unfriendly on campus, and are only nice to people they know and do not like to meet anyone new not affiliated with Greek life or party people. Everyone knows everyone, and if you are a transfer it is like being an outsider looking in."
College Junior,1,"I'm a transfer and always wanted to join Greek life and finally joined a sorority, but the Greek life here at USD is a complete joke. The Formal Recruitment process is terrible and the sororities are just looking for people that match ""their image"" and are NOT about their ""values"" or anything about Sisterhood at all. It is so disappointing because I wanted a real sorority/Greek life experience but will never have that here at USD. All of the sorority chapters secretly hate each other and look down or exclude non-Greeks. The top sororities look down on the average sororities or the lower tier sororities. They easily make these lesser popular chapters or non-Greeks feel excluded and come off as ""I'm better than you"" which is terrible because there is no Sisterhood at all. Even the women within the individual chapters are not real friends and don't even really know each other or are cliquey within their own sororities. It's sad because this is not what Greek life is all about."
College Junior,1,"Academic: THE DEANS ARE HORRIBLE. Transfer student that had a lovely experience with the Admissions Office and after that the administration became my worst nightmare. Most of professors in the science department are horrible and you don't really learn because you spend most of your time memorizing all the information for one class. The amount Gen Ed class requirements are insane and you will spend most of your time here completing them. Some professors are amazing and want their students to succeed, but I've had so many professors that just expect the students to learn every piece of information in the exact way they taught it, and I can't learn from memorizing lecture slides or lecture notes. Psafe/parking give a lot of parking citations and there is no place for residents to park on campus during the day, which is hard because the dorms are so far from campus and the trams are not always reliable. 

Social: Strict in the freshmen dorms and just watch people at night. They make sure no one smokes weed, but they never actually stop people from smoking cigarettes by the dorms. They are just out to get you for weed, alcohol, or anything else. DO NOT CALL PSAFE IF YOU ARE RAPED, call the SD police."
College Junior,1,"Transferred from another school where there was always someplace to eat and the food was always good. But not at USD, I've gotten food poisoning from La Paloma, Bert's and the SLP. The brunch is a literal joke and there is never actual good food in the SLP except the pasta from Mickey. There are hardly any late night options and the food is never fresh or prepared well. Tu Mercado only makes sandwiches and they never make the sandwiches right either plus I've seen the girls prepare food with their bare hands or touch the garbage with gloves and not change the gloves before making the next sandwich. The workers for all the dining services are almost always rude or mess up the orders."
College Junior,1,I am a transfer student and will never on campus again. The 2nd week of living ever (from out of state) I had my roommate accuse me of assaulting her and was called down to the housing office with cops there asking me all these questions. I never did anything wrong and was treated like I had and then had to move out of the room! Do not deal with housing any longer than you need to. It's always so loud and there is no A/C in any resident hall. Make sure you know your roommates/suitemates.
College Freshman,1,"The party scene here is absolutely horrible. If you are looking for a party school with a big social scene, don't come here. Most of the parties take place at Mission Beach (Jamaica Street) because on campus parties are just a horrible idea. The party scene is definitely a joke here. A ton of students go home on the weekend or go to parties at other schools to get their fix. 0/10 for parties"
College Freshman,1,So boring. Rather just stay. 
College Freshman,1,There is NEVER anything happening on campus. ever.
College Freshman,1,"I applied for financial aid, I come from a low income family, and I received no financial aid. One of the worst schools for scholarships."
College Freshman,1,The party is scene is not good and the parties usually get shut down.
College Senior,1,"Even with the parking structures parking is difficult.  There are times when there are conferences on campus which makes the parking situation even worse. On the plus side, if you have to park far from your class there is a tram...it just takes a while to get where you are going."
College Junior,1,"Transportation at USD is almost nonexistent. We have trams that take you across campus, but the transportation to anywhere off campus requires you to call a taxi. This is a huge pain and something students have been trying to change for years as most freshmen don't have cars and are restricted to the hill that USD sits on. You really do need to have a car to attend USD, or at least a friend with a car. If you don't, you will be spending a huge amount on cab fees as everything is at least a 10 minute drive away."
College Freshman,1,"All of the tickets to the games are free to USD students. Yet, nobody has spirit so the only games that people went to were the 1st games of the season. The teams themselves are pretty good (besides football)."
College Sophomore,1,"RA's are very strict with underage drinking and will report simply due to noise complaints. Any hint of the smell of weed sets off alarms to the campus police, who spent a lot of time on my freshman dorm floor searching rooms. If you want to party on campus, be quiet and keep it under 10 people unless you want a write up and pay $100. after a couple you could end up on probation with fines up to $300 or asked to leave the school.
you can get lucky with dorms that are easier to party or have cool ra's but ra's roam other dorms so its them you have to watch out for"
College Junior,1,The athletics department is known for under performing and because of this there is no school spirit.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is nonexistent. And those who enforce parking regulations take their job way too seriously. It is very probable that you will get a couple parking tickets while you're there
College Freshman,1,No one really cares about our athletics here and there is virtually no school spirit. Actually a lot of kids admit that they don't even like USD that much. Our teams aren't awful but there just isn't any support behind them.
College Junior,1,"I receive a fair amount of financial aid. I sent my complete set of financial aid forms in a total of 3 separate times (each time they were requested) over the summer and made sure everything was turned in on my part, and my aid still wasn't in place when I arrived at school for the fall semester. I turned in everything on time and the OneStop office couldn't help me at all. If you run into issues with financial aid, avoid going to OneStop and go directly to the Office of Financial aid in Hughes 319."
College Senior,1,They have a very terrible financial aid system. It took a friend of mine a whole semester to get his financial aid settled with the school. They don't offer very many scholarships and the few they offer are hard to get.
College Senior,1,"No one really cares about the sports at USD. The basketball team is probably the most popular but they aren't amazingly good. There is zero ""team spirit"" for our athletic teams. However, if you are a student athlete they do have very many helpful resources."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty Strict – The school is pretty strict. But honestly if you keep your head up and don't do stupid stuff in public your good.
Freshman year everyone lives on campus. The people that get caught for drinking in their room are always the ones with loud music. Keep it down and your fine. Public safety is everywhere on campus, so just be careful to avoid them if your up to something. 
They are pretty strict about Greek Life. But we still find ways around it and have a great time. I highly recommend rushing, you'll have a much easier time than first semester finding parties etc. because you'll have 10+ brothers with houses down at the beach."
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – Public Safety and the university itself are very strict when it comes to academics and social lives (especially social lives). Parking tickets are given out all the time in ridiculous situations and the first time offenses for alcohol are pretty severe, especially if you are in Greek life. If you are sent home from an event, you check in with your RA who has to call Public Safety who drives you to downtown where they throw you in Detox for the night."
College Senior,1,"Financial Aid are heartless individuals and do not understand the economic stress that most students are going through. They have threatened me and my friends that they are going to kick us out of USD if certain balances are not paid off by X due date. Furthermore, they are difficult to talk to. Though, they do give out a lot of scholarships and financial aid in the end."
College Sophomore,1,"Fan Support – The only bad thing about our school is the complete lack of school spirit during sporting events. Coming here my freshman year, and going to my first football game, I was extremely disappointed. It was our homecoming game, and barely anyone showed. Going to the soccer and basketball games are the same."
College Junior,1,"We Try, but We Have a Long Way to Go – Attracting a diverse student body has been one of the main goals for USD for the past couple of years. Unfortunately, the school is not diverse.  We have a really great  diversity of international students, however they often remain to themselves. There have been classes where I am the darkest person in my class of 40. There have also been classes with only 1-3 males present, or all girl classes. The atmosphere is ritzy, where brand names bags replace the good old jansport backpack you would find at any other campus."
College Freshman,1,Get here at 8am and you won't end up parking in no-man's-land.
College Senior,1,"Costly and Limited – Permit costs are outrageous! And most people have class around the same times each day so getting a good parking spot is up to the luck of the draw if you get there past 9am. Tickets aren't too expensive, usually about $50, but they are strict about ticketing. You don't really need a car if you live on campus, there are trams that go everywhere and walking from one end of campus to another is not hard at all."
College Freshman,1,"Sports Are Mediocre. University of San Diego's sports are supposedly decent, but no one has any real idea because the student body rarely attends games or meets. While there is advertisements for big or small games, they often fall on deaf ears. The beach is seen as a much more fun/viable alternative."
College Freshman,1,No public transportation. Their are the buss system and the trollies but it is very limitied on where it goes
College Freshman,1,"Explicitly Obvious Majority – From first sight to last, USD is heavily populated by Caucasians. That being said, hate crimes are virtually unheard of, and people are very accepting. Nonetheless, glass walls between whites and non-whites are understandable at this school, considering the extremely obtuse diversity ratios."
College Freshman,1,"Parking here is a problem. There is only a limited number of spots on campus and no convenient off-campus parking, as the school is at the top of a hill. The permits are relatively inexpensive for college permits, but even with a permit you will still have problems finding places to park and there are very specific areas in which you can park. If you park illegally you will get a ticket in a matter of minutes. Having a car on campus is definately a good thing because public transportation is not that convenient and taxis become expensive after a while (and there is not much with in easy walking distance). The professors do not even get parking spaces, I have had a professor come in to class late, tell us he is looking for a parking place but can't find one and that if he doesn't show up again in the next 5 minutes class is cancelled because he can't find a place."

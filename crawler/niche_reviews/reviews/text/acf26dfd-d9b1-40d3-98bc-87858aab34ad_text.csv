Senior,5,The advisors are really good with the students making sure the do everything in  a way that will cost you the least money but give you a good experience. Next year I hope to study abroad with them.
Senior,5,They use zoom meetings for most of their online classes. They seem well organized and easy to follow.
Sophomore,5,I did not know what to expect but I ended up really enjoying going online. Originally I set my classes up to completely avoid online classes. But with COVID-19 I had to do online. WSU did really well at changing everything to an online format. The teachers were very patient and willing to work with me.
Sophomore,5,Wichita State is an amazing place! Everyone is always nice and interactive! If you 're deciding where to go- Wichita is the place!
Alum,5,"Absolutely the best! What can I tell you to make you go here? I attended online graduate courses. They were welcoming, helpful, and timely on every aspect of my degree. My bachelors was from a big 12 school that I won't mention. It was terrible! WSU has costed me less (money, time, & hassle), responded to all of my needs, and provided valuable education that I can actually use. Updated materials and staff who actually do their jobs well. Please, please please, enroll at WSU and don't waste your time & money on others. This is exactly where you belong!"
Alum,5,"Nothing compares to WSU online learning! Their tech department has benefited my education in every way without problems. This experience was flawless! WSU professors are skilled at delivering online formats. I went to a larger school for bachelors that had glitches and profs just complained all of the time without fixes. The online learning at WSU provides a way for busy working people (moms like me) to have a life and get straight As! I love these professors, advisors, and tech dept like family! They have been so supportive, thorough, and worth it! Please go to WSU! You will be Shocked! That means actually graduate and on time!"
Freshman,5,"The professors are very accommodating and helpful. I never took any online classes until COVID-19, but the transition was fairly smooth."
Senior,5,"While taking classes online can sometimes feel overwhelming, the teachers are always there to help and assist as much as they can!"
Senior,5,The environment created by the staff and faculty makes wichita state a welcoming environment and an excellent school to attend.
Senior,5,"This semester online was pretty challenging but it also gave me time to actually study alone, and learn content better."
Senior,5,"My experience has been amazing. The school is very diverse, so I am able to learn alot about different countries on campus as well"
Senior,5,"I love the teachers, my social work program, and my peers. The staff at Wichita State is very open and honest with what is currently going on within the current events."
Senior,5,I love the online classes through this school. The blackboard online site has made it easy to navigate and I have been able to turn in all of my assignments without any hassle. My teachers have always replied to my emails in a timely manner.
Graduate Student,5,"I have loved everything about WSU so far. I'm in grad school, and my professors have been wonderful. They made online learning during the Covid-19 epidemic accessible but still challenging enough to inspire learning. I'm proud to be a Shocker!"
Graduate Student,5,All my online classes have been well-organized and accessible. The professors make a big effort to provide feedback and engage students.
Senior,5,"I enjoyed my time at WSU because campus was always a fun environment, the professors are really competent and communicative. I think there is something here for everyone and you will not feel like you aren't getting your education needs met."
Junior,5,"I have not officially started at Wichita, but the advisers and representatives I have communicated with have been outstanding. Everyone has responded back to me in a very timely manner. They have also answered all my questions, and if they could not, they looked it up for me and responded quickly. I am a non-traditional transfer student and they have helped me every step of the way to make sure I received the credit I deserved and plan out what I still need. I would highly recommend WSU to any incoming freshman or transfer student."
Freshman,5,One thing that I love about Wichita State is that everyone is positive and the vibe of the campus is really good!
Freshman,5,"Wichita State University is in Kansas. It is well developed and has up to date facilities for example a well equipped and modern gym and student wellness center , great student housing facilities, top notch academic resources, our professors are friendly and encourage participation in class, we have student advisors who assist students on enrollment and discuss with students about their academic goals, we have programs that allow students to meet and network with employers and so many other cool stuff. Overall my experience has been great and I feel privilege to be in Wichita State University."
Niche User,5,"Wichita State University is all about the advancement of its student's lives. The campus has a great feel to It, and will always be considered a special place for me. I could not recommend this school enough."
Niche User,5,They were very in nice showing me and my friend around. They were also very I formative. While this campus is in a not so nice part of town being in campus I could say I felt very safe and secure.
Niche User,5,I am going to be a freshman in 2020. We have been to the campus several times. It is very innovative as well as  update with technology.
Sophomore,5,"I like it but the school focuses too much on athletics, also the food sucks and it’s in the middle of a high sex trafficking area. Those are the main issues"
Freshman,5,"The school is very clean and modern with plenty of places on campus to eat, buy stuff, etc. As well, the professors work very hard. Overall, you are not just buy a degree, you're buying a wonderful college experience"
Niche User,5,"Wichita State is a small community of college students!  Everything you need within walking distance!  Gym, food, classes, entertainment, shopping and housing! If you have small children, they have housing for your family!  They only negative!  Parking! I hope they build a parking garage in the near future! A must necessity!"
Freshman,5,There are lots of opportunities to be involved on campus. You will occasionally see stands with free items or something student involved. Everyone is always kind and helpful.
Niche User,5,WSU has always made me feel welcome on campus even before I knew I was going to go there. When on campus I wasn't treated like a possible new paycheck for the admins they treated me like I was a student and one of the admins on our tour even talked to me about how some of the other schools I was looking at were good schools!
Sophomore,5,I like the different clubs and events wsu offers. There's always something for someone. I also really love the diversity
Senior,5,I received personal advising and step by step online enrollment help via phone with an appointment. Everything is so easy to take care of online.
Junior,5,My advisor is wonderful and has helped me with each step of the application process and helped me through my first semester!
Niche User,5,"I have been on WSU’s campus several times. I have been on one visit, but have also been on campus with my cousin, who cheered for WSU. I was so impressed by the campus, staff, and atmosphere that I decided it was where I wanted to continue my education."
Freshman,5,"Wichita State has a new Innovation Campus.  It is AMAZING!  The campus is beautiful, and it also compact so that you can walk everywhere you need to go.  Dorms are newer, there are a ton of opportunities for students to get involved.  I'm not a big sports fan, so being a college that doesn't have a football team, it feels more focused on education than sports."
Freshman,5,"Wichita State University has one of the most diverse college campuses that I've ever seen. They offer a variety of clubs and organizations that strive to include and appeal to all students. WSU also offers a variety of different degree pathways, and hosts many events year-round for students of all majors to attend. WSU also has amazing athletic opportunities, including their NCAA Division 1 basketball team. The professors also can about individual student success. They are well educated and strive to help you achieve your goals. WSU is not only affordable, but also gives students real world and hands on experiences that aren't always offered at other universities."
Freshman,5,"This is my first semester at WSU, but so far I can say that I am very pleased. Everyone here really cares about the students and you can see that in everything they do. While the campus can be better about its sustainability initiatives, the diversity on campus is pretty good and they have a lot of different opportunities for students to do things."
Junior,5,I love Wichita State. They really care about their students and want you to succeed. There is always something to do on campus and people really try to help students as much as they can.
Freshman,5,"I felt as though it was a kind accepting community all about trying to help others succeed. Although the fact it is a big city does scare me, but I absolutely loved the feeling of accomplishment I got while at the campus."
Niche User,5,It’s located in the Midwest. It’s really diverse there is little discrimination from anyone. They have really good programs for students. The college has good food and a decent amount of students.
Freshman,5,The professors really seem to care that you are learning and they really teach you.  The cafeteria rocks and the living learning communities are great!
Niche User,5,I haven't had much experience yet with Wichita State. That will change next year. I love how comfortable I feel there and all the opportunities they offer. It is close to home which is always a plus. They have a great nursing program and I already got accepted for the Fall of 2022.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Wichita State and I do not know if that will affect anything. From what I have experienced since I have arrived here, I would say that this College is really unique. The opportunities available to everyone are amazing and numerous. The food here is quite carb heavy but still good! Diversity here is amazing and it amazes me to see all of the art on Campus. I still have yet to see everything, but when I do I will give more input."
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at WSU and I love it!! The atmosphere is welcoming and there are so many ways to get involved and meet new people.
Niche User,5,"I love everything about this place. I love the campus, first of all. The wide variety of majors to chose from makes the college situation easier. The staff there is great and works very well with my many, many questions."
Freshman,5,"One of my favorite things about this university, is the diversity within the students. You meet people of all different cultures and ethnic backgrounds! Also, the professors really show that they are there for their students, they want you to succeed and thrive."
Freshman,5,I love it here. I have only been here for about a week and I feel at home. I feel like all of the classes here are good and informational. The school does a great job of making you feel like more than just a number.
Freshman,5,"A few weeks after sending in my application for Wichita State, a representative reached out to me and asked if I had any questions. She was very accommodating to my needs and there to help me should I need anything. The campus is beautiful and expansive with many different areas for students to study, chill, or relax at."
Sophomore,5,"Wichita State University is a great university that is focused on really bettering your education, my experience at his university is great I've made great friends that will last for ages. The campus is really diverse so there is a very good chance that you experience a different culture and ethnic backgrounds."
Freshman,5,"I don't actually attend the physical campus because my program is completely online. I do, however, have friends that attend on campus and the reviews I've heard are great. As for the teachers and staff: they really care about you and want you to do you're best. I think it's a great college and I'd highly recommend it to anyone seeking to further their education. Go Shockers!"
Sophomore,5,"Wichita State University have wonderful opportunities to be involve in  and supports from staffs as well as students. There are many events to attend such as art museum, musicals, pizza parties, etc. Also, WSU provide tutors in math, english, history, and many more. Wichita State University is a great public college to attend at a fair price."
Sophomore,5,"I really love how they do their best to make you feel at home . I transferred from another college to Wichita , and so far it has been the best move ever ."
Freshman,5,"people there is really nice including students and staff, the tuiton and fees are low comparing to other universities and wsu is really diverse when it comes to students"
Freshman,5,They have very helpful faculty & staff that will answer questions for find the answers for you.  The cafeteria food needs some work.
Freshman,5,"The staff are amazing. They genuinely care about your success. The campus is very nice. The dorms are updated, and there are plenty of spaces for students to study and hang out. There are always new events happening on campus, and new improvements."
Sophomore,5,"It has been a wonderful experience, and definitely with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. I honestly believe that because of the events and this space of ODI I would not stay at Wichita. Though the friends I've made and the amazing professors that I have met outweigh any bad experience I've had with other professors or situations."
Freshman,5,Wichita is a great student focused campus with lots of places to study in groups or on your own. Campus life offers many places to eat. Classes can be taken online and advisers are ready to help with any scheduling needs or questions.
Senior,5,I am majoring in biology and I have heard many good things about this department. I hope to expand my interests that are available at the campus.
Freshman,5,Wichita State offers a wide variety of interesting courses that allow students to explore the world and discover themselves as a person.
Sophomore,5,The understanding and elaboration. The amazing advocates and club activities. The food was great. The teachers were amazing. Financial aid always found a way to aid in what ways they could
Freshman,5,"The diversity at the College and different cultural and club. The education about different degrees and career that student are interested in. How every student at the college treated each other with respect and get along with each others. The school make it fun for every student to attend, study and participated in many clubs or others community service volunteers. Everything is interested to learn something new every single day and make friend, also welcoming the new student to Wichita State University."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere of Wichita State University is very welcoming. They treat like family and don't make you feel uncomfortable. Their goal is to make the campus feel like a home to you, which they do a very good job at achieving."
Niche User,5,I have heard great things about Wichita State University. I'll be attending this university here soon and I can't wait!
Junior,4,"It has been a learning experience for everyone, to say the least. Many teachers were not prepared to go online and were not familiar with the concept. However, everyone tries their best to make sure you are getting a great education, even if it is online."
Junior,4,"Overall, I transferred here in 2019 and I have not regretted it. This campus is very diverse and the people are very welcoming. There will always be someone to show you around, and the students are very nice."
Junior,4,"So fare everything is going smooth, I have had no problem. I'm still making friends and communicating to my teachers and everyone is being active. although I am sad to not be able to do many events this year."
Junior,4,"I love how the teachers care about you, you don't always get that at a college. One of my favorite things at WSU is that there is a huge event where each college at WSU does games against each other. I'v made a lot of Friends there just because of the events they put on. Its a great way to meet people! Due to Covid-19 there wont be a lot of events. Some classes are online and very few are face to face. but that hasn't stopped me making friends."
Senior,4,"I wish there were more resources to connect students with each other, and I wish the Heskett center didn't have to get taken away because of corporate-led greed."
Senior,4,I shouldn't have to pay nearly as much as Wichita State is charging for online and infrastructure fees.
Sophomore,4,So far I really love Wichita State University. The dorms I stayed in for my first year were relatively new and very well kept. The teachers are willing to help you succeed. It's a great school.
Sophomore,4,"The online experience is either a hit or a miss! The classes online could be very helpful to those needing flexible hours. However, there are some professors that need the students to have full study/attention to their classes! Just don't overwork the kids with the online classes! We are all adjusting!"
Junior,4,I feel that WSU is a great college. They are very open and accepting of everyone and there I always things to do!
Junior,4,"I like taking classes online at WSU. Although using blackboard can be confusing at times, I feel most of the teachers have a good understanding of it! It is nice to do when not wanting or having time to go to campus."
Freshman,4,A pretty good university with inclusivity and a wide array of activities. The campus is very nice as well as the housing (very spacious). Most classes have tutoring to go along with them and the professors are generally helpful.
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed learning my major at Wichita State University. I have attended for the last two years.
Sophomore,4,I had most of my classes online before coronavirus forced all classes to shift online. My class that was moved from in person to online was not very different besides the lack of communication with my peers.
Junior,4,"What I like about WSU is that the academic advisors are very helpful and great at finding the right classes for you to take. Most teachers are very helpful and understanding, they want you to succeed. I would change the price, because they keep upping tuition. I would also add more accessibility to the campus for going between buildings."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes and assignments are run through blackboard. Its not exactly newbie friendly, so to speak. Your online classes can either be really interactive, or very do-it-yourself esk. Its not bad, but its not perfect. However this can be made easier based on your study habits, schedule, and work ethic."
Sophomore,4,"Ok. So in the middle of no where, there is a large city. In this city there are several universities. One of these is Wichita state university. WSU is unique. It isn't too small, but its not big enough to where you would get lost. Sometimes the events are hit and miss, but they do try with what they can do. One thing that's not necessarily advertised, is parking is an absolute nightmare. But on the good days, you can find beautiful buildings, and unique plants in all of the small nooks and cranny's. You almost forget you are in a city when you walk around campus. Its full of trees and plants that are beautiful, no matter the time of year. Lastly, If you are involved in clubs and events, you will feel a lot better."
Freshman,4,"Its a nice, small campus that doesn't overwhelm me too much. I can find my classes pretty easily. it feels like home."
Freshman,4,I'm about to start this next fall semester and we will be doing part online classes so we'll see how that goes.
Junior,4,I came from a very small town and I believe that Wichita State University has the feeling of a small university but the opportunities of a large one.
Junior,4,I took about 50% of my classes online and for the most part it was very good. When COVID-19 hit and we had to move all classes online some professors were struggling to adapt.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy my experience there. It’s really fun and I’ve made a lot of really good friends. Teachers can be iffy at times but overall are good.
Sophomore,4,Online learning was an adjustment for everyone but most teachers did good about it. Others didn’t relay some info well though
Junior,4,"I love Wichita State!! The only thing I would like to change is some of the parking issues, I don't like that we have to pay for parking when we can't always find a parking spot."
Senior,4,I went to Wichita State as a returning student. They helped me adjust to my new schedule and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Senior,4,Loved that like 95% of my classes were online and I didn't have to go on campus. Annoyed that they made me pay out of state tuition for my entire bachelors degree.
Niche User,4,"I like the vibe of WSU. The school is big without being overwhelming, and it just seems like a nice place to be."
Junior,4,Wichita state is very tight community and they have each others back when something happens. I feel like something that needs to change is how late classes are for female students because of the surrounding neighborhoods and Wichita is a high sex trafficked area. The parking lots are far away from the classes so anything can happen in that walk.
Freshman,4,I like Wichita State University because there is a lot of aerospace engineering in the area and it is a very cool and beautiful university. I had some fun at the university and there is a diversity here. But sometimes people liter a lot and it would if people would pick there trash.
Niche User,4,Wichita State University has very nice dorm rooms built in 2019. They also have a variety of activities that you could be involved in. I feel there is something for everyone no matter their interest. The campus is well lighted and you feel very safe there. They are also building a new business school set to up in 2021 that will be very state of the art.
Freshman,4,I've only been here for one semester bit it's pretty good. The dorms at shocker hall are pretty small though. I enjoy most of my classes and I've heard that their clubs are also pretty good.
Freshman,4,There were many things to be involved in. However the local area is not the greatest location in town but there is not much that can be done about that. Other than that everything is good. The athletics are entertaining to watch even though there is no football team.
Freshman,4,"I liked Wichita State ever since I put foot on campus, it made me feel like home. It's a good environment to meet and make new friends. Different cultures and full on diversity, what I would like to see change is more events so students can meet each other and relate to the same things."
Junior,4,"Getting enrolled is rocky, and parking sucks, but other than that things have been extremely smooth for me at WSU."
Junior,4,The professors are very informative in the nursing department. They are very willing to help you one-on-one or explain something after class if you don't understand. There's a lot of campus activities for involvement as well. It's never a dull moment on campus.
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at Wichita State University I've found that I'm starting to come into my own place. It's easier to feel comfortable on campus because of the inclusive environment. The professors are very welcoming, and the staff is very friendly."
Niche User,4,"Since I've been born Wichita State has always been a great site to see. From much it has grown over my lifetime is pretty impressive. The campus looks amazing, plus I love the sports teams. I cant wait to start my journey at Wichita State."
Freshman,4,"The dorms are newer, clean and great. Dining hall could make food & choices a little better. Math lab wasn’t able to help me with Calculus much. Campus is safe & beautiful. They seem to really care about their student."
Niche User,4,When I visited everyone seemed so kind and welcoming. My tour guide was energetic and willing to talk. He answered questions thoroughly and made sure he answered them right. The campus was so close together which is great for walking. Overall a great campus!
Freshman,4,"The classes mixed with the teachers are terrific. The staff is encouraging and helpful. The campus is gorgeous with its structure, design, and natural decorations. Students are generally positive. It is a wonderful place to go to school!"
Freshman,4,Wichita State University is a great place to live. I'm a shocker hall resident. I enjoy my room. we get free cable and it closer to my classes. The only down side is the cost. If you want to live on campus I suggest the flats. It cheaper and you'll have a kitchen.
Senior,4,Provides a good education for a reasonable price. Most of the flaws can be overlooked considering how much less you pay compared to universities with similar degree programs.
Freshman,4,"So far, it has been very student friendly.  There is a lot of school spirit in and around the college. The event calendar seems fun and their student website is easy."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere and overall college experience here! The campus is lovely and the professors are professional but also informal. The student center gives a calm setting to study in and the library always provides a quiet work environment. I would recommend students to get involved because  WSU offers many community involvement opportunities.
Freshman,4,Wichita is a mid-size city with plenty to offer. It isn't too big and it isn't a small college town. Wichita State is a friendly environment with a strong sports environment and a business school that is investing in building an innovation center.
Senior,4,"Wichita State gave me great hands on learning experiences and encouraged me to pursue my career despite being an adult learner, late to the game."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are intelligent and helpful, there are always activities happening around campus, and the people I have met in my college (Fine Arts- School of Music) are really fun and very supportive."
Sophomore,4,"Love the sense of community that Wichita state has! At the college of fine arts, we are all just one big happy family. The professors really care about your success"
Junior,4,"Wichita State is one of the most diverse Universities in Kansas. It is easy to make friends if you join clubs or if you take part of Greek life. Joining clubs helps you explore  the city and they also do a lot of community work. One thing that is still in issue is safety, I do not recommend walking alone late on campus."
Freshman,4,"I like how inexpensive and welcoming Wichita State University is to it's incoming and current students. It is a nice place to get a degree, the price is smaller than many other colleges and the staff all seem very competent and skilled at their jobs. The only real issue with the university is they seem to have a poor ability at understanding what their students want. Rather than renovating the existing buildings whenever an issue arises, they instead build new buildings entirely. This maybe a positive to some, but it seems like a waste of funding to me."
Niche User,4,"The admissions representative for incoming freshmen was very nice and helpful. I will say that it has been hard to figure out their website and setting up the student email has been even harder. Besides this, the staff that I have met with seem nice and the campus is beautiful."
Niche User,4,"I like that Wichita State University is a school that really cares about their environment and students. At Wichita State University, the campus offers a variety of things a student can do and students can get the help they need. This college is not very small, but it is also not very large. If you are interested in sports such as basketball, the Wichita State University has a good basketball team."
Junior,4,What i like about Wichita State is that a friendly environment where you can be accepted where you go. The staff are there to help you out and the professors to an extent. But there are many ways to get help. Overall a good college.
Freshman,4,Wichita state has flex and great professors! Campus is welcoming and makes wanting to be there 10 times better. I would recommend this university to anyone and everyone.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Wichita State as a non-tratidional student. The class schedule made it easy for me to attend courses while working at a full-time job. In addition, the professors were very knowledgeable and caring and took the time to help me when necessary. I received my degree from the school of music and it is a highly regarded school for this degree."
Freshman,4,"I like how close to home and diverse it is. Back in high school, I was the only Desi kid. Now, I can speak to people who come cultures just like mine."
Junior,4,Wichita State University provides me with an excellent thriving environment for me to pursue my studies in. I always feel like the professors are encouraging and my fellow classmates share my energy for my field.
Freshman,4,"Wichit State University is a great school. It has a beautiful campus, tons of student activities, good food options, and they have the best freshman dorms I’ve seen. The only downsides are that there is always construction on campus and it is geared toward engineering majors so most opportunities can be biased."
Junior,4,"There is no doubt that there are countless universities out there, but Wichita State looks exceptional in many areas. I am currently a nursing student and the professors are great in breaking down information to the level of my understanding. Due to their huge impact, I do not look through outside sources for more clarity. The instructors are huge blessings and I am more than grateful to have them in my life. Aside the outstanding professors, the campus food is another strong area of the school. I would say that it is through the campus food that I remain active before and after classes."
Senior,4,"The campus is a great one although I do not live there at this time.  The classes are very manageable, but challenging, and instructors are easy to contact even by text or email, for assistance.  The buildings themselves offer a lot of food and activity opportunities for students, and the transportation services and safety programs are wonderful."
Senior,4,Wichita State University is a college with diverse Majors and programs. It is always expanding to accommodate the needs of staff and student in the community.
Freshman,2,"Careful who you choose for professors.
Don't come here if you want to enjoy the college experience or greek life.
On campus living is stupid expensive and not worth the price. 
On campus they pack as many as they can into a room. I was in a double with four others. 

Go somewhere else, for real.."
Senior,2,"For the most part the experience here is good. Going from a Hutchinson Community College though to WSU was a challenge. Wichita isn't as helpful when it comes to scholarships. They also charge for a lot more things like parking, and more proctored exams. Most of the professors are helpful but there are a few that were difficult to work with."
Graduate Student,2,The only real positive about this school is the price. If you can definitely go to K-state or KU instead. everything is better at those schools.
Niche User,2,"I have just been admitted to Wichita State University.  So far, my experience has been extremely difficult.  There has seemed to be a hurdle to jump through during each step of the process from transcripts, to name changes, to setting up a password to use the online portal, to being told I need an additional 17 hours on top of what I already needed to complete my degree.  It's been a frustrating process and I haven't even enrolled in a class yet."
Junior,2,"Student are not their first priority. Sports are the authority. Spending is a disaster, they spend money on things we don't need. We need new parking areas, new facilities, but they choose to spend money on food trucks! We don't need that. One of my classes I was looking forward to, bioethics was cancelled due to budget cuts. What a shame. Now, on a positive note, the teachers at WSU are tremendous."
Senior,2,"My experience has overall been somewhat negative over the past  three years. For those interested in entering the Engineering, Business Entrepreneur, or Education program this is the perfect university. For Pre Medical students like me, this is not the university to attend. Intro level courses are taught by professors who are not very fluent English speakers, vital chemistry courses are confusing as experiments meant to reinforce understanding of subjects constantly fail since the Chemistry Dept consistently contaminates their stock of chemicals. There is very little academic support for majors outside of the three groups mentioned above, and absolutely zero support for those seeking a career outside of the three academic fields. I am seeking a transfer to a different university in hopes they will have a safer, more academically friendly environment."
College Sophomore,2,"Fairmount towers are cost less but the quality is not good. Buildings are old and rooms are not very spacious or in the best condition. We have a shuttle system which is useful for those who stay here to get to campus faster. Shocker hall, which are on-campus dorms, are much better in quality but way too expensive for students. The social atmosphere is good at both dorms. There activities planned for residents throughout the semester."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not so popular on campus and they are not that involved so only some students have any idea of what's going on with greek life on camps.
College Junior,2,"For the art students, there isn't enough internships or jobs to help network."
College Junior,2,I take night classes. The neighborhood of WSU is not so great. I usually cary pepper spray walking to my car after class at night.
College Junior,2,there have been recent news stories about a murder that happened on campus near a housing complex. i do not feel safe thinking about living on campus
College Junior,2,This is also not something that I value. So i have little knowledge about how to join.
College Sophomore,2,It is so expensive to get into a sorority here and so very time-consuming. I just don't think the benefits outweigh the negatives.
College Junior,2,WSU doesn't have the best safety background. There have been a few crimes in the bank on campus and out in the parking lot of a dorm.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone is incredibly cliquey, and if you're not in the sorority, you don't exist to them or the fraternities."
College Sophomore,2,"This school has a chronic case of overpopulation. Parking is the first thing you will experience, which often results in parking a few miles out of your way, taking a bus - then walking because all the busses are full just to get to your class. Then you go in, sit in your first undergraduate class, and do all your work in your spare time because your Teacher Assistant can't teach a 130 student class effectively. 

So why go to this school? Proximity? Yes, but expect to spend plenty of time dealing with wichita traffic and fighting over parking zones. Then you get to pay a $150 fee for a parking pass so you can do nothing different. 

Okay. Price? Originally competitive, this school's prices have skyrocketed. Tuition increases, additional fees, and now a new ""$50 per credit hour"" to go fund the Engineering College I don't care about. 

It's just not worth it. Find somewhere that will accommodate you. At the very least, if I have to stay in this prison, I don't want to have to deal with another cellmate."
College Senior,2,The off-campus housing is poor to say the least. Over-priced for the quality.
College Freshman,2,"After receiving the merit scholarship, most aid is difficult to reach unless you qualify for special scholarships (race, gender, initial major, deep poverty, etc). Retrieving information necessary for understanding and using the system is difficult at best, only made easier with the many knowledgeable people on campus. If they're unavailable, it is very difficult to find out what aid you qualify for and what you can get."
College Senior,2,"Most students live off campus; I am one of them. So if there are any parties, most of the students probably aren't invited. Parties are for clubs and activities or if there is a basketball game."
College Junior,2,the safety is the worse there are so many muggings
College Junior,2,"the parking policy is ridiculous! WSU built these new dorms that no one asked for, and it took up all of our parking and now if there is a WSU basketball game we can't even park on campus even though we pay to be able to park on campus. it is not ok to make students pay to park then not let us park on campus."
College Freshman,2,I think parties would have a positive impact because then students can release stress from the school week. The party scene at my school is practically nonexistent.
College Freshman,2,"Student parties on campus are basically dead at WSU. Shocker Hall (new dorms) doesn't have any due to many being underage and the majority of students heading home for the weekend. The few parties around are at Fairmount but it's mostly sitting down and drinking. Wichita is a large city but it doesn't have a college town vibe to it. The few large parties available usually involve knowing someone to know the location. 

I don't party so it doesn't bother me but I know it does annoy others."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot of apartments near campus that are a decent price and look good to live in
College Freshman,2,Fairmount towers is a good deal but not worth walking to classes because of the hassle of walking to classes which is far. Shocker Hall is overpriced because it is a new dorm.
College Freshman,2,The staff is very poor on reviewing financial aid. They didn't take into account that I was an out of state student that was eligible for in-state tuition but continued to charge out of state fees. The financial aid process is poorly regulated.
College Freshman,2,Security is good at addressing crime that happens. We get crime alerts.
College Freshman,2,There are not many options to choose from considering off-campus dining because there are a limited number of fast food/restaurants near campus.
College Freshman,2,Off-campus housing selection is not very good because there is a lot of crime happenings around and on campus as well.
College Sophomore,2,Wish I could go out of state for art no culture here...
College Sophomore,2,I heard it can be cliquish but I know cool ones.
College Freshman,2,"Wichita itself is a very interesting small city with several things to do and see if you have decent transportation. 

The streets surrounding Wichita State aren't really places you'll like to be at late night. Most of the nearby locations are low-income and sometimes problems arise there. I can always here ambulances and police sirens from my dorm at night which is why I don't leave campus at night. The campus itself is very safe and the streets are ok during the day. However, most students wouldn't recommend walking out of campus past 10 or 11 pm."
College Senior,2,"Similar to off-campus dining, there are few bars and clubs near campus. I don't attend these venues, so I can only speak to their variety and proximity. There are more bars and clubs within a few driving minutes however."
College Senior,2,"There are few off campus dining options within a one mile radius and this is why I rate dining options as poor, but there is a large shopping center about a mile away with a variety of good options, but this is not really walking distance. Downtown is a few miles away as well, where more good bars and restaurants can be found."
College Senior,2,There are only a couple photography classes offered.  The can't even offer a BFA or MFA in photography because there aren't enough classes offered.  There isn't even a full time photography professor yet.
College Senior,2,"It's easy for athletes to get full ride scholarships, and it's easy for engineering, math, and science students to get scholarships, but communications and fine arts students get screwed."
College Junior,2,I cannot apply for the scholarships becasue of my residancy issue.
College Junior,2,"Wichita has been rated as the worst city for allergies in the nation. With that being said, during the spring it is tougher on all students when the campus is covered with trees that increases the pollen during the beginning and peak of the season."
College Freshman,2,There are only two pretty decent ones around
College Freshman,2,"The campus is relatively large and Kansas is known for the extravagant weather situations. While most of the time the university is excellent in understanding that certain weather situations make it impossible to make it to class, some days there is nothing they can do. The wind chill is a bit brisk some days; however, simply adding layers can help exponentially."
College Freshman,2,I never had much interest in joining a fraternity. I do not drink so I don't think i would like it anyways.  Not too many people (that i am friends with) are a part of greek life so it really doesn't effect me at all.
College Junior,2,"the city is down right boring. there is nothing to do but go to a bar, go to the movies or go eat. shopping is very limited. we have 2 malls and many shopping areas but it all repeats itself. no cultural events. no professional sports."
College Junior,2,"kansas weather is crazy. its always changing. if your from kansas, then you are used to it and nothing can stop you from doing what you want. however  professers dont cancel class that often, no matter how bad the weather and there are no on campus busing systems. to help you from walking in bad weather. "
College Junior,2,the only thing to do is to do where the rest of the city goes which is usually old town. there are no places for just the college kids. The scene can be a mix of things depending on where you go. Fridays are the worst because noone is out. There is no underage nightlife and the only way to get around at night is to take a taxi if you dont have a designated driver
College Freshman,2,When its snowing or raining and you have to walk to your class you are in deep poop. The campus isn't that big but at the same time you will be soaked or will freeze your butt off.
College Student,2,"Parking here is awful, have to get here and hour early to find a spot in the morning, it's kind of ridiculous."
College Junior,2,"I go to school for an education not to find someone to hook up with, again, not everyone is 20!!"
College Junior,2,The places near campus are horrible and it's the crappy part of town.
College Junior,2,"I think laptops should be given to every student, price of classes is crazy, so why not supply laptops?"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking spaces fill up quickly and there is not enough parking.  Sometimes I have to park a block away and cross a very busy street (with no crosswalk or light).  It is a dangerous situation, especially at night."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no permit costs if you are a student, but if you drive in it is usually difficult to find a decent parking spot. The lot fills up quick and there aren't enough to choose from. I usually add an additional 15 to 20 minutes into my before class estimate just for parking."
College Junior,2,"parking is really bad this year with all of the construction and they've bulldozed a big parking lot to build on and another big one is filled up with construction equipment. I ride my bike, but my driving friends and professors are always groaning about finding parking spots, especially around late morning."
College Junior,2,"I'd applied for education scholarships by the Feb 1st deadline and didn't hear anything until Easter Break when I visited WSU and they said they were re-doing their paperwork so it would be another month at least before I received anything. In a month or so I called back and found out the scholarships had been given out and due to a mistake in my enrollment (As ""Undecided"" instead of my chosen major) I wasn't considered for any of the scholarships I applied for. Very Frustrating."
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have any type of shuttle that goes around campus. We have the safe ride, but that is only for a sober cab. The public bus is not usually convenient."
College Sophomore,2,It is very windy all the time! Walking to class is tough because even though it is warm out the wind cuts through your clothes and it is freezing. When it does snow class doesn't usually get cancelled. Kansas weather is very unpredictable.
College Senior,2,"Only 3 places, RSC with few options, Blimpies with OK subway type sandwiches and the FT dinner with poor menu."
College Freshman,2,The police were around but there were car lefts and situations around the neighborhood a lot during the school year some during the time I was on campus but others were when I was home and safe and it would be on the news or said at the school the next day. Some of the time it would be sent to my phone since I linked my phone to the school contact weather report and crime.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a shuttle bus available to the students at the dorms who need to go to the store or get groceries, but there is no campus bus like some colleges have. Mostly everything is in walking distance unless you want to explore the local downtown or wherever. There is also a late night pick up service if you need a ride."
College Junior,2,"Wichita is in a drought, and problems with allergies and dry air are a problem. The weather is unpredictable, going from freezing to hotand back over the course of a day."
College Sophomore,2,The parking on campus is a tragedy.  There are not enough spaces during peak class times.  Get there early or you may miss class.
Senior,1,"Ten years ago, I was threatened to leave the university on exchange for getting my sibling out of the campus. If not, he would be charged for a battery case in which he did not committed."
Niche User,1,"The only reason that I won't attend Wichita State University is that they make you pay extra based on what you're majoring in. For example, engineers have to pay an extra $50 for every credit hour every class, whether it's an engineering class or an English class which is stupid. There are other majors that make you pay a fee for taking a class that is specific to that major which is dumb. So the feeling I get from Wichita State is that since you know what you want to be when you're done with college, you have to pay an extra 'x' amount of dollars for every credit hour you take. That's so dumb and you shouldn't be charged for knowing what you want to be."
Alum,1,"New professors are unqualified and overrated. WSU used to be great, especially the aerospace department. Older professors are very dedicated, but most of them are gone just few left, and the newer ones teach without any practical knowledge and passion. I hope things will get better ."
Alum,1,I liked the diversity at Wichita State University. Otherwise my experience was horrible. Mostly with my student adviser and the administration office. Most of my teachers were good at their job and easy to understand.
Senior,1,This is the worst school. Don't waste your time or money. The school has turned into a business where the administration is corrupt and only self-interested. The cost to attend is swelling and the value of the education and experience does not even match the price tag.
Sophomore,1,It is very much a commuter school. Only about 8% live on campus. It is lacking a sense of community because everyone is spread out over the entire city of Wichita.
Senior,1,"If you want an accommodating college, go somewhere other than WSU.  If you want to jump through unnecessary hoops to go to school, you came to the right place."
College Junior,1,This school is an educational joke. WSU is the equivalent of getting a degree from Phoenix University or Heritage College.
College Junior,1,Little diversity. Appreciates and celebrated conformity.
College Junior,1,"The schools does not provide any programs, the programs that exist are sparse with course offerings and all the classes are usually all taught by one or two professors in your whole underground and graduate experience. So, good luck if you're not a fan of your teacher. The teachers are bored. They give out grades, because students don't come to class. Waste of time."
College Junior,1,"Sexual assault, rape, and crime are incredibly high on WSU's campus. The Title IX/EEOC director battered a female student on campus and the University police covered it up. A WSU female was raped by a basketball player and she virtually disappeared and nothing came of it. The police are unmotivated and do not do anything. Do not do not do not got to WSU."
College Junior,1,"The school does not prepare students to be excellent in the workforce. Everyone gets by with easy grades, little to no training in professional ethical practices. Wichita does not have a well-diversified economy or workforce...and most of Wichita graduates from WSU...if that is any indicator to you."
College Junior,1,People are uninvolved. Academia is unappreciated. Culture is lackluster. There's really nothing going on on campus. The housing is incredibly expensive. Save your money. Go to a better school.
College Junior,1,There's just nothing special about WSU's Greek life.
College Junior,1,Our school has no real athletic talent.
College Senior,1,"I have never had a good encounter with anyone in the Greek system at WSU. My best friend joined a sorority and her personality instantly changed. She became disgustingly judgey of everything and everyone. Nobody is as good or as ""perfect"" as her and her sisters. And they all sit around talking crap on each other. Basically, if you don't want to leave high school, join Greek life."
College Freshman,1,There are many things to do off campus but crime remains an issue in the city of Wichita.
College Sophomore,1,Students stay in there own racial groups...
College Sophomore,1,"It's Wichita,Kansas there's not much to do... It's not a college town but a big city that feels like a big retirement home..."
College Sophomore,1,"The students are either WAY TOO YOUNG, since clubs here are 21+, or they're homebodies. Unless you know frat boys there is no party scene. Also the students tend to stay within there own races, even to party."
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful. Im not paying 120 dollars for a permit to park on campus for two semesters, nor am I going to struggle with the shuttle bus. Instead of creating permit parking required for ALL parking, just build more parking lots. Yes, there is a parking problem, NO it is not solved."
College Senior,1,"It was a nightmare. I never received any information until it was too late and any aid I received was through the FAFSA and the government. Any scholarships I may have been eligible for, I didnt get any information on or was told it was too late to apply or that they were unavailable due to ""reworking of the money""."
College Senior,1,The photography program at Wichita State is virtually non-existent.
College Freshman,1,There aren't many parties to go to and its a big enough city so that you don't see people from school too often.
College Freshman,1,"There is no night life, maybe one country club, but i hate country music so i would not go to that.  It's fine that there isnt a huge nightlife though because I am there to learn, not to party, which is why i chose Wichita State"
College Sophomore,1,The Weather in Kansas has been completely terrible my whole life.  If you enjoy cold Weather you will enjoy this campus during the Winter.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are decent right now, but they are building new ones which they are giving to incoming freshman. They're shutting down the current upper classmen dorm and moving the to the old freshman dorm. A lot of people are upset and don't think this is fair."
College Sophomore,1,"It is easier to find parking if student arrive after 8am. After 8 it is almost impossible to find parking until late in the afternoon, but students can use the shuttle bus which helps. Security is very strict on parking in the wrong areas and always give tickets."
College Sophomore,1,The parking is horrible at WSU. You have to get to school at least an hour before to find a parking spot because you might end up having to walk a long distance to get to class. Now there's construction going on so some of the parking lots are blocked off which makes it worse. Unless you're a teacher you don't get any of the good parking.
College Freshman,1,It's terrible. You have to go really early to find a parking spot or else you are forced to park really far and walk ALOT. Now it is going to be worse because they are closing the biggest and closest parking lot to the campus to make dorms instead. I can't imagine how this upcoming fall semester will be. I think i will have to take roller blades.
College Freshman,1,"The only way to find a spot on campus is to show up early. If you are not early, you will never find a spot to park."
College Junior,1,"You need a car if you ever need to go outside campus, taxi/bus service is not good."
College Junior,1,"When it comes to cost, it can't be beat (it's free). however at certain times finding a spot is a task. If I show up at a busy time I just go ahead and park in the lot that is by hillside away from all the buildings. It's a long walk but time will be saved by not searching for a spot. there is construction at the rahtigan student center and that parking lot is closed at least this semester. this makes the parking even worse. I have never been ticketed, but I hear they are outragous! parking would have to be my one NEGATIVE about Wichita State"
College Freshman,1,Avoid It If You Can – WSU does so many things well that it's a shame that the on-campus housing is so poor.  Housing has problems with bed bugs and roaches all the time.  The facilities are dated and need improvements.  Maintenance is not very good at responding to and fixing problems.
College Sophomore,1,"If scheduled for an early class, the parking isn't too bad. If not, one must be sure to arrive as early as possible. Often one must search far and wide to find parking. It seems like when there are major events at the school, especially athletic events, students who pay for all this are last in line, because they close down large swaths of parking areas. This is especially bad considering Wichita is not an especially bike-friendly city and public transportation is minimal."
College Junior,1,"Not Traditional – I was expecting to see more typical college students when I transferred to Wichita State. It's not a typical University, however. There are so many non-traditional students (older people). There are also many people who are ""homebodies"" (people who do not have a life). Kind of a boring mix of people."
College Senior,1,"Totally Depends! I live in an apartment across the street from campus, so I walk to class. Before I lived here, however, and had to drive, it was miserable. Parking is AWFUL. Even Faculty has it bad. There's been talk every year of a parking garage, but it always gets squashed. To give an idea, if I DO drive, I still have to leave THIRTY MINUTES before class to drive across the street just to ensure I get a semi-decent spot. And even then, I have to stalk people for their spots."
College Freshman,1,Not Worth It – Nightlife in Wichita is surprisingly bad. I haven't really found anything worth the time or money yet.
College Freshman,1,"Since Wichita State isn't in the best neighborhood, it does not have very much nigh life on campus. There is an attempt at ""nightlife"" by a campus organization but the events are not very good and usually end before ten. Some students go to frat and sorority houses, but mainly that's just a drinking scene."
College Sophomore,1,"No Car - No Way – There are virtually no options for transportation to, from, or within the campus. Public transportation in the city of Wichita is scarce at its best. If a student does not have a car, they basically have no way to go anywhere."

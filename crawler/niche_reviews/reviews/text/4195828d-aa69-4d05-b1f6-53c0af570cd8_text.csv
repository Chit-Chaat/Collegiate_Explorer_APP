Sophomore,5,"This college has made me feel so at home. I am a part of the softball program. This school makes it feel like a home away from home, while receiving an amazing education through God. I fell in love when I first walked the campus, and I fell even more in love when I started classes."
Sophomore,5,"Due to Coronavirus, we had to move to online classes for the Spring semester of 2020. All the professors were very lienant when it came down to the fact that this was new to most of us and that we were all very stressed and still figuring things out. My professors even told me they missed seeing me in class, which makes me know that I am so much more than just another student to them."
Sophomore,5,"Geneva College is not like most four-year colleges - it has a small campus, a ""no alcholic party"" atmostphere, amazing professors, important life values, and a relgioius center. For finishing my first year, I love Geneva and everything it has to offer. The small campus is beautful and cozy, enabling a good student-to-teacher ratio, the professors are passionate about what they teach and strived to make sure each student understands the content, and a Christian worldview occupies each course and the lifestyle of the college. Though Geneva is strict on certain policies, the students and faculty know how to have a safe, good time while being smart and responsible.  Education is of the upmost importance, and so hard work often pays off here. I look forward to what the rest of my college years have in store."
Senior,5,"I love Geneva College. I love the Christian atmosphere and how all the professors are so caring. They actually care about how you do in classes not just bc of a reputation or anything, but because they care for you. It’s an environment that is so friendly and opening. The classes are amazing and you learn so much from your time there."
Freshman,5,"I rate my school as being 10/10. It's a great school that boasts of fantastic connections with other students. There's always something to do or ways to get involved. From music tours that leave the US to helping the impoverished in the area, Geneva is a great choice if you want to diversify your college experiences. The atmosphere of the school is far from partying; being an older school (founded in the 1800's), there are plenty of nooks and crannies to cozy up in and get some studying done."
Alum,5,"Geneva College is an intimate small Christian college in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. It a place where the professors truly get to know you as a student on a first name basis. At its core the educators look for ways to unlock every students' hidden potential while educating the students with a Christian worldview lens. They effectively show how the Christian faith can be incorporated into every professional career.  I loved getting to be involved in the campus life while I was a student at the college.  I served as a Student Activities Coordinator and got to effectively run and develop campus wide activities. The college offers many other ways for students to get plugged in whether by participating in intermural sports, marching band, theater, or student leadership."
Niche User,5,Geneva is where a lot of friends and family ended up going. Its beautiful and enforces everything you're taught in the bible. Everyone there is kind and willing to help anyone.
Junior,5,"Excellent school with teachers who invest in their students in a personal and professional way. There are plenty of ways to get involved, through clubs and sports and intramurals."
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed all the courses I have taken so far at Geneva College. I have found all the staff very supportive and helpful.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so welcoming and the campus is beautiful, overall an amazing atmosphere! Professors are very nice and helpful. Class size is just right and I can always get help or have any questions answered by my professors. I had been looking for a college that provided a great atmosphere with people who believed the same things I did, and I found that. The weather is way better than where I am from. My teams are so nice and I love training and running with all of them."
Niche User,5,"Christian centered, great professors and staff.  Great small college campus.  Able to speak to professors in a friendly manner."
Freshman,5,"Geneva is a beautiful school with very kind, helpful, and caring staff. They are very intentional with contacting you and informing you of different things going on there."
Niche User,5,it was a great environment to be in and have great sports and students. i felt really at home when i visited
Freshman,5,"Apply was easy, I attended the open house where they helped me apply with no fee (which is helpful).  Ever since coming to live on campus everyone is so nice and helpful. The campus is small making it easy to get around for classes, no need to worry about if you will make it on time to your next class."
Graduate Student,5,This college provides online courses that are easy to access and easy to navigate. It is self paced and is user friendly. There are no due dates as long as the entire course is finished within a year. Instructors are also very helpful and respond quickly.
Sophomore,5,"In addition to the strong academic programs offered and the qualifications of the professors, I love the atmosphere Geneva has. You are not a number. The faculty and other students all care immensely about their work and each other. Even though we are a smaller school, it means you get to know everyone personally and build strong connections right away. I just love my Geneva family and I know I am being prepared well for Grad school."
Junior,5,"I have loved my time at Geneva College! The professors are wonderful and truly care about their students. The overall atmosphere on campus is comfortable and academic, but still fun. The academics are rigorous. You get your money's worth at Geneva!"
Freshman,5,Geneva College is a great place. Everyone is very welcoming and treats you respectfully like a real person not just another number.
Freshman,5,"I love Geneva.  It has provided a safe environment to study any major or participate in any sport, club, or activity while growing in God's love.  Highly recommended."
Freshman,5,"I just started as a Freshman at Geneva College and I couldn't be happier.  They teach not only academics but also bible classes.  The teachers, students and environment are all welcoming."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love this college...the close community, personal & caring professors, and the atmosphere of the campus life. It is an amazing place to continue an education (specifically one that is faith-based) and a place to receive the encouragement you need as a college student."
Alum,5,"I loved the small classes and one on one attention from professors. The campus is small, but so beautiful. Geneva prides itself on incorporating the Christian faith into all aspects of its organization. Geneva has a variety of sports teams and allow students to balance sports and education. Reasonably priced."
Junior,5,"Geneva College is a small Christian liberal arts college whose focus is on preparing students to go into the workforce with a Christian worldview and a solid theology. Geneva has certainly done that for me, and I am very thankful for the professors who are quite unique in their love for their students and their Creator. It is a great place to be!"
Freshman,5,"Super great school. Professors are personal and very willing to work along side students. Food is pretty good. The XC team is the best!!! Safe campus. When you get there find the HoodRats, they're a hype group of people who do some pretty crazy stuff!"
Junior,5,"I love being at Geneva. The community of the college is strong. The school works really hard to get you connected not only to other students but also faculty and staff as well as the community. The professors are wonderful and truly care about their students, wanting me to succeed, sometimes more than even I do."
College Sophomore,5,It's great and I couldn't imagine myself at any other school
College Sophomore,5,"Almost all of the professors are very personable and friendly. They genuinely care about each student, both academically and personally. There is a nice selection of possible classes. It is fairly easy to register for most classes, except a few of the core classes and classes taught by certain preferred professors. The work load is sometimes overwhelming, but it pushes students to learn how to manage their time well. There are a few on campus study areas, as well as places off-campus."
College Freshman,5,"I do not have much experience dealing with the alumni network, but I often hear of different events that they hold and take interest in in campus. There are many different opportunities to attend job fairs, which enables students to look for prospective jobs and internships in school, as well as after graduation. The career centers and services are said to be extremely beneficial and helpful. Receiving a degree from Geneva can assist in the future, as the college does the best it can to prepare students for any future possibilities."
College Freshman,5,"Many of the courses require hard work. Good grades are not extremely difficult to get, as long as you are willing to put the effort into striving for them. The majority of the professors truly care about you as a person, not just as another student. They are willing to help you in any way you need. They often are friendly and welcoming outside of the classroom. While there are a few more popular majors, Geneva tends to have a wide range of options for whatever a student may want to study. There are a even opportunities for students to create independent majors. The size of the classes for general studies are larger, since everyone on campus is required to take them. For most majors, once you get into your major classes, the class size starts to decrease."
College Freshman,5,"This school is truly a place where I feel that I belong. The community that occurs on campus, and with the surrounding neighborhood, is truly welcoming and inspirational. I cannot imagine being any other place."
College Junior,5,There are always security officers on campus.  There are also multiple places on campus to press for help.
College Junior,5,It is a big campus but the classes make it feel like a small school.  The teachers are caring and helpful.
College Junior,5,There is lots of school spirit and always someone on the football fields practicing
College Freshman,5,"There is no crime at Geneva. Safety is good and there is always security circulating our campus 24/7. Dorms are always locked. You need a Geneva ID to get into the building. Sexual assault is not a problem whatsoever on our campus and we are extremely well informed about sexual assault, how to prevent it, and how to deal with it."
College Freshman,5,"So far, my first semester has truly surprised me. I am so happy with my decision and I want to go to classes each day. I no longer dread going to classes, unlike high school. I enjoy talking to new people each day. The community is great. You can walk in to Alex's, the Brig, the library, or Skye and know that you can easily approach someone you've been meaning to talk with or get to know more. That's what I love most about Geneva: the welcoming community. I can already tell that I will leave Geneva with many deep and loving relationships."
College Freshman,5,"Geneva's community is so welcoming. There are a lot of extracurricular activities and student engagement opportunities to keep you busy. There are plenty of on-campus jobs, sports, and your coursework will always give you enough to do. There are also immense community service opportunities! Everyone is so warm, loving, and passionate about their faith in Christ, others, and their studies."
College Sophomore,5,Being in the engineering program at Geneva it is a very rigorous regimen but it has 100% job placement rating in the last 10 years and many students have internships that actually mean something around their sophomore year which is incredible to me.
College Freshman,5,"The academics at Geneva are amazing. The professors care about individual student success, the courses are challenging and push students to work hard in order to accel in class. The acedemic programs are some of the best in the area especially in engineering."
College Freshman,5,The campus nurse is in five days a week and does an excellent job with students. Residence directors are also extremely helpful in cases of health and safety and campus offers a wide rang of support groups for students who have been sexually assaulted or have health issues.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are small and the professors know you by name. They teach the information well and care about the success of each student. Each professor that I have had thus far is always available to provide extra help outside of class. Geneva offers a wide variety of courses that count as electives for each major so that you can get personal with the degree that you want and can choose classes according to potential job fields.
College Senior,5,My professors are dedicated to giving all a worthwhile education.
College Senior,5,I love this school because of it's true sense of community and commitment to giving its students a Christ-centered education. There is no school I would rather have spent the last four years of my life.
College Senior,5,"I love Geneva because of the community. The faculty, staff, and students all make Geneva the college that it is. I have grown in my faith and my education because of passionate, knowledgable professors who care about me. My fellow peers have also made these 4 years some of the best of my life."
College Freshman,5,"I think—and so do many others—that the best quailty about Geneva College is its strong faculty. The great care with which the professors approach their academic discplines and invest in the lives of their students is something that came as an incredibly pleasant surprise to me. Most of the professors that I had for this semester have an attentiveness toward their students, much like the attentiveness that coaches have when they observe their players carefully and train them to bring out the best qualities in each individual player. This was extremely helpful in building my academic confidence.

Geneva College also offers an excellent set of core courses (though I know some students would tend to disagree), the greatest of which is Humanities 103, a class about life. There are people who decry the impracticality of this course, but those who have taken it and have been changed by it know how powerful and far-reaching its effects are in individual and community life. This, to me, is liberal arts education at its best.

I was also surprised by how much fun I had here with my friends. Despite the academic rigor, we are advised by other students and faculty alike that we need to invest our time in the people around us. It's good advice. Whether it's just goofing off, singing together, or discussing serious subjects, these have been amazing times that I would love to relive. Perhaps one of the most notable things I've done this semester is making a short film with a number of my friends. On the day of the showing, we dressed up and rode in limousines to a nearby highschool, where all the films were shown and the awards were presented. That was really fun.

I would choose Geneva College again if I were given the choice. This is a place that sees you not just as a potential professional, but as a person. Among all the institutions of higher education today, I daresay that this is a very rare quality."
College Junior,5,"I'm not much of a sport person, but I do enjoy going to games with friends who are excited about them."
College Junior,5,"For college food, I think Geneva's is pretty good."
College Junior,5,"I have visited a lot of different colleges, but there was something special about Geneva. The campus is small so it's almost like a family relationship with professors. The people are genuine and I find myself enjoying a lot of student lead activities. The classes are well taught and God is involved in every class."
College Sophomore,5,"The strictness of school policies is just right. They are very strict in the areas they need to be and lenient in the areas that do not matter as much. Because it is a drug and alcohol free school, they are very strict about drinking/using whether you are of age or not. This not only keeps students safe, but it promotes good behavior and excellence in academics."
College Junior,5,"The best part of Geneva is the people.  Whether you are talking about the faculty, the staff, the administration, or the students, the atmosphere at Geneva is one of community.  Every professor I have had was knowledgeable in their area, wanted students to learn and grow, and understanding and willing to work with each students' unique situation."
College Freshman,5,"The surrounding towns offer lots of things like pottery classes, highschool dram productions, sporting events and local markets. The people are friendly as well. Pittsburgh is about 45 minutes away if you like big cities, but the immediate surrounding area is small, so it depends on your preference."
College Freshman,5,"The only issues I have found are the basic ones that come up any time 150 people try to live together for the first time and start the process of learning to respect each other and each other's space. The RAs on campus are fantastic about intentionally helping out, and some of the closest friends you meet will be on your hall. The matresses are comfortable, and the space is as adequate as you could expect a dorm to be. There are also ample bathrooms on each floor, and crowded morning bathrooms are never an issue."
College Senior,5,"Again, what you should expect from a conservative Christian college."
College Senior,5,It is a conservative Christian school. Most people are assumed to be Christians if they are coming to Geneva.
College Senior,5,Christian School with severe penalties for students that partake.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my major, and love the professors.  They are great at preparing you for grad school and helping you apply"
College Sophomore,5,Families on College hill host college students for relatively cheap!
College Sophomore,5,"A few options, but Applebees is always open late and is the typical off campus spot to eat."
College Sophomore,5,"Great Coaches, and Great school spirit.  We cheer on all the teams and many people participate in IM!"
College Sophomore,5,"Totally accepting, we reach out in love to minorities, but do hold convictions that some lifestyles are sinful."
College Sophomore,5,"Straight forward, many scholarships offered"
Alum,4,The individual programs and professors were incredible and passionate. The college as a whole entity is lacking. The College seems disingenuous and fake. There are a lot of rules without the feeling of anyone caring behind the rules. There seemed to be a massive disconnect between faculty/staff and the “higher ups.” There just seems to be a lot of tension and lack of trust with the College.
Sophomore,4,"The transitioning from in-class to online learning was definitely an adjustment. Deciding to switch on such short notice, Geneva did do a very good job at keeping everything in order and instructing the professors on how to go about it. Many classes  did need to be taught in the classroom, but we did manage  just fine online."
Senior,4,Geneva College has been significant to my story as a student and as a human being. I have built relationships that will last a lifetime and have found family when I had none. Geneva has done so much to shape my worldview in a positive way. My professors have encouraged me and supported me in every way possible. This was by far the best experience of my life. I wish there was more diversity on our campus!
Niche User,4,"Great education, excellent relationship opportunity with professors and student life is wonderful. I would suggest offering more classes in the health care field."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed professors who cared intently about learning and grasping materials, in a Christian context as well."
Freshman,4,THE COLLEGE IS VERY NICE THE PEOPLE ARE NICE AND VERY HELPFUL THE AREA IS SAFE AND BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN
Sophomore,4,"Geneva is a small college equipped with professors who genuinely care, high academic standards, local community engagement, and a plethora of student activities. I'd recommend this school for anyone who enjoys tight communities and wants to succeed in many areas of life."
Sophomore,4,I started attending Geneva College in the Fall of 2017. I love the Christian integrated learning and the people I'm surrounded with. This school is perfect for someone looking for a small Christian college and a quality education.
Freshman,4,"Geneva College is  great school. Although it may be great, it does have a fair share of problems. Unfortunately you may end up spending extra money on books when certain professors make you buy their syllabus for money(BIB 111). As well as for engineering majors with EGR L&T. Some classes are better than others admittedly. I personally did not have a great experience with one of my prerequisites (CHM 111). Other than that, I believe Geneva is great!"
Sophomore,4,The Athletic Department needs work but the academics and professors whom i have had so far are great and really care about their students.
Niche User,4,"Geneva College in Beaver Falls which is a unique Christian College. I had a great experience visiting Geneva College. The football coaches, faculty, and students are very friendly and really do care about each and every kid. It is a great atmosphere being closer to God, but everyone does not have to be a practicing christian. The electrical engineering program is great, and is close to almost a 100% job placement rate. The football team is on the come up, but has their philosophy down to be a physical smash mouth football team. Overall, Geneva would be a great place to go to school for 4 years."
Sophomore,4,"It is a wonderful environment! Great Professors and Staff, all extremely helpful! Geneva becomes a home away from home and is a phenomenal place to get one's education."
Junior,4,"Geneva College is quirky, but with a kind of dignity that comes from 150+ years of being a small Christian liberal arts school affiliated with the oldest Presbyterian denomination in America.

I would say that our faculty members pursue (and achieve) excellence both in the arts and the sciences, and seek to integrate the two.

Faith is a big part of being at Geneva College. Here we provide many answers—thousands of years' worth of answers, from the Scriptures to the church fathers to the Reformers to the Puritans and to modern apologists. But we are also not afraid to ask questions, even questions that linger, out of a desire to find the relevance of our faith to every area of life and learning. This tension between a strong tradition and contemporary problems allow for a lot of growth, spiritually and academically."
Junior,4,"Geneva College is a wonderful small college that really allows student to professor interaction and hands on learning that is not available everywhere else. Also, because it is a liberal arts school it really does its best to cut out the useless classes offered elsewhere and give you classes that will help facilitate learning in more than just one's major. I would like to see more campus events offered to the students, ones that students are actually interested in and want to be active with. But overall I believe this to be a very good college and an excellent choice for future students looking for a solid Christian College."
Freshman,4,"Geneva College is a Christ centered education focused on community, engaging, and achieving higher standards of life. The challenging academics provoke thinking, the professors promote studying and will pray for their students, and the campus provides four seasons of beauty. It is a home away from home with countless ways to connect and infectious friendliness from students and faculty alike."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great small school, where people want to learn and there's not a lot of panic around studies. This is a great college to go to if you went to a small school or you lived in a small town. There are more people than what I was accustomed to, but I liked the ease into people and getting me into real life situations. Since this is a small school, the class sizes are also small. I love the small classes and the professors are more than willing to talk to you if you go to their office. The professors help in any way they can and they truly care about their students.  The college is located in a smaller town with not much to do right in the town but close by. Pittsburgh is less than an hour away and very convenient for a night out, also Grove City Outlets is just a half hour drive away. Lots of opportunities to shop and hang out with friends. "
College Sophomore,4,The quality of the courses is pretty great. The professors vary but most truly care for you just as much as a person than a student. The class size is wonderful as the most I have had in a non lecture class is around 40. I feel like Geneva provides a very focused atmosphere for its students.
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni are very prevalent at Geneva College. There are multiple alumni events happening year round. There are career fairs that sometimes come to campus or the school sends announcements about them that are in nearby areas. There is a career development center that is very helpful in anything regarding your career, internships, resumes, etc."
College Sophomore,4,I honestly have never felt unsafe at this school. Campus security is always around and has a number you can call at any time and they will show up almost immediately.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the community that Geneva College holds. It is very inviting and unlike any other school. The professors truly care about both you as a student and a person as well. I would strongly reccommend this school to anyone who really values relationships between the professor and the students, wanting the best for you."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great and really care about everyone, inside and outside of the classroom. The class sizes are perfect and allow you to know people personally."
College Sophomore,4,This school is giving me the best opportunity for my future. It's providing me with the best education to get into a grad school and be great in my future career.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't ever heard of anything going wrong on campus or anyone being in harm.
College Senior,4,"I have meet some of my best friends at this school. The professors provide us with assignments that we would be expected to fill out in the field. I would definitely choose this school again if I could do it all over because there is no partying, no drinking, and no smoking allowed on campus. The students and staff are generally friendly and considerate of others."
College Senior,4,Professors are friendly and genuinely care about their students. The majority of courses are excellent. There is a variety in the humanities courses. There is not a variety in language or technology. Most styles are lecture based. The class sizes typically don't go above 20 students.
College Senior,4,"The career center is excellent; helping with internships, resumes, and advice. There is a strong network connected to Pittsburgh. There are employers, mostly of religious organizations, that are available various days in the brig. There is a summer camp fair looking for student workers."
College Senior,4,Geneva has a variety of favorite annual student events. The community at Geneva is excellent. If you reach out and get involved you can find lots of support and make lots of good connections that you can carry with you for the rest of your life. Professors and staff genuinely care about their students and there success.
College Freshman,4,"That I have heard of, there are not very many crimes that occur on campus. Students frequently feel comfortable leaving their things alone for a period of time while they go to the bathroom, or even if they go grab something to eat. Security vehicles are often present somewhere on campus during the day. Many new security cameras have recently been installed, moving to make the campus more aware of what is going on. I feel completely safe walking across campus by myself during most hours of the day. Geneva works closely with the police and fire departments to ensure a safe and welcoming environment."
College Freshman,4,"Where I lived this year, I was able to quickly and easily become close to many of the other girls that lived on my floor. We have each other to spend time with and to keep each other accountable."
College Junior,4,I have not had an internship but I have one coming up this year.
College Junior,4,Professors go the extra mile with all of the classes I have completed so far.  There are always positive and on time for our class.  They value our input and our opinions as well.
College Junior,4,The rooms are spacious and just like living in an apartment.
College Freshman,4,"Although it can get very stressful and is very different from High School curriculum, the work that the professors make us do is very helpful. They push us to do the best that we can so that we are better prepared for the future. They also incorporate faith into the academics which is phenomenal."
College Freshman,4,We all are very accepting of one another. There is not as much judging on campus as there was in High School. People are very loving and willing to accept all they encounter with some acceptations.
College Freshman,4,Personally I have not seen any alcohol use on our campus. That is because if you are caught with it you are kicked out of the school. Therefore if someone was to do drugs or alcohol then they go off campus.
College Freshman,4,"Our school has a low sexual assault rate, but it still has happened. There are points where I do feel uncomfortable, but most of the time I feel safe walking across campus by myself because we have emergency buttons all over and have security going around all the time. Also going with a group of friends makes it not as easy for something bad to happen."
College Freshman,4,This school prepares you the best of their ability to prepare you for a future career. Our school is very adamant about student success and are there to help you in your future. They want to make sure that once you get out of school that you have a job. Our school has a high job rate.
College Freshman,4,"I come from a small school so the smaller school campus is very comforting. The teachers are very intelligent and are very open to help their students. Each professor has their own unique was in which they teach and makes classes interesting, and want to make you learn more."
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love the girls on my floor and am so blessed by them. We are all unique in our own way, but live together so well. The rooms that we live in is okay, but it is not about the building it is about the people. Community is key when living together and we have an amazing flourishing community."
College Freshman,4,"I am actually part of the Cross Country team and I am very thankful that I chose to join the team. They are like a second family to me and also we are using running to Glorify God. With being part of Cross Country, it is not as big as Football or Soccer, but we are still part of the school and represent the school well."
College Freshman,4,"I am very thankful that God lead me to the school I am going to. If I had not have god to this school my faith would not be where it is right now, I am academically flourishing, meeting so many new people, have has so many unique opportunities, and love the environment I am involved in."
College Junior,4,"I love the academics and the courses that are offered at Geneva. I also love that they are challenging and they make me work for good grades, that way I feel more accomplished upon finishing."
College Junior,4,"The education that I am receiving is wonderful and one of the only reasons I chose to stay at Geneva the past 2.5 years. My professors are all very personable and involved, they also always know what exactly they're teaching on. The courses offered here have been very beneficial towards what I plan on doing in the future. The class sizes are various, from anywhere between 120 and 5, and I can honestly say I have enjoyed both classroom settings."
College Junior,4,"I have never once heard of someone getting denied a job because of the fact that they graduated from Geneva. In fact, whenever I tell people that I am attending Geneva, their general response tends to be that they are impressed. I find a lot of value in the fact that I will be graduating from a school that offers a noteworthy education."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't really looked into job/internship prospects yet, but the college brings in many organizations almost every week that will be at an information table in the Brig. That's really neat. I plan to go to Career Development more this semester for a summer internship. I've heard great things about internship and job placement for all students and upperclassmen."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms give you a sufficient space to work with in Clarke Hall. I really like it. There's a kitchenette on the first floor, so you honestly don't need to bring a fridge or microwave if you don't want to. There are two sets of bathrooms, which is nice, but there are only 2 showers and 2 toilets per bathroom. There are lots of sinks, though! Clarke is right next to the library and Alex's which is wonderful! It's close to everything else on campus, too."
College Sophomore,4,There is extremely little crime on campus. There has never been a time when I have not felt safe on campus. The security officers are responsible and friendly.
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of alumni in great positions across the globe.
College Sophomore,4,"Courses are challenging without causing a breakdown in most cases. Professors are almost always willing and eager to help you succeed. There are not as many courses offered as at a state school, but there is still a good variety. Class sizes are normally fairly small which helps students to learn better and to be more involved in discussions."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is kept clean, is very close to classes, and the RAs are very friendly without invading your space."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school because it's a smaller school. You are easily able to recognize people in your classes, the professors know you by name, and classes are never a far walk."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great here, and they provide a challenging curriculum but not impossible for students to manage. Workload does add up especially for the engineering majors as many semesters they are taking 18 or more credits. There are a few study areas that are generally very quiet and workable in."
College Sophomore,4,"Safety on campus is great, its a very friendly campus to go to and security there always makes sure that certain doors are locked after hours and they do are great job of walking through the dorms just to stop and check on things every once in a while and take time to actually talk with students and get their thoughts."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at Geneva are amazing! The coaches are amazing and being an athlete myself I feel that I can say that because the coaches here really do care for you as a person and not just a player. The students that aren't on any teams do a great job of supporting the athletic events and generally our sports teams are very good and competing for the division title is expected out of our sports.
College Sophomore,4,"Geneva is a different sort of college and one you have to visit to understand, it provides a great small town feel to it, but you can still go and do fun things off campus that are not too far away. You get out what you put into it for sure and that is definitely true for Geneva, if you are willing to put a little effort in and make in fun, it really is a great place to go to."
College Freshman,4,The student development office does a great job with helping students prepare for interviews and putting together resumes as well as helping students to find jobs off campus. There are recruiters on campus at least every other week with job opertunities and internships.
College Freshman,4,"We have some great athletic teams that are very competitive and compete for conference titles as well as being invited to the regional tournament. The sports teams are supported very well within the community and on campus due to the small, close feeling that campus has."
College Freshman,4,I love my school although there aren't much things to do around campus on weekends unless you have a car. Geneva offers many activity opertunities for students although sometimes the times that they are offered are not well suited for busy schedules. The education is personal and the professors do everything they can to help you understand the material.
College Senior,4,Security is usually around when you need them.
College Senior,4,I have learned so much from the professors in my major. My education has definitely prepared me for life as a teacher.
Freshman,2,"I am enjoying my experience because of the bonds i have made but the college itself is lack luster and there are mice in the dorm buildings. There are positives tho the professors are some of the best I have ever seen. they work with you on a super individual basis and the personal ties you can make really boost the entire school experience. the college is reformed Presbyterian and  follows closly, students cant dance nor can we drink, also we aren't allowed in opposite gender rooms after 1 on Fridays and Saturdays  very concerned about sex. people here are weird unless you find your own little friend group. very inexpensive for a near ivy league college and is very gracious with school given aid. they are invested in you  as a person and student and all in all an average university"
Junior,2,"This has probably been the worst college experience a student can have. I was harassed by another student and after going to the right people who are paid to protect me, they did nothing. Many students treat this school just like it's high school. Please save yourself and do not even think about this school.  For this school being a Christian Liberal Arts School, it isn't Christian by any means."
Freshman,2,"I decided to transfer out of Geneva College because I felt as though I was deceived. I went in with a certain major in mind and I was swayed to believe that they offered all of the classes that I wanted, which was not the case at all. The program that I was in was barely even a program, and I was offered only one ""major"" specific classes. I decided to leave the school for that reason, and honestly I did not enjoy the professors, nor the staff. None had been very helpful, and I frankly felt like just a number. If I wanted to feel like just a number I would have selected another school"
College Senior,2,"There are so many events on campus that sports often get overlooked, except for football on Saturdays in the fall. Our sports teams are not very good in general. Every once in a while, some teams will have an outstanding year. A club called Superfans once existed but has recently died out. The athletes get an entire building they can utilize, but even that is not that great. The fitness center supplies the rest of the student body and has just about everything you could want in a gym but it's still small. You don't want to go there during busy hours."
College Junior,2,"Parties don't take place usually and if they do they are low key. Geneva is really strict. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they used surveys like this to try to bust people. Sometimes it feels like Geneva lives for getting people in trouble. Res Life is very corrupt in my opinion and they tend to be jerks."
College Junior,2,"Whereas the minority groups are accepted and included, there are not very many of them. Because of this, I believe a lot of our students remain ""in the dark"" about the racial and issues of diversity in America today."
College Junior,2,"I feel as though the campus housing is outdated, for example, my apartment last year had mold in it and also little critters because it was in the basement. The social atmosphere in the apartments is also absent in comparison to the social atmosphere in clarke, the freshman girls dorm, where you're constantly in contact with somebody other than your own personal roommate."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some parties on the weekends if you know the right (or wrong) people. However, it is not a huge problem on campus. If people want to drink, many will go off campus to do so."
College Freshman,2,Most students live on campus. The only option of off campus that I know of is City House.
College Junior,2,there should be more options
College Junior,2,Technology here is decent but the network connection for wifi is basically non-existent.
College Junior,2,You have to have a pass to park on campus at all. Lots of the side roads and streets prohibit parking at all or past midnight. The roadsides are always packed up.
College Junior,2,There is not very much diversity.
College Sophomore,2,"There could be a better push towards fitness and health. There are a handful of attractive girls, but they become stuck up because they know there are the few."
College Sophomore,2,They need more convenient parking lots.
College Sophomore,2,The WiFi is atrocious here.
College Freshman,2,"There are only two choices that are considered ""Off campus"" housing. Both buildings are very small and hard to get into. It almost seems like I need to fight for a spot to get into one of the buildings."
College Sophomore,2,my only complaint is that the network is very inconsistent. 
College Senior,2,Food here isn't the greatest.  I don't know too many college students who rave about campus food.  It gets old to quick and the quality isn't top notch.  You do have the option to use your flex points at the Brigg at for local pizza shop but other than that if you could arrange to make your own food your better off.  Of course students don't mind cafeteria food.  If you come from a place where you are eating organic food and stick to a healthier form of eating you won't find it in the cafeteria here.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Geneva College is a christian campus. The typical nightlife hardly exists, however if you like to party there are people who sneak around and I am sure you can find them."
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene at Geneva College is not very big. This does not mean that there isn't people who do drugs but the percentage of seing someone doing drugs is very low.
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much to around Beaver Falls (the city Geneva College is located). If we want to do anything that is fun, we must drive atleast 20 minutes to do much of anything."
College Sophomore,2,There are open hours some nights when people can hang out in the opposite gender's dorms. But the hours only go til midnight or so. After that there's nowhere to hang out and nothing to do. The lounges aren't even open.
College Senior,2,"bars are really your only option, so if you're not 21, you're stuck in your room all night. parties may happen off campus, but not on campus (at least not real parties anyways)"
College Senior,2,only seniors are able to apply for off-campus housing.
College Junior,2,"Although their are a variety of Athletics available on campus, I feel as though they suffer severely due to the inability to give scholarships.  Fan support from the community has diminished due to this factor and school spirit may also begin to suffer.  Team performance has been affected greatly by this budget cut and i believe that the athletic facilities in most schools are the number one attraction for student involvement."
College Junior,2,Need of change and TV situation= terrible and Rez life is the worst department on campus by far.
College Junior,2,Rainy Damp Dark – Not a lot of outdoor time besides the first two weeks here and the last two weeks here.
College Junior,2,"Mostly White – The majority of the students are white. There is a Black Students club, and the campus has many events to support diversity. Most of the students are Christians, as this is a Christian college. Most students are from middle class homes."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a a Lot of Options Unless You Are Married – Geneva does not allow students to live off campus without a parent or a spouse until you are 21, but thee are a lot of apartments around the college and there are houses available to students to rent"
College Sophomore,2,"some of the rooms are very small especially for freshman, but there are new apartments on campus for upperclassmen"
College Freshman,2,"There's no diversity at Geneva! This isn't because it's not allowed, the staff is careful to make it obvious that they'd love different ethnicities to attend. But there's just not really anyone other than white kids here"
College Sophomore,2,"Most people have their own computers, but if you're on campus and you forgot to print something, your best bet is to go to one of the computer labs in Northwood or Science & Engineering. There is WiFi access all over campus and only in a few areas of the library (Reading Room, Reference Center, and group project area downstairs), but there is no WiFi in the desks of the main book stacks."
College Junior,2,"Geneva provides no transportation for it's students. Being a small Christian college, there is pretty much no need. There is Beaver County transit that will take you downtown for cheap, the ride takes forever. You are better off carpooling and finding rides for all your transportation needs"
College Sophomore,2,No Off Campus Living Until Senior Year. You are not allowed to live off campus until you are a senior. But Geneva does have an apartment building that is a popular choice instead of the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"Alright but It Gets Old – I am not too picky of an eater, but there comes a point when leftovers should not be left over to another day. Geneva's dining hall has good days and bad days. When they make fresh good food, it is amazing. But when they re-use food from previous days, (especially on weekends) it can go from bad to disgusting really fast."
College Freshman,2,"What Do You Want to Do? What do you want to do?  Is often a question that is asked and the response is often, ""It's Geneva; there is nothing to do.""  Which is true in some senses and not in others.  I feel like when the college puts on events it's good, but truly there is nothing to do.  This is due to me having mostly opposite sex friends so I can not hang out with them a lot.  Also that all buildings close at 12 even on the weekends so this is nothing to do.  I always hear, ""Make your own fun,"" but when there is no place to go to other then the movies or out to eat its hard to. And in all honesty you can't go to the club or anything unless you are 21 so that cuts out half of the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Sub Par – The food at Geneva isn't anything special. There are two places to eat, the main cafeteria and then the Brig. The Brig has the same foods everyday, no variety. The main cafeteria isn't much better. You'll find yourself getting sick of what you eat relatively quickly here."
College Sophomore,2,Dining Off Campus – The dining off campus is not as good as it should be. The best places to eat are 20 minutes away and the not so bad places are 10-15 minutes away. We only get student discounts at one pizza parlor. SO the cost for off campus dining is pretty high.
College Junior,2,"Not Much to Do – There isn't anything to do on campus at night, especially weekends unless you want to play sports or longboard with your friends."
Niche User,1,There weren’t any classes I needed that were available online. The online classes that I could have taken were ridiculously overpriced and I would have taken them somewhere else if I needed to.
Niche User,1,"The school was more like a cult than a religious school. Used their religious teachings to control everyone. The students acted like immature high schoolers and were just socially weird. The classes that actually mattered for your major, unlike the humanities and bible classes, were decent, but the unnecessary classes just caused pointless stress. That hell hole was not worth the money. Most of the students have that children of the corn vibe. A party school is not what makes a school worth going to, but this school truly had nothing interesting to do outside of class other than shove their beliefs down your throat and ostracizing you if you don’t conform to them."
Sophomore,1,"Do not come here!! Total rip off for your money! Can't even call this place a college. They try their best to make their classes hard so you lose your scholarship. I asked for a tutor for my hard classes and they gave me a student taking the class with me as a tutor because my professor failed to ask any previous student who took the class to be a tutor and after 7 session they charge you $15hr for this service. The dorms fail to have A/C or heat and I tried to have my heater repaired and the guy who came to fix it smelled like piss and couldn't repair it. These rooms are over $10k a year and they have bugs and mice in them. When I brought these up to the administration all they could say is ""why did you come here?"" like its your fault not theirs. Also the meal plan is a joke. There's nowhere open after 8 to get food and the dining hall is open in increments through the day. Keep in mind this is an extra $2300 a semester that you are forced to spend."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have any Greek life on campus, so if that's what you're looking for, then we're the worst in that category. For me, I don't want anything to do with Greek Life, so that's great for me!"
College Freshman,1,"There is not Greek life at Geneva, so it's impossible to rate it."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate how strict it is here. Visitation Hours, No alcohol on campus even if you're 21, professors deduct a percentage after you miss about three classes."
College Sophomore,1,Talk to your friends if you need a ride to something outside of walking distance.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is very little around Geneva for students to do. Beaver Falls is a run down town that has no hangouts for fun places for college students.
College Senior,1,"honestly, i would do away with most of the athletics at geneva college. Most teams consistently have a losing record, most players dont add to much of anything outside their sport. school spirit is whatever. just do us all a favor and put the money to a better use other than a sorry excuse for a sports program."
College Junior,1,"The atmosphere of the town that surrounds the campus is very alarming and seems to be going down hill.  I personally feel unsafe as i walk across the street to the apartments or down the street to the local gas station.  Student Activities tries to coordinate cultural event, intramurals, and other activities however they are not very attractive activities for college students. There is not much shopping or excitement available in the surrounding community."
College Freshman,1,"Geneva is very strict about stuff.  Some things are understandable like underage drinking or drug use, but to get fined for swearing is a bit extreme. Also there are silly rules like no laundry on sundays, and there are strict dorm rules about visitors of the opposite sex."
College Junior,1,"Geneva College wants to care about the students that attend college there by strictly enforcing rules that are a little ridiculous. It's impossible to live off campus unless you completely lie about it, and even then, they can find out. Drinking is strictly prohibited, and you will get in a ton of trouble even the first time you are caught drinking. The dorms are also very strict. When the opposite sex is over, which can only happen on Wednesdays and the weekends, the door needs to stay open, all lights need to stay on, no blanket covering both students, and no PDA. Oh, and if you live in an ""apartment"" dorm, opposite sex guests are only allowed in the living room and kitchen. I do think that they are now allowed to use the bathroom, too, which is helpful. Geneva has good intentions, they just don't always go about it the correct way."
College Sophomore,1,"Parties Are Off-Campus – If you're the party type, you have to be friends with the right people. If it happens on campus, it's kept EXTREMELY hush-hush because there are huge consequences if you get caught. Most partiers that I know have friends who live off-campus, and they party there. Pittsburgh is about 40 minutes away if you really wanted to find some nightlife. Other than that, there's not much around here."
College Junior,1,"Geneva is very strict when it comes to the rules they make and enforce. Many rules seem stupid to many including open hours, no laundry on Sunday, or the lights on in the room. However, these rules fall in line with the Reformed Presbyterian views the college was founded upon. But as with any school, there are ways to get around these rules."
College Freshman,1,There aren't that many good looking girls on campus. and a lot of the people are very wierd.
College Freshman,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! It's the worst school in western PA! I would not advise attending this college. Unless you want to just study all day and have no fun or any type of a college experiene, stay away!!!!"
College Freshman,1,"Dorms are tiny, appartments are older and there aren't very many different places to live. Rules in the dorms are extremely strict."
College Sophomore,1,"Haven't Yet Seen a Beaver. Not Surprised. Because I'm relatively sure that beavers, given their lack of fiscal restraints, have already moved out of Beaver Falls. It's not as if it's horrible, but it's not ""nice"" either.  It has a few nice points, but the ""area attractions"" pretty much amount to Sheetz, a Korean restaurant (which is admittedly excellent), pizza, and a rather nice campus. The campus is definitely a winning point. Given that its near Pittsburgh, it's not hard to go out and soak up some cultural experience if you want to--the college will even facilitate a few. The town, however, is a product of the depressed steel industry, and since the 60s its population size has decreased to about a sixth of its former glory. This is evident in the shoddy storefronts and unkempt houses. If you're a girl who doesn't live on campus, you'll probably feel more secure with a guy to walk you the few blocks to your house or the Geneva apartments after twilight.  If you're a guy, this is a great chance to meet girls."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid didn't give much, but every bit counts."

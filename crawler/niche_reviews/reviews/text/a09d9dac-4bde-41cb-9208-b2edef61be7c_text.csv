Freshman,5,"With a lot going online because of COVID-19, PCC has a great online D2L website for students to easily access their courses and know when things are due. They offer a tutorial for new students to navigate the website and also offer ways to communicate with teachers and even do virtual learning. So far it is great."
Freshman,5,"I just started at Pueblo Community College this fall in the Respiratory Therapy Program. So far I have enjoyed my teachers and even with COVID-19 regulations and now having to go virtual, my teachers are still trying to help all of their students be successful so that we can become amazing Respiratory Therapists. I really have enjoyed this program so far even though it is a heavy work-load, it is just part of being in a medical program."

Freshman,5,"It is a must do. I was hesitant at first and wanted to just attend a university but through my research I have found that PCC is an amazing way to get my feet wet and save money. the classes are small, small campus size, and easy, the faculty are friendly and helpful and the other students are helpful and friendly. If you are wondering if a community college effects job opportunities, I have talked to a Vocational Rehabilitation job coach and other employers in a multitude of careers and they all have in common that they look for consistence when looking at education. So why not make the your college career easy and affordable with PCC being fourth best in value."

The environment is perfectly suited for studying and learning, the professors are very passionate and helpful, the students are all present to learn and help each other succeed, and it is a very judgement free zone.

All of my professors have helped me get through my learning issues or difficulties I've encountered along the way. Honestly, I get nervous to leave and graduate from this school because of how great they are, I am worried no other school will be quite the same or as determined to make sure I graduate and am learning everything I need to be learning. I am truly grateful for all of the faculty and staff that have helped me through tough papers, IT issues, and tutoring through my exams. I definitely recommend this school for anyone wanting to better their futures.

Freshman,5,Pueblo Community College has simplified the Admissions Process and has been very helpful in getting me on track to return to college. I was able to meet with both a Academic and Financial Adviser within a matter of minutes. The campus is small and easy to navigate. PCC has a online Portal to help new and existing students seek resources and navigate their way around campus.
Niche User,5,I have had a great experience at Pueblo Community College. The faculty is amazing because they are really there for the student and do their best to ensure that the student succeeds with their desired career path. The only thing that should change is to have more teachers in the Criminal Justice field. It feels like there are only two professors teaching Criminal Justice.
Freshman,5,"Small campus but big enough to meet new people. The staff is amazing and super friendly. The only bad thing is that they do give a lot of outside homework, more than i expected in college. Its over whelming at times but at the end of the day its my education so i cant really complain. The more home we have, the more i learn. They offer a wide selection of degrees and certificates. They are the only college in Pueblo, Colorado with a Culinary Arts program. This is my first semester going to culinary arts and I feel like this is what im going to stick to because it makes me happy."
Sophomore,5,"I take all online courses and am grateful for the option of being able to complete a degree fully online. This is also the only school in the state offering the program that I have chosen, an associates degree and certification of Library Technician. This school is ideal for busy working adults with families."
Freshman,5,This is the best community college experience I have had. Equal to university standards. The school provides excellent resources and a support system I have never seen before. The campus is safe and clean. The program list is extensive and well rounded.
Sophomore,5,Very friendly and the teachers are amazing. they work with you in all ways possible to help you understand the work.
Freshman,5,Pueblo Community College is a school that really cares about the success of its students. There's many on-campus offerings like Pueblo Joe's and the Career & Transfer Center.
Freshman,5,The nursing program is designed for success. The faculty is passionate about teaching the correct ways and so many resources for those that are struggling.
Freshman,5,All of my professors are very helpful if they see you falling behind they have no problem to talk with you about whats going on. The classes are very intimate. You have no problem meeting the entire class and getting help from one another.
Junior,5,Pueblo community college is a very friendly place with great professors and a student friendly ambient. They have great classes that are very encouraging towards students who may be unknowing of what kind of degree they wish to pursue.
Senior,5,I love being apart of a community college. The teachers really do make it a top priory of theirs to make sure you are both understanding and passing their classes.

Junior,5,I love and enjoy Pueblo Community College for its small class sizes and their wide variety of graduate programs. I highly recommend this college as it is affordable and filled with a diversity of caring and hardworking people. One thing I would like to see change is to expand some classrooms in the older buildings so students do not feel so crammed.
Works Here,5,This has been a great experience for me working at PCC Southwest. I love our team and culture at PCC and we are always looking at how to create a better product and/or service for our community. It is an affordable opportunity with many degree and certificate options for our students.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy attending PCC! I have had all amazing teachers who take the time to teach and help every student they can, and i really enjoy the learning center. they have so many resources and tutors available for students who need it. ive also been to a few of the events PCC has such as the spring fling and there are activities and food and it is a good time!"
Freshman,5,"I never had any problems at all when I went there, besides how far the student parking was from the buildings. They're a great school, with great community involvement, amazing teachers and some pretty amazing food!"
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently attending a branch of Pueblo Community College in Durango (Southwest Colorado Community College - East site). Although we only have about 15 classrooms, I feel that they have plenty of classes and wish that they could expand their location, but it's only going to get smaller. Overall, I'm glad I chose this college as my first; the staff was always great, more than helpful, and was always willing to work with you."
Sophomore,5,"I think that Pueblo Community College does an amazing job in its education. I attend as a concurrent enrollment student while finishing high school. The staff is extremely involved in the student's success, and works with them to ensure their success. Pueblo Community College offers many opportunities for their students. The class sizes are small enough for individualized attention from professors. I really enjoy attending Pueblo Community College. It will really help me succeed in my future."
Freshman,5,After being here for a year I can honestly say that I haven't had a bed experience. PCC is well organized and the staff are excellent. They are very helpfully and want to make you the best you can be. This is a great place to start college and get some classes done before transferring. They also have the early college program which has benefited me very much this past school year. They have wide variety of programs along with many degrees to choose from. If I could change something I would put the cosmetology school on campus again so it is easier to get to.
Sophomore,5,I loved the diverse students and the helpful teachers. The classroom sizes were small and  each student had a good relationship with the teachers. It is a good price and there are many different extracurricular activities that students can participate in. Each student is here for a  quality education and they are all  very friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,This college is very open and has a very optimistic attitude towards everyone. I love going to this school the way the staff helps whether you are a stranger to them or not they do everything to the best of their abilities.
Junior,5,"Pueblo Community College was an excellent choice for me. The amount of degree opportunities that PCC has to offer students appealed to me. The overall low cost is a huge factor that brought me back to school as well. The instructors have shown that they truly care about my educational goals and make every effort to help me accomplish those goals. PCC has tools that help every student's different learning style. No matter a student's age, gender, or ability, there is individualized learning and teaching. I would recommend PCC to anyone who wants a quality education, wants the most bang for their buck, and would like to make some new lifelong friendships."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy being here and the staff is very nice and always willing to help you find your class or get you emrolled.
Freshman,5,I love the variety and diversity on campus. You can see people from all walks of life. There is a variety of campus activities and plenty of options to keep yourself busy and involved.
Freshman,5,"what I like about this college is, has a great campus and amazing teachers that are willing to help even on there own time."
Alum,5,"Overall a great school that truly wants to see students succeed. However,  more funding needs to go to the Fremont campus."
Senior,5,"I like the small school feel of PCC.  Professors are generally happy to help you succeed.  It is easy to register or classes, speak with advisers, and make friends with classmates."
Sophomore,5,Pueblo Community College does not have the typical college classroom. There are only 20-25 students in classroom to make the student/professor relationships closer and easier to communicate.
Sophomore,4,I am currently completing my education online and I feel like it's going to be a great return investment. I sometimes feel like my teachers aren't very helpful and I'm expected to figure it  out for myself. Overall I am very happy and grateful to be furthering my education.
Sophomore,4,I like online learning because I can go at my own pace and complete it at any time. Because I work full time this gives me the flexibility I require to complete my education!
Junior,4,"Most of my classes have been mostly in class, but the work done online is straightforward, easy to understand, and most teachers keep their information very up to date and keep connected to their students well."
Junior,4,"They are very warm and open to talking to students to see how they can support them. The campus tries to get student involved even though it is a community college and many students have full time jobs. When it comes to classes they are for the most part small and the teacher is easy to contact and able to get one on one help. Students are very open to helping one another and the college promotes student services .If you are struggling there are several ways they make one on one help possible with other staff as well. The campus also has success coaches that are able to meet with you upon request or if your grades begin to fall. They will help you come up with a plan to help bring up your grades and will help monitor the progress. If you are struggling with issues at home that may be effecting your education they also will help students find local resources. This can range from child care, to food help as well. This college is also great for helping students plan after graduation."
Junior,4,"When online, the assignment have been very easy to complete and upload. The program that is used also allows you to have access to other students that are in the class and so you can send messages or ask questions if need be. The program also sends confirmation emails when assignments students turn assignment in that proves they were submitted."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the classes but feel the instructors  gave perrefance to the younger students and it was hard to get one on one time. then when I needed more help I feel they didn't really care if I passed or not
Niche User,4,The online courses were good but again the instructors didn't seem to help a lot.I think because of my age they didnt take me seriously
Graduate Student,4,I have only just barely began the program at PCC but so far everything is user friendly and the support Is awesome!
Freshman,4,The majority of the professors are great at helping students with tasks. My favorite professor Mandy Kuiken has always taken the time to help students understand a concept.
Freshman,4,"Pueblo Community College is a very good college. Its always has events for the student public to attend. They even host a scholarship fair for students to try and receive scholarship money. The campus is always clean. The staff for the most part seem readily available to help any student with whatever issues may arise. They have even implemented their PCC App to help optimize the organization of schedules, appointments, tasks and student email. I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to attend college after gap years or a hiatus."
Freshman,4,"Pueblo Community College is a wonderful college at a wonderful price. As someone who works part-time, I will barely just be able to afford to go, but a little extra money would really help me out. I would recommend this college for anyone who wants to major in their specific areas for an affordable price, or a great place to start out before transferring to a 4-year college."
Freshman,4,As I’m attending Pueblo Community College this fall. I’ve liked how the hallways are to busy and the teachers are pretty good about letting us out on time. I think it’s awesome how the Fremont Campus does a food pantry. Will recommend to others.
Sophomore,4,"I have been going to Pueblo Community College for the past couple years now and I have enjoyed every bit of my experience. The staff here at the school are great and very helpful. The school itself is also very welcoming with a very nice community feel to it. The diversity is quite large which excites me personally since my high school was not nearly as diverse. However the only thing I would change about my school is the way some of the marketing is done. Unfortunately I am not quite sure how I would change the marketing, but in it just seems that the things happening on campus don't reach as many as it should. Over all though my experience at Pueblo Community College has been a very positive one."
Freshman,4,I have when to pueblo community college for a few different thing in my career life and I have had a good experiences in the past. very nice people who are willing to help and work with me to achieve my goals.

Freshman,4,"It is a beautiful campus, the food is great, the teachers really engage you and help you understand the material, great school overall."
Freshman,4,"The school is in one of the better parts of town of Pueblo.  I feel safe there. There is well lit security, good parking, as well as campus personnel who run security.  The food needs vamping.  The cafeteria is expensive and is not open to convenient hours.  The work out gym is awesome. Clean and plenty of equipment. The professors care, get to know your name, and the student to teacher ratio is low."
Graduate Student,4,Faculty is extremely helpful in making sure one is all ready for school. Any problems that a student comes across they are more than willing to help solve it.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed it, the resources there are great and all you have to do is ask. Though it'd be nicer if you didn't and they communicated their information easier."
Freshman,4,"I havent yet stared school at PCC , but the advisors and administators were very helpful with helping find a major , enroll into my classes , and with helping me set up the account  for Financial aid. PCC students are very helpful and the teachers are always smiling and ready to help."
Niche User,4,I love the class sizes as well as the interaction! Never have a major problem with the students or staff.
Senior,4,"The Pueblo Community College opened a small extension in Canon City, just over a decade ago. It has been a great addition to the community in ways of providing increased motivation & inspiration for all types young and old."
Sophomore,4,"PCC has a wide variety of degrees they offer, especially for a smaller community college. They work with students one on one to make sure they have the right curriculum."
Freshman,4,"Pueblo Community College has regular classes as well as hybrid classes. The instructors are diverse, interesting, and helpful. The class sizes at the Fremont Campus are small, ranging from 15 to 30 people, which I find very convenient. This allows students to have more personal relationships with professors.  Together, both campuses have an array of useful and very helpful facilities including libraries and their free-access databases of information. The campus is also fun and frequently gives out shirts or serves free pizza for fun. I haven't met another student that doesn't enjoy their experience at PCC."
Graduate Student,4,"I liked my whole experience at the school, the office of financial aid was extremely helpful during my time there, the professors where nice and helpful they encouraged going to them for help and visting them durring there office hours. The other student where freaindly and kind, the libraary was a great source of informatian and they help with studying amoung other things, the learngin center was a great place to go for tutoring help and to meet up for gorup projects."
Graduate Student,4,"Love the ease of online courses, nice instructors, website has a lot of helpful information on it & easy to navigate."
Junior,4,"Over the past few years which I have attended Pueblo Community College I have had the pleasure of meeting several different people. The courses have been vigorous and fulfilling beyond belief. I have taken both the physical in-person classes and classes online, both have been enjoyable experiences. The only downside of a community college would have to be the lack of dorm rooms and sports teams. Other than those two specific areas, it is an amazing school to attend."
Freshman,4,"For being a community college, PCC exceeds is every area and makes it a pleasure to come to school everyday here. Every professor and faculty are extremely helpful and want to see us succeed."
Junior,4,Pueblo Community College in Canon City is a small college that provides a great education and a positive atmosphere. The class size varies anywhere from 8 to 30 students. What I love most is here at PCC I am a student and not a number like the feeling I had when I went to a university. Most of the instructors will do what ever it take to make sure you succeed.
Niche User,4,"My Name is Marissa. I'm think about going to Pueblo Community College. I have many family and friends that have attend Pueblo Community College. They have many great think to say about this school. My auntie also has work in the Accounting department and loved working there before they moved out of State. She even got my Uncle to help out with Kids College in the summer. He enjoyed helping out with the kids. I'm every excited! to attend Pueblo Community College, can't wait to see where it takes me."
Freshman,4,"I like the small school feel. It allows students to get to know each other better. I also have had some great teachers. Overall, it has been easy figuring out what credits I need, and I've had help in moving toward accomplishing my goal."
Freshman,4,"My experince has been great at Pueblo community college. I attended while I was still in High school. It wasn't the easiest but worth it. Their is plenty of hand on help offered with very friendly people. Whenever I had an questions or concerns, I have never felt judge or embarrased afterwards. Though I do wish there was more groups to join that help with the community and have more people involved."
Freshman,4,"This college is easy to apply and get accepted to, they have assistance programs that help pay for college. There are very friendly people who work to help you get anything that you need to get into college and any and all course available. There is online as well as on campus classes to help all students in any hardship that prevent them from going to class or who do not have online access."
Freshman,4,Great community college. Laid back and very low student to instructor ratio. Wide variety of career choices and academic levels.
Freshman,4,"Pueblo Community College is a beautiful campus with many things to offer. It is small, but the community is large and exciting. The campus puts on many events to get either volunteer at or attend. If you are commuting from The Springs, the drive is not as bad as it seems since all the traffic seems to head north towards Denver."
College Senior,4,Although I do not take online courses.
College Senior,4,Through life there are always better programs how ever PCC I fell is one of the best for non traditional students such as myself.
College Junior,4,PCC has on of the top accredited programs in Radiologic Technology in the state.
College Sophomore,4,I understand my teachers one hundred percent. I get along with them and they help me one on one when i need it.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Pueblo Community College, it's easy to get signed up for classes, and its reliable on getting grades back to me before classes even end."
College Junior,4,"I cannot express enough how valuable the resources are at my school. As long as you know what is available and who to ask for it youbwill be on the right track. The school definitely looks out for students who need more of a flexible schedule so they offer night classes, weekend classes, and day classes so you have variety."
College Junior,4,I have had some babysitting troubles that prevent me from going to class from time to time which my school is very understanding. The library allows us to check out laptops and lecture dvds which i have taken advantage of frequently so that i can stay current in my class. The online courses are very similar to the In class sessions with the same work load.
College Junior,4,"I havr had a wide range of professors, my favorite were the ones who were honest and helping. I could ask questions and get reliable information as well as assistance on my grades and what i can do for future tests. However some were very overbearing with authority and would treat us as if we were not yet adults and treated us as non compliant teenagers. Going to the restroom in those classes was something i never wanted to do, in fear of getting embarased and yelled at. We should be respected as adults. Every teacher has there own style and its hard to adapt but doable."
College Junior,4,My school was high ranked based on the jobs students found after graduating. This is very appealing because that is our goal as students to find a job quickly after graduation.
College Junior,4,"My school is based in a town where teen pregnancy, addiction, and felonies are more common than degrees. So the school goes above and beyond to keep their students on the path toward success. Although our success depends on us personally this school gives us the edge we need with various resources like laptop checkouts you can take home, dvd lectures if u happen to miss class, scholarship workshops, etc. I would definitely choose to attend this school just because of the convenience of the small canpus and upmost support from the staff."
College Junior,4,prefer it over in class due to its convenient and alot easier to attend and focus
College Junior,4,The school ranks 4th in the nation for graduation rate
College Junior,4,Most of the instructors are very helpful and awesome
College Junior,4,Early childhood education is what I am working towards enjoy every moment the program is great
College Junior,4,So far I've only done pre requisites for the program I hope to get into. They were great classes and I actually learned a lot from them.
College Junior,4,"PCC has great staff, especially in the learning center and library. The staff take the time to actually help you so that you actually know what you're doing."
Recent Alumnus,4,My school is unique in the fact that the small class sizes and the individual help i receive allows me to be succesfull in my class work.
Recent Alumnus,4,They are helpful to start your college education. It is a great place to begin.
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small and the instructors are very dedicated to helping you achieve your goals.
College Sophomore,4,"The pueblo community college has open admissions

to anyone over i think 17 years of age. i have seen different

races attend. even scholarships that are focused towards

hispanic races still accept applications from other races."
College Sophomore,4,"At pueblo community college,  workshops are 

available for filling out financial aid forms; however

most people do it by themselves online. Also to get

loans, the school requires counseling on the subject.

there are some extra fees at the school for extracurricular 

activities and books are expensive too if you don't 

Get them used. all the expenses are worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"There will be full time semesters for my culinary 

arts management degree aas. the classes that 

caught my eye were cpr, bartending,and poultry.

 i was also pleased that some of my credits from

A previous attempted degree will be accepted 

like my math 107, cis 118, and eng121. I've always

worked in the food industry since i was 16 and 

I believe a degree will take me to new chaptets in my

career. i would love to work for rmser headstart as a cook."
College Junior,4,I think the flexibility is amazing for me cause i can take the bus to school and still be able to take it home when i get out of school. my only frustrations i have had is that i have to find someway to pay for tuition without taking out a loan.
College Junior,4,the activitey's you always meet new people and make new friends at the events plus meet other professors and get to know them.
College Junior,4,"Its not a very big class, my class in the morning has bout 13 students then you have the night students. The courses offered are amazing i love i do hair styling, nails, and esthican class all in one program. my professors are very nice and very helpful with things and questions i have."
Sophomore,2,"The sister school in Durango,CO is in an office building and now it will be moving to the local high school. you can not take certain courses because they do not have the classrooms for it, chemistry specifically. The college is poorly run and the administration is horrible at informing students of the changes with classes or that they were even moving to another location. I heard from another student! Teachers are okay that is the best I can say for this ""college""."
Sophomore,2,"Pueblo Community College is getting a two star rather than one. As harsh as this may be I am comparing to other schools I have been to such as Denver and Arapahoe.  Anyone or any parent that is debating on going to Pueblo Community College or sending their kid I would look somewhere else first but if moving and finances are a problem and their is no last resort then maybe consider Pueblo Community College. Class work is that of high school or less while many answers are given. Text books are out of date and don't match current work. Construction Was taking place and we had to swop times and couldn't use half the equipment. The library was closed due to lack of money and we had only computers.  Teachers teach to the material that the school provides and is redundant. Veteran Affairs office for years has messed up my paper work and makes excuses and is so bad I have to check on them frequently as misplaced records, late submissions that affects pay for months."
College Junior,2,"I took a few online courses, and I did not do well. I feel like the homework load is much, much greater just to make up for not actually being on campus. I didn't learn much at all."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally the workload on online classes in the summer is

crazy. it hard to get help from the teacher. you have to wait about

24 hours for a reply which puts you farther behind on assignments."
College Junior,2,It is not very reliable and is constantly asking for your password.
College Junior,2,The only thing available are the computers.
College Junior,2,There is no real student space and parking sucks.
College Junior,2,The financial aid office is completely useless.
College Junior,2,The classes I need only have one available section.
College Junior,2,The class did not cover relevant information for my career choice.
College Senior,2,I believe that teacher that are really into teaching are often not hired but instead those who often just want a pay check seem to get hired. Student need teachers that love and are passionate about their fields of study and have the ability to teach in such a way that each student is able to grasp the subject that is being taught
College Junior,2,"I am not a very big fan of the Pueblo Community College. I am only attending this School because I was denied transfer to the Colorado State University. Now, this School offers some music classes for which I have always been interested. Therefore, I really don't have very many options."
College Junior,2,The only issue I have with the financial aid process is that the process should be made easier. The financial counseling should be more organized as well.
College Senior,2,"Under Construction – Because of one of the buildings being under construction, other resources are hard to find and use"
College Junior,2,"I enjoy many aspects of attending PCC, such as the level of knowledge and personal investment that many of the professors demonstrate here, the size of the campus, the variety of one-year certificates offered, the ammenities of the campus, and the appearance of the campus. I am, however, not impressed with the financial aid office and the manner in which they disperse additional funds to the students after recieving their payment for tuition, books, and fees. The school is attempting to reduce the percentage of student default rates on student loans, but it is a hinderance in my effort to earn this degree when the college refuses to disperse funds available to me, based on their determination of how many excess funds they think I should need, despite my financial aid history which shows that in five and a half years, I have never defaulted on a student loan. I feel that these issues with financial aid being awarded based on the academic institutions dictation, should be more personalized and all things considered should be based on the individuals past performance in school, and their credit history so to speak when it comes to recieving financial aid. Many times, I needed additional grants or loans and have been turned down by the school, though the lender seemed to be more than happy to lend to me. Many peple I have talked to that attend this college have similar opinionson this issue. Still, I would reccommend this school to others who are interested in beginning a nursing career beacuse of small class size, and excellecnce of the professors teaching science here."
College Freshman,2,"When I started at PCC a few years back, I wasn't even aware I was in an online course until just before school started. I had no idea how to navigate through everything and found it to be very frustrating. I took the innitiative to really figure things out this semester before getting our first assignment, and found that once I got the hang of it, it was quite nice, just bit of a hassle."
Sophomore,1,Worst college I've ever been too and I've just started. No help from staff. Professors teach off of power points and nothing else. All around sucks. Except the campus is nice.
Works Here,1,"As an employee, I have seen a lot of problems that need to be fixed. Nobody wants to stand up and do the right thing. People would rather keep the status quo and allow an inept person run the show. I do not understand how the state of Colorado allows this person to run the show."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't get the same amount of money for my classes for every semester, and I would like to have four classes each semester but they will only pay for two."
College Junior,1,It is non existent at our campus. 
Recent Alumnus,1,Online courses is not for me.
College Senior,1,The process takes an enormous amount of time and  the results are less than satisfying.
College Junior,1,I would say that if you are a minority you will probably run into double standards when it comes to receiving financial aid. There are some that work in that department that will try and discourage you and try there best to push your buttons. I find that this type of behavior is unaceptable.
College Sophomore,1,Post Grad Services – My campus is mainly a two year campus. There is absolutely no post grad services.
College Sophomore,1,honestly there is really nothing that sets it aside. If you don't want to be a nurse then good luck getting the classes you need.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Small Campus – The campus I go to has a very small library, nothing for athletes, very few campus activities, and very little to do other then go to class."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Career Center ??? I am about to graduate from my school, but I did go see a career counselor about 2 semesters ago and I was not very satisfied. I felt that the counselor was not interested in helping me she was way too busy and grumpy. She seemed much more interested in what was going on around her and when I asked her to help me she said I need to figure things out for my self. Not happy at all with Career Counselor."

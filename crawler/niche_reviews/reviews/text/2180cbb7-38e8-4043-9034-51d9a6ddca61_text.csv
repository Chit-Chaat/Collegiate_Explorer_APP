Niche User,5,"Houston Baptist University is a very warm welcoming college and continues to improve diverse environment. When I went on a campus tour at that university, all of my questions were answered and the people were overall nice. The landscape is beautiful and clean. Therefore, I know that students take pride in their school and others around them. I also noticed that are building a bigger STEM building for their students that enjoy STEM grows. That really excites me because I'm interested in the STEM program and decided to major in Biology. Houston Baptist University is a great school choice for anyone and I see no needs of improvement."
Freshman,5,"In comparison to my high school, HBU is absolutely incredible. I have so many resources available to me that I greatly appreciate.  For instance, tutoring. I was extremely impressed with how HBU handled the coronavirus crisis. They have a mask policy and have implemented a hybrid model for classes that seems to be working very well. Mostly I have been impressed with how nice and understanding the staff is."
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing experience at HBU thus far. The professors and community are what helps me very much. The fact that the classes are smaller then other colleges really give you the opportunity to really get help from the professor if you truly need. The professors really care about you and it shows. As for the community the school is small and there aren't a ton of students but there are many benefits to that. The people make things so much more amazing being able to become close with people you go to school with, seeing them around campus and actually knowing peoples faces and starting conversation or even saying hello to people around makes this school so much better."
Junior,5,I have learned a lot while being at HBU. The classes themselves teach you a lot but even more the professors. They show that they not only care about the students but the class itself though the way they teach and what they teach. The professors know what they are doing and talking about which makes learning that much better.
Sophomore,5,The community is amazing and the atmosphere is very homelike. It's tons of opportunities to get to know your fellow huskies as well as make friends and get involved in campus life.
Freshman,5,"I love all my instructors and my classes are really intuitive. I am able to learn in the environment properly. Knowing that it is pandemic, I am taking online classes and will further my education through online classes. I am grateful for the convenience of taking classes online during this time in 2020. I love how the school is Christian based and private as well. Everyone that I have asked for help or have emailed, they have helped me answer my questions without a doubt."
Freshman,5,"Yes, I really do enjoy the online learning classroom really well!!! The professors are still very helpful and able to answer any questions you may have. The curriculum is the same, very rigorous."
Freshman,5,Online learning is great aw well. The professors want you to succeed. Their class sizes are small and meant to make sure you are following along. They have professors as well as assistants to help you through the class.
Freshman,5,"Houston Baptist is an overly welcoming university. They want you to feel right at home when you first arrive and that's just how I felt. They are there for you through every step in the process. Applying took 5 minutes or less. They are straightforward and have easy platforms for new students to use. Their guides are great as well along with their replying to questions or concerns you may have, they want the best for you."
Sophomore,5,online classes in houston baptist university are very good and i truly recommend. professors are very understanding and are very helpful when it comes to the online classes. the work that is given is very well explained and is very easy to reach out the a professor if there is something you don't understand.
Junior,5,"Hi, my name is Kaitlyn Patterson and I have attended Houston Baptist University   School of Nursing for a semester. I love the atmosphere so far, the diversity of the campus and the fact that it is a Christian based college. I hope to continue to thrive at Houston Baptist University and grow into a mature young lady. I pray that I continue to grow spiritually by connecting with God through my future nursing career."
Junior,5,"I haven't taken any online classes personally with Houston Baptist University, but I have heard that it is a great experience for others. I do plan on taking at least one class online in the future with them."
Freshman,5,"I personally did not take any online classes, but the classes that I took online (due to COVID-19) were a smooth transition from normal in-person class."
Freshman,5,Houston Baptist is a great school with great professors. I love HBU and the school will always be a part of me.
Freshman,5,"My experience was awesome because I never thought of hbu as an option but I ended up being a husky . I would regret if I hadn’t done that decision . It was very warm welcoming there at hbu . Despite all the covid crisis still they welcomed us with smiles and lots of hug even though virtually. Hbu had a lot more options than I thought . Organizations and clubs are the best . They are very active .indeed makes us more happier and involved . Being at hbu or having to been a husky feels like doing the right decision or like maybe even having a meaning to life .i would recommend anyone hbu because we have such a panel of teachers ,advisors ,loving seniors , and faculty and staff who really feel as family ."
Sophomore,5,What I love about Houston Baptist university is that the teachers are excellent. There is unity with staff and students.
Sophomore,5,My online experience with Houston Baptist university was great. There was effective and productive communication with teachers and students.
Sophomore,5,Houston Baptist is like home. From the second you walk on campus you can feel the love. Everyone is so welcoming and sweet. The people there are just so magnificent. It’s a very diverse environment too and the air there is fresh. The professors rock and really care about your well being. I have never been blessed to be a student at HBU.
Sophomore,5,The online courses at HBU were very easy and smooth to use. I have never been able to use such an easy program than the one HBU offered. You could do everything you could as if you were on campus.
Freshman,5,"All my professors were understanding and patient. They were flexible with our due dates and guided me throughout my semester. Also, they gave me portions of their time to talk about my personal concerns regarding the Covid-19. My professors are not just teachers, they are also my confidants."
Freshman,5,"All my professors were understanding and patient. They were flexible with our due dates and guided me throughout my semester. Also, they gave me portions of their time to talk about my personal concerns regarding the Covid-19. My professors are not just teachers, they are also my confidants."
Freshman,5,"Houston Baptist University is a great university that helps students with any challenges, or any questions. My admission counselor has always taken time to answer my questions and help me through the admission process."
Alum,5,"Houston Baptist University is a private university. I personally felt my professors cared for their students. There were many events you can be part of at any given time. However, as a private university it was very costly. For that reason, unless you choose a career that will allow you to maximize your return on investment, I would choose other alternatives first before diving full-time, for four years at Houston Baptist University."
Graduate Student,5,What I like about the university is that the professors are for me and will do everything they can to help me be successful.  I also enjoy the time I have with my peers to collaborate and communicate with them on different subjects. The campus atmosphere is great because the environment is open and pleasing to the eye.
Junior,5,"Houston Baptist University has an incredible community and incredible professors that care about their students. They invest heavily in them and become life long mentors. The tutoring services and the library services are incredible! The best part of the university is its Honors Program, which replaces the basics with a classical approach. I have seen incredible improvement in critical thinking. I've seen it in myself and in all my classmates. They focus on several areas: science, art, literature, government, and theology. In areas like Latin, theology, and music, Houston Baptist University is world class. They also give generously when it comes to scholarships. 

The cons: The food on campus is not the best, but there are several restaurants within walking distance. The dorms are not the greatest and the service to help with plumbing is always pretty late."
Freshman,5,"Houston Baptist University is a wonderful institution. Classes are small, thus the students have great relationships with their professors and tutors. The school itself is small and peaceful, and a great place for students who are focused and want to achieve their educational goals. One alteration that would benefit everyone is more parking space and university scholarships."
Alum,5,"Houston Baptist University is where I not only gained the existential knowledge I desired in order to further my educational career, but it is also the place where I formed my most closest friendships and further developed my relationship with God. If I could do my undergraduate career over again, I would choose HBU over and over again."
Freshman,5,My experience at Houston Baptist University so far is amazing. They have a lot off services and is really organized. they emphasize more on academics and christian faith. their main goal is for students to receive higher education and become people of good spiritual and education influence.
Senior,5,Houston baptist is great i love being in the environment and its amazing all the students are nice i really needed friends and all the students are helping and ready to be your friend
Niche User,5,"I attended Houston Baptist University's preview day, and I believe it is one of the best colleges that I've ever visited before. I learned that the future student does not necessarily need to be the religion they believe in. They are just trying to help students reach their goals, and believe that that they are capable to be anything, no matter what religion. 
This University also provides clubs that I have interest in being part of. For example, there is a club that is like a band or choir, and I like to sing, so if I attend there I will join. Another club is a group of Catholic students, in which they volunteer in churches and talk about their religion and share their thoughts about it.
In general, I love the experience at this University, and I hope to be eligible to attend."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the learning experience at HBU, along with many opportunities that are open to me because I am a student. I also really enjoy the diversity and the clubs and organizations that currently exist at the school. I also feel very welcome and happy that this is a small school and I was able to fit in right away!"
Freshman,5,"From my visits I can safely say that this is one of the best places I can be at. The focus on student life, academics, and spiritual life makes the school very tight knit and helpful--from the staff to the students."
Sophomore,5,I am blessed to have been given the opportunity to attend Houston Baptist University. I feel at home when on campus and I wouldn't want it any other way.
Freshman,5,Orientation was amazing. All of the staff and educators are very supportive and helpful when transitioning from high school to college. Houston Baptist wants you to succeed in whatever you choose to do and offers a variety of programs.
Alum,5,"Houston Baptist University is a place where you can grow in your faith and meet fellow diverse classmates and experienced professors. What HBU lacks in recoginition, it superseeds in quality of education adn student experience."
Niche User,5,Houston Baptist was a great Christian school with lots of different opportunities for a worldwide of different people with so many different pathways.
Freshman,5,"Houston Baptist University is a pretty small University which is great if you arent looking for a huge 4 year university. Yet the University still provides everything a huge 4 year University provides. It is a great campus with plenty of opportunities to advance in academics and many other aspects of college including greek life, social excursions, athletics, and even military."
Freshman,5,"I love attending Houston Baptist, the small campus size allows for so much growth in and outside of the classroom! I have grown so much spiritually, academically, and personally. The size allows for closer relationships with professors and peers, making learning more meaningful."
Freshman,5,"I really love Houston Baptist University and would recommend it to anybody. The professors and advisors are really great and care about the students. The campus is small and beautiful. It's never too crowded or loud. The class sizes are small and more personal, which I love. The only things I would like to see change are the internet, and the laptop kiosk. The internet is really slow most of the time, and it's usually faster to not be connected to it. The laptops in the kiosk are a great idea for students who don't have their own laptops, but they hardly ever work. Many of them don't even turn on, and the ones that do run extremley slowly.  There should be more effort in maintaining those. Other than that, I absolutley adore this school and all the opprotunities it has to offer."
Freshman,5,Houston Baptist University is a school that gives you the education that you need and gives the opportunities that you never imagined you can have.
Junior,5,Houston Baptist University is preparing me for my future with a socially responsible degree and a strong work ethic. Facilities are nice and the professor genuinely care about the success of the students. This is a great small divisions I university and I recommend it to everyone.
Niche User,5,"When I visited the campus in July, I was surprised too see how big and pretty the entire campus was and how the campus looked the time I was there. I was especially shocked to see the price of attendance for a year on this campus ($40,000/year), but they offer a lot of financial aid to attend campus. Overall, the campus was really good and I would recommend anyone to visit this beautiful campus to see for yourself what life at HBU is like."
Graduate Student,5,HBU is very kin on providing opportunities for student to gather professional working  experience while in school by making work study job readily available.
Senior,5,"I love this school so much. This school might be expensive (that's why I'm applying for this scholarship) but its the best. I enjoy having small classes because you can have better connection with the professor. They will know who you are because there isn't a lot of students in the class, unlike public universities, and will remember you years after taking their class. There's a better connection between students and professors because of the small amount of students in this school. You can be a senior walking pass a professor you took in your freshman year and they looking at you and greet you with a hug and smile. Having close bonds with the professor will make you feel like you matter and not be seen as just another random student. Being a baptist school allows them to tell us more about God and helps us learn more about the word of God and how much we mean and matter to him. I'm glad I am able to attend this school."
Graduate Student,5,"My graduate degree from HBU provided me with incredible opportunities and prepared me to be successful in my field. My professors knew my name, they cared about my success, and served as exceptional advisors throughout my time as a student. I can’t recommend this school enough."
Sophomore,5,The classes are small and attentive so you can always get help if you need it. The campus is small but has everything to offer. Theres events going on all the time so you always have a chance to meet new people.
Junior,5,"Houston Baptist has a located which has a good proximity for everywhere,the admission staff are welcoming as well as the professor,the campus is safe and everyone is always ready to help."
Junior,5,"Attending my first semester as a transfer at HBU, was exciting yet challenging. The courses here are not easy, which is why they have such high stats on their students entry into medical schools. The atmosphere is friendly and everyone is to themselves which is great if you are a private person. I am excited to start my next semester here!"
Junior,5,"I like the students to teacher ratio, which is about 30 students to 1 teacher. I also like the environment and how everyone is so kind."
Niche User,5,"I personally feel that HBU is the best of the best. I went there with my mother and was greeted instantly by friendly faces. I automatically knew that this college was right for me. When the director came to greet us personally, he offered water or tea which was really nice. Also, the meeting we had with the univesity director was great! This school has everything you could possibly ask for.!"
Sophomore,5,I love everything about my university. The professors here are so wonderful. You can tell they care about their students. The education and material learned in HBU's classes are exceptional as well. The only downside to it is the total cost for attendance.
Niche User,5,"Houston Baptist University is an amazing school, located on a beautiful campus on the west side of Houston. There is so much to do outside of the classroom. It has an excellent student to teacher ratio and has a very secure learning environment."
Junior,5,"Houston Baptist University is a welcoming school. All the faculty is very nice, supportive, and helpful. It is evident that the professors love their field of work and they try to help you in anyway they can."
Senior,5,"I had a wonderful time at this university. The professors are knowledgable, the atmosphere is amazing, and you will get a quality education here!"
Sophomore,5,"Attending Houston Baptist University was something I didn't think I'd grow to love, but touring the campus was just an eye opener for me, that this was where I wanted to study music. Fast forward to now, and I'm in my 2nd year entering my 3rd year come next semester. The faculty are absolutely amazing, and I love all of my professors. HBU is where I want to be."
Freshman,5,"Houston Baptist University is a great university to go to because of the environment and the staff members who work at the university. The environment is not only clean, but also positive as the people get along with one another. The staff members at Houston Baptist University always strive to encourage the students to do their best in classes and in their personal lives. They also create many different events and to try and engage with the students. The most important thing that Houston Baptist University offers is spiritual growth. The campus has a variety of programs (Bible studies, convocations, etc.) that allow the students to fellowship with their mentors and increase their love for God. Houston Baptist University is an excellent college to attend and a person would not regret applying to this university!"
Freshman,5,My experience is going great so far my professors always available when you need to talk to them. They also have a great tutoring center.
Junior,5,"Houston baptist university has an execellent curriculum for learning. They have great teachers that are ready to help out with any difficulty. Friendly campus environment, neat and conducive for learning. Lots of extracurricular activities are provided for students which helps student to get to know each other better. Excellent program for any career field."
Sophomore,5,"HBU is close to home,has an amazing environment. The other students here are friendly. It has a nice family environment. The professors are great, always ensuring that we do our very best when it comes to tests and exams. Just an overall great school."
Freshman,5,"I simply love my school. The day I entered the school I feel like I was in Heaven.
I believe that an education at HBU should I be granted the privilege, will equip me with a deep understanding of 'every part of the scripture'. And as I go from HBU and down the path communicating the message of Christ I am certain that I could one day stand before my creator and unashamedly give account for the instruction and guidance I received from Houston Baptist University."
Niche User,4,"I've never taken classes at Houston Baptist University, but I've met some of their professors and they are very detailed and nice."
Freshman,4,"Houston Baptist University implemented a hybrid classroom model and a remote option. Students can choose to be 100% remote. If they choose not to, then students still would only attend classes once a week. The class roster is split in half with one half on Mondays and Tuesdays and the other half on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Everyone is remote on Friday. This feels very safe, Additionally, the online formatting for the lectures is very easy to use and helpful to categorize assignments, see your grades, and interact with your professors and students. You can even turn on captions and speed up or slow down the recorded lectures."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at HBU has been life changing . The university has not only allowed me to grow academically, but spiritually as well."
Graduate Student,4,"If you are looking for a school with close connection between sthe students and teachers, guidence in spirituality, and an overall great college experience, Houston Baptist is the place to be."
Junior,4,The campus is absolutely phenomenal and the classes are smaller than public universities which make the learning environment a lot easier and well suited.
Junior,4,"Learning and taking courses online can be manageable as long as you are disciplined. However, the professors/faculty here respond pretty quickly if you have any questions or concerns."
Sophomore,4,"houston baptist university is a great university to attend. it has many programs and ways to help students achieve scholarships,grants, and internships for their education."
Freshman,4,"The Campus is Amazing and beautiful!!! All of the faculty are kind and helpful, and they want to help you to succeed in your professional life and your personal life!!!"
Freshman,4,"I have not yet taken online classes with HBU, but I am looking forward to the two online classes I will be taking this Fall."
Freshman,4,My classes haven’t started yet but I do know that they have a very good online working class also different other options to enhance the studies of students.
Senior,4,They were understanding of the pandemic and were lenient about getting work turned in. They also gave us easy access lectures to learn from at our own pace.
Junior,4,"My experience so far with Houston Baptist University has been filled with many learning opportunities. I am currently a junior going into my third year attending Houston Baptist University, as someone who has been known to be reserved, shy, and quiet for most of her life, attending Houston Baptist University has been a great opportunity for me to branch out and come out of my comfort zone. The professors and faculty members have been most attentive to their students and provide any helpful information to the best of their ability. The campus is not as large as most universities, however, I feel as though that benefits the campus to bring a sense of protection. The classes have been a great learning experience, the ratio to professor to student is smaller, however, that provides more engagement between the students and professors."
Sophomore,4,"With the current pandemic, all classes were moved online. My experience taking my residential classes online ran smoothly. The transition was made in the platform we use: Blackboard. Most of my professors understood the platform, which made it easier for the students to get access to assignment, quizzes, and exams. Many professors provided their best to their capabilities with creating lecture videos and explaining the chapters' material. However, there were some who did not provide any additional forms of teaching such as creating those videos; only PowerPoints were provided and students had to self-teach themselves. Video calls and emails were the main way of communication between students and professors. I believe the online learning experience is similar to the way remote classes were held during this pandemic. However, online learning professors are fully trained on how to handle every learning aspect online. I would consider taking an online class in the future."
Freshman,4,A lot of the professors just uploaded the course content and left it up to you to do it and stay caught up.
Senior,4,Great professors and class size. The only thing that is hard is paying for tuition when the rate goes up every year. It makes it hard to have your scholarships cover expenses when fees keep rising.
Junior,4,"Houston Baptist is not like a state or public university. If you come in expecting that type of experience you may be disappointed. Rather, it is a small private liberal college with Christian ideals. Due to its small size, I have created deep relationships with my favorite professors who are very accessible. If you find your group of people you belong with you will be very happy here."
Niche User,4,When I visited Houston Baptist University I really liked how small the small campus was. I also liked the people there they were all so friendly and welcoming when I took a tour of the campus. Something I would change about the University would be the cost of attendance.
Niche User,4,"Great school and value. Houston is a wonderful city with great weather.
HBU is small and welcoming. Student life is great."
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming campus, with an overall sense of unity and an inclusive community. They are very generous with their scholarships, which goes to show their willingness to support students financial needs. Close proximity to the downtown area allows for full exposure to the diverse life and culture in Houston. My only gripe is that I would love to have cheaper dining options for freshmen."
Niche User,4,It's a very good University I have really enjoyed their service and it has been a wonderful experience to be involved and to be in this university. It has been a very pleasing experience to be a part of this great University.
Freshman,4,I just started going to this school but so far I'm enjoying it here. I like most of my teachers so far and have made really go friends I think.
Sophomore,4,"The university is wonderful with little lacking. The good things about the school are the professors, atmosphere, and safety. All of the professors that I have had and my other peers have had have been very professional and caring. These professors are usually highly renowned and intelligent. The school has a very great and open atmosphere to it. There are plenty of student organizations and all of the students seem to be very friendly. The school is very safety, allotting many police booths. The only thing that is really lacking is the overall beauty of the campus, which is average and the administration. I have had numerous problems with the cashiers office and other assorted administration offices, they just seem very dazed and unorganized. Other than those few things, I think HBU is a very wonderful school."
Freshman,4,It has been a very fun first semester and I am looking forward to the next. So far I have learned many new things in regards to philosophy that I never would have imagined that I would ever learn.
Freshman,4,Houston Baptist University has a very nice campus. People at HBU are very friendly. Professors are very helpful and enthusiastic.
Freshman,4,"HBU is a very diverse school. Not only do they care about your academic life, they also care about your spiritual life. It's a very good school if you want to focus on your studies and God."
Sophomore,4,Very small community that cares. Some professors are difficult to learn in their courses however overall they are good at teaching. Expensive but give scholarships.
Junior,4,I like that my professors take a personal interest in me and are very encouraging of my future goals. I wish there were more options for academic scholarship or opportunity.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I have had a pretty good experience. The small classroom sizes really allows you to connect with the professor and your other classmates. Along with that, there is a lot of professors who truly care about their students and makes sure that they are really learning while also having fun.Only problem is there seems to be a lack of school spirit. There is plenty of school events but since about half of the students live off campus, not a lot of people tend to show up."
Sophomore,4,"HBU is a very wonderful school to attend, but the students here are not as diverse as they can be. Of course, like most schools, students can tend to be divided into groups such as the popular kids, the athletes, and more. Teachers can be understanding for the most part and are willing to help you sometimes."
Freshman,4,"For me personally I liked the religious aspect of  Houston Baptist University. But most people may find that extaciricular but I see it as something essential. The only thing is thier enviroment, which compared to other colleges like University of texas San antonio does not match up even in the slightest."
Freshman,4,"Houston Baptist University has an phenomenal online nursing program! The professor are always available , the programs are easy to follow and you have your own success coach. If you have any issues or concerns your help is just a text, phone call or email away.  IT is also highly accessible for any problems that may arise. At this point I am very pleased and impressed with the school. It has made going back to school after 26 years doable.  I am comfortable knowing help is readily available."
Junior,4,"The college as a whole is pretty small, but the education you receive is spectacular. I believe that this small campus helps others come together and allows the staff to become more invested in their students. They allow you to challenge yourselves and help prepare you for the workforce by exposure to internships."
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman at Houston Baptist University and still have a lot to see, learn, and explore. The faculty and staff really care about making the transition from high school to college smooth. Professors are strict but not unreasonably so, just enough to keep you in line and focused on graduation. The students are friendly and there is always activities going on around campus. The food isn’t too bad either. ;)"
Sophomore,4,"I personally have a love-hate relationship, one minute I'm in love because the people honestly are the ones that make the university amazing. Then because it's so small, there is literally NOTHING TO DO! UNLESS YOU HAVE A CAR AND WILLING TO DRIVE EVERYONE!  The professors are great! But let me tell you, CLW points and extra required courses will kill you! they'll hold you back! if you can I suggest you get some course done at a community college, it will save you a lot of time and money! Overall it's a good school! If you're more into ​academic life, then you'll love it here."
Freshman,4,"During my experience at HBU, I have come across many wonderful people and top-notch professors. Originally I had intended to stay only a semester, but I now plan to finish my degree here. The small class sizes allow for more interactive lessons and many Socratic style discussions (depending on your major). Though tuition is expensive, they offer very generous merit-based scholarships that make paying for college extremely feasible. The area directly surrounding HBU isn't the best, but Downtown is relatively close by. This university is ideal if you are a humanities major, and less ideal if you are a science major. The labs definitely need to be upgraded."
Freshman,4,"Seldom do I walk into a place and feel connected not only to the atmosphere, but also to the populace. Walking on the stones of progression, I saw that the college campus is small and quaint, a sight that is captivating to see – not only for its beautiful architectural prowess, a sight objective – for its diverse alumni, further connecting for I too will be a part of that beautiful society. Furthermore, the experience with the staff was nothing short of commiserate; the friendly eyes and smiles that I was greeted with welcomed me into the place that I will, soon, call my next home, a noun assigned not for the location but for its feeling of safety. I end this note to extend my absolute commendations, for what was a regular waking day turned into a walk filled with introspection and a hopeful glance into the future."
Sophomore,4,"Houston Baptist university is one of the most diverse and friendly colleges out there! Classes are small, and student resources are readily available. Since it is in the Houston area, you can go around for great food and shopping after a long day of study!"
Freshman,4,What I like about Houston Baptist University is that is a safe place for students trying to seek God. I would probably change the fact that there isn't much diversity. I would like to see more Hispanics and African Americans.
Junior,4,"I love how HBU has different programs for people to join who have similar interests or similar situations like Gen 1 or Trio. Gen 1 is a program for incoming freshman that are the first one in their family to go to college. The program creates events and a variety of meetings to build friendships and tips on how to handle their first year. Trio is a similar program that goes all 4 years, they provide counseling, free tutoring, advice on finance, trips etc. The only thing I would like to change about my college is more parking space since there seems to not be enough on certain hours."
Junior,4,Houston Baptist University is very diverse and has a very wide variety of courses for all types of majors or minors. The school has a very excellent art program and has a lot of good options for financial aid.
Alum,4,"HBU was a great school where I recieved personal attention from professors who took an interest in my goals. While it may  not be a typical college, I was not looking for a typical college experience. If you want small classes, attention from staff, and a great education, HBU is the right campus for you."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very small and easy to get around. The classes are small , with usually about 20 students which allows us to have a relationship with the professors. The professors are usually quite engaging and will try to learn their students names. There is not a lot of activity happening on campus usually , so there could be more to be involved in."
Sophomore,4,"While no school Ian perfect, I have grown in my appreciation for HBU’s faculty and students. Going back to school after taking a three-year gap has been rough but every professor and personel I’ve encountered at HBu has greatly helped me along the way. I am immensely grateful for the people at this school and I think has made the most impact in my life. While the courses are fun and a great size, it’s the professors and faculty at HBU that make this college worth attending."
Sophomore,4,"great faculty, generous scholarships. I do wish that the overall cost of attendance was not so high though."
Freshman,4,I am going to be a freshman this incoming year. I am an international student from Spain. The times I have been on campus I've been very well attended and also I have learnt a lot about it.
Senior,4,"Beautiful campus. I love the small class sizes and the professors really care about your individual success. I also like that there are many spirituality growth opportunities on campus. It's also in Houston, so when you want to go off campus you can explore the wonderful city!"
Freshman,4,"I am an entering freshman at HBU and I have been impressed with the school thus far. Everyone that i've spoke to about the university has spoken very highly of the university and said I will love it. The campus is very well kept and it is fairly easy to find all the buildings. The only downside is that the tuition is very high, especially if you live on campus or join a sorority. They do offer a good amount of money in academic scholarships but there is still a large sum of money left to pay."
Junior,4,"Based on physical looks and current students ratings, HBU sounded like the school for me. Can't wait to start this fall!"
Sophomore,4,"I like the overall experience, but the school is cost way to much and I don't feel like it offers very much"
Sophomore,4,"It's a really nice school, small campus but excellent facilities. Professors very helpful and always willing to hear you and give you advise. Campus is full with friendly people."
Graduate Student,4,"What I like about this university is the small student to professor ratio. You really get to know your professor and everyone in your class. What I think HBU can work on is the type of service they provide their students when it comes to staff in the admissions office. Also I feel like the advisors should work more closely with the students, especially graduate level students."
Sophomore,4,"This place has a gym which i liked most about it. This is also the reaosn i go to this school, because it's very much helpful to be active."
Niche User,4,The college was nice and homey there was a lot of people who just talked to me randomly even if I did not know them. The campus was quite beautiful complimenting the city it dwells in.
Freshman,4,"HBU wasn't my intended college, but fortunately I do love the school and atmosphere that it gives. The education they give, at the price it is, is great and I do feel like I will be able to do well in my profession b/c of that."
Senior,4,"HBU is a great school if you can dodge some of the cost and don't mind a small town vibe. There are some spiritual aspects but it isn't overwhelming. My favorite thing is that no matter what you are in to, you will find someone or something to make you feel right at home. You will definitely leave HBU well-rounded!"
Freshman,4,Houston Baptist University provides a safe learning environment for students. We are provided with campus police that ensure that we are safe and problems are handled. We also have residence assistants that help students with any problem they have or just make them feel welcome. The residence assistants are also very good and helping students get involved with on campus activities such as bible studies or fellowship.  The dorm rooms are in good condition and are cleaned at least once a week by maintenance. There are several places to eat on campus such as chick fil a and the Baugh (the residential cafeteria). The Baugh has a very diverse menu which allows many students to be satisfied. Also there are many food places surrounding the campus. The only thing I would change is the amount of parking space. I believe the parking areas around the dorm rooms should somehow be extended or reserved for residents only.
Freshman,4,Houston Baptist University is a very close knit university. The professors and students are very involved on campus. The food isn't all that great. 
College Junior,4,I am unsure on this topic as I have not yet tried to apply for a job outside.
College Freshman,4,I am in the freshman dorms which are not all that but the upperclassmen dorms deserve all 5 circles.
College Freshman,4,I am a football manager and I love them.
Junior,2,I liked that it is a small private university. That means small classes and professors knowing your name. I do not like how biased it is.
Niche User,2,"Houston Baptist University does have some great advantages during a college experience. However, it also has some serious flaws that the University needs to address. If you are looking for a place with ample opportunities to develop your faith, you are in the right place. HBU is a very small school with great opportunities to be involved in all types of organizations across campus. HBU is located near the Houston area which is a great place for networking and career choices. There are great academic resources for students within the library. However, the University does have its downfalls. Housing, on campus food, student involvement in allocation of funds, and the genuine care for each student at the University are all severely lacking.  HBU has some great faculty members and those who make their students feel important and help them in any way possible, but there are also those who make students feel like nothing more than a paycheck."
College Junior,2,"Houston Baptist University has minimal student involvement in athletics. Athletic facilities are great for football players, but all other sports suffer because of this. Very few students go out to support the team during sports matches."
College Junior,2,"Houston Baptist University is currently in the process of expanding, which means they accept many students who do not work hard and who bring down the overall intelligence of the community."
College Freshman,2,"This school tricks you into thinking you are a valued student at the time you are accepted. Once you are attending, it becomes very hard to get help from most of the staff."
College Freshman,2,"I would most definitely not choose my school if I had a second chance. The staff is rude, cold, and not helpful, they are only interested in the money - not the success of their students."
College Freshman,2,"I am not a member of any clubs, etc."
College Freshman,2,The student population is very small and most are commuters. The buildings (including residence buildings) are mostly old and not very inviting. The cost of attending is very high. The professors are very knowledgeable and caring. The classes are relatively small. The food on campus is sub-par at best. The campus is incredibly small and in not in a very good location in Houston. There are often sirens nearby.  The entire University basically shuts down on weekends leaving on campus students without any resources. Very strict rules.
College Junior,2,"Administration is absolutely horrible. They are so self-absorbed and do not exude Christian values in any way whatsoever, especially the President's office. They need to be completely replaced. I never thought I would go to a school where the administration cares absolutely nothing about what the students want."
College Freshman,2,"HBU is in a very poor area of Houston. So it can be dangerous, depending on where you live, and the quality is fairly poor."
College Freshman,2,"Parties are there, but they don't happen often. And since the campus is a dry campus, expect to be carpooling or driving to other people's houses. There is a club called Limelight that gives discounts to college students on Thursdays, but it is very boring."
College Junior,2,"Student discounts only apply to select surrounding fast food locations. Cost is ectremely tight, given I am trying very hard to pay for school myself."
College Sophomore,2,"These things get pretty awkward in general. Most students want to have fun but if it's hosted on campus, there's are pretty whack. They're fun for small groups of friends but it's hard to bring in a huge crowd. It's awkward to even attend for some people. They're nice events but there's so many can's & cannot's to follow to be an acceptable event. All in all, HBU is NOT a party school, in any way."
College Freshman,2,"If you are looking for the ""college experience"" this is not the school. The school's main objective is making you a better Christian. If that is what you are looking for, then yes, go to this school. However, this is not what I wanted. 12 hours of theology is required, Christian theology is taught in every class you go into, every paper you write will be about virtues and morality, professors will shame you for disagreeing, students will simply ignore your opinions."
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms are old and smell terrible and the toilets clog all the time. My friends dorm flooded because of a toilet. There is very limited space on campus for underclassmen and the other option on campus is only available for upperclassmen and there are no exceptions. The Lake House is the other dorm. It is brand new and the best place to live on campus but it's super expensive and fills up very quickly. Husky Village is on campus apartments only for upperclassmen. It is dirty and gross.
College Freshman,2,There is wifi available across campus but it is slow a lot of the times in the dorms. The wifi also cuts in and out in the dorms frequently. The HBU network shuts down a lot and software updates are constantly happening which causes problems with the network.
College Freshman,2,HBU is a dry campus and does not allow smoking of any kind. Campus police will pull you over if you go over 15mph in the parking lots and will lecture you for 10-15 minutes about safety. They will also look at anything put under your windshield wipers for some reason.
College Freshman,2,"There are many people from different ethnic backgrounds however people from similar backgrounds stick together. Groups of people from one ethnic group are clumped together around campus. I would not recommend HBU for people who are looking for people who are looking for open minded thinkers. There is a very strict traditional religious view of the world and it flows into everything, including all of the classes. Even science classes are taught with religious influences. Generally insensitive to sexual orientations and political orientations."
College Freshman,2,"The professors are amazing in my major but the classes required are not the same classes required for most graduate schools. Therefore, it is necessary to take these classes as electives plus the extra core classes required by the university."
College Freshman,2,I don't go out at night. I just stay in my room and sleep and study.
College Freshman,2,"I love living on campus, but the area right outside of school is terrible and everyone says it's dangerous."
College Freshman,2,"I honestly have never seen the inside of the off campus housing, but it is much more convenient to just live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,The science classes are ridiculously hard.
College Senior,2,HBU charge you $100 per year for parking and the spots fill up fast. 
College Senior,2,"Houston weather is crazy. One day it's sunny, the next day it's freezing. When it rains, the campus floods."
College Freshman,2,I commute so it takes me around an hour to and from school. 
College Freshman,2,"During the rain, part of the sidewalk floods. "
College Senior,2,The public transportation in Houston exists but isn't on time and can be difficult to access on certain days of the week. You really need a car if you really need to get somewhere.
College Senior,2,It is difficult because the grades must be at the top of the list in order to get in.
College Freshman,2,"You'll be lucky if you live in the area because there aren't a wide number of apartments around the campus. It's mostly stores and homes of individuals in the neighborhood. The campus does offer apartments next to the campus, but other than that, driving there from the C.E. King area of Northeast Houston to Houston Baptist University is an 30-50 minutes drive with moderating traffic."
College Junior,2,Nothing really exciting takes place at HBU after hours.
College Freshman,2,The school tries to throw a party every month but the school closes every thing at two in the morning.
College Freshman,2,"Not Enough Variety – In my opinion, there isn't enough variety when it comes to majors. There are only about 30 to choose from, so your options are limited. However, if you know for sure what you want to major in and HBU offers it, then it's a good place to come. HBU has awesome nursing, business, education, and kinesiology programs."
College Junior,2,"Bad Surrounding Area – There are several apartment complexes located around HBU, but choosing housing in these locations is not recommended as it happens to be a ""bad area"" (Sharpstown/Houston area). It is almost unusual, but HBU serves as an  ""oasis"" in this part of Houston. There are on-campus apartments available as well."
College Junior,2,"Many People Commute – Many students who live nearby the university usually commute to school. For students that choose to live on campus, there are dorm facilities and on-campus apartments that may seem a bit pricey. Other off-campus apartments nearby the university aren't really recommended as they are located in a ""bad area""."
College Sophomore,2,"No Options – There aren't any off campus housing options available through the campus. While there are some apartments near by or a short drive away, most people live farther at their homes with parents, or  on campus."
College Freshman,2,This school is very strict one must tell an police officer to enter the campus after 11pm and there an no drug or alcohol policy on campus and ther is also limitaions on people who visit.
College Freshman,2,Declining Balance Off Campus – We can use our declining Balance dollars at Papa John's and order tax free pizza.
College Freshman,2,"I Do Not Recommend – The main cafeteria does not have a variety of food. The cooks often reuse the food through out the week for example we will have meat loaf with carrots in it on Monday. then they would use the same meat to to make meat patties the next day. Another example is that they served brisket with gravy and and then the same brisket with bbq the next. If you like comfort food and do not mind the variation ten you would be fine. They also serve hamburgers (so greasy) and sandwiches however you want them. I do not like the food so I usually just eat a bowl of cereal or hope they serve something worth tasting. They Have a restaurant called Tilas that serves ""Mexican"" food. They are not good at keeping there food hot so its good if you get it when they first open unless you do no mind lukewarm food.There are two places that we can use our declining balance dollars. One place stays open until 12. The best part about our declining balance dollars is that we can now use them toward Papa John's pizza."
College Sophomore,2,"You Need a Car – There are not too many parties on campus and since it is a Baptist university there is no drinking and any parties are well monitored. They are really strict about opposite sex visits so I really recommend having a car to go out, especially if you are looking for alone time with your partner."
Freshman,1,"Just sad
 There was no tutor no one to oversee 504 students with disabilities  we have met with him 3 times and still did not  Get any service But"
Freshman,1,"If you have a child with disability They do not help them
 And as for academic sports They mistreat them And I have reported this twice each time has not gotten a response Very poor for  Students with disabilities Maybe someone will call me but it has been months also
I have text messagesThis is very sad knowing that we pay really well for  Our students 
 To attend this University
 And the disability office also was no help 
 This has broke my signs spirit and love for his future shame on you HBU
 In let's not forget 504 was not even told to the teachers
 And never gotten his tutor"
College Junior,1,There is a total lack of rule enforcement within the dorms and apartments. Everyone does whatever they want. The curved building results in awkward rooms with very awkwardly curved walls. There is almost no lighting available in the rooms. The housing process is a complete mess because there is a new Residence Life staff each year. There isn't a social atmosphere to the dorms. The amenities are okay.
College Senior,1,"Wow. This school cares about the money from your tuition and that alone. I transferred here to join a new majorette team and before I could even audition, I was told they were ""postponed"" due to issues that they couldn't control. I was upset and spoke to the captain and she could only tell me that it was out of her hands and that the university had cancelled the auditions, not the team itself. This has been going on for months and now I'm thinking of transferring somewhere else. Every time I ask for more information on tryouts, I'm told that nobody's heard any information back. I was looking forward to joining this team and forming a sisterhood with the girls that I actually had a chance to meet personally but thanks to whatever higher up that cancelled the auditions without even offering a valid reason to the team members themselves, I think I'll go elsewhere and find a better fit for me. It's a shame."
College Freshman,1,The core curriculum is extensive. Most advisers are not organized and do not have the correct classes on file for the students. I am starting my sophomore year and my AP scores are still on file. My ACT scores were not on file last semester. The advisers have told students they need to take up to 12 hours of unnecessary classes.
College Freshman,1,HBU was at one time rated the worst dining hall. And it still should be.
College Sophomore,1,There is ABSOLUTELY NO night life or party scene
College Sophomore,1,It's a Christian University so everything is super conservative and boring.
College Senior,1,Focuses more on the aspect of improving lives both academically and spiritually.
College Freshman,1,"HBU is not a party school. But there are still students who have their ways of finding the right places to go to for nightlife. I don't know anything about bars, but for parties, your best bet is to go off campus to other schools such as UH or TSU."
College Junior,1,"They only offered AKA as part of the divine 9 and Delta Sigma Theta is needed to be on this campus, to give women options"
College Freshman,1,I don't usually done at school die to the poor quality of food unless it is a snack that is packaged.
College Freshman,1,"My school has a really strict policy regarding relationships and showing affection in public and also homosexual relationships. However, I had a friend who had a boyfriend and they would hold hands and kiss in public so there is so strict enforcement of the laws that I have witnessed."
College Freshman,1,"if you are social, hbu isnt the place for you. everyone leaves on the weekend, the baughs dining hours suck. not a fun place to be."
College Freshman,1,"they do not even have a track for the track team, the facilities that they do have, suck."
College Junior,1,"Christian School Enforces Godly Policies – Hbu is a drug free campus. 
However, like anywhere else, some people will sneak things in they shouldn't because they don't believe or want to abide by the standards the cool tries to set."
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do on campus but study at night.
College Junior,1,"Bad Quality and Little Choice – The on-campus cafeteria is notorious for its horrible food quality and complete lack of variety. There is one other location for actual dining - a mexican food line - and it's decent. For quick eating, there are a few places to grab snacks, but the prices are steep, and any substantial food is just taken from the cafeteria."
College Freshman,1,"Houston Baptist University has no nightlife at all because it is christian based. I never looked for any parties on or off campus that consisted of drugs, drinking, and/or sex. I am rarly in the club scene so I do not know much about the topic"
College Sophomore,1,"none, busses are unreliable and unsafe. without a car you are stuck on campus."

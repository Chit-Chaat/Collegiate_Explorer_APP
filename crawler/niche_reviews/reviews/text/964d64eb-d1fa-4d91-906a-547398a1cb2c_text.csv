Alum,5,South Univeristy was a great school because class sizes were small and professors really lookout for their students. The professor were either former police officers or have backgrounds in the criminal justice career where they were able to share experiences and knowledge with their students.
Freshman,5,The faculty is always available to help and more importantly willing to help. It is a small school so every knows each other. The quality of the professors is second to none.
College Junior,5,"The class sizes and professors are guaranteed to make the student that wants to learn all that they can successful in that achievement. This is not the school for young, fresh from high school students looking for their school to have social groups and activities. Only serious academics looking to achieve a quality, accelerated degree need apply. It is too expensive to mess around, requiring repeating courses."
College Junior,5,"The nursing program, and the students doing their clinicals in local facilities, are well respected for the quality of the nursing program. Students graduating with their BSN are offered jobs often from their externship locations."
College Junior,5,"The faculty and curriculum are outstanding. Students are expected to study and work for their grades. In turn, the professors and administration do everything they can to help those that are really trying to succeed."
College Junior,5,"It is a very expensive, small local college. If you are a returning adult student or a young adult only interested in getting a very high quality education, then this is the school for you. The classes are very small which allows the very qualified professors to focus on the educational needs of their students. The classes are as flexible as can be considering the size of the school and the resulting number of classes. Tuition is very high, but ebooks, tutoring, and printing is all part of tuition."
College Freshman,5,The student center and libraries on this campus are great.
College Junior,5,"We do not have athletic centers that I know of. But the student body is always having some type of fundraiser or event going on that all the other students are invited to. There is also usually some type of additional seminars that are hosted for students to attend, which is nice."
College Senior,5,"After getting my Bachelors in Nursing, I plan on getting a job and then advancing my degree."
College Senior,5,"Not much homework, Daily reading, tutoring is available, and the professors are very attentive and helpful!"
College Senior,5,"Because my major is a Bachelors in Nursing, the curriculum is more tougher and condensed than other schools around my area. Because of that, job opportunities are better for students who graduates from there."
College Senior,5,The student body consist of a variety of nationalities. South University considers all the students as equals.
College Sophomore,5,"you can access your account/ ecompaion from any computer on campus, and off campus as well, there tech person really knows her Stuff."
College Sophomore,5,"You have the library, they have their own website, they have a wide varitey of campus activites, No athletics, The career service department goes beyond the call of duty to help you find the right job in your career, and other jobs as well."
College Sophomore,5,"The financial Aid department at south is really the best they help you seek other scholariships, and grant money, and to be honest i think you get more for your money here than any other school in west palm beach, They help you understand where your money is going, they break it down and show you what you are receving. Tip just Fill out the Free Application Financial Aid"
College Sophomore,5,"The student Body here is really supportive it doesn't matter what your major or program is here at South University, whether its books, study groups. From start to the end they are really helpful."
College Sophomore,5,The student body are very friendly. They are helpful also and direct you in the right path.
College Sophomore,5,There are many classes available throughout the day and weekdays. The faculty is always available after hours. 
College Sophomore,5,Tuition is pricey but you get your moneys worth. 
College Sophomore,5,"The professors, the faculty, the students, just everyone there is always helpful."
College Sophomore,5,The advisors and registrar always go above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need and to make every process easy.
College Sophomore,5,I will be starting the program April 7th. Taking my prerequisites there has been great. I did better in courses and received all the help from many places.
College Sophomore,5,Library always open and the employees are vey helpful and polite.
College Sophomore,5,Computer labs always available and we are able to print on compus whenerver necessary

College Sophomore,5,The professors care more than other schools. They call you and follow up with you to ensure you are doing well.
College Sophomore,5,The online classes at South University are amazing. You learn a lot and get to interact with the professors and students. The professors ensure to always help and be available.
College Sophomore,5,there is always computers open and unlimited free printing.
College Junior,5,"
       I can say that South University is a very good school."
College Sophomore,5,they have worked around my busy work schedule nicley
College Sophomore,5,the networks are fast with multiple labs availabe
College Sophomore,5,there are libraries and tutors available always 
College Sophomore,5,perfect work load for busy students as myself
College Sophomore,5,they have free tutors and study hall programs 
College Sophomore,5,students who graduate find jobs immediately 
College Sophomore,5,everything has been easy going! 
College Sophomore,5,everyone is so friendly and helpful 
College Sophomore,5,My school is tailored to everyone's success 
College Junior,5,"Financial Aid at PBSC was horrible. But once I came to South, I worked with financial aid and the person I dealt with really helped me out with the whole process. I explained my experience at other schools and she was really understanding, unlike other schools financial aid really takes the time to understand your situation, your not just a number. The whole process was really made easy for me."
College Junior,5,"Online Courses are great! I love taking online classes. I took my Comp II class online and finish in 5 weeks! Its awesome, I love it. The online teachers really help with the material. As long as your willing to focus and do the then online classes will be like a walk in the park."
College Junior,5,"The academics are overall good so are is the curriculum. The homework varies depending on teachers, for example, my A&P I class we rarely had homework because it was mainly about studying. Although, they do give out study handouts that really help. The school also has two AICs (Academic Improvement Center) which designed to help/tutor students on general classes such as math and they've also got another AIC for medical classes. So if you've got questions about A&P, Patho, Micro, this is the place to go.  The class registration process is very easy, I've already recommended somebody here and they are starting this month! "
College Senior,5,Free printing. Lots of computers to use and always functional with a very helpful IT staff. Free wifi on campus as well works great!
College Junior,5,I have had no problems so far with my school. my classe schedules are convenient. I am taking both day and night classes and it is working just fine with me.
College Junior,5,The classes were straight to the point and don't on your own time.
College Junior,5,"Small Private Colleges â€“ As a South University student, the school has a great variety of fascinating teachers. I mostly love all my science teachers because they make sure you understand their materials."
College Freshman,5,They have a free tutoring program available for the students. Registration is easy.
College Freshman,5,"Had no problem transferring my credits.  I do however, have to repeat some classes because they were too old.  I understand, but I wish I didn't have to retake a couple of them."
College Freshman,5,My major is Health Sciences to go into Nursing BS program...The school pushes you to learn and doesn't allow you to slack off.  I need that.
College Freshman,5,"There isn't any athletic centers on campus, but the school has joined with a local community recreation center that allows students to join.  The library is small, however it is set up nicely along with the computer lab."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is there to learn.  Unlike other schools/Universities, there is no pressure for social class picking.  There are no clubs and it doesn't make you feel you are in high school.  The campus itself is in a very good location, and the maintenance is well kept."
College Freshman,5,South University has very caring staff...I was very nervous restarting school after so many years of being out.  The admissions director gave me positive reinforcement even up to this day.  All the staff in financial aid really try to help with any problems.  so far everyone has been friendly and I love that the class sizes are small.
College Senior,5,"The classses are very flexible. They have classes both day and night and on different days. So if you have a set schedule to work during the day you can take your classes at night, or online!

The transferring of my credits were very easy (40+). I had no problems coming from a semester-system school to a quarter-system school here at South."
College Sophomore,5,"I've never really used career services, but I know that they send out possible job opportunities. They also provide different dates for seminars that are meant to help prepare for post graduation."
College Freshman,5,"The Courses at South â€“ A course here in South is shorter than the typical university course. A regular 16 week course is condensed into to 11 weeks. The classes are fast paced, but the any homework or classwork assigned is fairly simple. The professors provide all the information required to get you into one of the programs. I would not recommend these types of courses for anyone who has a lot going on in their life. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you are guaranteed to succeed in these types of courses."
College Freshman,5,"Computer Labs, Library â€“ There are two computer labs with 30 up to date computers each. They provide all the necessities to complete any work that can not be done at home. The library is an excellent place to get information for any paper or project in any class. The three librarians and student helper specialize in finding a wide variety of information in a short amount of time. There are also computers there that are just as good as the computer labs. Printing is not a problem; you can print as much as you like in either color or gray scale.  The best thing about the resources is the free wi-fi. Students can access their personal laptops anywhere in the school if they choose to do so."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Small Class- Intimate Setting â€“ Small classes, individualized attention, hands on experience, guest speakers, friendly and courteous staff."
College Freshman,5,"South University: South U 4U â€“ So far I love my school. I love the environment that I a surrounded by, the respect that's given. I was scared at first but the students and faculity were very friendly and caring for one another. There are many reasons that makes South University very unique because 'in the spring of 2011 one of the South Unversity students by the name of Nicole O'Conner was hired on the spot at the campus in Tampa at the career fair' as stated on the school home page. I know just speaking with the teachers and faculity they are concern about the student and their education. They put the students first and make sure if thats what they really want to do. If I had to do everything all over again I ould choose South University because of the type of environent that the school is in. They helped me narrow my choice down to something that I would enjoy. The teachers and faculity are here to help you in any way that they can. I am a proud student to knowledge this statement."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Mixed Bag â€“ we are a mixed group from all ages, all ethnic/racial backgrounds"
College Sophomore,5,"Very Flexible â€“ The flexibility at South is wonderful. There are so many options in which you can attend and accelerate your graduation. They have day, evening, weekend and online courses.This is very important when you have 3 children and have to work."
College Sophomore,5,"The Scoop â€“ I really don't have an inside scoop to give. All I can say is that socially, eventhough I am older than most I feel quite comfortable. There is a nice diversity of students and everyone seems genuine and down to earth, as do the faculty. The schools I attended in the past were overwhelming. They were fast paced and nobody was very social. I actually felt intimidated and was in my early twenties. I don't feel that at South."
Junior,4,"I am a new student to South University. So far, It has been a pleasant experience. There has not been any moment where I did not feel as if I did not have the resources necessary to be successful. I transferred in from a bigger university and there I very much felt like a number. The small class sizes here make for an overall better learning experience. The only gripe I have is with the cost of Education."
Junior,4,"As a hesitant student looking to go back to school, this campus fell into my lap. Where I was just inquiring about the program turned into a four hour meeting and ended with myself enrolled. The faculty there are above and beyond and do their best everyday to help you succeed."
College Senior,4,studying and understanding the material is key
College Senior,4,This school is great due to the Professors.
College Senior,4,Learning a lot from experts in the field
College Senior,4,I glad I choose this school
College Junior,4,"I sometimes had difficulty scheduling a specific class around my availability, but waited for the following quarter and it was offered at a convenient time for me."
College Junior,4,They work for the placement of all of their graduates with pretty much 100% success of BSN graduates.
College Junior,4,"Great school, small, and the staff is phenomenal."
College Junior,4,"I finished my general classes here, it was easy transferring my credits from another college."
College Junior,4,"I can't really comment on the school as of yet because I'm planning to stat the program in the fall  semester 2015. From what I can surmise thus far is that the administrative staffs are very cordial, attentive  and eager to help."
College Sophomore,4,Although it is expensive this school has a lot of perks such as helpful teachers and kind students.
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small/average -maximum of I have seen was maybe 20 students. Almost 95% of the professors who I have had the pleasure of taking their classes are actually interested in their students performing well and want to see us succeed.
College Junior,4,"I took some classes like sociology, which I originally did not care to take before. But I am glad that I did, I really did learn a lot from that class, as well as other classes like public speaking. The professors I had when I took those classes made learning fun and interactive. Class registration has been made very easy. The registrars set up in one of our student lounges for a couple of days to register students for whatever classes they may have to take. Some of them are super friendly and are able to help accommodate you so you can work out your schedule according to what you are supposed to take. They have a very well put together system, so it flows really easily. Our school also offers tutoring which some professors have definitely made a point to some of us to attend. I have personally not used those services, as I did have on professor that came in on his day off to conduct a ""study group"" in class for students who wanted the help. It truly did help having a professor like that, that actually wanted to see his students succeed and take time from his personal life to help us."
College Junior,4,"I am not currently in the program yet. From the other students that I have spoken with that are currently in the program I am applying for, it is very intense. The workload is very heavy, so some students are unable to continue working while in school."
College Junior,4,I have not personally used the post-grad services since I am still in school and am currently working. I do plan on using the services once I am near graduating or graduated. I regularly get emails about updating my resume or someone offering help with resumes as well as attending job fairs.
College Junior,4,I have only taken one online class thus far. I had a pretty good experience. The professor was good about letting us know ahead of time of what would be due on what days and interacting with the students in the discussion. The professor also would give us feedback on what we may have had missed and where we could improve so that we would do good in the class. I would say the workload was pretty average considering it was done online instead of in a classroom setting. The peer to peer interaction was good. Students would always comment each other and ask each other questions just like it would be in a a real classroom setting.
College Junior,4,"Unfortunately because it is a private school, it is very pricey. I was not eligible for many loans, or even approved for any grants. So it did make it tough because I have to work full time to make out of pocket payments to even come to school, in addition to paying for all my textbooks and supplies. The business office staff was really good though about explaining on what would be covered and what would not. Also showing me what my out of pocket expense would be and how much it is going to cost me every month for a certain number of semesters."
College Junior,4,"There is always some type of event or function that the student body is hosting, which is nice- whether is it s fundraiser or seminar."
College Junior,4,"The school is great. I love the brand new campus and abundance of computer labs. The classes are small, which is a plus. But depending on your professor, for example one of the last classes I just took, my professor never gave our class any feedback. Our grade was based solely on bi-weekly tests. After our test, we were just given our test grade, but no explanation on what we missed or got correct, which is frustrating because when our final exam came up- it was cumulative. So I was sort of at a loss of what I needed to concentrate on, and what I was okay with. We did a ""review"" the class before our final, but there was no structure as to what exactly was going to be on it, our professor just asked what we did not feel confident with, and went over what the student was worried about- which ended up not even being on the exam. I ended up being held back for being ONE point off of what I needed to get in to my desired program!! I felt that I could have learned so much more if the professor actually took the time to go over or let us review our own tests to see what we actually got wrong in order to learn from it. Now I have to re-take the class and wait six months to reapply for the program."
College Sophomore,4,"I greatly enjoy a couple of my professors because they are not only smart but they are patient with the students whom need it. Also, the registration process is great. I missed registration and was still able to set up an immediate appointment and a professor made my schedule for me."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally enjoy the labs available for help. Although, I never utilized them at Palm Beach State College, I feel comfortable enough at South to do so and appreciate the help I have been given."
College Sophomore,4,I can easily interact with my classmates and get help if I need it.
College Sophomore,4,I don't need as many credits to get into my program
College Sophomore,4,Everything is close its not far to walk.
College Senior,4,"The overall experience is competitive. Because the tuition is so high, students take advantage of all the resourses provided."
College Senior,4,The campus is very clean and well kept that includes the restrooms and lunchrooms.
College Senior,4,Class selection time varies until you are in your major.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had the pleasure to meet with career services yet. However,  I do hear from other students they are wwonderful in helping find a job you love."
College Freshman,4,The prerequisite are good and helpful
College Freshman,4,Everything is close and available to you.
College Freshman,4,Computer network is good. No delay and is always available
College Freshman,4,I love the environment and the small classes...
College Sophomore,4,Registration is not a long and tedious process. The professors do well to deliver the information so every student can have a comprehensive grasp of the lesson being taught.
College Junior,4,I have heard great things from colleg alumnis about how quickly they have been able to find a place to beging their careers because of the great rep that South University has.
College Sophomore,4,Printing on campus is free which is awesome... the access to the labs is fairly great
College Sophomore,4,Their flexibility is schedules for me is great
College Sophomore,4,We are not traditional students. All ages its great lots of diversity
College Sophomore,4,It department and library is great
College Sophomore,4,"The schedules are pretty flexible, the offer a lot of classes with a different range of times"
College Sophomore,4,Although classes are accelerated the ultimate goal is to work towards your dreams instead of wasting time.
College Sophomore,4,"Printing is free which I like, printouts are double sided to save paper, and the network is reliable."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere, the quality, and that it is close to home. My only issue is the cost but it is a sacrifice to reach my dreams."
College Sophomore,4,Online classes are convenient and differ from the classroom setting because you go at your own pace and must be attentive to what you are reading. 
College Sophomore,4,I have a friend who graduated from this South and found a job quickly.
College Sophomore,4,It is expensive but everything was straightforward
College Sophomore,4,"they work with you, and that's what i like about the school."
College Sophomore,4,"small class sizes are also a huge plus for me, i get more attention from my professors."
College Sophomore,4,they do everything in their power to help their students.
College Sophomore,4,"this is my first semester at this school, and i enjoy it."
College Sophomore,4,everything was a smooth and very helpful process
College Sophomore,4,everything is based on personal needs 
College Junior,4,"Although this school is great their class flexibility are not so great. There are some really teachers at that school but in order to take classes with them you would most likely have to choose a morning class. But if you're like me then you are going to have to take evening classes with other teachers that are good but not great. Although there are some teachers who teach morning and evening classes, while attending school themselves. Now, those teachers are just astounding! The school should really have more of those teachers that are willing to teach at night."
College Junior,4,What I really like about this school is their AICs (Academic Improvement Center) designed to help struggling students. I was having trouble with A&P 1 because I have no prior experience in the medical field but South has an AIC specifically for Nursing students. 
College Senior,4,its expensive. but that brings better teachers and more resources for learning
College Senior,4,Not much for a social scene. No sports or any other physical activities to join. This is a campus to get an education on a specific skill. In and out and off to start a career!
College Senior,4,It is a very intense program! You have to be very self motivated to keep up!
College Senior,4,Its a small program and you stay with the same class group throughout! So make friends with your classmates and teachers!
College Junior,4,"Most of the students that go to South University have a busy life schedule just like me, so they come to do their work and rush out to get to whatever else it is they have on their agendas. I have come across all kinds of people, young, old, finanacially stable, and some that are struggling."
College Senior,4,Good PTA program that offers both a day and night option! I had no issues at all with registering/fin. Aide etc. the staff is all very pleasant and very invested teachers.
Sophomore,2,The school charge you monthly fee for going to school. Instead of allowing you to go to school an focusing on your academics instead they hound you down about monthly payments. The teachers are amazing its just the finical office isn't the best to work it they will put a hold on your hold until you can pay. Which in most cases students go to school to help better themselves off in long run. If they change the policy about monthly payments allow students to continue going without paying payments every month it would be an amazing school.
College Sophomore,2,Wireless speed is average and there is only one computer lab available to student for the entire day
College Senior,2,The only good thing about this school is that the legal studies program is approved by the American Bar Association.
College Junior,2,"Okay With Choice, Not Necessarily Happy With It. It's far. It's expensive. But it's where I am. I don't think that I would want to choose it again if I were given the choice."
Graduate Student,1,"DO NOT ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY. I was sweet-talked into enrolling in the BSN. I was told ALL of my credits DISCUSSED before enrollment were APPROVED and that I just needed to take a couple of more classes. After enrolling, they said to me that I needed to take more classes; in which case you have no option. Tried contacting counselorsâ€”referred me to registrarsâ€”referred me to director of the program...so on and so on, I did not get any help or resolution. My tuition for two classes was over $4,000, and THEY WILL NOT RELEASE YOUR TRANSCRIPTS. BEWARE OF THIS INSTITUTION"
College Senior,1,"There are just a few professors that makes the education worth while. The tuition is expensive and keeps increasing almost every semester. The financial aid office only offer limited resources. For example, there it is only two banks that are affiliated to the school that provides student loans. So if you are not approved by either of them in case you need, then you pretty much are sol."
College Senior,1,"Financial Aid isn't helpful, everyone goes through verification and they pull Aid without trying to help at all"
College Senior,1,there arent enough resources and there is very little available to students on campus.
College Senior,1,"very basic, Wish there was more available based on the price of tuition"
College Sophomore,1,I am really frustrated with the help they give students.  When you go and sign up they are all happy and excited.  But when you need for them to be a little understanding you do not receive the same treatment.
College Sophomore,1,Financial Assistance â€“ I had a problem where I had to stop my classes almost at the end of the winter quarter.  Because the school did not receive my high school transcript on time they were not able to receive my financial aid funds on time.  So here I am paying 284.00 a month were I am basically living of unemployment and child support.  The school knows my financial situation and are not able to make my payments affordable.
Recent Alumnus,1,No Job Placement â€“ As far as I know the school provides no job placement

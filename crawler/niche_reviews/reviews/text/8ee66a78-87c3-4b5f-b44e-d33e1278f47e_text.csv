Graduate Student,5,"I completed my Masters of Strategic Leadership and I am currently completing my Doctorate in Executive Leadership from UCWV.  The leadership programs are second to none.  As a former senior enlisted leader in the U.S. Air Force, these programs are very relevant to leaders today."
Graduate Student,5,"The UCWV online programs are amazing.  Unlike logging in, doing work, and logging off, UCWV has at least one interactive Blackboard Collaborate, Zoom, or Teams meeting a week, and relates current events to help students understand their academic materials."
Junior,5,Excellent communications.  The admissions process was not complicated.  I've been in touch with my counselors and given vital information to ensure my success.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. I am originally from Indiana and I moved here for the small school size and outstanding nursing program. The professors are so helpful as are the peer tutors. Every advisor or professor is solely dedicated to helping your success in whatever you choose to partake in in school. This school is for people who like the smaller town feel, but loves to visit the city. The school is right across the river from downtown Charleston and there is always something going on downtown. This school is everything I was looking for and more."
Graduate Student,5,"So far, so good. Transfer doc student and I am enjoying the process of UCWV as well as dynamic professors and challenging coursework. Highly recommend the grad programs."
Sophomore,5,"As a native West Virginian, there is very little opportunity to live on a campus that allows for both diversity in thought and culture. The University of Charleston proudly accepts students from all around the globe. The majority of the friends I made were international students. These bonds helped to broaden my understanding of the world around me. I can think of no better place in West Virginia to find such a rare and enriching opportunity like this!"
Niche User,5,"Our experience touring University of Charleston was wonderful.  The campus was very clean and absolutely beautiful.  Classrooms, hallways, and all areas that we were able to see on the tour were clean and very nicely decorated with beautiful art work.  The lunch we were provided was exceptional.  The outside campus was very quaint with lots of nature."
Sophomore,5,"I always feel like a priority at this school. My advisor works tirelessly with me to make sure I am on the right path for my future. I never feel like ""just a number."" My professors know my name and I am able to build relationships with them. The school is always so clean and tidied. The place is taken care of very well. The outside of campus is beautiful. The landscaping is always immaculate. This school feels like home to all students. There are a number of diverse students within the schools population and that is so cool."
Freshman,5,"The University of Charleston is an excellent school that offers much diversity. Excellent professors, always willing to help whether it be a personal problem or a school problem. Many professors help as much as possible and are always holding study  sessions for the whole class. they try to hit as many study techniques as possible to be available to all students."
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience with UC. The staff has helped me at every turn to get me ready. I believe they truly want the students to succeed.
Graduate Student,5,"UC offers so much for their students. I am very impressed with the resources that are available. Everyone has been so kind and welcoming, not only on campus, but around town as well!"
Freshman,5,"I am anti-social person but with this small and friendly, yet convenient campus, everyone has made it helpful for new ideas. Professors and students work together very well and make the time here much easier. It is overall a fun campus."
Sophomore,5,I love the unity of  the university! I felt like I belonged there and I had a great repore with the faculty. I could go to the staff for anything.
Niche User,5,"The University of Charleston is an incredibly prestigious facility with a variety of majors to meet a majority of careers.  The campus is small, safe, and incredibly easy to navigate compared to large universities.  Also, it is a campus with high expectation as far as academics, being that a 3.75 is required to meet the Dean's list, making it the highest, both public and private, in the state of West Virginia."
Freshman,5,"At this moment, I am a high school student planning to attend the University of Charleston.  From my visits to the campus, all of these values below could be rated.  The campus is in a great location and has great potential in every aspect that is presented there."
Junior,5,"The University of Charleston is a small college with an on campus population of about 4500 students; therefore we are a close knit group. This is one of the many aspects that I have grown to appreciate about the University of Charleston. More face to face professor time, better classroom seating, a more friendly and comfortable environment. Everyone knows everyone and while that may not be the universal college experience I could not ask for a better situation."
College Freshman,5,The football team and soccer teams are very good and make it far every year. The softball team is very good as well and could go very far in the conference. The baseball team is on the rise and will be good in a few years.
College Freshman,5,Very small campus so the classroom sizes are small as well. This allows the professors to be more involved with every student in the class and can be very helpful.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. I don't have to worry at all about being harassed or harmed while I'm at school.
College Freshman,5,"It's a very small campus, which I love. Also, the teachers are always there when you need them and are willing to help you."
College Junior,5,"Because of the size of our campus, safety and security is important.  We all look after each other."
College Junior,5,Faculty are engaged with their students and are also involved in the community.
College Junior,5,Best athletic attention for a DII program.
College Junior,5,Great individualized attention due to it's smaller size.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school-- it is my safe haven. I can be anything, or anyone when I am there. My professors, friends and mentors really care about my well being and I feel like I can succeed in life. UC was the best decision I have ever made."
College Freshman,5,The school sent emails and letters all the time.  I got updates on what still needed to be done and what I still had to do.  Made it so easy
College Freshman,5,UC is honestly an excellent school to attend if you want to graduate early and avoid writing and speech classes.
College Freshman,5,It is a lot cheaper to live off-campus than on campus.
College Sophomore,5,It is very diverse. Lots of international students and students with varying view points.
College Sophomore,5,"The nursing program at my school is great. The teachers are really there to help you learn, not like most other nursing programs. I enjoy going there and learning so that I can someday be out working as a nurse."
College Freshman,5,"There are computers everywhere, there is always a computer you are able to get on."
College Junior,5,International Students – There are many international students attending UC
College Junior,5,Excellent IT Department – UC does a very good job at maintaining the computers on campus to ensure availability for use.
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of Variety – The dorms at the University of Charleston are extremely nice. They are bigger compared to other dorms and there are also many options such as individual rooms, apartments, suites, and regular dorms. All are very nice and clean. However freshman are only allowed to live in dorms, the rest are reserved for upperclassmen."
College Student,5,"Places to Eat – There's plenty of places to eat. There's not much of a cost either. Some examples are Red Lobster, Hibatchis, McFonalds, Logan's Roadhouse, Texas Steakhouse, Olive Garden, and many many many more"
College Student,5,"Not Bad – All of the main underclass man buildings being connected is very nice when the weather is bad, and the dorms are close enough to the classes that very few people can complain."
College Freshman,5,There is many students from different states and also different countries who are enrolled at the University of Charleston.  This makes it very diverse because there are many accents and also different ethic background from different people
College Freshman,5,"Its Very Fun – There is always something going on here. There is no reason to just sit in the dorm, there is so much to do."
College Sophomore,5,"Community Service – There are many opportunities for community service at UC.  The school takes pride in its community service, and is well-known for it.  Therefore, if one would like to participate in community service, it is easy to find something that would be interesting to that person."
College Sophomore,5,"No Cheating – At UC, there is a very strict Academic HOnesty Policy.  There is absolutely no cheating allowed at UC. If you cheat you automatically fail the course, and have to retake it if it is available.  If you are caught cheating again, you are dismissed from the university.  I think this is great because it is not fair if someone cheats, and gets an advantage over honest students."
Sophomore,4,The professors and peer educators were very helpful and genuinely wanted me to exceed during my freshman year.
Sophomore,4,"I had a couple online courses, but during the spring semester all courses transitioned online due to the pandemic.  All of the instructors continued to be helpful, but biology labs and my calculus course was tough online.  Overall, the learning experience was good."
Sophomore,4,"I am a student at the University, my overall experience has been super positive especially with the food, student life, and most professors. I cant really think of anything to complain about other than a few bad professors, but that happens anywhere. I would really recommend this school to anyone who can afford it, super friendly and helpful!"
Sophomore,4,"I really live the feeling you get when you step on campus. It still feels like college but, like for me it wasn’t overwhelmingly big and make you feel like you are nothing there just a number. You get to know your perfectos one on one and grow great relationships with other people."
Freshman,4,The online hybrid nursing program made it possible for me to pursue my goal while still working full time. The staff members and professors are helpful and friendly as well.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with University of Charleston has been very pleasant so far, I have had nothing but tons of help and guidance from the admission's staff, and I can't wait to get started with my classes. I highly recommend this College, it has programs to fit my busy schedule and I love that aspect."
Junior,4,"The school has a gorgeous campus, it is obvious that much time and thought has went into the landscape design. The school is very diverse and features many students from other parts of the world and different races. Professors are very helpful and determined to help each individual student reach their goals, and academics are highly emphasized at the school. Overall, it is a beautiful school with professors that are determined to help their students succeed."
Junior,4,"The school is a small college so it is very easy to get one on one with the professors, which makes for a good learning environment."
Senior,4,"Staff is kind
Good about giving out scholarships
Campus is pretty
Nice school for athletes
A lot of events if you're the kind of person who likes to get involved"
Freshman,4,"I go to the Beckley campus. It seems to be a great school/environment. I am attending their ADN  program. Which seems to be going okay. However, I am terrified of the boards exam. Just hope I will make a great nurse some day. Here's to the next three years of my life. Being stressful and trying."
Junior,4,The University of Charleston is well diversed and pprovides students with many activities to choose from. There are advisors there to help each student succeed.
Junior,4,"The University of Charleston is probably the very best pick for me when it comes to a campus community. I wanted to continue my education at a school that was widely diverse in everything it had to offer, but also a little on the smaller side. UC is exactly that. Student Life has helped me so much in the past two years that I have been in school here, and the people that I have met in my field of study are exactly the people that I have always wanted to surround myself with."
Junior,4,"The University of Charleston is a very unique school that attracts students from many backgrounds and embraces differences. There are a wide variety of groups, sports and activities to become involved in at this school. The University of Charleston really focuses on making each student feel comfortable expressing his or her self while continuing their education. However, like any other University, each students' experience is what he or she makes out of it."
Freshman,4,"I go to the Beckley Campus for Regishered NUrsing and I really like it. It is a good place. there may not be on campus housing at the beckley campus but that doesnt matter to me. I honestly find this school worth it. I like it when a college allows us to be challenged and this collage does this and so much more. the beckley campus is geared toward the careers that are in the highest demand in this area, medical. they have nursing classes, Radiology technology, occupational therapy, and a few others."
Freshman,4,"Charleston started out tough because my 3rd class was dropped due to lack of instructor and then my account with the wouldn't open the first week. But now that it is up and running,  I love this school ! The online classes are awesome!"
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful and look to help each student be successful
College Freshman,4,Our soccer team was number one in the country for the past couple of years. Our school is very involved in sports most of the programs have successful seasons
College Freshman,4,"Dorms are sweet. Nice amount of space, close to your classes. no community bathrooms. A good perk about the school."
College Sophomore,4,The science programs at UC are very effective in preparing students for grad school and for their future careers. Difficult but efficient area of study at UC.
College Freshman,4,the freshman rooms are sort of small but clean building.
College Freshman,4,"Football, Soccer are among the top at our campus.  Have a lot of competitive student athletes that have good on to Major NFL and FIFA . We are great athletes but it is promised that we will get hear/clothing handed out.  Our cleats are not good at all. Left from previous years. We don't have a Band so that kind of stinks. We do have a lot of alumni come out to support our teams, as well as the facility staff and students.  It is the thing to do here at Charleston, WV"
College Freshman,4,Most students after earning a degree will find a job and be successful.
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere on campus is very welcoming. Teachers and students are friendly and accepting of others.
College Freshman,4,"Student involvement is very important at the University of Charleston. People go all out for sporting events, showing school spirit."
College Junior,4,Career Center brings a wide variety of potential employers to job fairs on campus.
College Freshman,4,What I like best about this school is the small class sizes. You get to know people faster and better than you would at a larger school.
College Sophomore,4,"UCSOP is my first choice of all pharmacy schools nationwide. After studying here for 1 year, I could proudly say I would never regret my decision to become a student of this amazing school."
College Sophomore,4,I love my school. It's a really close knit group of people and you get to know just about everybody in your first year.
College Freshman,4,its a really small school - sexual assualt isn't really a problem.
College Freshman,4,"There's a lot of variety, pizza, chinese, almost anything you'd like can be delivered."
College Freshman,4,"Although there are alcohol rules, the RAs in the dorms don't really do anything to stop it or the noise."
College Freshman,4,There's a lot of restaurants near campus since it is located across the river from downtown Charleston.
College Senior,4,my friends live off campus and they love it
College Senior,4,selection of classes is decent for such a small campus
College Freshman,4,Campus security is very helpful.  The officers are constantly walking around campus (or driving).   They are always around and are willing to walk you to and from your car if you ever feel threatened at night.
College Freshman,4,"Overall there are various options in the Charleston area; however, there convenience is another matter.  Most options are located along corridor G, somewhat out of the way from campus.  Ultimately, it depends on your willingness to drive out of your way.  Cost is average with restraints such as Olive Garden, TGI Friday's, Quaker Steak and Lub etc."
College Freshman,4,The University of Charleston encourages its' students to become involved in at least one club on campus.  Student involvement is high and there is much school spirit on game days.  Athletics teams are fairly good with our soccer team taking 2nd place in the nation.  Our athletic facilities are currently being updated along with a new gym being built.
College Freshman,4,Lots of variety very close to campus
College Freshman,4,I am not sure about student discounts but there is fast food close by and some local restaurants.
College Sophomore,4,"Security is very strict on alcohol and drugs, but students get away with it more than they get caught. It doesn't cause problems on campus though."
Junior,2,"Disappointing, especially if you live on campus and definitely not worth it considering how expensive this school is.  Basically, if you don’t play sports there, you aren’t s***. The college COULD be nice, but they don’t put money where it SHOULD be going to make it a good experience for everyone. They’re building yet another sports complex, meanwhile their classrooms and labs are very outdated (minus innov center). Majority of staff and teachers were unhelpful and some very rude too. Also, their pharmacy program is probably the easiest to get into. Their minimum admissions gpa is only ~2.7. Most ACCREDITED and REPUTABLE schools are a 3.0 minimum. The school to me just seemed to have a lot of disorganization too. I will be going back home to Pittsburgh and attending Duquesne for pharmacy school. 1000x better and nicer for the money."
College Freshman,2,There are only a couple fraternities and sororities. They are also really small and not diverse. No attention is given to the greek life.
College Sophomore,2,Current status with courses and professors is awful. I am on the waiting list for all but one class (six out of seven) and am terrified that I will have to do an extra semester because of the unavailability of the classes I need. My stats professor is unorganized her inconsistency is making it difficult for me to stay on top of the class. This is the frist time she has taught this course.
College Sophomore,2,Administration doesnt do their job
College Freshman,2,In my situation it is pretty bad because I changed my major and I was just informed that I will need to go to summer school in order to have all of the needed pre-requisites.
College Freshman,2,The director of the nursing program is extremely rude and the advisor of the nursing program waitlist isn't very bright.
College Senior,2,It is extremely tough for international students to get one as we are denied internship because we are international students and they prefer hiring the local ones
College Freshman,2,"The nursing program at the University of Charleston is a good program with great faculty.  However, the application process is very unusual.  In order to be considered for the program you must take and pass a TEAS Exam before even considering you for the program.  This is a fairly simple exam that measures your abilities in math, science, english and reading; however, I believe this University places too much emphasis on this exam."
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, they act like you're going to get a lot of money for coming here, but most of us end up paying way more than we can afford just to attend another high school."
College Sophomore,2,Campus crime is very low. Very rarely happens and when it does it is something minuscule. Security is basically useless. They say they are willing to help but are really just glorified rent-a-cops. There is no campus health center. At all. I'm not kidding.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is one of the biggest complaints of this school. They have recently added a new campus to UC, but have not added any more financial aid employees. Therefore there is only one office running two campuses. If you call and leave a message, do not expect a call back. They frequently do not know what they are talking about, and will confuse or screw up your financial aid when given the chance. Tips for anyone about to start this process? Go there in person. You might have to wait a while to see someone, but you will be better taken care of this way. Also, ask for Michelle, she's the best one they have there."
College Sophomore,2,"If you are not 21, your options are limited. Either stay in to drink and hang out with your friends, and risk getting caught by an RA or security (which means a boat load of community service or fines), or you go downtown to the local gay bar, Atmosphere, and watch the drag show. Atmosphere can be interesting and a lot of fun if you're open minded, but the same scene every weekend gets old. If you are 21 and over there are a variety of bars you can go to, all of which are a fairly good time, however crime at these bars has been increasing. Some parties can be found at the sports houses though, if you know the right people, but sometimes these parties get busted as well. Cabs are fairly cheap and easy to get."
College Freshman,2,"Its EVERYWHERE, every Wednesday-Sunday night there is always a hoard of drunk people running around campus screaming and causing a scene."
College Freshman,2,"Guys are really nice, but none of them seem to be looking into anything more than a random hook-up. There is a larger amount of girls than guys."
College Junior,2,"freshman park across campus in a garage even though there is a parking lot right next to the freshman dorms. you get a ticket your first time and booted your second, not very lenient on parking"
College Junior,2,"Not a lot in the city itself, you have to be 21 to get in unless you have connections. Mostly bars downtown. otherwise you have to go an hour away for anything else"
College Junior,2,It's very boring for someone that doesn't live relatively close to the school. Not a lot to do.
College Junior,2,"You can never find security, they're rarely in there office."
College Sophomore,2,you have to park in a current spot and it you dont you get a ticket.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a whole lot to offer.  However, there are the general shopping and eating places to keep things upbeat.  The night life is not so great, but there are things to do.  These things include: movies, ice skating, hiking and scenery oriented things.  I wish there were some museums, aquariums or something interesting to do on the weekends or when I got a bit of time from school."
Niche User,1,THIS IS A VERY RACIST INSTITUTION! Always trying to intimidate you in some way and give preferential treatments to the white population.Very expensive tuition for below average education. Some professors  cannot teach so I basically have to teach myself! Very Mediocre and pathetic place. The university values sports over academics. Absolutely absurd! Do not come to this university!
College Sophomore,1,"Personally know too many victims of sexual assault on campus. Way too common. Most victims are females, but I know of a few male victims as well. Almost all students choose to look the other way. This characteristic of UC disgusts me. I resent the RDs and much of the faculty here for not taking the problem seriously, this should be the top priority for every employee at UC, UNARGUABLY. College women are at the highest risk for sexual assault out of anyone else in the United States. The boys here do not watch each others behaviors, they do not look after their female friends, they will look the other way if they see a problem, and the girls undermine the situations they hear about or that they have been put in."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at UC is near nonexistent. The members may have fun, but non-Greeks have no idea about anything that Greek students do."
College Sophomore,1,They dont want to give money out to the students working hard
College Freshman,1,"Not very many parties, but when people want to get drunk, they get DRUNK."
College Freshman,1,I hated living on campus! The RA's didn't care what anyone did and they rarely did anything about the noise complaints.
College Freshman,1,They rarely do anything special.
College Sophomore,1,"Dining here is awful. The hours are very limited. Depending on which meal plan you chose you only have so many meals per week. That being said if you have 14 meals a week, you have two meals a day. However, if you choose to eat lunch at 4, because thats when you get out of class for the day, you've just used your dinner meal. Therefore, you have no meal for the rest of the day. Lunch runs from 11-4. Dinner from 4-11. So even though you have two meals that day, you have to use them at certain times or else you lose them. Food is overpriced. Students almost always spend more than their meal plan. The starbucks is only open until 7pm, and not at all on weekends. So there is no place for students to get coffee at those times. Unacceptable. The Food Court has 3 stations, subs, mexican, and the grill. However, mexican is only open until 2, and only one of the other stations will be open after 6. The other option is the cafeteria where they serve a meat (usually bleeding beef, chicken, or pork), with some sort of steamed vegetable, and some form of potato. In the fusion line, they will create something with the leftover food from yesterday, bake it in a pasta and call it cuisine. But hey, theres always the variety of off brand cereals to choose from if those options don't appeal to you. Oh, and If you have a food allergy, or IBS, or any type of food related problems, forget about eating on campus. Almost everything there ""may contain nuts"" and literally EVERYTHING will do terrible things to your stomach."
College Freshman,1,"I tried pledging, I realizied the girls were stuck up and rude. If you pledge and then quit they treat you like dirt and have a tendency to talk about you behind your back, or so I've heard..."
College Junior,1,The school is money hungry and I'm paying more than  I should be to attend
College Sophomore,1,"As a pharmacy student, I have an internship due to the fact that we have to accomplish a certain number of hours in order to sit for our NAPLEX exam in order to get our pharmacist's license when we graduate.  Unfortunately I have not had any help in getting my internship and wish that the school would help students with things such as this."
College Freshman,1,No one stays on weekends because there are no activities. I dont see why people go to college just to go depend on mom and dad every weekend. College is supposed to be independent time.
College Sophomore,1,The computers at UC are horrible. The systems are out of date in the library and rarely connect to the internet. The only computers that do work are in one lab. They also take forever to start up.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Garage – We got a parking garage that is completely paid for, yet they charge every student 100 dollars to park there. The garage is nice, but it is not fair we have to pay for it when the school got donations and grants to have it paid for."

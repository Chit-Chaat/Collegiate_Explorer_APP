Freshman,5,Everyone is super sweet and makes me feel special. The campus is also beautiful and feels extremely safe.
Freshman,5,Havent taken any online classes although I know people who have and they seem to enjoy it and actually are learning
Sophomore,5,"Hood College is a great school, especially for people who love science. The Hodson Science Center is maculous, and the professors are great. My favorite parts about Hood College are the people, the campus, the professors, and of course, the science programs!"
Junior,5,Hood is an amazing school with a close knit community. Hood offers amazing opportunities for each and every major. I feel as an education major that i am valued both at Hood and within the community of Frederick.
Niche User,5,"Hood is great. Since class sizes are so small you get to know people easily. The teachers are always willing to cater to you (within reason) when you need help. I feel like you get a really personal experience. Plus downtown Frederick is awesome, theres a lot to do!"
Freshman,5,"After my first year (being cut short), I really learned to love Hood College. Hood is definitely a small school and not a huge party school. It is extremely easy to make friends (everyone is really friendly). Wherever you go people always say Hi and you’ll know a lot of people by name. If you want to go out and party you can. You can find parties if you allow yourself and many people go! It’s an overall amazing experience and I recommend this school to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,Hood is a small school but with a lot of potential for students to succeed at. Professors are very knowledgeable and the small class sizes allow for personal relationships between the students and professors. There are a lot of opportunities to engage in activities outside of academics.
Niche User,5,"Hood College is a school that values their students. They make sure every student has equal opportunities, and they provide many great experiences."
Junior,5,"I love Hood College, for it is a small campus, with small classrooms and dedicated teachers. The community is strong and connected, well-known in the greater neighborhoods. It is easy to meet people and make friends. The buildings are gorgeous, and every stair creaks with history. The faculty have all been extremely helpful, whether they be teachers, the registrar, accounting, or in the library. Hood offers excellent tutoring, with many available slots, and many tutors ready to help. 

If I could change anything about Hood, I would add on to the social work program, expanding it into a Master’s degree. Having to go from a college like Hood to any other in order to attain a social work Master’s degree is a jarring, disagreeable option. Hood is a school unlike any I have been to, and I look forward to the next few years here."
Sophomore,5,I love hood. From the first time I toured the campus the staff all made me feel like I was part of the family. It’s a place where you know that the staff really cares about the students as individuals.
Sophomore,5,"I love this college! I made so many friends my first year,  and I regularly found myself walking around campus to attend events with my peers. I see a lot of people complain that there isn't anything to do here, but there IS, you just have to read the weekly emails to see the huge list of all available activities (which many students never do). The academics and professors are also top-notch, and I always received the guidance I needed when I asked for help."
Freshman,5,"The experience I've had at Hood College is actually better than I imagined. It all started at the College Open House there some months ago, I loved it and their food as well. Recently, I went there for Accepted Students Day. I came there still being undecided on the college I would attend and I left with the decision on going to that school. I also found a roommate too and she came there undecided as well so that experience went well."
Niche User,5,"The first thing I noticed was how beautiful the campus was. I had a euphoric feeling as I walked through the campus. I made an instant connection with a sophomore at Hood College. The sophomore her roommate, and staff were amicable. It made me feel as though, it would be easy to make friends. I saw state of the art manikins that were in the simulated patient rooms. This allowed me to imagine myself at Hood College in the nursing program."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Hood College is the diversity and small community that you have on campus. At Hood you begin to feel as if you are part of a family. All professors are very nice and are very willing to help you. The athletic programs at Hood College are wonderful, they are a big part of the school and a great way for students to get involved. The dorms are always kept very clean, the custodial crew does a very good job at keeping everything up and running. The saftey on campus is amazing there are blue lights all over for safety. The location is my favorite part the down town has so much to do. There are places for all groups of people from families to college students."
Senior,5,"Really great, small school. You have to want to attend a liberal arts school. Business department is thriving and most popular majors reside in the business department. The resources available are tremendous and Hood does its best to place students."
Senior,5,"This college experience has taught me about respecting other cultures,  other people's feelings, and most of all we learn to be one big family. Learning and curiosity is always encouraged. New friends that have become lifelong friends."
Sophomore,5,I loved my experience at Hood College. Teachers were approachable and passionate about their subjects. Administrators and deans were equally approachable and visible to the students and participated in many campus events. The students and families in the neighborhood were down to earth and kind. I enjoyed the small campus setting which allowed one to get to know many people on a personal level.
Senior,5,"I have been attending Hood for just about 3 years and I really enjoy the campus, academics and the staff. Everyone on the campus is friendly and lend a helping hand when needed. The only thing I wish that was different is the sports and the clubs."
Junior,5,This is my first semester at Hood College! I am a transfer student from Montgomery College. I commute to school. So far I am enjoying this school. 
College Junior,5,"We have a great security in place here. With emergency buttons around campus, and live security guys here who have experience with a criminal justice degree, you feel safe. The students here look out for each other but it's generally as safe as a neighborhood could be. There is a counseling area and health center here that are always welcome, but also you teachers and staff always there to help and listen as well."
College Junior,5,Most of your teachers all have had jobs within the field that they are teaching so they really give you many great contacts and are able to teach you what you really need to know. There is such a variety of classes to take as well so you never get bored. All of the teachers are very passionate about what they do!
College Junior,5,"Frederick's food and community events are great, you just have to get involved."
College Sophomore,5,"So many options, some within walking/biking distance of campus."
College Sophomore,5,Downtown Frederick is awesome for dining options.
College Sophomore,5,I have almost a full ride
College Freshman,5,They make sure that everyone is involved and they are very caring and nurturing people.
College Freshman,5,I love the many activities that hood has on campus for resident. Each dorm has a different uniqueness with different themes in the building.
College Freshman,5,"I happen to love the city of Frederick. Coming from a small town, it is a great transition to a bigger area. It isn't overwhelmingly large but there is lots to do especially in the down town area which is five minutes from campus. The only people that complain about Frederick are those from huge cities such as New York, which is to be expected. Great night life if you're 21."
College Freshman,5,Anything off campus is considered great.
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus was a nice experience.
College Student,5,"I absolutely love Downtown Frederick. It is such a wonderful town community to be part of. They have the first saturday downtown, and I try my best not to miss it. The community is so friendly and kind."
College Student,5,"Everyone truly is accepting here. I have never seen someone shunned for who they are. Hood is a very open, accepting community. It's one of the best aspects of Hood."
College Student,5,"I think that Hood was the best decision I could have made. The school really showed that they cared about their prospective students. I loved receiving post cards about my visits from my admission counselor. It was such a wonderful feeling to recognize some students in the papers I received. I think the most important criteria for admission is how much of a well rounded person you are. The best tip I can offer, is to be your self and really show you want to be part of the Hood community. It is truly such a great place, and I am so excited to be part of the Hood College legacy."
College Sophomore,5,Nothing negative to say at all.  We have fabulous dorms with their own bit of unique flair.  Keep in mind the bathrooms are stupendous since it was once strictly women.  Upper class apartments are available within walking distance as well. 
College Sophomore,5,We have an awesome student center along with a new gaming area so lots to do.  Our library is state of the art with plenty of places to study
College Sophomore,5,Our school is one of the most diverse places I have ever been.  We cover every spectrum and the level of acceptance is what is one of the most wonderful attributes that Hood College has to offer.  
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid office is truly the best place on campus.  They work very hard to make things as easy as possible but they also demand that you keep your grades are maintained
College Sophomore,5,"My mother went to Hood and there are some spots that we both enjoy when she comes to town.  Downtown Frederick, MD is a hot spot and so much fun to explore when it comes to dining..mexican, spanish, italian, greek..lebanese, and even an ethiopian spot.  "
College Sophomore,5,Brilliant professors!  They force you to think beyond anything I could ever have expected in high school.  Work load is heavy but that is what we are there for..to learn.  Registration is easy and their staff is very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,I am Business Major with a concentration in Accounting and Finance.  Work is challenging and the expectation is high.  I work very hard and it pays off.  Facilities are fabulous and our required internship for graduation is a huge plus for employment after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,Never a bit of concern when it comes to safety at my school.  We have top of the line people
College Sophomore,5,Hood is amazing. The campus in a great location in one of the best cities I've ever been in. We have lots of different classes and majors. We have nice room and good food and even a couple good sports team. The environment in which we are surrounded is good for both study and play. The campus is beautiful with all of it old building and beautiful flowers. 
College Sophomore,5,"At Hood College it is great to be a history major. Since the college is on the east coast it is very close to many of the most historic town, cities and places in the country.  The workload of a history major is not all that bad it just involves lots of studying, reading and writing as to be expected.The program available to us are amazing to we can study general history, history with a degree in Secondary Education or Public History. curriculum is very dense and there are several classes that are mandatory but there are also a lot of fun and interesting classes that count toward history and many of the other majors."
College Sophomore,5,"The City of Frederick is a city with a small town vibe. It is gorgeous and their is always something to do here. The student of Hood College are very accepted among to natives of Frederick. Downtown Frederick is hot spot of shopping with small shops and novelty stores such as Retro Metro, a sort of gift shop, and The Pop Shop, a store filled with nostalgic and hard to find soda and a record exchange and a rock pop, that sell to rock and mineral collectors. A cool attraction found in Frederick is a monthly tradition called First Saturday, which takes place on the first Saturday of every month. On this day, the shop all stay open late and usually have sale or give coupons or free samples. Other cool attraction include a museum on Civil War era medicine, another museum in town is called Schifferstadt Architectural Museum it is a authentic German style house from the 1700s. Another cool historical attraction is Rose Hill Manor, a Civil War era plantation house where they have a museum and hold reenactments occasionally. Frederick is also home to many cool restaurants such as Volt very fancy nd expensive but very neat; Another is Pretzel and Pizza Creations which serves the best pretzels, pizzas, hot dogs and sandwiches around and they use pretzel dough for all of these recipes: another is Isabella's an authentic tapas bar; And a sandwhich shop called the 7th Street Sandwich Shop that sells organic and locally grown product at a cheap price with good size portions "
College Sophomore,5,"Hood College is an amazing school that is filled with the lots of great classes, students, teachers and people. When I am there I feel like I'm am right where I  belong and I would not change it for the world "
College Sophomore,5,All the students at good have a variety of  players as well as equipment. Every student at good loves there sports and coach!
College Junior,5,"Hood is beautiful. There are endless amenities like a pool, modern athletic center, a welcoming student center and commuter lounge, beautiful landscaping and amazingly renovated historic buildings."
College Junior,5,"Hood is a small school and they have provided ample parking. Even if you have to park off-campus, there is free street parking that is amazingly close to campus and the main academic buildings. I have never once parked farther than about a football field from the building I wanted to be in. You don't even really need a car because Hood is right downtown close to lots of things. They do frequent bus trips too in case you want to see Baltimore, Annapolis, or DC while you're here."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on Hood's campus. It is well-lit and there always seems to be someone around that I could call upon for help.
College Sophomore,5,You can find any type of race or religious beliefs. There are also a lot of foreigners who come to hood. The community is supportive and nice.
College Sophomore,5,There are computers in every building that are available for use at any time as long as there isn't a class inside the room. They have Macs and Windows
College Sophomore,5,I Always feel safe at all time at hood college because their is always a security guard nearby by and our health center is amazing except for the fat it is closed on the weekends.
College Sophomore,5,"This school,is awesome and has a high school and small town  like feel with rigorous and fun college level class we have wonderful food and a million ways on and off campus to have fun while still staying focused on the rigors of a busy college schedule with about five classes"
College Junior,5,"Frederick is packed with restaurants varied from high class dining, to little corner spots."
College Junior,5,"It was pretty simple getting in the Psychology program, all I had to do was get signed off by the head of the department and submit my application to the registrar."
College Sophomore,5,"I received a large scholarship from Hood eventhough I was not an ""A"" student in high school. This scholarship is guaranteed for the 4 years that I will be there."
College Sophomore,5,"Walking to Class – There is no transportation at Hood College aside form the old fashoned way, to walk. The campus is small enough that students can walk to all of there classes without a problem. It doesnt take more than 10 minutes to get from one end of campus to the other."
College Sophomore,5,"Process Is Easy – The financial aid office is wonderful. They give you plenty of aid and scholarships. I received close to 34,000 in aid bringing the price out of pocket to something similar of a public university. The rest of my tuition and room and boarding were covered by the GI Bill which is very easy to set up. Also always go to the financial aid office, try for at least once a month as they always have a list of scholarships."
College Sophomore,5,"Easy Application Process – Hood's application is very simple and short. The application is free. Declaring a major and a minor isn't a hassle and can be completed in just a few minutes. My program is straightforward, but other students seeking to enroll in education or hard sciences should definitely read the catalog closely."
College Junior,5,"Downtown Frederick Has Amazing Food – check out:
1. The Wine kitchen
2. Tasting Room
3. The Orchard
4. Volt/Lunchbox
5. Olives
6. Cafe Nola

all amazing!"
Freshman,4,"All of my classes are in person (I got lucky). Online schooling isn't really for me; I absolutely have to be in a classroom. When we were put on a 72 hour dorm hold, we all had no choice but to attend class on Zoom. The professors really tried to make it seem like we were in the classroom which was really sweet and considerate. Like I said, I cannot do online schooling for a long time successfully, so the fourth star goes to the hard work of the professors."
Freshman,4,"In my four weeks of being here Hood College has been a dream. I can't wait until the pandemic is over and I can truly explore and take advantage of all Hood has to offer. From the staff, to the professors, to the class experiences, to campus life, to the surrounding community, I'd say I'm blessed to be here."
Senior,4,"I resisted going to Hood at first, but my overall experience was wonderful.  Some  professors pushed me to go beyond what I expected of myself.  

If I could change anything, it would be campus life.  There seems to be something lacking in terms of student body being cohesive."
Senior,4,"I like the in-class experience.  However, since Covid-19, my classes were all online.  Overall my experience was satisfactory, and the course material and teaching from my professor was interactive with me and my peers."
Sophomore,4,"I only took online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am not very good at learning online, because I am more hands-on, but most of my professors worked really hard to provide online materials and videos. I prefer to learn in a classroom; however, Hood College's online course options were flexible."
Sophomore,4,"Jood college is a very small school. It has small class sizes that allow you to gain a personal connection with professors. Most classes sizes become smaller the further you get into your major. The food on campus is good. They have different eating options and will accommodate you if you have any food allergies. The rooms on campus are decent. Every student can apply for a single, double, triple or quad. There is a cleaning service that comes in and cleans the bathrooms regularly. Overall, Hood college has a beautiful campus with decent living conditions."
Freshman,4,"I think Hood College was a perfect fit for me academically and socially. I have met some of the best people that will be in my life forever. I am a current first year studying Political Science with a pre-law focus. The education I have received has been very good. The class sizes are very small, and I am able to connect well to my professors. Our campus is right outside Historic Downtown Frederick and in a ten-minute walk, I am able to explore the city and enjoy the scenery. The school is worth checking out!"
Graduate Student,4,Good small college. Close to home. Located in a great community with a lot to offer. Good price. Works well with grad. students offering most classes at night after work. Interesting classes.
Niche User,4,"One of my favorite parts about Hood was the environment; everyone was so friendly and honest. It didn’t mattered who I talked to, everyone was nice. The dorms were beautiful, and the only disappointment was the food. The faculty and professors really care about you as a student which made my experience there valuable."
Junior,4,Very small and everything is close. The buildings and classes are small too. Most of the professors are nice and easy to talk to.
Sophomore,4,Hood College is a fantastic four year college with some majors offerings 5 year Masters degree programs. The environment is excellent and everyone on campus isn’t helpful and polite. At Hood College you will be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t love it there and isn’t willing to help with anything you might need.
Junior,4,"I have been a very active member in the campus community. I hate the housing, the campus is too small for the number of students have and rooms available. They are not very accommodating when it comes to room selection. They are however building a new dorm so things may change. The food quality is very poor. Its either the same thing over and over or something strange with no flavor. The Blazer is a joke they would be better off partnering with the community and allowing student to use their meal swipes around town."
Works Here,4,Hood College is for sure a college you want to look into if you are going into Education. They have a great program and help you get on the right track for your career. The campus is a good size and it is very beautiful.
Sophomore,4,Hood college has a great campus and it is very beautiful. Although I would like to see more diversity. The cost to attend is expensive but it is also worth it. Everyone there wants to help you succeed and not hold you back. The staff is very motivational. The parties are normally fun because everyone comes to them and have a great time. The academics are great depending on your major but overall this is a great school to attend an they are helpful whenever you need help.
Junior,4,"Hood provides a great college experience with many student engagement activities. The total population is smaller then most colleges which give the students a chance to really get to know their professors. The academic resources include offer a  tremendous amount of aid. One detail that should be considered is the location. It is on the border of downtown which limits space for parking. Overall, Hood is a great school to consider with a strong value system."
Freshman,4,the school has a great community and has a nice small campus very kind and welcoming people who guided me throughout the school
Alum,4,"I graduated from Hood in 1990. It was a small, all women's college back then but there were men taking classes as day students. I loved the friendships I made there. The school was small enough that we got to know a fair number of the students around us. I loved my dorm and the people in it. Everyone was friendly, helpful and kind. Classes have changed a lot since I was there and the campus has upgraded a number of their buildings to keep up with the changing world. The new library is beautiful, as is the new gym center. There is a nice feel of the old Hood College along with the new."
Graduate Student,4,"They are excellent at answering any question you may have. Timely in response and helpful. The course selections for Graduate programs are very good. The class size is small, but I like that. The professors are knowledgeable and encouraging. It is an overall great experience."
Sophomore,4,The best part about hood is the small class sizes and the pride professors take in the student’s success. Athletics have helped me stay on task with the strict schedules.
Junior,4,Love the small school feel because of the ability to build strong relationships with classmates and teachers
Alum,4,"Hood college afforded me the opportunity to experience so many great things. There were challenges along the way, but overall it was a good experience."
Senior,4,I liked how easy it was to tell that the people working at Hood cared about me and whether I was doing well with not only my grades but also in my personal life.
Junior,4,"What I like about Hood College is how helpful the professors are. Since majority of the class sizes don't reach over 25 students, it's easy to build relationships with fellow classmates and gain connections with the professor. They also provide a vast amount of resources to students and are extremely helpful with getting internships and job opportunities."
Niche User,4,"The college tour at Hood college put things in perspective for me. Everyone that I came in contact with was friendly and knowledgeable. The staff care about their alumni, current and future student's needs.

      It felt as if I wasn't going to feel like a number or that I won't matter is a big concern of mine and the class size sounds about right for me. I have a sense of peace knowing that tutoring is available for no additional cost. I appreciate the labeling of the food in the cafeteria. I can eat something and not worry about food allergies while focusing on my education."
Sophomore,4,It's really great. I get to meet a lot of intelligent professors and good people. The dorm buildings are fun and it is easily to get paired with a person you get along with. They take a lot into account when pairing you with your first roommate.
Senior,4,Graduating this year and overall has been great except the food which is very terrible. Hope changes will be made to it soon and also variety
Niche User,4,"My experience at Hood College was very Captivating. I enjoyed many things about Hood College, including the campus, classmates, and amicable professors. While an education is always something to be treasured, a fortune is needed for a proper return on investment."
Senior,4,"Hood College is low-key an awesome school. There is always something to do. The downtown/nightlife scene of Frederick is outstanding for a school the size of Hood. But best of all, Hood has a tight knit community. Everyone kinda knows everyone but it's really not all too bad."
Sophomore,4,I love Hood. It is very easy to become involved on campus because the campus is so small and everyone knows everyone. It's a short walk to downtown Frederick where there is plenty of stuff to do. The academics are great as well. Professors care about what they are teaching and you'll almost never have a TA teaching your class.
Freshman,4,Nice school. All the professors are willing to work with students to assure they get what they need. The students here are all very friendly too. Never had any problems. Just needs more parking
Junior,4,I enjoy the small class size. This enables students to have necessary one on one professor time to enhance the experience.
Freshman,4,"I love Hood College! There is always something to do so you are never stuck in your room bored. Some classes are challenging, butI would rather this than a school that doesn't teach well. Hood College may be small, but there are so many different things here, like clubs, activities, and even a few parties. This is a great school for many who don't like to be around too many people. As a proud Hood student, I can say that this is a great school."
College Sophomore,4,The professors really get to know the students and help them out.
College Sophomore,4,I feel really safe on campus
College Sophomore,4,"I find that after freshmen orientation they need to just let the students go, forcing us into events long after we are very busy is stressful"
College Sophomore,4,A lot of emphasis is put on students finding a job after graduation
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"Hood is a D3 school. Sports are important but not nearly as much as academics. There are two athletic centers, an older gym and a new facility. They are both great for athletes as well as non-athletes and are used by both."
College Freshman,4,"Hood is a really nice, small private college. The teachers are great for the most part and everyone is really nice on campus. The class sizes are personal and the campus itself down is beautiful."
College Junior,4,"Very concerned about your health and safety. That's why my mom wanted me to pick Hood. She knew that if I were going to be away from home then I needed to be somewhere safe, and this is where she felt was safe for me."
College Junior,4,They really help you get your name and face out there for opportunities that may help you with your future. They try to help you be ready for the real world by lining you up with a job out of school.
College Junior,4,"This is a typical residence hall with dorm rooms, but I live in what we call the hotel. It has a spacious elevator that works majority of the time. It has nice bathrooms that are clean. We have one of the nicest kitchens on campus. We have a recreational area to watch TV. We have a computer room and a laundry room where you don't have to pay for your laundry either. I wish we had more common areas on each floor, but nonetheless it's nice."
College Junior,4,"Hood College used to be an all women's school, so asking about sports is interesting. Our athletics are evolving into something really great, but we haven't reached the point where we want to be as a school. We have top of the line equipment, brand new fields, bread new facilities, and constantly new players that make the game. Campus does get involved with the sports, but we could certainly get more involved."
College Junior,4,"It's a beautiful, small campus with a variety of classes and clubs to join. It's located about 10min walking distance from downtown Frederick where you get great food, shopping, and nightlife. You are 30min away from D.C. and Baltimore where you have even more doors open of internships and careers. It sounds great right?! Well the part that doesn't get this school a 5 star rating, it's expensive. Those internship and career opportunities for certain majors are extremely competitive because so many in this area want to do the same thing. In other words, you have to know what you want and be able to fight for it. The classes here are wonderful, teaching not only the curriculum but also life lessons along the way!"
College Senior,4,"Some campus crime and vandalism, but security guards regular patrol making everyone feel safe"
College Senior,4,In an area with a lot of possible internships and jobs
College Senior,4,"Classes are a bit small, but professors are very passionate and well-educated"
College Senior,4,"Near my home, in a nice area"
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's unique because it's close to downtown, shops, dining, and many activities"
College Senior,4,Hood College fits my academic needs very well
College Junior,4,"I lived in off-campus housing this year and even though it is expensive it is nice and close to campus, Hood hooked us up well."
College Junior,4,"The admin is good, they don't push the rules too much because they don't have to, everyone is responsible here."
College Sophomore,4,The people in the cafeteria do a good job. Also there's a soft serve ice cream machine.
College Freshman,4,They work hard everyday to ensure our safety on campus
College Freshman,4,Campus security does its job and safety is basically not an issue at all.
College Freshman,4,There are loads of great restaurants to eat at. The best are the privately owned restaurants downtown.
College Freshman,4,The diversity is good here. The student population is mostly comprised of people from all over the east coast. I have made friends with several international students.
College Freshman,4,"College provides apartments on campus, but there are also some houses for rent nearby, but not within walking distance like the apartments are."
College Freshman,4,"Within walking distance of downtown, so always something going on"
College Freshman,4,"I love it because they aren't the huge school ragers, more like 25-30 person kickbacks where everyone knows each other, so don't have to deal with the damage, or ignorance."
Freshman,2,"I really don’t like it at this school. First of all, the food sucks! It tastes like crap and there is a lack of nutritious option. This is just plain ridiculous, since college students should have access to healthy food when studying. Secondly, there is no social scene at campus. There are no events by clubs and there is a lack of accommodation for minor religions, such as Sikhism and Islam ( which have good representation in other colleges or universities). Hopefully, I will soon transfer to another school!!!!!"
Freshman,2,"The scenery is old fashioned and kind of boring. It’s a very small school, so you get to know everyone quickly. The food was nasty on most days! The student body was very informative about events and clubs that were available for us."
Sophomore,2,"This college needs students who really want to party and have fun. Most professors are fun and have no issue with helping students while others are elderly, cranky, conceded, and condescending. The tuition seems unnecessarily expensive. The area has interesting and historical locations, but the local area is suburban and boring."
College Sophomore,2,Buildings are very old and dirty
College Freshman,2,"Male students have started one Greek life, but their main focus is community service and education which is good, but when they plan ""fun"" events they are not awesome enough for my standards."
College Junior,2,"The housing options were okay but they are getting worse. We are starting something new this year and I don't know how I feel about it or how it'll work. We are more or less being pushed to live off campus in the city of Frederick because of the lack of housing, but it is hard to financially afford living off campus when your grants and scholarships are being taken away because you're not ""living in on campus housing"" anymore... I'm upset that it's so difficult because I'll be losing money next year if I live off campus"
College Sophomore,2,The parties are just awful and everyone knows each other.
College Freshman,2,There are not many options when it comes to the dinning services. The breakfast is the best eating time out of the whole day.
College Sophomore,2,I do not know much about the experiences people have had when trying to live of campus. I only hear the complaints of those as I am walking past them.
College Sophomore,2,Not as great on weekends
College Senior,2,Local transportation is almost non-existent. I would have preferred if a bus came to the campus. You can only use taxis and Zipcars and that gets expensive.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much night life at Hood... Sometimes there is a movie usually people just hangout with friends in their rooms or on the quad.
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene at Hood College is noticeable, and quite outrageous at times even with the school's policy. Casually, students smoke outside. Often inappropriately, students are drinking in the dorm halls and causing a lot of unwanted noise."
College Freshman,2,"The food is not bad but not good ether. I advise anyone after freshman year to not taking a big meal plan. Its better to shop for your own food in the long run, plus the cost for the meal plan is ridiculous about $5,000."
College Freshman,2,"The school is pretty strict when it comes to drinking and unauthorized drug use on campus grounds. Once in a while there is a day called ""Dry Campus"" where all dorms and housing has to clear out all alcohol, even if your old enough to drink."
College Sophomore,2,"If You Really Want It, You'll Find It...But Beware – I think the drug scene is all about who you are hanging out with. Like at any college if you want it, you'll find it. But for those that do use drugs and get caught there are penalties including alcohol/drug classes."
College Freshman,2,Most people go to the apartments. There really isn't much to do on campus. People go clubbing to DC or Baltimore.
College Junior,2,"Honor Code – We have an honor code that we have to write on all papers and test. But it is so loosely enforced that some teachers don't require it at all, while others will fail you if you forget it."
College Junior,2,"Parking is very limited on campus, but the side streets are always empty."
College Student,2,"Trapped on Campus – Downdown Frederick is an okay place to go, there's lots of smalls stores and restaurants  but many are more expensive than what a college student can afford. There's really no nearby fast food places except for a Taco Bell and a Sheetz and if you don't have a car, a lot of time you can wind up feeling trapped on campus."
Freshman,1,"My experience at Hood College was terrible, and I am transferring elsewhere after one horrific year at attending this school. I was personally strangled by an RA and harassed (yes, this seriously happened) -the school did nothing about it, after reporting it. I still have nightmares about it.  The dorms and bathrooms are terrible, very outdated and need renovation. There was a lot of mold problems that made students sick and unable to attend classes. The food is terrible, many students had food poisoning and was afraid to eat there. It is a pretty campus but there is no social life, nothing to do on the weekends if you didn't party. It’s a very small campus. I’m a nursing major and had an awesome anatomy and physiology professor. I would not recommend this school! If you are between Hood College and another school, go to the other school! Please take my advice"
Niche User,1,"This school is too expensive and its financial aids office is unfriendly/not helpful. If you are not applying for any of its undergraduate programs, I will advise you not to attend this school. The school only cares for the undergraduates and careless about the post-graduates especially when it comes to financing your program. Something needs to be done to the tuition fees and should make available scholarship opportunities for other types of students asides the freshman students."
Freshman,1,"The dorms are old and need remodeling. The food is terrible! Too much drama! Campus safety isn’t there when you need them. They need more security on campus. It’s very boring, no activities for students."
College Sophomore,1,We dont have greek life so..
College Freshman,1,Hood does not have a greek system.
College Junior,1,"There are basically no transportation methods on campus if you do not have a car or a friend with one. Though, the campus does have zip cars you can rent for a fee."
College Freshman,1,There are no transportation options at Hood unless you find a form of public transportation or have your own car/have a friend with a car.
College Freshman,1,There are almost no minorities here. Minorities are most not very accepting to the environment here.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no drug use on campus that I have witnessed. There are parties on campus, and I have seen no one using any type of drug."
College Senior,1,The cost of this school is outrageous considering the elitism the professors possess and the poor quality of the departmental connectivity and lack of helpfulness in searching out a career.
College Sophomore,1,"The sports here are very mediocre. Hood is a D-3 school meaning that there really isn't any focus on the sports. There isn't a football or baseball team so there is no true sport that brings the school together. 
I think it would be fairly easy to get onto any team because most of the teams suck so any new addition would be appreciated. I have a good chance at playing soccer and I've never played a day in my life.
The sports facilities are weird. There are two gyms, a very old one and a brand new one, that are used to different things."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is predictable, but always seems to catch Hood unprepared. The campus regularly floods when it rains and don't be surprised if the buildings are leaking. The pipes burst once in the winter. It was pulling teeth to get the school to provide accommodations elsewhere."
College Junior,1,"Drug Availability – I don't even know where to begin. The school is located in the middle of down town frederick, 2 blocks from a park, and 5 blocks from All saints street (street known for having police raids regularly). So there is drug use."
College Student,1,"Almost None Existent – Besides soccer there are almost no sports that anyone cares about. The is swimming, lacrosse and track but no one pays any attention to them."
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation in Frederick is very poor. I have lived here my whole life and would never step foot on one of the public busses. There are no college shuttles here. You can, however, rent a bike for the day from the information desk. I would definitely recommend having a car on campus or making friends with someone who does. You can easily walk to a shopping center with a grocery store, subway, taco bell, starbucks and CVS or to the downtown area with shopping and dining options. The way I see it, having a car is really the only option when it comes to transportation."
College Sophomore,1,Oh My Gosh the Train! No one really knows where the buses go not even the people who live in Frederick. The train only runs 3 times in the early morning and 3 times late at night and only one way depending on the time and as far as airports go I'm not even sure if we have one.
College Junior,1,"Least Out of Three – I have been to 3 different colleges, this is my least favorite. The teachers are not flexible and are prudes."
College Junior,1,Majorly limited...you wind up making your own spot and praying you don't get a ticket.
College Senior,1,We don't have any greek life at hood. If you want to be in a fraternity/sorority this is not the place for you.
College Senior,1,There is absolutely no public transportation unless you wanna take a commuter train at 5 am.  It sucks!  You need a car here if you wanna get out of Frederick ever.

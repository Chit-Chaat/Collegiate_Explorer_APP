Junior,5,I have not began my classes yet but I am excited and have a good feeling  based on the people I have spoken with and the orientation session.
Junior,5,"My experience with the University of North Texas at Dallas has overall been really pleasant. One of the things I find most convenient and very compelling about the school is the class sizing. The classrooms are never too full which gives you a better chance of being able to interact with the professors. Being able to communicate with the professors easily is a very convenient thing which I like to have. Also, the professors are very friendly and very enthusiastic when you ask for help, they never shy away from helping their students. Another compelling attribute of the campus is the many helping centers they provide, it being help with math or even helping you revise a paper. The layout of the campus is one of my favorite parts as well. There are many studying quarters which anyone can access. You can have an individual area for yourself or even go to a larger area with a group to help study for a test or work on a project."
Graduate Student,5,"Even though the school only has 3 buildings, those 3 buildings are enough. They all have plenty of resources to continue succeeding in the academic world. The Student Center has SO MANY resources available for students, including tutoring which has helped me succeed in a class I was struggling in. The professors that I've had so far have been so helpful and so understanding in these tough times."
Junior,5,The best college! In the process of having a more beautiful campus and becoming a more well known school. It really lives up to its sister school UNT with its programs and teachers.
Junior,5,I transferred to UTD from a community college and have been impressed by the incredible faculty. Every professor I've encountered has a colorful background in their industry and most are currently writing/working in their field as well as teaching.
Junior,5,I love that the school is not that big. You are able to reach out to your teacher and get help when needed. They are never busy for their students. The classes are not that big. I think that can do better with timing. Maybe having more people in the office to assist with registering and answering questions.
Niche User,5,I personally enjoy the environment of this college. The campus is not too big to where you get lost. The student to teacher ratio is fairly small allowing more one on one with your professor.
Freshman,5,So far UTD is a beautiful campus with a lot of knowledgeable staff and faculty that make it easy to navigate and find out what you need.
Freshman,5,Personally I really like how the school is very intimate. Classroom sizes can be from 20-35 students which is not bad at all it makes classes easier to pay attention. I also like how itâ€™s a small campus because I can get to my classes a lot faster without needing transportation. The faculty there is also really nice and everyone tries to help you no matter what . Leaving high school  was a big transition but The University of North Texas at Dallas made it with super easy and convenient .
Junior,5,I actually don't have much to say just yet about the university. This will be my first year as a transferring junior from a community college. I am extremely excited and I think I will be content with my college choice. Everyone at UNTD actually cares for your education.
Niche User,5,"UNT Dallas will be the school that I'm transferring to in the Fall of 2019. I love this campus because the area is very nice, i love how helpful the staff is when you have questions about anything. I love how diverse the school is and how they always have different events that take place every other week. It's very organized in terms of events they always have. I would recommend this school to anyone who is interested in staying close in the area and not travel out of town to get to school."
Junior,5,I have recently been accepted to this school and I'm excited to begin my next journey. I have heard a lot of good things about the school and know they are one of the more affordable Universities in north Texas. I've visited the campus a few times and I really like it. I like that it's close to home and offers online classes.
Freshman,4,I am a current student at UNT Dallas. Ilike this school because they activley help students find their career and the correct path to reaching their goals while making you have fun at the same time.
Freshman,4,It can sometime be difficult but my professors try their hardest and I make at least a passing grade in their courses.
Junior,4,My experience at UNT Dallas is going well. I thoroughly enjoy my online classes and my professors help where they can. On campus we're still able to enjoy the college life and talk with friends.
Junior,4,Some miscommunication throughout the registration and enrollment process but not the worst I have experienced.
Junior,4,The online courses are very convenient for students that do not have time to really be on campus. The online courses provide everything you would need to succeed as if you were in a classroom setting. The online professors always provide in depth lessons so there is no confusion within the lesson. Professors always reply within a timely manner to ensure you are getting the full advantage of the online course.
Sophomore,4,Some professors struggle with technology and cannot post grades. But most are very organized and friendly
Sophomore,4,The staff and professors are very helpful when it comes to work and tutoring during office hours. Very good overall
Freshman,4,"My experience so far here at UNT Dallas is great. The learning environment is exceptional, no distractions, small class sizes, great relationships with your professors, all of that in a 4 year institution. So many resources that are offered to you to help you succeed. Although maybe the ""big college"" vibe hasn't begun here we are slowly building an awesome community, soon to have sports and a unforgettable college student experience."
Senior,4,I like the campus for its laid back atmosphere since it's a small campus. I wish there was more degrees to take.
Graduate Student,4,Very good school and Statewide recognized.  Located in the North Dallas area it is closed to many resources and businesses.
Junior,4,"I like how the classes at UNT Dallas are small so there is a lot of classroom interaction with the professors, as well as close discussions. However, there are no sports available at this school and they lack clubs for sports."

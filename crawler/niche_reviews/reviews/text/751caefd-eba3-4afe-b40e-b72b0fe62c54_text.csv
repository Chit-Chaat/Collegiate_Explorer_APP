Junior,5,I attend Make School at Dominican University and I believe it is the best computer science program in the world when it comes to teaching people how to code and get a job afterwards.
Freshman,5,I am excited to enroll here in the fall. The campus tour showed me everything that's great about a school in the bay area.
Freshman,5,I love that it is a small school because you get to know your professors and they get to know you. I like how they offer so many things for new students to help them get started in a new place far away from home. They provide many services for their students and overall it is a great school.
Graduate Student,5,"One of the things I love about Dominican is the school and I both share the values of community and service. I've spent time over the past 10 years volunteering inside and outside of my local community, so I appreciate how Dominican encourages community involvement, as Iâ€™ve seen positive effects firsthand. Greater community involvement is congruent with the caliber of involved education that Dominican offers, particularly in that classrooms are smaller, allowing better connectivity between student, material, and professor. I believe this style of education is vital to creating successful change, and I love being a part of that community."
Graduate Student,5,"What I really enjoyed about my experience with Dominican University of California was the openness of the faculty and staff. I am impressed by their continued dedication to their student body and their investment into my personal success. Each staff member was genuine and unique, offering a variety of strategies and resources for any situation I had. I am truly grateful I get to continue with Dominican University of California. Thanks to the efforts of Dominican University of California, I am greatly encouraged and have such a positive outlook concerning my future career. Dominican University of California has given me the tools and connections I feel to strengthen my future."
Senior,5,"Tremendous campus, amazing professors, plenty of opportunity and experience. At Dominican I was able to start in my field of study as early as the first semester of my Freshman year. I went to Dominican for the broadcasting and Communications program. By Fall of my freshman year i was already broadcasting games and hosting my own radio show. Dominican put me in a position to be successful and to be a professional."
Freshman,5,the campus is beautiful and old- which is what i love personally. its small which is also something i enjoy about it since i thrive in smaller groups/classes. It is also in a great area inside a neighborhood but there is a ton of places to check out nearby. and one of my favorite things is that there is free parking and a free gym with a pool. the only thing i wish there was more of was p.o.c . but i found my own group now. the teachers are amazing and there is a great support system for everyone.
Niche User,5,"I applied to Dominican University of California because of the amazing location and the reputation the school has. The campus is beautiful and clean, the staff has answered my emails quickly and in a timely manner. I am excited to start my future here. I also have Celiac Disease so have to eat a Gluten Free diet. The  dining hall met with me and went through my diet with me. It was an easy choice that this will be my new home!"
Freshman,5,"I've been loving it here. Lots of opportunities for students to explore their passions. Work-study is easy to get on campus. If you work hard you'll be recognized campus wide or at least by your professors. Study Abroad is recommended here, and you can do so as soon as Sophomore Year."
Alum,5,The small class sizes and hands on learning was excellent! There were many opportunities for community involvement.
Sophomore,5,"The diversity of student body and academic options is incredible--the faculty was invested in my learning and compassionate in my understanding. I feel I was pushed to seek new levels of my abilities and challenged to explore my innovative creativity. The campus itself is beautiful, although the buildings are old and could use some renovation. Angelico Hall, especially the theater/stage, could use some expansion and updating."
Senior,5,"Despite not having the massive sporting events and Greek life of state schools, it is located in an area where you can still maintain a social life by going to concerts, the city, Berkeley, or to the countless waterfalls/hikes in the area. The small class-size and close-knit community allows everyone to find their niche. Each person is able to get opportunities they would not necessarily be afforded at a large school and the staff and faculty wants you to succeed. For example, professors are willing to meet outside of class on top of the free tutoring offered."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small, tight-knit community Dominican has to offer. As a Nursing student, it is so helpful having small class sizes because the professors take the time to get to know you and help you succeed."
Niche User,5,I have chosen Dominican to be my home for the next four years.  I'm extremely happy to be a penguin.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed my time at Dominican. The campus is beautiful and the small class sizes really help your teacher to get to know you and vice versa.
Sophomore,5,"After completing my first year at Dominican, I am extremely satisfied with my experience thus far. The professors care about the students, and will do all that they can to ensure success. The one-on-one connections at Dominican open many doors for students in the academic world in addition to professions. Their are internships offered for most majors, and personal advisors are great for recommendations. Dominican is a friendly and welcoming environment."
Freshman,5,"My experience so far at Dominican has been fabulous. I am enrolled in Dominican's teaching program and it has made my dream of becoming a teacher a reality. My professors really do care about me as a person and about my academics. The classes at Dominican are very rich in content and really are worth your investment. The overall campus is beautiful. Wherever you are on campus you will see trees or bushes or flowers. Dominican's campus is composed of over 400 different plant species. Dominican's community is so welcoming, kind, and diverse. The diversity is so beautifully present here. As always, students will want to get off campus and San Rafael is a great location. Located in Marin County, there are many diverse places to eat, malls, movie theaters, book stores, and hiking locations. San Rafael is also just a 30 min drive to San Francisco and a 15 min drive to Berkley."
Freshman,5,"Wanting to be located in close proximity to San Francisco but also be out in nature by the redwoods was a must for me coming from congested Los Angeles. the location is perfect, and the professors are personal and the classes are challenging but manageable. If you are here solely for a strong education then this is perfect for you. Small classes give you hands-on experience with plenty of internship opportunities. I will be coming back for another year."
Niche User,5,"When I went to go visit Dominican it was really gloomy but the people there brightened the day. The people there were really generous and the campus is not that big, which I really like. Everyone knows each other there and it is a small community that really make the campus have a positive vibe."
Junior,5,"As a transfer student, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I know I received more! The counselors were helpful with scheduling. Classes are smaller but it is not too difficult to get the classes you need."
College Freshman,5,It's a great school! The professors and staff care about the students a lot and the campus is beautiful and everyone is so nice and caring.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is super nice and helpful and supportive to freshmen. You have to clean your own room and bathroom. Bathroom shared with 6 girls.
College Freshman,5,I feel like I'm at home there. The staff's supportive.
College Junior,5,A degree from this school is very valuable. Alumni get hired in very high positions in recognized companies or organizations.
College Freshman,5,I haven't ever heard of anything happening here.
College Freshman,5,"The head of my department, Brad Van Alstyne has been so inspirational when it comes to my future career. He is always willing to help his stunts find great jobs and internships in the bay area and goes to great lengths to make sure his students actually receive them."
College Junior,5,"The gym is open to all students and has new, clean equipment. The fields are groomed and there is enough space for everyone."
College Junior,5,Community environment allows for easy relationships and connections to be made. Small class sizes allow for more learning opportunity.
College Freshman,5,"Dominican is a very safe place. To get into any buildings, one needs an I.D. card. In general, one just needs to lock their door to their room and not leave valuables lying around. The school allows students to register their bikes with the school in case the bike is stolen. As an individual, the campus is very safe. Dominican security will transport you to wherever you need to go on campus if you don't feel safe. Overall, Dominican is an extremely safe campus. The only thing usually leads students to feel unsafe is a squirrel or the campus deer darting across the sidewalks at nighttime."
College Junior,5,Classes are challenging but you students have access to tutoring and the professors are personable
College Freshman,5,"The school has great location, staff, and learning environment."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am so happy I ended up at Dominican University of California, and I know of a friend mine feels the same way. Yes, it's expensive and the small school environment has it's pros and cons. But I was given so many opportunities there both in regards to academics and extracurriculars. I believe that if you make the most of it, you can really get a tremendous amount back from Dominican University."
College Junior,5,"I've had a great time. Teachers are incredible and you get to know them well, Administration is always willing to help, and everyone is so nice."
College Freshman,5,The administration is very helpful. Since the class sizes are small professors are easily accessible and able to help with any difficulties. I really enjoy having a student-professor relationship which can benefit my education.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Biased here, but I received an excellent scholarship. I think almost every student got some level of scholarship, based on their high school academic performance. And as long as you meet the academic minimums, the scholarships will renew."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Dominican and could not picture myself anywhere else. I feel that this school is truly where I am meant to be and learn and grow as a person and as a student. The campus is stunning and there is nature all around you. I love the trees and the flowers and how well kept and groomed our campus is. The library is a big resource and I love going there to study, research for a class, or print out papers for my classes. There is also a common are in the lobby that is great to relax and sit down in between classes. I love attending the basketball games! They are so much fun and there is so much spirit, everyone has a lot of pride for the Penguins. I enjoy the different events put on by ADSU like Man auctions, trips to Warriors' basketball games, dances, Mr. Penguin Contest, Bowling nights, RA socials, and so much more."
College Freshman,5,IT WAS GREAT! The process wasn't to hard
College Senior,5,I AM STILL WORKING MY INTERSHIP NOW FOR $15 AN HOUR.
College Senior,5,"MOST PROFESSORS DO A GREAT JOB, HELP STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE STUGGLING, AND UNDERSTAND WHEN STUDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH DIFFICULTIES."
College Junior,5,The admission process was easy and I was able to contact persons when I had questions. I did not have any admission related difficulties.
College Junior,5,"I love the psychology program at my school. The professors are great and are very open minded. They provide me with opportunities that I don't believe I would have at other schools. The workload is not very heavy during the semester, but at the end of the semester there are a lot of papers to write. It can be stressful, but using my time management skills I am able to complete my papers ahead of time. Dominican University has provided me with an opportunity to go to the Western Psychological Association in Portland this year."
College Sophomore,5,They are very accepting and have different programs
College Sophomore,5,I felt like I belong.
College Sophomore,5,They are very involved and offer a lot of aid.
College Sophomore,5,Greek Life is not available.
College Senior,5,"Dominican University of California has a very diverse community from ethnicity/culture to areas of study and character/beliefs. Although it is a small school, it has a wide range of different personalities and traits of students. Whether you come from another country with different beliefs or someone who's local, this University projects the future of diversity in the United States."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the weather. No snow and spring, summer and fall are absolutely beautiful."
College Junior,5,Business program is awesome! Low student-teacher ratio. Helping you to get a career after college.
College Junior,5,Athletics are improving a lot at this school! D2. Reaching new heights. Athletic facilities are improving a lot!
College Junior,5,"Whatever I am in the mood for, I can find that type of food within walking distance to the school. The prices are average, with few locations being a little more expensive, but the food tastes amazing and is worth the price."
College Freshman,5,Very well organized and very good
College Freshman,5,"The Communications program at Dominican is one of the best which offers a variety of classes, internships, and job opportunities. We have our own radio, advanced cinema, 3D modeling, and graphic design equipment which is great"
College Junior,5,The weather is beautiful.  You can go out and enjoy all the Marin and San Francisco have to offer every day of the year.
College Junior,5,Love my teachers and all the options I have to learn
College Junior,5,One of the best features at Dominican is not having to pay for a permit and not driving around for 30 minuets looking for a spot.
College Freshman,5,"The students at Dominican dont really drink or do drugs, but theres always that small group. You can have fun without drinking and doing drugs, but its pretty easy for underage students to access alcohol."
College Freshman,5,"We have a lot of campus security, but it is an open campus so anyone is allowed on the campus. ANYONE."
College Freshman,5,"Summers are hot and beautiful, and Winters are rainy and cold like they should be! "
College Freshman,5,"As a Bio Major, the workload is extremely difficult. Studying is crucial because a lot of it is memorization of terms, events, etc. The outcome is really good, though, because Dominican has ties with many lab corps. in Marin County, so many students that intern get offered jobs before they even graduate. "
Freshman,4,"Dominican University has a beautiful campus and lovely people. There is so much you can do, they offer many majors and clubs. Dominican's diversity can really be seen through their clubs, people love to host events to educate and showcase their culture. The residential halls will remind you of Harry Potter and are very comfortable spaces, there's a room with a pool table and another with a ping pong table! Dominican offers so much support, there are many tutors and mentors available and of course, counseling services. There's even a first-generation student program called Torch who helps the transition from high school and are a great support system, you can come to them for any reason. The smaller student population allows for people to really connect with their professors and advisors, which enriches the student experience."
Freshman,4,Dominican is a nice school and the environment is very clean and welcoming. The dorms are clean and nice and the community is very open and accepting. I chose Dominican because of the community.
Freshman,4,The athletics facility are nice but are too small and not big enough for the community and school. The weight room is way too small. The sports teams donâ€™t have their own locker rooms so you have to carry your equipment from the dorms to field. The food in cafeteria is okay but it has been improving as the semester goes on.
Senior,4,Dominican University of California is a wonderful University in Marin County- just 20 minutes north of San Francisco. The campus is small and very special. the classes are intimate and there is a good student-professor ratio.
Freshman,4,"Campus is very pretty and staff is very understanding and helpful. Staff loves to reach out and make sure that student is well adjusted, and are all so willing to help and work with the student with what they need. Food is average, but does have a wide diversity of things to choose from (personal experience, breakfast is the best meal). You do have many opportunities to further your education and major. Campus life is very subtle with limited parties on campus. Nothing really to do around the area unless you have a car. Reccommended for nature lovers, and quiet scenes."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my time here and the campus is beautiful but for personal reasons, I did have to transfer."
Senior,4,I enjoy the occupational therapy program so much and the professors are so caring and helpful. I would like to see change in the admissions office I feel they are often unorganized and its up to the student to keep track of all information
Junior,4,"I Enjoy the small size and the warm community. As a music and business double major, I love that Dominican has several opportunities to expand your network and career connections for future success."
Sophomore,4,I liked how the campus is very mellow and everyone is friendly. Dogs are always being walked around campus. Professors are very understanding and instructive.
Niche User,4,"The campus is very open and has a lot of nature. If you like the outdoors, this college is perfect for you. Dominican is well known for their outstanding Nursing program so definitely apply here if you're interested in that field."
Freshman,4,My experience overall at Dominican was great.i met new people and found a new support system that I can count on. All the teachers are there to get you to success and it is very appreciated.
Niche User,4,I recently got accepted to Dominican. The campus is beautiful and in an ideal location close to San Francisco and the overall environment is very welcoming. The school is also very generous with financial aid and merit scholarships.
Niche User,4,"Great location, small school with nice people and nice professors. The campus is beautiful. The tuition is very expensive, but there are good programs for teaching and premed."
Junior,4,"Small campus school with an intimate approach to education. Professors are friendly and willing to go the extra mile for all their students. Very high focus on the nursing program. Campus security is always present and quick to respond. 
Dining hall is one of Dominicanâ€™s weakest points. Lunches are generally okay but dinners tend to be worse. Vegetables generally burnt, food is greasey, salad bar lols unhygienic. Had a very evident rat problem in the past year.  
Dorms are given out based on a lottery system. Majority of students are commuters. 
Campus is beautiful and located in a upper class, quiet neighborhood. Fireside trail located right behind. About one mile walk from downtown San Rafael, 30 minutes from San Francisco, 15 minutes from Berkeley."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Dominican University has created nothing more than a positive environment that has enhanced my overall experience as a first year student. It has exceeded my expectations that I had for the school. For starters, the professors are all willing to help you in all possible ways to enable success. I feel extremely safe at my school as campus security is always there for you no matter the time of night. Being that I am an African American going to a school where I am the minority I was initially concerned about being discriminated against. However, the school goes to enormous efforts to stress the importance of equality. In today's society, it is nice to know that the university I attend seems me just as everyone else. No matter the background, race, religion, sexuality, etc., everyone is seen as equals and it is the such a beautiful environment to be around and further my education."
Alum,4,Valued the opportunity to attend classes through the Pathways/ADC program in the evening.  The quality of education was not diminished - mostly PhD instructors with practice/work experience in Psychology.  Would be great to work in cohorts with the opportunity to establish relationships and support for adult students. Also would have benefited from a more involved and consistent advisor throughout my 3 years attending the school.
Junior,4,Love the small classes and the teachers. Possibly change the tuition price and cost of  related school costs.
Junior,4,"Education depends on the work you put in, I've had a great experience because my professors are very good at answering questions clarifying concerns and being attentive."
Freshman,4,"The people at this school were amazing. If you establish the proper relationships your opportunities are endless. I do think the faculty could be more accessible to students, unfortunately the current situation is either your teachers are extremely helpful or not helpful at all. The students are great and its very easy to establish relationships."
Junior,4,My experience at Dominican has overall been an amazing one. I really think that having the right advisor helps make the experience here truly something worth it. The resources on campus are also very helpful and it's easy to form a real relationship with most of the people you meet throughout your educational career at Dominican.
Freshman,4,Dominican has an environment that fosters self-sufficiency while simultaneously providing you with help to palliate the steps it takes to get where you want to go. People here care.
Niche User,4,"My overall rate of Dominican University of California is of a very nice school. The campus is impressive and beautiful. I like how the professor to student rate is considerably small, because that way students have better communication with their professors. I also like their nursing program and how relatively convenient it is, it makes your internship and college years much simpler. Only thing I wish they did, is to offer more scholarships for students from different backgrounds."
College Freshman,4,There's security and it's a small school.
College Freshman,4,"It's a small, personalized school."
College Freshman,4,There seems to be a lot of alumni network and there is a very high rate of getting a job from this school.
College Freshman,4,I have walked around late at night and feel safe and if you don't you can call for the campus police to give you a ride places.
College Freshman,4,"Everyone goes to support the teams, but there isn't a football team. Basketball is important though."
College Junior,4,Professors really want to see students succeed and go above and beyond for students. Courses are challenging and make you feel like you are getting your money's worth.
College Junior,4,"Security takes a bit long to reach you considering how small of a campus it is but generally they are not called for safety reasons, they are called for small tasks such as letting someone into their room because they forgot their key. Security is usually not needed."
College Junior,4,Athletic equipment is very new and clean. The gym is welcoming and has a very polished court.
College Junior,4,My school is very diverse. Everyone is approachable and wants to see their peers succeed.
College Sophomore,4,The Alonzo King Lines BFA program definitely gives its students lots of experience and connections which can be put to use after graduation. The company is very well known and the program is small and exclusive. It is a great reference to have on resumes in the future. It gives great training that can be put to use as a professional dancer. Many alumni go on to dance with their dream companies.
College Sophomore,4,"My dance courses are great. They are challenging and difficult, but I feel like I improve with every class. The dance professors are really great teachers with lots of experience. My academic courses are not the most challenging, and it was easy for me to get all As. Dancers do not have a big variety of G.E. classes to take because all academic classes have to be taken in the evenings, so it is difficult to find the classes that I like and there ends up being one option for each G.E. course.  The class sizes are small and you quickly learn everyone's name and your professor knows your name. A lot of classes have you turn things in and look at things online, which is nice because it saves paper and printing money."
College Sophomore,4,There are always security guards walking around the campus. It is a small campus in a residential area so it feels fairly safe. There was a lot of bike theft my first year there. The dorms are pretty safe; you have to have your ID card to unlock the front door and each dorm room locks.
College Sophomore,4,"Because it is such a small school, the sports are pretty popular. Sports events are small, but mostly well-attended by students. The teams are the best, but with it being a small, private school, they're ok."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is small and you are able to get to know your peers and professors. It is nice to be able to have a sense of community with classmates and to be able to have more support from professors than if you were at a large university. The location is great: just outside the city without being in all the busy California traffic. My school is unique because of its dance program. It is one of the only college dance BFA programs that is connected to a professional company. I would definitely choose the school again for the dance program and from the amazing opportunities that the program offers. The academics at the school are not my favorite, however, and I wish dancers had more options for General Education courses."
College Junior,4,The Men's golf team carries all other sports and is also super attractive.
College Junior,4,"What makes Dominican great is the people. Yes, it is a small school, but I've made amazing friends for life that make my experience here at Dominican worth it."
College Freshman,4,I enjoyed my first year of college.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, Dominican is a great school. The Communications department does a good job of applying hands-on experience in classroom coursework rather than just working with theory."
College Sophomore,4,I think what makes Dominican unique is our Medieval Combat Club. Not many colleges have a club like this so it's really fun to talk about with others outside of my school who have no idea that this club exists on campus.
College Freshman,4,It really depends what department you are in the nursing and OT are suburb
College Freshman,4,"Its a small school, definitely won't find your husband here if that is what you are coming to college for. Overall good education and friendly people"
College Freshman,4,"The process of switching rooms is difficult, but it still happened for me, and I love my new room"
College Freshman,4,"The people here are very nice and sociable, it is easy to find a study group for difficult courses.  The school also provides free tutoring for students, and all biology students begin research their second semester of freshman year"
College Freshman,4,"I am healthy, I feel safe, no complaints"
College Freshman,4,"Again, I really enjoy it here. The campus is lovely the professors are great and I am genuinely happy I am where I am."
College Freshman,4,Dominican has been a great experience for me. My academic advisor is probably one of the greatest human beings on the planet. He is definitely one of the reasons my time spent here at Dominican has been so pleasant. Classes are the perfect amount of challenging and the assignments are actually useful. I love feeling so connected to the community as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great school, staff, and professors. Almost everyone is friendly and helpful"
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is high around Dominican. The basketball and soccer games draw in huge crowds. At the games to keep morale going, the school gives away free shirts, phone chargers, and most importantly certificates to the surrounding food places in San Rafael."
College Freshman,4,"Dominican is known for over seventy percent of graduates being able to find work. The employers around the school are legitimate businesses with the nanny business booming in that area. If you aren't working on campus, you can work at the stores around the school or at the elementary school as a tutor. The career center is a great place to find work because jobs are posted regularly. And, the school has a job fair during the first month of school, so finding a job is very easy."
College Freshman,4,"Dominican University is a great place for those that are not too concerned with Greek life or partying. The school is truly geared on pushing the student's to their best potential and ensuring that someone gets out in four years. Plus, the school's location allows for numerous connections for pretty much any major. The professors are willing to help their students succeed and truly know what they are talking about. The classes have generally small sizes which allows for a personal connection to be formed with the professor. Overall, the school is a great place to get an education."
College Freshman,4,Having a degree from Dominican helps you indefinitely in the process of finding a steady job for your future.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are great for me because it allows me to ask questions and have a relationship with my professors. the professors are very willing to help outside of class hours and are very patient and understanding if you are absent for a sporting event.
College Freshman,4,The athletics program at Dominican University of California is excellent. They provide many useful tools to become successful. The coaches for the teams all correspond with one another and think of fun exercise which will connect the team members. the athletic facilities are great which allows the athletes and other students to get fit and become a healthier individual.
College Freshman,4,Being a Freshman at Dominician University of California has been a wonderful transition. The school and the many advisors have been so welcoming and helpful. I am involved in many activities around campus and love the community feel of the campus. I love being a part of the women's golf team and being able to travel around to many new golf courses I have not yet been able to play.  My schools location is unique because it is set so close to the San Francisco Bay. I love going into the city and experiencing new things.
College Junior,4,"There is a diversity of students, staff and faculty"
College Junior,4,Our last semester of our senior year we get to precept at a hospital
College Junior,4,The nursing program is challenging but the professors are very helpful and really care about the students
College Junior,4,Security is round the clock
Junior,2,"Professors don't show up to lectures, the Wifi on campus is HORRIBLE. We have had the wifi drop 4 times in the past 4 weeks. Many professors have given up teaching because it's so hard to learn online. Also, it's impossible to catch students cheating so professors don't really care anymore about that. Some professors show up late and end class early."
Junior,2,"If you want to come here to party and make friends please find another school. It's SO hard for students to make friends here. Socially, our school is a dead zone. Academically, most students come here for Occupational Therapy, Nursing program, and anything medical related. If you are coming here for any other majors, academically, it's really not worth it. The on-campus housing is extremely expensive and the student-life here is below average. I'm a current student and the only reason I'm here is for the OT program. Don't get tricked by admissions when they tell you Dominican has a lot to offer and there's a lot to do here. Take it from an actual student, there's not much to do here. We also have Confirmed COVID tested students here and out school is not sending an email out to notify students."
Niche User,2,"ATTENTION: RECRUITED HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES BEWARE, SCAM UNIVERSITY

TUITION CONTINUES TO RISE, TRANSFER RATES INCREASE, GPA INFLATION IS RAMPANT, ATHLETICS ARE POOR,  ADMINISTRATION IS CORRUPT, FACILITIES ARE DATED, HUMANITIES DEPARTMENTS ARE COLLAPSING"
College Senior,2,"If I could go back in time, I would only choose to go to this school again because of the wonderful friends I have made and classmates that I have met. However, the Department of Residence Life and the Nursing department members have made me absolutely hate being here. Members of both department are not as responsive to student's concerns and needs as I would have liked them to be and are biased/pick favorites with certain residents/students. Residence Life members will ding you for something but may not do the same to someone else who is their friend or favorite resident, which is completely unfair and frustrating. The Nursing Department members tell you to voice your concerns and opinions because ""the students are important to [them]""-- yet, when you try to address whatever your concern is, they disregard the issue and give a non-direct explanation as to why they did what they did. In fact, instead of answering your actual question, they make you feel like you're the one at fault for whatever the issue is that you're trying to address. Additionally, the department of Nursing is disorganized in the way they run things, which adds stress to the students' already stressful school load."
College Junior,2,Quality of food could be so much better. It's pretty disappointing.
College Junior,2,Honestly just don't go to this school and deal with this.
College Junior,2,"If you're a favorite, you have nothing to worry about."
College Junior,2,"Considering the financial aid is going down as tuition is about to spike, I'm not pleased."
College Junior,2,"Cost is obscene, and the hours open are awful. If you're lucky enough to get a pre packed lunch form, you can bet it'll be impossible since you need to submit it 24 hours prior."
College Freshman,2,Food is way too expensive and quality sucks. We need more variety/options. Best thing about the food is Ice Cream Thursdays.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I would like to see more fruit, organic food, coffee machine, cappuchino."
College Junior,2,"I've had a terrible experience so far within my first semester at Dominican University of California. I'm a graduate student getting a multiple subject teaching credential. My advisor, Dr. Rosemarie Michaels, has had trouble responding to my emails. I've asked to meet with her twice about scheduling for my classes, which is required of all students, and she failed to respond on both occasions. I had to follow up several times and contact other administration to schedule an appointments. 

My experience was further worsened when the University didn't take the tuition payment that I made on-time, and followed up with a late-fee. I have yet to know whether or not this will be corrected in a timely manner.

Now, to make matters worse, contrary to what I was told in admissions, they've recently decided to change class times to 4:30pm...conveniently after I applied and started my program.

I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of organization and communication at this school. I'd consider going elsewhere if I were a student still thinking about options, and I might decide to transfer with how hight the price of this school is and lack of quality I've found."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I didn't have too many problems, because I didn't cause trouble. But the RAs/administration is pretty strict about any rules if they hear about them. Obviously some students got away with visitation/alcohol/drugs if there was no reason for them to know."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm not much for parties, but the way I saw the party scene at Dominican was essentially a wannabe party scene. There would be very small parties in the dorms and off-campus, but basically small groups of beer pong and drinking games. A few of the parties off-campus got a little crazy, but nothing compared to a large university."
College Freshman,2,Not as much of a athletic pride as I wish
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of places around campus, but if there is, then there is very low availability as well as a higher rental cost, but it is still cheaper than living on campus"
College Sophomore,2,"THIS IS NOT A PARTY SCHOOL. Please remember that if you are going to come here. Yes, there are parties, but they are mostly super selective. So, if you don't know the host or friends of the host, the likelihood of you getting in is very low. And if you do end up getting it, they'll eventually make a big fuss about not knowing you and wanting you to leave when it gets too crowded. And even after all of this, the parties are sometimes in small apartments, so they get shut down by the cops very quickly. Basically, attending parties is sometimes a very complex, long process."
College Freshman,2,"I applied to many, but did not receive any."
College Freshman,2,there is no Greek Life
College Senior,2,FOOD STAFF DO NOT COOK FOOD PROPERLY (I.E. RICE IS UNDERCOOKED)
College Sophomore,2,Most people partake in drinking and smoking.
College Freshman,2,It's an expensive area to live
College Junior,2,"The library is not open long enough for you to use their computers, so having your own is very important. The WIFI is weak, so they encourage you to bring a router."
College Junior,2,"There is a bus stop conveniently located outside the gymnasium, but it runs infrequently. There have been several occasions when I took the bus to one location and it never returned to take me back. This was while following the bus schedule. On the plus side, it is cheap."
College Junior,2,"Living on campus is very costly. While choosing to remove yourself from this equation and living off-campus may seem valuable (considering you will not have to pay an allotment for food), Marin County is still an incredibly expensive place to live. This should be considered when looking at the amount of space you will have, distance from the school, parking availability at your new off-campus location, and other expenses you will incur, such as food and utilities."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not condoning underage drinking or drinking at all, but the campus is a little too strict in my opinion. Some of the Resident Advisors are very biased and will seek out certain people that they assume to be party people and sometimes search rooms for alcohol just because they feel like it. Also, if you happen to be in a room in which drinking is happening, you will be fined if the room is searched, even if you weren't drinking and just popped in for a second. They also tell you that if you bring a friend in who may have alcohol poisoning to get them help, you won't get in trouble. However, I have heard of people still being fined when they brought their friends in. It's all a little ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,I may not have explored enough because I am not sure about parties or other nightlife at my school.
College Junior,2,Freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus and there is only one bus stop in the town.  It would be amazing if there was easier transportation to San Francisco than a ferry which you can get to by the bus that is located 1 mile from the school.
College Sophomore,2,parking is outrageously expensive. considering the cost of parking you would expect to find an open spot but that is usually not the case.
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of girls that attend the school 
College Freshman,2,I did not receive enough aid and I am transferring from the school due to money shortage.
College Freshman,2,"Living close the campus is difficult to access because the college is pretty much downtown, and living downtown is extremely expensive in San Rafael. Many students have to go with bad, cheap apartments. "
College Freshman,2,"We dont have legit fraternities and sororities with crazy housing and parties, but we do have frats and sororities that offer admittance through academic achievement. "
College Freshman,2,"The housing is extremely expensive. Many students receive financial aid so what they end up paying for is room and board. They dont go into debt taking out loans for tuition and books, they go into debt taking out loans to pay for housing. I live about an hour and a half from campus, so I commute every day to eliminate those costs, but many students do not have that pleasure. "
College Sophomore,2,"honestly, there are ""no"" guys here. the school's a nursing school so it's like 70% female. the females here are nice enough not like gossip girl at all. the guys can be nice but some are just jocks and jerks"
College Sophomore,2,"there really aren't many options in san rafael. the most popular place would be Sol Food but it does get pricy and full. mr. pickles is pretty good too. i would not get asian food in san rafael. if you can drive, just head into SF (it's like a 20 minute drive with no traffic) for asian."
College Junior,2,There are drugs available at Dominican University to those who want them but not forced upon anyone. Different crowds have different standards.
College Freshman,2,"Since there is not greek life, finding that college ""nightlife"" could be a problem."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is very strict when it comes to underage ""nightlife"". If any underage drinking or other prohibited acts are caught, then fines will be faced by the student(s). Since San Rafael is near San Francisco, then many students prefer to go to the city to party, and go to clubs. Transportation is done by walking downtown, riding the bus, then riding the BART if necessary. Many students have their cars on campus which becomes the main use of transportation."
College Freshman,2,"Like any other school there are always students who use drugs, but it is not everyone who does so. A lot of it depends on who you are and who you hang out with."
College Sophomore,2,You pay too much to live on campus and don't get the greatest rooms or nice food. We are a growing school but I don't feel as though money is well spent on people who make things happen. So people who actually work hard are overworked on campus.
College Freshman,2,Freshmen can't have cars without a special permit. Very limited parking.
College Freshman,2,"While there are options for vegans, people who cant have gluten, etc. the food just isnt that good. But I have heard from other schools that it is much healthier options then what they are offered."
College Sophomore,2,"The atmosphere is dry. You have to make the most of your opportunities here at this university. Nice to be in the middle between Sonoma and SF. Many activities to do in the city, but not many things to do in San Rafael"
College Freshman,2,"Actually I would say ""what nightlife?"" The only ""nightlife"" there is exists at the parties hosted by the athletes' when they are off season. If not, you would have to go into SF to find a club and if you weren't over 21, the clubs in SF aren't even great. Getting into SF is a pain as well since the buses don't run often and it does take an hour to get there."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is diverse but there are mostly asians and whites. I think the campus should add more diversity. There does not seem to be any racial problems at my school. Even though we are a catholic school, there are gays and lesbians that attend my school. That does not seem to be a problem though. I wish my school was bigger as well."
College Sophomore,2,There really is only one and the food for the most part is pretty awful. Tater tots are good and the Thanksgiving dinner is excellent.
College Freshman,2,Breakfast and lunch is good but you'll still be hungry after dinner.
College Freshman,2,"Although the area is safe, the school is surrounded by mostly houses and very few apartment. Plus, the area is expensive. Unless you have a car, it is best to live on campus."
College Senior,2,"Dominican University Campus life is not very exceptional, in fact is quite dull which earns it the grade of a C, which is generous. Although I enjoyed my freshman dorm experience and made a lot of new friends, there simply are not a lot of activities that Dominican offers. There is only one multi-purpose gym with one basketball court and a single pool which is closed most of the year. Other than that there are little to no other activities offered on campus, and the city of San Rafael itself is not college town. On the upside, San Francisco is only ten minutes away."
College Junior,2,"Parking is horrible at Dominican University! Not all students that are living on campus are guaranteed spots. Although the campus does have parking available for daytime students, it is very inconvenient, as the parking lot is located at the back of the campus."
College Senior,2,Dominican us located in Marin in the north bay of San Francisco. Off campus housing can be pricey because of the area. But if you are consumer smart when looking are a place to live you can find something affordable. Craig's lost is usually the best and most efficient place to look for off campus housing.
College Junior,2,"Very Strict Campus â€“ I've only gone to one ""on-campus"" party and they had to keep everything down as the police enforcement is pretty strict. There are security officials on duty all the time and you feel like you are being watched all the time. Not the most pleasant college experience."
College Junior,2,"Weekend Activites â€“ During the weekend the campus is dead. Everyone heads home for the weekend and the dorms become eerily quiet. If you're looking for a party school, this is definitely not the place to be!"
College Freshman,2,Not Applicable â€“ I live at my home with my parents. I did not move closer to school. I commute and do not have enough knowledge of the off-campus housing selection for my school.
College Freshman,2,Not Enough â€“ The parking lot is not big enough for all off-campus students. I often have trouble finding a space. It is not unusual to see cars driving around the parking lot for at least ten minutes waiting for someone to leave his/her space. It should be fixed.
College Senior,2,Never Lived on Campus â€“ the dorms are pretty bare bones but does provide for that crucial social element that's very important element for youngsters going away to college. I didn't live on campus...I'm too old for that!
College Junior,2,Largest Nursing School in State of Ca â€“ largest nursing school in CA and a very pretty little campus
College Sophomore,2,I myslef had a hard time communicating with the proffessors due to lack of availability.
College Freshman,2,"More Girls Than Boys â€“ There are more girls that guys, a lot more. Its a small school which can make it feel like high school all over again, the good and the bad. Most of the guys here are jocks, and there are all kinds of girls here."
Senior,1,"Awful. It would need a complete overhaul to make it user friendly and accessible. The program the campus decided to use (Moodle) is clunky and number user-friendly when compared to something Canvas. The requirement to use Okta, for authentication to access anything school related, is simply an unnecessary burden. I hope the school will one day decide to find a better solution for online courses."
Senior,1,"This school is essentially a pay your way for a degree. The nursing department is saturated with instructors that have not practiced bedside nursing in years. The NCLEX pass rates are sporadic, ranging from barely maintaining the programs BRN licensure to adequate at best. The university as a whole was woefully unprepared for going remote and yet it seems to be receiving praise from dozens of media articles for how well it has done during this pandemic. I wish someone would randomly interview a few dozen students to see how well the university is really doing. If you want to get a good education go to another school, trust me you will be better for it. To those still attending this university. Best of luck. You will need to pretty much teach yourselves and find a way to get clinical experience since you will not get it from the school."
Junior,1,"The professors were NOT ready for online learning. I attended here during the COVID-19 Pandemic .Again, highly recommend you to go to another university."
Junior,1,"Really upsetting that I have to put a 1 star for this school. I had a terrible college experience here and I HIGHLY do not reccommend this school. The ""Dominican Experience"" that you get is awful. This school lacks diversity and always has technical errors on their website. I do not understand how this school costs so much and there is no great assistance.  I went here for two semesters and learned absolutely nothing ( you could find all the info online) Learned no skills either. I transferred to another university and I am learning way more. The staff in business services and the financial aid department are so awfully rude and serve no help. Save your time and MONEY and go to another university."
Works Here,1,"Since they don't have much money, they hire the professors that no other schools want. 

Their tutors aren't even trained!  

And you only have one food choice on campus.  

Campus buildings are so outdated. No air conditioning in any building, except one!  

Disgraceful how much they charge students for such bad quality."
Senior,1,Psycho professor Afshin Gharib who was asked to leave by his previous job and has the worst ranking and reviews online. He was involved in a sexual relationship with another faculty member and his lectures were all about 'men craving for sex with their mothers and women wanting to have sex with their fathers. Sick mentality!
College Freshman,1,"We are not good at sports. It is not a part of the student life unless you are an athlete. There are about 2 ""big"" events for sports, but that is all otherwise it is over looked."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greek life, which as an aspect I love about Dominican. It makes the campus a much more learner based area."
College Freshman,1,"The only thing about Dominican is that there's no Greek life, but the school does make up for that. The school hosts numerous activities throughout the year including dances and pageants (Mr. Penguin)."
College Freshman,1,We only have one Greek life which is very small and prominently for Filipino students.
College Junior,1,"DO NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS BEYOND FRESHMAN YEAR. The housing director does not handle her job well, and this causes problems for all of the students. If 95% of the resident population has negative experiences with ONE person, you can imagine... Of course, you won't have issues if you happen to be one of her favorites, because then you will most likely get to become an RA or have your write ups dismissed."
College Junior,1,"I've had a terrible experience here--from working with my advisor, Dr. Rosemarie Michaels, to other departments on campus, including Business Services. There's a clear lack of communication and organization, and thus lack of professionalism at Dominican University of California."
College Junior,1,"It's been a difficult feat to pay for this education. I wonder at times if it's been worth it to spend my money here and not somewhere else. I work 2 jobs to pay for this, and I've applied to numerous scholarships to no avail. Teaching grants are also very difficult to coordinate, more so than most people assume."
College Junior,1,"My experience with my advisor has been the worst. I've dreaded meeting with her knowing how my last two meetings have been. She's provided incorrect information--to my knowledge, at least several people from some of my classes received wrong information from her. Communication with her is extremely unreliable as well. She fails to respond to emails within several weeks, if at all. Calling and going to her office is also useless as she isn't often on campus. 

My latest hassle has involved scheduling my classes for the fall. She told me that if another class opened up, she'd advocate on my behalf to make it scheduled for 7:30pm (as was always the case in the past), but now it's been changed to 1:40pm. I'll have to quit my job or quit the graduate program at this point. I wouldn't even say that the scheduling has been the biggest headache though--it's mostly been just lack of information or incorrect information from Dr. Rosemarie Michaels. I can be flexible when I know that my advisor is at least trying, but she seems to be very dim-witted when I talk with her. I often wonder what I'm paying for with Dominican if this is what I have to deal with.

I would advise choosing a different school if only to skip the hassle of dealing with Dr. Rosemarie Michaels as your advisor."
College Junior,1,"I've had a ton of difficulty with the Financial Aid office and Business Services Office. They've failed to take my payment on-time, even though I was well within the deadline. They charged me a late fee nonetheless and still have not shown the payment. It's been taken from my bank account, but they appear to not know anything about it. I've been beside myself with the headache. (I work two jobs to pay for this, and I've received such little respect considering how stressful this has been...)

Emails back and forth from Financial Aid and the Business Services Office are late-coming. Communication is unreliable."
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for a greek life, this is not the school because it does not have one. You can always join another greek sorority or frat off campus and that would be normal since most students who do want to be involved in greek life would do that."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Junior,1,There are literally no frats or sororities at Dominican.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek Life. 
College Freshman,1,If you don't drive you have to walk or bike

Junior,5,"I have not taken any classes online yet, I will this semester coming up and I am so excited. I have heard great things."
Junior,5,"I haven't started at OSU Yet, but when I toured the campus it was beautiful and I fell in love with it."
Freshman,5,"I have had such an amazing experience at Oklahoma State. It’s so festive here, with all the orange and school spirit not only on campus but also throughout the surrounding town. It’s been really fun, and I would recommend the college to anyone looking into it."
Freshman,5,Online learning has been a difficult challenge for everyone but OSU has made it the easiest in my opinion okay
Freshman,5,so far I love it there people here are great and all my professors are understanding and will work with me okay good
Freshman,5,"My teachers have been so understanding and accommodating throughout the entire process. If I felt behind or confused, they offered many different resources for assistance. I would not recommend taking many online courses if you have a really bad tendency to procrastinate. Many of the courses are ""pace-yourself"" so you have to set aside time yourself to watch the lectures and do the work."
Freshman,5,"I love OSU! The community is amazing and everyone on campus is so inviting and welcoming. There are so many opportunities on campus to get involved, no matter who you are or what you like, so it's fairly easy to meet new people. Overall, it's been a great experience so far, and I can't wait for the next 3 years."
Junior,5,everyone is nice and speaks and make sure everyone is ok and is safe no matter what makes sure you have everything you need to be successful that school year or just in life. i love it here so much i would not change it for anything in the world this place is awesome and i love the people here as well . they are very good at what they do for their students and staff as well.
Junior,5,stay in touch with classmates teachers and advisors they have been making sure im ok and  they are very supportive with school and my health as well. thank you
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. Everyone is so friendly, small town feel. From the second I got to OSU I found friends."
Sophomore,5,The professors are flexible and classes are well adjusted online. Professors are easy to contact and TAs super helpful.
Freshman,5,I really like the people associated with the college and the people that attend. Everyone is very friendly.
Graduate Student,5,The teachers make sure all students are online during classes and make sure the learning materials are well understood by the students
Graduate Student,5,Oklahoma state university is the best university any student will wish for because they provide the best teaching experience for students and gives the best opportunity facilities
Sophomore,5,I love Oklahoma State because you can always see a friendly face and I’ve never met anyone who wasn’t willing to help someone out. Oklahoma state provides excellent academics as well as involvement opportunities. This place feels like home away from home and the cowboy family feels like real family.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience with Oklahoma State University so far is pretty amazing! Not only do they make sure you are apart of them, the friends that come along make it worth it! One thing I would like to see change so far is more diversity in the students, organizations, and professors."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience was a bit of a challenge, transitioning to in person to a screen was not an easy pick up for me. The teachers did reach out and tried to accommodate the student needs as much as possible with little resources they had at the time. Yes, the online experience comes with a different way of trying to study and a different way of how teachers teach their lectures in a way to not make it so stressful."
Junior,5,"I love the area and atmosphere that comes with the town that Oklahoma state is  located in. Of course I started out scared and worried about where i was going. Once I was there and started to accumulate to the new surroundings, everything fell into place and I absolutely love Stillwater, Oklahoma now."
Niche User,5,They were very helpful with the admission process. They answered all of my questions. Solved every problem I had including little errors on application.
Niche User,5,"What I liked about Oklahoma State was the environment they had they have a well college spirit school full of joy that makes you want to attend their school. I also liked the housing and how big the campus was. They had different places you can hangout, different activities each day. I plan to attend here with everything in me. They have all types of majors and different programs to study,the diversity is very good it fits my"
Junior,5,"My online experience was good, knowing the current situation, but when you in a high level major like i'm in aerospace/mechanical engineering. There is no way that online will be permanent these class will not fit the intensity of workload that an individual is able to handle."
Junior,5,"As any transfer student, i was pretty lost at first finding my bearings, but the  thing is about Oklahoma State University is that everybody is nice. I didn't believe that until I went to class and became apart of a gigantic community, it's absolutely extraordinary! and most of my friends came From OU (University of Oklahoma) and said everybody talks to you here! and you came join on campus organization easily! all major is important here, literally there is free thing that OSU give away and companies in your major and free food! every once and a while. You won't regret trying OSU , I wish all universities were friendly and supportive like OSU. I wouldn't change a thing!"
Sophomore,5,i like oklahoma state because it has great academics and is really diverse which are the two main reasons i came here but with all that being said there's still some problems with racial equality on campus for example we do not have a cultural/diversity center and there is not a lot of faculty that are black or POC which is crazy since oklahoma state always preaches diversity.
Sophomore,5,i had to take all my classes online at the end spring semester last year due to the COVID-19 outbreak  and i found it was the same as if we were having in person class i had no problem with the transition
Sophomore,5,The professors work with you even if its virtual. They want to see you pass the class and to graduate. The work looks tough but they give you about 2 weeks to turn it in. Even if its late just a few points are shaved off. Just don't procastrine too much.
Sophomore,5,"OSU is the best school to attend. When you enter the campus you'll find students who are friendly, outspoken, and just enjoying the freedom they have waited for their whole lives. This is also the safest campus in the state."
Freshman,5,Everyone on campus is super nice and will always help you out. They look forward to make friendships. They want you to feel like home which is what I felt like.
Freshman,5,They try to make everyone have the least online classes and more in person so everyone can have the full college experience.
Freshman,5,I did orientation online and everything went very smooth along with amazing people to walk me through every step with great detail.
Freshman,5,Everyone is super nice and very welcoming! The campus is cute and clean with lots of dorm space. Overall its a great college experience for anyone and everyone!
Freshman,5,I love attending this school!!! Game days are the absolute best and all the friends I have made will be cherished for the rest of my life.
Freshman,5,It is interesting for sure. I do not hope to use online next year. It is just not for me and I do not like it.
Sophomore,5,"Despite the below average stigma about the programs at this school, I found that it offered everything I needed from personal items to leadership opportunities."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved my time at Oklahoma State. The classes were all challenging but not impossible, and I feel like I learned a lot. The professors were great about taking the time to help students understand the material they are struggling with."
Graduate Student,5,"I took several classes online during my time at OSU, and I feel just as positive about them as I do my in-person classes. The professors posted lecture videos and the corresponding PowerPoint slides for the students. The quizzes and tests were completed through a LockDown Browser, but they were easily completed with our lecture notes."
Junior,5,"OSU really feels like home to me, and the people feel like family. I've had great experience with the college of agriculture, and good experiences with the classes I've taken in other colleges. Overall I think its a great place to learn and grow, and I fully recommend the college of agriculture."
Sophomore,5,"the online classes were very simple and easy to follow. The teachers were very helpful throughout the online process for students who did have trouble understanding what was being taught. The classes were activity filled and fun to be in, with teachers helping to make an overall fun experience out of online classes."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful and full of life. The students and staff are very friendly, allowing everyone to feel welcome and at home being on campus. The staff  truly care about the inclusion and development of the students. There is a lot of activities to do on campus, allowing everyone from each and every heritage background to feel included on campus."
Junior,5,"Oklahoma State is one of the nicest campuses, and it is always filled with people. The small-town feel of the campus makes Stillwater stand out like no other campus can. The staff is proud to be working at OSU, and everyone strives to represent the campus well."
Sophomore,5,My first year at OSU was great. I met a lot of new wonderful friends and tried new things. I was on the Board of Dictators in Pacthin/Jones Hall. We planed events for people who lived in those halls. I was also involved with the Baptist Collegiate Ministry and was on the events team for this club. I spent all of my time with people from the BCM. I worked at Boone Pickens Stadium as a club/suit ticket check-in. This job was a easy to do job that paid well and didn't take up to much time. I loved talking to my coworkers.
Alum,5,The online experience is perfectly fine. I did not do much of it because I loved being on campus and didn't want to spend the extra money to take online classes.
Alum,5,OSU is an incredible university with some of the friendliest faculty and students you will find. I had a great experience and can't recommend it highly enough. Go Pokes!
Senior,5,"Stillwater may not be the flashiest town out there but something about the cowboy family seems to cover that up. I was born bleeding orange and will die bleeding orange. The professor genuinely care and are willing to help with anything, you just have to ask"
Alum,5,The student organizations for branching into the professional workforce are pretty good and recognized by companies as practical.
Sophomore,5,"What I like most about OSU is its main overall student demographic, and how involved everyone is within the school.  No matter what there is always a friendly face to turn to."
Alum,5,"I took several online courses, some were related to my major and others were general education credits. There are some winter and summer break short courses available for gen eds that were so helpful and easy - which they shouldn't be difficult as 1000 level courses. The few intermediate level engineering courses that I took online during the Spring or Fall were all excellently put together and organized, and there was ample opportunity to dialogue with the professor or TA to seek help or glean more information when necessary. Granted, I only took online courses with professors/courses I knew were highly praised and rated from both peers and Rate My Professor. I am aware that not all professors devote the same effort to a quality online experience, as they prefer in person teaching."
Alum,5,"OSU has about 25,0000 students, but it is in a small town and has a family-like atmosphere! They have incredible donor support with most of the buildings updated or in the process of being updated, and the university is committed to providing a quality education for its students. As an Agriculture and Engineering land grant school in the Midwest, they are dedicated to research and there are ample undergraduate research opportunities available. In addition, there are over 200 student organizations to get involved in, and free student resources are available for everyone. The population is diverse, with over 100 nationalities represented on campus, and there are plenty of campus activities for students to partake. OSU does a great job of developing young people into adults with a well rounded education and college experience, and I loved every minute of my time in Stillwater."
Freshman,5,Oklahoma State University is by far one of the best colleges in the state! The students and staff there are outstanding! Students are very friendly and the staff are very attentive with their students. The campus life is wonderful and a safe environment as well!
Freshman,5,Oklahoma State is an overall great school. The atmosphere of the campus and people around makes school feel like home. The staff at OSU wants everyone to succeed and work hard for what you achieve.
Sophomore,5,I loved getting to meet new people. Being from Florida it’s a little scary going halfway across the country and trying to find a new start and new people. But everyone made it super easy to find where I was suppose to go. I can’t wait to go back
Sophomore,5,Honestly the online learn wasn’t so bad. I was actually fortunate enough to have professors who didn’t have zoom class during the actual class time. So for me I was able to do my homework or class work whenever I wasn’t as long as I got it in by the deadline. I mean I definitely don’t want so to it again but if we didn’t it wouldn’t be so bad.
Freshman,5,Even with everything that was going on the teachers were understanding and did all they could to make sure we understood
Freshman,5,I loved how the teachers did everything they could to make sure we as students were still learning and understanding.
Freshman,5,"I love that OSU is my home away from home. OSU is seriously my favorite place to be, even when I am in class. I could not imagine going to a better college."
Freshman,5,"I loved even taking online classes this semester, the teachers were so supportive in the transition from in person classes to online. I simply never imagined myself taking an online class, but I loved it. (I took 6 online classes)"
Freshman,5,"Such a welcoming, beautiful campus with equally welcoming people. I'm proud to be a cowboy and am excited to continue pursuing my degree at OSU."
Alum,5,Online classes included a lot of discussions. But professors were creative and good about posting powerpoints online for students to watch. Office hours were popular as well.
Alum,5,"I loved OSU, there is a lot of school spirit. People are friendly and teachers care about the students. There is something for everyone to feel included. OSU also is constantly building and improving their resources, which keeps the campus feeling fresh."
Sophomore,5,"For me, OSU is my home away from home. The town of Stillwater gives you a small-town vibe while at the same time going to a big school. Being an out-of-state student I couldn't always go home but I had many professors that I could always turn to if I ever needed something. The professors are really there for you and push you to succeed. Everyone there is so friendly and the campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at OSU! I had great professors all through my program in the college of education. I chose OSU as the Student Disabilities Services office was wonderful and helped get my accommodations set up [I have a disability]. The campus is gorgeous and the facilities are well kept and in some areas, brand new! It isn't the most diverse place on earth, but it's also in the middle of Oklahoma."
Freshman,4,"Different professors have implemented different things for online learning, so I have had some learning curves in different classes. My classes so far have all been synchronous, with an online option (usually via zoom) occurring at the same time as in-person class. Overall, the university has done a good job of encouraging professors to be more available and more communicative via the online programs we use throughout all our classes. In addition, the professors have been very understanding of different situations during this time and have been generously working with students to find options for completing work and getting experiences from the class."
Freshman,4,"It's hard and very challenging as usual for a university, but I can manage with all the helpful instructors."
Freshman,4,"At first, I thought this university was going to be a bad and hard experience, but after staying here for a while, everyone is professional and super friendly. Staff and instructors are always willing to help their students. I'm shocked."
Freshman,4,Very kind and welcoming. Extremely passionate professors. Need to be more aware of some freedom of speech when it comes to racism and discrimination.
Freshman,4,It's okay with the online change. Professors are still working on how to be online. Usually problems with the older professors. Some get very creative with videos and make it seem realistic as being in-person class.
Sophomore,4,Professors shifted to online learning well and provide the appropriate amount of work while providing great teaching on scheduled days. Professors are always willing to answer questions and discussion forums seem like they make students feel more comfortable opening up.
Sophomore,4,The engineering program is pretty cool. The Computer science department is terrible. The University hasn't handled Corona virus very well.
Junior,4,"I love the area and atmosphere that comes with the town that Oklahoma state is  located in. Of course I started out scared and worried about where i was going. Once I was there and started to accumulate to the new surroundings, everything fell into place and I absolutely love Stillwater, Oklahoma now."
Sophomore,4,"I love Oklahoma State university, everywhere I go the people are friendly and ready to help. The college broadcast its resources everywhere so I always know where to go!"
Junior,4,When learning went remote the professors really took the concerns of the students and helped them figure everything out.
Alum,4,I love the environment and campus overall. Everyone is kind and happy to be there - including staff. Lots of resources on campus. I'd like the school to be more open about dialogue with current events.
Alum,4,"I took a few online, and they were managable. The professors are super helpful and willing to meet in person if needed."
Junior,4,"I have taken a few online classes at Oklahoma State University and finished the second semester of my sophomore year online due to the coronavirus. My professors posted our assignments on canvas so we could plan out when we wanted to get our work done and made it more flexible for the students. During covid-19, some of my professors would give us the option of attending live lectures online, but did not make it a requirement. Professors answered emails and questions for students, and made online classes flexible for students."
Junior,4,"My experience at OSU has helped me grow in different ways than I could have ever imagined and helped prepare me for the workforce. I love the community I feel in the town of Stillwater and how much it feels like home. Everyone is friendly and wants to watch you succeed. The friends I have made through Oklahoma State University have become my best friends and share similar interests as me. My professors so far truly are and have been the best, as in, being flexible to work for their students and offering assistance in any way they can. I would like to see more parking options for students as it can become difficult due to a high amount of students on campus."
Sophomore,4,Oklahoma State University is a welcoming and genuine school. The surrounding city and its occupants are heavily involved in the school and the education and resources are top notch.
Senior,4,Online classes are better than actual campus classes. They do require an extra fee and some require you to take test through a proxy server which is an extra cost anywhere between $12 to $20.
Senior,4,"Overall a good school, but more focused on athletics and student athletes than their regular students."
Junior,4,"Online was great; however, some classes became more difficult online due to the fact that professors still struggled with Canvas and online material."
Junior,4,The environment there is so friendly and everyone is so welcoming. I highly recommend going to this school.
Alum,4,"I took various online courses through OSU, the professors would upload material about the same time as their physical class, although some courses are not the best online as I physical class session allows better explanation of the material as you can get immediate feedback from the instructor. This is best recognized with higher level courses meant to weed out students such as Physics 2, which also has a lab that is very hands on."
Freshman,4,Taking the classes online were a bit difficult but professors were very understanding and also lenient on assignments.
Senior,4,"I love my university. I love most of the staff and the atmosphere of the campus. The university isn't perfect, but what is? I would recommend going here if you're looking to be in an environment where you start to get to know everyone without really needing to make an effort to do so. You are surrounded by those of your major/minor/option which makes the school feel smaller and more comfortable."
Senior,4,"My experience with online schooling went about as well as you could expect. It was a difficult process, for both students and professors. I wished that the school had extended spring break for two weeks (instead of just one) and then our semester would just last one week longer than originally planned. I thought this would have given the professors more time (more than 1.5 weeks) to convert their class to online. But hindsight is 20/20. I appreciate the precautions my school took to keep their students safe and I hope they continue to do so, even if it means going online for the fall semester."
Junior,4,"Most of the instructors are pretty awesome. People say campus is huge, but the size dwindles quickly once you start walking and get to know where everything is. Lots of people to get to know."
Junior,4,"My only experience online at OSU was during the COVID-19 situation when campus shut down and everything moved online for the rest of the spring semester. Most of the instructors had never worked online and the transition was a bit rough, but they really worked hard to make the move as smooth as possible for us."
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus with a relaxing and friendly environment. My time at this University has been great thus far!
Freshman,4,Through the pandemic classes have been tough however the University handled it as best as they could in their situation.
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma State University is a great college! There are plenty of ways to get involved, and it is a very laidback, unbiased atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma State University (OSU) is a wonderful campus. The area is beautiful all times of the year, to me, at least, the people are kind, and there are many options for food, so there is something for everyone. On top of this, the university really pushes its own job searching program, which really makes finding work easy. The only problems I have had with OSU thus far are the lack of parking close to the center of campus and the fact that the hall I stayed in my first year, Stout Hall, is basically falling apart and has not been updated in a very long time. All in all, I would say my experience here has been far more positive than negative. Go pokes!"
Freshman,4,I love the diversity and overall atmosphere of the campus. There are so many opportunities to get involved and meet people just like yourself. The athletics are absolutely exhilarating and filled with laughter and friends. The professors are always willing to help with anything that they can; same thing with all of the faculty on campus. I have made many friends that I hope will be in my life for the long run.
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma State University is a good university because you get all the aspects of a big university, like sports and campus life, but also the small town atmosphere of Stillwater Oklahoma. OSU has a friendly atmosphere that welcomes its students and is willing to go above and beyond to help answer your questions."
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma State University is one of the best around because of its community. OSU has a true small town, real college experience. Whenever someone speaks about OSU that was a student, they always have the upmost respect and they speak very highly of the university. The university wants you to succeed, and it is very evident through the various resources they offer to students such as different forms of tutoring, great buildings and facilities, and highly qualified staff members."
Freshman,4,"OSU's professors are amazing. A majority of them have PhD's, so you know you're getting the best education you can. They also have a vast variety of resources to make sure you graduate in four years. This is important in a big school. I'm very happy to be here!"
Niche User,4,"I have only visited the school since I am currently in my senior year of high school.  I like that it has the decree I am looking for, comfortable with the distance from my home town and the town of Stillwater."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the atmosphere of the school. Moving away from home can be pretty daunting, but Oklahoma State University just has a way of making it feel like home. I don't regret my choice, and if I could choose again, I would still pick OSU. GO POKES!"
Alum,4,I loved the environment there. Everyone was so nice and always willing to help. It really felt like a family.
Sophomore,4,I love the academics and campus life. Oklahoma State offers so much for its students in help with classes or things to do on campus.  The facilities are very well taken care of and are very enjoyable for anyone who attends school here. I am very glad I am pursuing my academic career here however the one drawback to the school is that without a good group of friends it can get kind of boring. Everything about the school is great but you really want to make a good group of friends because there is not much else to do on the weekends unless one of the sports is in town then those are very fun to go to.
Freshman,4,"I like that people and professors are understanding. There are a ton of resources that the university offers from counseling, relaxing, math center, writing center, free printing. It’s amazing. Also, we have a beautiful campus that just draws you in and gives a good home like feel. The campus police assumes all college students are bad and they are not lenient at all. We know they’re there to protect us but it’s more like they’re there to fine us, we’re supposed feel protect but most of us are afraid. So, that’s my opinion and experience with OSU"
Sophomore,4,I'm only on my second year but I've had nothing but good experiences. the Science labs could use a upgrade but when it comes to teachers and staff they are amazing and only want what's best for you.
Freshman,4,"I live on campus. The food is great and in good locations. The student life is fun. I have met many new friends. I've had good, challenging classes. One professor is very hard, but i understand her and chose to take another class under her. I look forward to finishing my undergraduate classes here and go onto Optometry school at Northeastern Oklahoma State University."
Sophomore,4,Oklahoma State cares about it's students. They provide many assets to help students learn a lot of the material taught in the courses on campus. Not only that but during the week before finals OSU provides stress relieving activities around campus at no cost to the student. This has has created a welcoming feeling to students at the university.
Freshman,4,"Oklahoma State University is a great school. The town of Stillwater is the perfect college town with a lot of available resources. The University itself also has great opportunities for student involvement and great campus resources. The price for out-of-state is extremely expensive, however."
Sophomore,4,I love the opportunities in the Arts and Sciences college and the flexible hours I get working in the Union.
Senior,4,"Love this school! Immediately felt like home to me when I came here as a freshman. The campus is huge, so there’s a lot of walking to do, but it’s gorgeous. There are plenty of activities to do on campus through the Student Union Activities Board if you can’t find anything to do around town. The best dorms are the newest ones- University Commons- the others are alright. They’re livable but they have seen better days. All of the professors I have had were amazing! Really passionate and are more than willing to help students who are going through a tough time. Go pokes!"
Freshman,4,"Good school, like any other college it's going to cost a huge amount of money.College education can range from engineering to political science; it gives users the knowledge to achieve their goals through hands on experience and extensive learning. For me, my college education consists of heavy science and math courses for my electrical and computer engineering degree. In addition to these classes, I also take leadership and management courses, being smart alone isn’t a guarantee to running a company, you must be able to lead and talk with others. I believe education is a powerful tool for students, however a student must be willing to do more and expand their education, allowing them to have a little experience in multiple fields. Even in its definition education is defined as the process of acquiring knowledge preparing one for mature life.  But over all it was a new experience."
Junior,4,I'm currently in year 3 of 4 and so far I've had a couple of amazing semesters. And im excited and saddened to leave next year.
Sophomore,4,"College is beautiful, class structure good, knowledge gained so far acceptable.  
Cost to out of state student such as myself, outrageous."
Sophomore,4,The academic opportunities at OSU are extremely well structured. I am very impressed by the depth of their curriculum and the breadth of study that they are able to offer to students. Their undergraduate offerings and the breadth of courses are outstanding.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the fact that teachers are very willing to help you make sure you will pass. The instructors are very supportive and only want to see you succeed. Everyone is really nice. I don't think that there is anything I would want  to change about OSU. It has so many different people and it is so easy to make new friends.
Sophomore,4,the school is wonderful and everyone is very friendly but the tution is every expensive the doomrooms are larger than most and you have th echoice of a more private room or a shared room of about 6 people
Sophomore,4,As a student there I truly enjoy the experience. A beautiful campus with lots of social opportunitys!
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma State University has been so welcoming and warm. I transferred here from a community college, and the experience here has been wildly different. I feel so much more cared about and accepted her."
Freshman,4,"Of the many schools I toured and applied to, Oklahoma state is and was the only one who would consistently return my phone calls immediately and try there hardest to fix my issue. The dorms are getting better, with Kerr-Drummond supposedly getting torn down eventually. The food is good but I wish there were more cafeteria style options. The restaurant kind of idea is ok but I feel like it actually enables you to eat less healthy."
Niche User,4,I loved the staff and the faculty everyone was very helpful. I enjoyed the campus   and thought that the technology and apps they have for getting around were great.
Niche User,4,Oklahoma State University it's an outstanding school and it is considered one of the best valued institutions in Oklahoma. You can receive a great education at a lower tuition cost than other flagship state universities.
Freshman,4,From what I've seen from the University so far has been amazing and all the people I have come to meet have been sweet.
Sophomore,4,"I really like how everyone is nice and most of the teachers try to help you achieve the goals that you set. There are tons of things to do on campus for those that like sports, but I wish there was more to do for those that do not like sports."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere is amazing and I love attending the sporting events! I'm also extremely happy with the major I've chosen at this school.
Senior,4,"Oklahoma State has helped me in numerous ways when it came to academics. At first, I felt as if I was not ready, but after my freshman year, I utilized so many resources OSU has to offer. OSU offers a number of FREE academic resources made to help their students. The campus is also very safe and clean, while the facilities (for the most part) are great too. Most of my professors have truly cared about the students and are always there to help."
Alum,4,"I love OSU!! I had an amazing experience at Oklahoma State.  Everyone is extremely helpful and nice.  They plan so many different activities to get everyone involved and have a club for any hobby you can think of.  The football games are the best!! I earned an outstanding education, and had a super fun time doing it.  GO POKES!"
Sophomore,2,"OSU is a great school if you're the right type of person. Conservative, from Oklahoma, enjoys a rural setting, etc. I regret nothing more than only applying here. There are a lot of things I wish I had known about it before I committed and had I known them I don't think I would have. For reference, I'm from a big city, attended magnet schools my entire life, and I was used to a lot more diversity than there is here. I've found the academics to be easier than my high school was. This isn't to diss the school exactly, I think for the right person you could come here and love it, my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents went here and loved it, but I don't think it's for me."
Graduate Student,2,Oklahoma State has a horrible undergraduate program for Accounting. I had to switch schools because I couldn't stand it anymore.
Graduate Student,2,"I have been let down several times by this college.  Paid for courses I didn't end up receiving any credit for as well as being forced to retake classes only to not learn anything the second time around.  The chairs we sit in for three hours straight for graduate classes are plastic and terribly uncomfortable.  The temperature of the rooms is never accurate.  Bad advise is consistently given by mentors, advisors, and faculty."
Junior,2,"My freshman year I had a great time in my sorority and meeting new people but after that everything was a downhill spiral. My advisors didn't help me really at all, the professors don't seem to care in the slightest about their students and when you get one bad grade you can never get your grade up."
Graduate Student,2,"Nice campus, but professors are hit/miss. This is a great school if you want to have fun, but if you want to learn, I would choose another institution."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is way overrated
College Senior,2,Housing is way too expensive and many options are a 20 minute walk from all the classroom buildings.
College Senior,2,I've only ever heard of Greeks when they are throwing parties. They aren't very nice to non-Greeks.
College Sophomore,2,Greeks think they rule everything.
College Freshman,2,Some roommates need to respect the others on the same at night instead of being really loud while they ate trying to study or sleep
College Sophomore,2,Greek students seem stuck up and self-centered. I constantly feel judged by Greeks.
College Sophomore,2,Campus Police (CamPo) kinda suck. Don't do too much.
College Freshman,2,"We have had bed bugs, roaches, infestations of fruit flies, my bed has been broken for over a semester, and this housing is 20$ cheaper that if i were to live off campus with my own room and full kitchen."
College Freshman,2,"There is a large cost to the students that DON""T play sorts, to cover for the wasted energy and efforts of the football program."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about Greek Life because it isn't something I'm much interested in. I know that Greek Life does important things for the local community. However, Greeks act very snobbish to non-Greeks and generally don't acknowledge our existence if we aren't a part of their sorority or fraternity. Non-Greeks dislike Greeks because of their attitude and stereotypes about Greeks."
College Student,2,The dining hours are awful. None of the food is healthy which makes me end up eating off campus and having a ton of meal plan left over at the end of the semester which doesn't all roll over. Also the food is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,The quality of the food is average and I would not mind it if I didn't have to sacrifice my first three children in order to pay for it.
College Freshman,2,I have one scholarship that took me a long time to earn and not much time to almost lose. I was crammed into a lot of very hard classes and now it's hard to keep it and get new scholarships because my GPA has gone done because of the difficulty of the many classes I took.
College Sophomore,2,"Near campus is too expensive, way off isn't better"
College Freshman,2,"I'm actually being denied a scholarship I was supposed to get based on my ACT score because the school is telling me to go through the Regents and the Regents are telling me they have no jurisdiction. Currently, everything is coming out of pocket and from loans."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of students come with other priorities than serious study.  Being a more serious student, I found it hard to deal with the constant noise level. Roommates aren't always compatible and I didn't have much luck finding compatible roommates since I am less social than most."
College Junior,2,"I don't like them, I see them as a bunch of spoiled rich kids with not self identity or knowing of how to do for self"
College Junior,2,"if something major was to happen I don't have any faith in campus security reaching you in time to save your life, I would recommend that everyone, especially women take self defense classes, because campus security is like the phantom of the opera they're there, but you never see them unless your getting a ticket, they are good at that."
College Junior,2,"For the brief time I was on campus and the price it was horrible, people would take your stuff and the room was way to small for how much I was paying to live there"
College Junior,2,"without the college, this place is a ghost town in the middle of nowhere, there's nothing for the youth to do, not very diverse, the people have never been around certain ethnic groups, and it shows in their actions and manerisms"
College Junior,2,"Financial Aid at this school seems to be mainly for those who are considered Oklahoma residents, and is very difficult for non-residents to get scholarships here. I've been in school here for almost 3 years and I have yet to get a scholarship although I've applied for countless ones. GPA plays to big a role in obtaining a scholarship, it is not taken into the equation that some students have to work while in school, which results in lower grades do to being overwhelmed"
College Senior,2,They care more about saving money and getting students than protecting students from sexual assault. How many high profile cases will we need before things change for the better?
College Senior,2,"Baja is the only good place in the Union, and then there are some good places but are too far away from central campus"
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive and help in offering an alternative.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics are the most important thing
College Sophomore,2,Too scared to go out
College Sophomore,2,I have had a tough time with a class and I have asked tutors for help and even the professor but no one seems to care.
College Sophomore,2,I just don't like the way they compose themselves on campus
College Freshman,2,"Stillwater is great, but there's not much to do besides walmart and whataburger"
College Junior,2,"The registration process is annoying, but most of the available curriculum is pretty solid"
College Junior,2,"The town of Stillwater kinda sucks, you would think the town revolves around the school but it doesn't."
College Junior,2,"The best tip is if your paying your own way through not mommy or daddy or the federal government, you're screwed.  The System is totally against people who actually have a work ethic and do things for themselves. Or be an orphan or ward of the state."
College Sophomore,2,I barely got anything even with the struggles my family is presented with. But my family wants me to have the brightest opportunities and this school offered it.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is very expensive; either on campus or off campus. This is definitely something that OSU should consider lowering, cost-wise."
College Junior,2,There is never any parking and the pass is outrageously priced. The officers give tickets and I feel that a lot of the time it is not rightly justified. I feel that the students should be able to petition tickets more.
College Freshman,2,"I want to move to a school more suitable to my major, but for other majors this school is perfect."
College Freshman,2,It is poorly structured in that it is too strict on what order they want your classes. So in order to study aborad you will have to take an extra year just because you missed on class that was suppose to lead to another. Plus when studying abroad nothing transfers over like it does for other majors.
College Freshman,2,"Girls: Big T-shirts and no pants

Guys: Nicely dressed most of the time.

Does this make sense...no never."
College Freshman,2,"This is not the best school for fashion. I knew that when I came here, but there definitely needs to be some revising."
College Freshman,2,I know of too many people going to parties and getting sucked into underage drinking and other things of the sort. Why would you want to get so plastered that you don't even remember the things you did the night before? Honestly partying is not my thing so I wouldn't know much about what goes on on and around campus.
College Freshman,2,you have to live in poverty to get anything.
College Freshman,2,"The most famous attraction that allow students that are under 21 is Tumbleweed which is a dancing club. On one side there is the ""country"" setting where you can two-step and enjoy the music, on the opposite side of the building there is a section of ""hip hop/pop"" music where people who are of that genre can enjoy. 

As for the transportation, I hear that OSU has a twitter account in which serves as a DD service and aides those who are in no shape or form to drive. There are also sororities and fraternities who have DD for the night. There is also a DD service that you can call and pay $5 for the night, so it's pretty safe here."
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough places to park on campus! This is something OSU really needs to improve on.  I rarely will move my car because I am afraid I will not get a parking spot when I come back.
College Sophomore,2,I don't feel I receive that much financial aid.
College Freshman,2,You never know in Oklahoma!
College Freshman,2,a lot of underage drinking and partying
College Student,2,The Admissions office is more interested in people who are from the prestigious high schools across Oklahoma they tend not to reach out to the public ones in Tulsa or Oklahoma city
College Freshman,2,"The staff that ""fixes"" it sucks."
College Freshman,2,The weather here is really unpredictable. The winters are pretty cold and the summers are very hot. One of the worst things though is the constant wind that really never stops and makes the wind chill very bad in the winter.
College Freshman,2,"I come from a bigger city, so I'm used to a lot of food choices. Here, there's pretty much Taco Bell, McDonalds, Subway, Chipotle, Qdoba, Fuzzy's, McAlister's, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Chili's. There are a few others but I get bored with the choices very quickly. Eskimo Joe's is of course the place to check out, and Vaquero is pretty good too."
College Freshman,2,"I personally am not a fan of Stillwater. I come from a city, and I'm used to being able to have hundreds of restaurants to choose from and 6 movie theatres and the small town just isn't my thing. However, Oklahoma City isn't too far away."
College Freshman,2,Restaurants and eateries are too expensive for college life.
College Freshman,2,The local weather for those that are use to the cold temperatures seem to be ok.
College Freshman,2,"I believe the cost of meals could be less expensive, considering the tuition and cost of college as a whole."
College Junior,2,Permit costs are outrageous and increase every year. Tickets and fines are even more outrageous and expensive. The parking police are the worst at giving tickets. It is impossible to find a spot living on campus and off campus. 
Junior,1,It was awful. The entire university panicked and it was easy to tell. I felt the staff was not prepared in way shape or form for the circumstances.
Freshman,1,"This place was awful, Greek life was terrible and there was no party scene. The town is small and there is nothing to do. Academics were not that great either. Definitely regret going there and already transferring to OU."
Graduate Student,1,"After achieving a 4.0GPA with several honors during my master’s program, I was terminated from my graduate assistanship and blocked from completing my program while I was on medical leave because I notified OSU about the discriminatory hiring of James Knecht an unqualified male applicant for Interim Director of UAT when they had a perfectly qualified female applicant who was too afraid to stand up for herself due to fear of retaliation. Sheryl Tucker - Dean of the Graduate College, Pamela Fry - Associate Provost & VP of OSU-Tulsa, and Gary Sandefur - Senior Provost (and many others) have played serious roles in the cover-up of the discrimination against me...a disabled student and employee, and that female applicant. Gary Sandefur also threatened a lawsuit if I spoke of this to anyone. 

PS And, this University is more than happy to stifle freedom of speech when you’re trying to expose their corrupt cover-ups!"
Junior,1,Oklahoma State University is a beautiful campus with a terrible education at a VERY expensive price.  I moved on my own without help to take classes here and I have been getting the run-around on various issues since I got here in 2016. I have since transferred to Arizona State.
College Freshman,1,Greek life is ruining the culture of our generation.
College Freshman,1,I absolutely hate Residential Life. They are terrible at maintaining the buildings they do have and they don't provide any amenities or perks to living on campus. They don't respect Freshman living on campus (presumably because we are required to live on campus and they don't actually have to care about our concerns). I have called three times for roaches and twice for bed bugs. I have asked to be moved to another room and they refuse to move my roommate and I despite having open rooms.
College Junior,1,"for the average college student like me the off-campus housing is extremely absurd, if you don't have a big budget you will likely have nowhere to go. most places are not within walking distance and cost more per month than the average students make total. I fortunately found a place to stay, but it's not he best, but it is cheap"
College Junior,1,"I don't party so I wouldn't know, as far as I can see the parties are not very diverse, being that my college is predominately white kids who have never been around people of color"
College Senior,1,"Friendly people but it's in the middle of nowhere. If you don't have a car or if you're a city-person, you are screwed"
College Freshman,1,"There are no student discounts available, it is very difficult to find organic food."
College Sophomore,1,"I wanted to live on campus but when I found out how bad it is, I would just rather live alone in an apartment."
College Junior,1,"The town of Stillwater is horrible for dining options. Very few places are open late, (usually not past 8 or 9). And the places that are open are bars and that's it. This town sucks for food."
College Freshman,1,"The wind is TERRIBLE. I don't know if our location has anything to do with it, but I can not get over how awful the wind is. It seems to never let up. 

Also, when it snows, doesn't matter how much we get, they never cancel school and I know of multiple times when people have broken bones from slipping on the ice walking to class."
College Sophomore,1,"The Greeks are very irritating. They act and speak in a very unintelligent manner, and are very aggressive and dominating on campus. There are enough students where you can find your own niche away from Greek-dom, but it IS a large presence at this university."
College Freshman,1,Initially when appllying I had high hopes.  UNFORTUNATELY NO FUNDS! :(
College Sophomore,1,"Campus parking enforcers are everywhere and God forbid you have to go into a building for 5 minutes without having to walk a mile or pay a fee. I heard they sell 5 permits per parking space, and no wonder there is never a place to park. "
College Student,1,Its terrible even if you had a parking permit you would still have to fight for a spot everyday.
College Student,1,Its frezzing for a few days then it summer hot the next.
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate Greeks. They are snooby and look down on everyone, but in reality have no clue about life beyond daddy's pocket book."
College Student,1,"The building I live in (Kerr hall) is absolutely terrible. The elevators are always broken and the bathrooms are disgusting. The whole place looks like it an break at any moment. On the other hand, other campus living areas are great and are a thousand times better than here."
College Sophomore,1,I would have gone to school when I was 20 but I couldn't file independently until I turned 25 so her I am 5 years later. I was able to pay for community college so I got my AS but I am still behind. I hope to catch up after I graduate. 
College Junior,1,"I'm in Graphic Design. I hate it. It's something I love to do, but the teachers definitely have favorites (which are the naturally talented students) and don't give much help to other students who struggle to reach greatness. The program has small staff, so we have to take the same teachers again several years in a row. The work load is crazy hard. Studio classes are 3 credit hours, though they are 6 hours each week, and you're required to do sometimes into the hundreds of concept sketches for one assignment. Being a part of the program and getting good grades requires a huge sacrifice from your social life. Our adviser is very sweet, though, and e-mails students internship and job opportunities when they are available."
College Sophomore,1,"If you live on campus, parking is a nightmare. Once you park you will never move your car. Once you move your car, you will be parking miles away from your destination. None of the parking lots have security cameras. The campus police are very strict and issue tickets without blinking their eyes."
College Junior,1,Be sure to get to class 30 minutes or earlier in order to get a parking spot
College Freshman,1,"From experience, there is absolutely nothing to do in Stillwater. The restaurant selection is limited, there is one movie theater, a bowling alley, and  a few bars. I'm in a sport, however, so I am very limited in my activities. I cannot go out to parties or the bars so that may have something to do with it. Stillwater is still a very very small town and there isn't much recreation here."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone on campus hates the arrogent, rude, spoiled Greek students who think the earth revolves around them. Their only redeming quality would be the charity programs but those have become a joke too."
College Freshman,1,"On-Campus parking is ridiculous. There are not enough sports for the number of students OSU has. Permit costs and tickets/fines are reasonable, but can add up."
College Senior,1,"The parking is insane! They have recently increased the cost for permits. And the parking staff are like vultures searching for someone to give a ticket! The parking is also very limited, so if you live off campus, you will be searching for a bit. If you are a freshman or live on campus you only get to park by your dorm and thats it. The dorms are an ""ok"" distance, but typically you will have to walk further than the people who have ""off-campus"" permits."
College Freshman,1,"It's Oklahoma, the weather will always keep you on your toes. Once we hit a 100 degree difference in one week."
College Freshman,1,I have had a lot of trouble trying to find parking at night or in the morning. It is horrible at those times even the over flow parking is full. During the day it isn't as big of a deal because people are out and about.
College Junior,1,"The police are extremely strict about parking. I got a ticket just the other day for parking in the clinic parking lot when there was only a half hour left for the police to ticket, and I have also caught and spoken with a policeman who was trying to ticket me after ticketing hours."
College Sophomore,1,I did not recieve any financial aid from the university.
College Senior,1,"Good Luck – The parking can be a nightmare especially if you commute like me. There's only one or two lots and by 8 am, they're completely full. You're circling for about twenty minutes making you late for class and when you finally decide to head to the garage you have to pay a dollar an hour unless you have a garage permit. Needless to say, I have taken to other forms of transportation (walking, biking, the bus, etc.)."
College Senior,1,"No Help at ALL – I recently needed great help in scholarships and went to the financial aid office.  As a transfer student I did not get ANY help at all. I was just told ""We will email you as soon as we get any."" and sent out of the room.  I was given no forms or any care at all. My own department has been greater help and my adviser could not believe that the office did this to me. I would love to know how a transfer student with an overall GPA of 3.8, an Associates degree, and is a part of several academic organizations, and is an officer in a few of them, is eligible for NO scholarships at the school, just loans. If you are a freshman I imagine they will throw money at you for coming to a four year school off the bat."
College Sophomore,1,"OSU Parking is horrible. They provide more faculty parking than student parking. The student parking lots are easily filled and overcrowded, during class hours. Imagine Christmas parking at the mall; hard to find and far to walk."
College Freshman,1,The Drug Scene – There are not many inspections for drugs around campus. I personally have never heard of one.
College Freshman,1,Over Crowded – Parking cost 66.00 a semester and is a nightmare.  I live on campus and sometime's I am parked more than 3 blocks away.  I use a skateboard to get around becaus I do not want to move my car unless it is to go home for the weekend and when I come back I do it very early to get a place and tickets.  They are very ticket happy around our campus.
College Freshman,1,"If you aren't looking for a spot on the weekend then you will be hard-pressed to find a spot close enough to your dorms. They have parking lots on the opposite side of campus, which is about 20 minutes walking distance from the center of campus where the library is located. If you find a good spot there is a rule among my friends: You never drive."
College Freshman,1,Our campus has brutal parking. There are not enough spaces for the ammount of students living on campus. It's a miracle if you get to park anywhere near your room. Its like a war just to find a spot. They are also very strict on fines. I once saw someone get a ticket for parking crooked. Everything is pretty handy on campus though so a car isn't always necessary. The permits are also pretty pricey and somewhat confusing. There is a definite need for more parking at OSU!
College Freshman,1,"Parking for Off-Campus Students – The off campus parking is not very good. If you do not have morniing classes, then you are going to have a hard time parking. I have to park in the Student Union parking garage a lot and they charge per hour. I paid for a parking permit and the fact that they do not have enough parking for everyone is disappointing."

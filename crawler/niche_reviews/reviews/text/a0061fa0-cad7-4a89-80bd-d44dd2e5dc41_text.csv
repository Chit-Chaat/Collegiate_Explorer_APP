Freshman,5,"Usually it's difficult to feel included and noticed in an online setting, but this is a very personalized, inclusive online program."
Freshman,5,"A great breadth of class choices, extremely personalized and focused on your chosen major. They offer very affordable classes, fully accredited, with decent school scholarships, and the online program seems fantastic so far. The administration is very helpful and communicative, and everyone is kind and generous with their time."
Sophomore,5,"Central Christian College Of The Bible is a great place to be. The people here are fantastic and they believe in God. The students that are accepted come from various backgrounds and they love people and they love God and it is displayed through their actions. I like the atmosphere where love pours all around this place, where strangers feel like friends and friends family. The professors are personable and will do anything to help students succeed and they are real people and do not have the presumption that they have it altogether."
Freshman,5,Great atmosphere and a place to grow with people who live life with you and care about you as you go through your journey!
Freshman,5,It is a awesome place to learn Gods Word. I chose this college because it felt like the place God wanted me to come this was the only college that got back to me about applying to I am very thankful this door has opened.
College Freshman,5,It's the best. I feel I can actually grow as a person.
College Student,5,"It a great school, I would high recommend it to anyone"
College Senior,5,Everything is safe in the city. There are plenty of fun activities in the area.
College Senior,5,Off campus is a great option as far as affordability.
College Senior,5,The dorms are a great option. They are very affordable and of high quality. The social atmosphere is well worth it.
College Senior,5,"The acedemics at Central are of the highest caliber. The faculty are all overqualified it seems, but also very friendly."
College Senior,5,Both the academic quality and community of this institute are of the highest quality.
Junior,4,"I'm currently a junior at CCCB. The people, the schooling are excellent. The people are open, religious and God-focused. The academics are very rigorous but worth it. You truly learn the Bible and how to interpret scripture without the professors or the school imposing their personal beliefs on students. I wish that there were more exciting things to do off campus to get your mind off of school."
Senior,4,At CCCB the campus community is great. We have a small campus so you get to know a majority of the student body.
College Junior,4,I am learning a lot with classes.
College Senior,4,"There are people that are very different from you, but yet we all share one mind on so many topics."
College Senior,4,"Weather is unpredictable everywhere, but Central almost never misses school due to it."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The college has dorms, there is one newer dorm, but the two other dorms are fairly older, but they are in decent shape."
College Senior,4,This major is fantastic. It has allowed me to transfer in and still graduate on time; while learning what I need to be equipped for the field.
College Junior,4,"Central is located in central Missouri. She experiences typical Midwest weather. Winters are cold, but not so bad that classes get cancelled frequently. Fall and Spring are both beautiful season with Missouri's rolling hills."
College Junior,4,"Living at Central – Central dorms are nice. The newest dorms have walk in closets. Overall, this makes the room size smaller, but this can be considered a positive because of the clutter that is eliminated from the living area in the dorm rooms"
College Junior,4,The computers are average as well as the internet access. The school is in the process of updating the internet capabilities. One of the great things about the computer labs is that there is no fee to print if you print from one of the school computers. There is wireless access almost anywhere.
College Sophomore,4,"Fairly Conservative – Since it is a Christian college, the students abide by higher standards. Dress codes are rarely violated. Drinking and/or partying are not tolerated. Students are studious, kind, and really, it's like a large family."
College Sophomore,4,"Within Walking Distance, for the Most Part – I honestly do not live off-campus, but I know students who do. Most have never complained about the cost of living, though it is cheaper to live on-campus. There are apartments within walking distance, some just down the street, and many within a short drive of the college."
College Sophomore,4,"Fast Food Options, Chinese, Mexican, Wal-Mart, Pizza – Since the college is located in a more quiet corner of town, you would need to either drive or catch a ride with someone to a restaurant if you wanted food other than cafeteria food. Otherwise, there are pizza places that deliver to the dorms. For the finer dining, a bigger city (Columbia, MO) is less than half an hour away."
College Senior,4,"Student Center – Has a coffee-house, pool tables, ping-pong table, tv's, lounge area, computer area, conferance room, and work-out area."
Recent Alumnus,2,The nearest thing to do is to drive 30 minutes to Columbia to do anything. But there are always things to do around campus so that you are not completely board all the time.
Recent Alumnus,1,Horrible to say the very least. Contact for more info OR read my review on their Facebook page.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This college is horrible. There are professors who are bigots, there was once a required text that literally challenged the mental capacity of Full Gospel/Pentecostal believers. They are condescending to say the very least."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This place is a joke, run away, run very very far away!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Feel free to read my full review on their Facebook page.

But be VERY CAREFUL about going to this college.

They never were ""great"" but they have changed so much, you may want to consider staying away from them!

They may possibly be borderline fraudulant.

They seem to discriminate against Full Gospel/Pentecostal believers.

They ARE VERY rude and VERY dishonest!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"HORRIBLE COLLEGE! 

Borderline FRAUDULANT!

LIKELY DISCRIMINANT!

Feel free to contact for more information or find my FULL REVIEW on Facebook."

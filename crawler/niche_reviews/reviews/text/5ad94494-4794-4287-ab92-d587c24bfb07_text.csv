Freshman,5,I did not really do any online classes at lee university however my roommate was mainly all online and she had great things to say about it
Freshman,5,I love my experience at lee it feels like my new home and I wouldn't have chose to go anywhere else but Lee
Junior,5,"Lee University's moto is Christ Centered Excellence and that is exactly what it is.  The community is loving, the professors care, and Lee University has your best interest at heart. The love of Jesus is evident in every aspect and the staff wants and loves to see students fulfill their calling. Go Flames!"
Junior,5,"I took online zoom classes during the pandemic and it was handled very well. While, I personally would rather be in person, Lee University was very professional and excellent in the situation."
Alum,5,I am an alumni . I absolutely loved my time at Lee University.  When I 1st went there it was called Lee college... My senior year of live was they changed it to  Lee University.  I received a great education.  I also met my beautiful wife their. We have now been married 22 years. We have 4 children and we pastor in amazing church in Saint Lucie County Florida
Alum,5,I personally did not do the online program however my brother-in-law did.  His name is David Webb. He spoke at the commencement ceremony a few years ago  And the University use that speech thousands of times to promote their online learning.
Alum,5,"It is a wonderful school where the students are truly cared for. The campus felt like home, and everyone is friendly."
Alum,5,"Their online classes are great. It was wonderful taking both online and on campus classes. The professors try to get to know you on a personal level, and they truly care about you receiving a good education. The teachers also want to help you spiritually and mentally."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment the most about Lee University. You are constantly surrounded by people who are there to encourage you and support you no matter what.
Sophomore,5,"We had to switch to online platforms because of the COVID-19 situation, and the way it was handled was very professional and smooth. The professors and staff were trained adequately in having to teach classes through online platforms and it definitely promoted motivation for me to learn even though I wasn't in a classroom setting."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Lee has been a blessing! The core values and the faith the university builds in each student is a holistic experience where students will remember for their lifetime and not just their college season.
Junior,5,The atmosphere around the campus is great! The teachers are more than willing to work with you and the academics are great!
Junior,5,The online experience has been great. My professors are constantly in contact with me through email or videos to give me their expectations and due dates. They have gone above and beyond on clarifying how things should be done and don’t leave any room for misunderstandings.
Alum,5,"Experience in any university is about involvement and application. If you apply yourself and involve yourself in some kind of activity outside the classroom, your experience will be a positive one. This was my Lee Experience."
Freshman,5,"Lee University is unlike any other college I've visited. First off, the campus is absolutely gorgeous and feels like home. The professors and staff genuinely care and love all of their students. They are so excited and thrilled to meet you and walk with you in an academic perspective but also through life. I am so thrilled to spend the next four years at Lee!"
Freshman,5,Lee University is not like any other college. People care so much about you and your education. This campus is filled with love for God and others. There is never a day I go without smiling. It truly is a great experience.
Niche User,5,"Such a beautiful place, amazing location full of professionals ready to help you. With a great diversity Lee showed me a place where I could feel safe and comfortable."
Works Here,5,"It has been the best 4+ years of my life. You gain so many friends, amazing experiences, and opportunities for the future."
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment and Christian community that you see here. It is a small, maybe above average, so everyone pretty much has seen or knows someone. The cafe food may not be the best and they don't have many choices. There are tons of groups you could get involved with and many chances to get to know the community around you by doing community service."
Freshman,5,I visited Lee University last April and have been striving to get into their college since. Everyone I met was so kind. I felt like I belonged. My major is in Vocal Performance and I love the faculty.
Junior,5,Overall my experience has been incredible here for the past 3 years. The way the teachers engage with the students and the amount of opportunities for students to get involved on campus is wonderful at this university.
Freshman,5,"Just a well build school, and a better built culture. The campus is beautiful and not too big so it’s still personal and the sites are important."
Niche User,5,"I love everything about this school. The schools campus is absolutely beautiful. The people are incredibly nice , and they all believe god is the way to an amazing life."
Sophomore,5,Amazing! The teachers are so helpful and students are friendly. I wish there were more options for the meal plans.
Freshman,5,It's small size. The teachers seem to really care.   The class sizes are good.  I like the small town it is located in.
Niche User,5,"Lee University has such a welcoming, family-like atmosphere. You are instantly connected with those who share your similar interests but are also challenged by different world views. Lee is by far one of the most affordable private, 4-year universities in the country without any lack of quality. I'm excited to be a #FutureFlame!"
Freshman,5,This University is great! The class sizes are very good. The professors really care about you and want you to succeed. The on campus environment is very healthy and fun.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Lee and love it! I live in Bowdle OBannon and have gotten to know a lot of guys. The leadership is  intentional about making sure we connect. In the Freshman Gateway class we do a lot of things to get to know other freshmen. We have socials and do service projects together. The class teaches us how to ""do college."" I can say the food is really good at Lee. We have the cafeteria that offers a really good variety of options, we have a Subway, Dunkin Donuts, Chick-fil-a, etc. The chapels are really good and challenge us to follow Christ and live a life pleasing to him. Now, academics. The classes are hard, so get ready to study if you want to succeed. Know that you're going to have to spend plenty of time outside the classroom to make the grades you want."
Freshman,5,"This is a beautiful campus.  I decided not to start right after graduating high school and instead get a job and take a short break and when I did decide to start applying, I visited Lee and every person I encountered was so welcoming and encouraging.  I even asked students for directions on campus as I was finding my way around and the environment is happy, positive and uplifting.  I am so excited to have been accepted and starting in the spring!"
Niche User,5,I'm doing dual enrollment at Lee during my senior year of high school.  The students and professors have been very welcoming and helpful to me. The campus is beautiful and inviting!
Sophomore,5,Lee University is absolutely my favorite place in the ENTIRE WORLD. I truly feel like the best version of myself while I am there. The teachers push you to be the best student and the best person you can be. I always feel like I am prepared for obstacles that come my way because of the way we are taught at this school. I never feel judged and I always feel like I have a family away from home.
Sophomore,5,"I'm about to start my second year at Lee University, and, aside from its top of the line academic courses, life at Lee is excellent. It has clubs galore for all sorts of activities, ranging from video games to sports to theatre and arts. I found that it was almost funny how friendly everyone was there. If you give a smile you're bound to get one back. I live in the dorm building Medlin Hall, and the community there is very friendly. They're like my new family, and I truly miss them when I'm away. I can't imagine a better college to attend"
Senior,5,Lee has been one of the most amazing decisions I have made so far in my life. The small sexting makes it easier to stay connected to friends on campus. The staff is always willing to provide help and guidance when needed
Senior,5,"Lee University is a great school, with great opportunities to get connected. They provide so many experiences to prepare you for your future career."
Sophomore,5,Lee is like a fresh breath of air. They always do their best to make you feel welcomed. The professors are truly their own breed. They go out of their way every day to help any student who asks for it. I feel blessed every day that I am on campus. It was and is my new beginning/fresh start.
Junior,5,"At Lee University, teachers love their students. I have seen this first hand via the countless hours I have spent discussing academic topics in their offices, many nights playing board games at their houses, and the various on-campus events where professors have joined."
Sophomore,5,Lee University is an amazing school where a bunch of young college students can come together and have fun while learning something new everyday.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Lee University. As an incoming student, make your goal to get connected to as many people and groups as possible and you will love it!"
Niche User,5,It was beautiful and amazing and the presence of God just surrounded the entire campus. The people there treat you just like family and make you feel so welcome. The president is amazing and really cares about his students and I think it’s amazing how he is a professor also.
Niche User,5,"Visiting Lee University was a great experience. The school is filled with nice and really helpful people. The school is a really beautiful sight and it is a school that I will never forget. The diversity was also really great and I love that it is a faith based college. Christianity is a really important religion to me and Lee University  showed me, that it is also important to them too. They also really care about you education, they will give you tons of information that you need to know about the majors that you would want to try out. And they really care about their students, so this school is really perfect, and I hope to come back soon."
Sophomore,5,Lee University has changed my life! The professors help us integrate faith into the classroom in a seemless and amazing way!
Niche User,5,"Lee is a very diverse college. You can find anything at the school from music, to science, to even athletics. Everything is at Lee. To add on to that, it’s in a very popular area so there are plenty of restaurants, churches, stores, etc."
Freshman,5,I started Lee in the fall of 2018. It has been nothing short of amazing! The professors truly make my time here great. I love going to my classes and being able to learn about Christ in all my classes. The professors truly care about the students. There are so many clubs and organizations outside of Lee to get involved in so I definitely suggest looking into some of them. I like dorm life and living on campus so much. There's just an atmosphere here at Lee that is unlike any other campus and it is truly an amazing school.
Freshman,5,"Lee University has a beautiful campus, engaging professors, and a very developed sense of community."
Niche User,5,I love the environment so much! Everyone there is so on fire for Jesus and it is an absolutely amazing community. So uplifting and positive!
Freshman,5,I love how willing they are to work with you and around any inconvenience! They are ALWAYS helpful and they have never pushed me to the side for any reason!!
Senior,5,"I have been apart of Lee University Online for 4 years now. I have had an amazing experience with the courses, professors, and fellow students. This is a school I would highly recommend for anyone seeking ministerial degrees. They offer a variety of degrees that prepare you for ministry and share a deeper insight into God's word."
Junior,5,I love Lee University. It had wonderful academic programs and is preparing me in every aspect for graduation and my career. I feel welcomed on campus and am always excited to start the new academic year.
Freshman,5,I really like it and would not change anything.  I feel like the Lord is present and that the professors really care about the students.
Senior,5,"I am getting ready to graduate from Lee, I have been in the online program and it is awesome. The university uses moodle for their online work and it is real easy to follow, and understand. I am thinking about working on my masters there as well. I would not change anything about the online program, but I would like for them to have a payment plan that you can make payments every month instead of having to have your bill paid in full after 3 months."
Junior,5,"Absolutely love this school! When most of my friends that go to other colleges refer to having to go to school, they usually speak about it in a dreading and negative way. When I think about being back on Lee campus, I am always excited to be there and get to gain more knowledge. The professors are outstanding and very personable. I feel that the education is definitely worth the price that I am paying for school. The campus itself is absolutely beautiful, and I love just getting to walk around campus looking at the architecture and landscape. I would recommend this school to anyone."
Junior,5,"I came to Lee in the Fall of 2017 as a Sophomore. I moved into a dorm on campus and begin to experience campus life up close and personal since I had never lived on campus anywhere. I found that campus food was actually not half bad since they recently renovated the dining hall. The RA's and RD were very personable and really made me feel welcomed and accepted in my new home. The campus is beautiful and I really love how all the buildings have the same design. They are always improving and the general area of Cleveland, TN is a wonderful place."
Sophomore,5,I love it here! I have met awesome friends and helpful professors. The campus is located in the perfect spot of TN. There are so many clubs and activities to be involved in on campus. Life is amazing at Lee.
Sophomore,5,I have been at Lee University for a year now and it has been the best year of my academic life. The professors were absolutely amazing and helped me grow as a student. I now have a job on campus that plugs me in even more. I love Lee University!
Sophomore,5,"Lee University has that home-feeling to it once you step on campus! It's beautiful how everyone comes together to worship God and although you might still feel lost, the students on campus are very friendly and engaging, making it easier for new students to feel welcomed!"
Sophomore,5,"The school overall is amazing. It’s inclusion of faith into their curriculum allows you to grow spiritually, as well as get the degree you desire. I’m glad I chose to go here."
Alum,5,I absolutely loved my time at Lee. I made lifelong friends at Lee. I have friends from Freshman year of college and eight years have passed and we are still the best of friends. I developed a true relationship with the Lord while attending Lee which you cannot put a price tag on. The professors genuinely care about the students and I left well prepared for the career that I am currently in right now.
Sophomore,5,"A very good school, inspirational and Godly. Professors are wonderful and care about the students. Campus is beautiful."
Junior,5,"From the professors who invest in their student's lives, to the students who support one another like family, to the campus that truly feels like home, Lee is the best place to invest in your personal, academic, and spiritual growth."
Junior,5,"I like how welcoming Lee is, along with the great Psychology program they have. There are wonderful professors who want to help in any way they can."
Alum,4,"I personally enjoyed Lee University because of the community commitment to strong character and excellence in pursuit of academics.  Student life is rich with different sports, events, and clubs.  Most professors really care about their students and are eager to help."
Alum,4,Absolutely loved my time there! It’s heavily a PWI but as a black northerner I found some really amazing friends even though the diversity was lacking. Food was BOMB and there were new renovations to the cafe that set it off!
Sophomore,4,"Online experience at Lee is definitely different from being on campus. However, the teachers were super helpful and they made it a point to help us all pass our classes"
Senior,4,Lee University is overall a great school that offers a great education with faculty that truly care about the school and the students as well. Students that go to Lee are proud to say they go to Lee and the campus is facilities are all top notch as well.
Freshman,4,The admission office is friendly. The professors are personal and give detailed instruction. The campus is very well maintained. They are constantly updating buildings. They have several social events. There are chics on campus however and the campus is spread out. Parking is very limited also.
Freshman,4,"This campus is absolutely amazing!! The professors I have had, for the most part, have been phenomenal. My biggest gripe of the campus would be the parking, but other than that I love everything else."
Sophomore,4,"Lee University is a great liberal arts education, the small class room size and religious culture create a different community on campus. It is a small school so getting from class to class isn't that hard and the dorm life is very fun, I made some very good memories in Medlin dorm. The Cafeteria food is good for about the first month you're there and then it does get a little old and pretty bland."
Junior,4,"It has a great, diverse, and loving social environment. The professors generally do care a lot about their students, however, in my particular program it lacks an edge to provide to its students. It is not the teachers, but more so the content and the focus of what the program tries to teach. It is a liberal arts school, so teaching a wide range of knowledge is to be expected. However, for students who want a focus it is hard for them to obtain that due to the ambiguity or lack of focus that the program has. It has all the necessary facets and tools, but to me it isn't molded into a great system that it has the potential to be."
Junior,4,I'm a nursing student and while the program is tough it is an excellent program with wonderful professors who truly care about their students. Being part of a liberal arts program is enriching and a true growing experience. Of course there are things that I would like to see changed... Where in life isn't there? But overall it is an excellent school and a fantastic opportunity to be part of the Lee family.
Sophomore,4,The teachers here care greatly about your education and that you succeed in your classes. I always feel supported in my learning. The school administration needs some work because it feels like they do not care about what students need changed on campus. The requirements outside of the classroom are also very demanding and this can be difficult to balance.
Alum,4,I would like to higher priority placed on academics and the professors need to do better at making sure touring/traveling groups can get excused for claa time missed. I was pulled in too many different directions.
Junior,4,"Lee University is a great way to meet people who are like minded, but also to meet people who are different than in many ways. My experience at Lee has had its ups and downs, but through all the good and bad I have become more confident in myself and in my work. Lee helps its students build character and learn to love others better."
Senior,4,"Lee University is a beautiful school with about 5000 students on campus in Cleveland TN. The most beautiful thing about my school, is the love and concern the professors have for the students. They want their students to succeed, so they do everything in their power to help their students. I would like to see more diversity in the student population, so that everyone can feel at home in this beautiful institution."
Freshman,4,"Right now, I just finished my first year with Lee University. During the year, I managed to learn a lot about myself and what God has in store for me. Getting used to the community was a challenge but the people are very inviting. I honestly cannot wait to continue my journey for the next 3 years,"
Junior,4,"The professors at Lee really care for their students and invest in their success. There are plenty of clubs and activities to get involved in, and Lee encourages students to get involved in their community outside of the school."
Junior,4,"I wish there was more attention from the teachers for the student, it all seems to be very fast paced and there is no room for comfort."
Senior,4,"Would love a better IT program. The current one is not bad, but is not as developed as a lot of the majors offered here."
Freshman,4,"Lee University is a Christ centered campus. While you are required to go to chapel two times a week, as well as signing a community covenant about not doing drugs and alcohol and such...it is still a very free feeling campus. Students are very responsible for their learning and achievements and the professors are great and will walk along side you through spiritual and academic journeys that you will most definitely encounter in your college career. The athletic events are free and get very hyped making for a great atmosphere. Overall, Lee University is an amazing campus full of amazing people who all share community and fellowship in a place where Christ is king."
Sophomore,4,I love the community that Lee has to offer as well as the genuine passion that professors at Lee have for what they do.
Sophomore,4,"Really love the atmosphere of Lee. It is a beautiful campus, students are very nice, there are a lot of clubs you can join. The professors are always very helpful and open to helping students when they need it. Most classes are engaging and thought-provoking, though you do get a dud sometimes. I wish it were a bit more diverse and open-minded, but it is the South, so just be sure to go in with your eyes wide open. Not much of a party scene unless you specifically seek that out."
Freshman,4,"Lee University welcomed me with open arms and gave me a community of amazing people who love God and seek to love others. I have found Lee to have an amazing support system that works to provide resources and relationships to guide you through college successfully. My teachers demonstrate a desire to see us succeed and go out of their way to help the individual.  I love the feeling of the campus and the genuine friendliness and kindness of the majority of the people that attend here. One thing I would like to see changed, is the opportunity for activities on campus. There are many ways to meet people through sports and music, but not many places to go and do things with friends on campus. Even so, I have had a lot of fun here and will make more effort in the future to seek out adventures. Lee is an amazing school, and i would highly recommend it."
Niche User,4,I loved visiting the campus it was beautiful!  It had wonderful people and staff! I cannot wait to see what it has in store!
Freshman,4,the community on campus is really good. There are many ways to get involved and the people seem to be really genuine. However there isn't much to do off campus. Chattanooga is the closest city with stuff to do.  Also there are strict rules in the dorms pertaining to curfew and leaving for the weekend especially for freshmen.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and I love the teacher/student ratio. 
The communication is excellent of the students with each other with one common goal for everyone.. to SUCCEED!"
Sophomore,4,"I have had a wonderful time at Lee University. The professors are incredibly invested in their students, the campus is beautiful, and the overall environment is wonderful. I miss it greatly when away."
Junior,4,"Lee is a Private Christian University that is welcoming and accommodating for many race, genders, and religions. The campus is medium size which allows for the students to make a genuine connection with other students and faculty. It's really nice to attend a university where the professors and faculty actually care to know and help you."
Senior,4,"Lee University is a great Christian school. It is a little pricey but the professors are awesome and will help you, pray with you and lead you to where you need to be!"
Freshman,4,"The school is very small, and slow to respond to student needs. However, these are remedied pretty well by the community one finds at the school. Facilities are constantly being updated and the professors really do their best to ensure you get the most out of their classes. The school is truly conservative, but is making efforts to shift so it's more welcoming to a more diverse group of students."
Graduate Student,4,"Never thought I would return to college at the midway point of my life. I have really enjoyed the faculty and the encouraging advisement from them. The academics are challenging here in grad school, but have learned much. Just hoped there was more financial assistance for graduate students, however."
Sophomore,4,"Lee University has a beautiful campus. You can clearly see the effort that is put into its maintenance. There are also many ways you can get involved in campus life: clubs, choirs, bands, employment, etc. My only wish is that there was a more universal communication tool so all these groups could be in better communication."
Freshman,4,"Lee has strong christian values and morals. The godly atmosphere through out the campus and the people is amazing. Though, not everyone on campus is the same or has the same values, when we come together we unite as one and worship the same God."
Sophomore,4,"Lee University is a Christ centered school. You must know what you are getting into. You must respect the chapel requirements and have an open mind. I am talking to those of a more non religious folk. Professors really work with you and care for all students. Food is not as bad as its made out to be, Not the best, but fair. Lee could not be more diverse. Lee has students from literally all around the world. If you want to party, you can.  Keep your eyes and ears open and you will find those rebellious party animal Christians. However, there are more bible belt Christians open and proud of there faith. SO much to be involved in. Great school and for the most part great people."
Junior,4,"Overall, LeeU is a wel-rounded school. I love the faculty at Lee, they're friendly and they care about the students. The student life is not great in terms of things to do and on campus activities."
Sophomore,4,My time while attending has been a completely enjoyable experience.  I’ve enjoyed all my class that I’ve taken at Lee as well as having my professors who taught these classes. The thing I like most about Lee is the community factor Lee builds their foundation on. One of Lee’s goals is to get students involved with the campus either with dorm activities or different campus events in order to create a sense of community among Lee’s students.  What I would like to see change in the near future is more campus events and more unique club options for students to be apart of.
Niche User,4,Lee University was an overall pleasant college to visit. The faculty and staff were very welcoming. You could tell they all cared about what they did and how to make your future the best possible. The tour was very educational and helpful. The tour guide pointed out key details so not many questions had to be asked. The campus was beautifully kept up and I could envision myself living there. The admission counselor was full of good information and showed us many scholarship opportunities. After visiting I put Lee on the top of my list.
College Freshman,4,Everyone seems nice and friendly. the professors are friendly and always there to help
College Freshman,4,"Generally, the campus is a safe place"
College Freshman,4,I love the location Lee put me in. It's a house close to campus.
College Freshman,4,"Sports are great, but not a huge deal."
College Freshman,4,"We have many teams, but we are far from being a nationally ranked school in this area. Also, not every sport is offered, but unique sports like rugby and lacross are offered in both genders and supported generously."
College Junior,4,We have a great baseball team
College Junior,4,They have been so helpful and always so kind to answer any questions I may have.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the courses as well as the professors. The professors really care about thier students well being and progress on the class. Yes, the classes are difficult but they are worth every minute. There are variety of class styles but the main one that I have been in are lectures. The class sizes are very small. The larger lecture I had was about 120 students and I think that it a great size."
College Sophomore,4,"I think we have great security on campus. There is never a moment when campus security isn't on duty. No matter what time it is, if I feel unsafe or need a ride at night from one place on campus to another, campus security is always there ready for my call. Overall I feel very safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus. I'm in close proximity to all of my classes. The worst dorm to me would be Simmons because the rooms are so tiny. I stay in Nora chambers and I love the people and atmosphere. We have a sink in our room along with community bathroom and showers. We have a lounge with a refrigerator, microwave, and tv. It's pretty nice."
College Sophomore,4,What makes my school unique is that it is centered around Christ. Since Christ is the foundation of the school it makes the atmosphere even more conducive for learning and growing. One of my most memorable experiences was auditioning and being accepted into a music ensemble. So many doors of opportunity have been open to me because of it. If I could do it all over again I would still choose Lee University because it truly has my heart.
College Freshman,4,To get a degree from Lee is very important; especially in the Church of God. It is highly looked upon if you have graduated from Lee. The alumi is very proud to be Lee graduates.
College Freshman,4,The dorms aren't too bad here at Lee. I would say they are about average.
College Freshman,4,We have a lot of different options and opportunities for athletes at Lee.
College Senior,4,It has overall been a good experience. I wish I had been advised a little bit more.
College Junior,4,"Job and internship prospects are pretty good at Lee, even though I have not seen many employers recruiting on campus. This semester I have an archive internship this semester. This is the first semester, that I know of, that Lee has ever offered an internship program for course credit. The alumni is hugely valued at Lee. Many alumni fund many of the buildings at Lee. There are also alumni that make the school well known such as Clarke Beckham. The Center for Calling and Career on campus is a major asset to students. Every semester they offer classes, free of charge, that teach students how to optimize their resumes, how to get the best out of a job interview, and other useful things that need to be learned (but aren't necessarily taught in school). The center also offers counseling for students who wish to change their major and what types of jobs or careers are offered in respect to their major of choice."
College Junior,4,"Safety on campus is generally very good. I have only heard of a handful of incidents where someone's car has been broken into, and I have never heard of anyone being sexually assaulted. However, I do feel rather unsafe walking back to my dorm from the library late at night. I have had friends who have walked alone on their way back to their dorms late at night and have had people verbally harass them to the point of feeling unsafe at night. I walk back to my dorm with my keys between my fingers for fear of someone trying to kidnap me while I am walking at night. Campus security is on call 24 hours a day, and when it is close to midnight/1 o'clock in the morning you can see campus security cars driving around campus. It is just a little unnerving because Lee is an open campus."
College Junior,4,"I really like the campus housing at Lee University. I have lived on campus for three years. However, I wish that there was a later deadline for finding apartments for students who wish to live off campus. This year there is also an issue with an overflow of incoming students. These students are being placed in apartments on campus, which means that traditionally four person apartments are now five person apartments. The dorms themselves are close knit (especially the freshmen dorms). I am still friends with the girls I lived with in my freshman dorm."
College Junior,4,"I have fallen in love with being at Lee University. The professors are very caring. They engage and seek out interaction with their students. They take the time to make sure that students understand the material they are teaching, while at the same time presenting a challenging classroom experience to each student. My school is unique in the fact that it places a Christian, God-centered relationship at the center of everything that takes place on campus. Lee is also unique in the fact that it is a Christian liberal arts school. I have found that many people do not think that those two things can coincide. My favorite experiences at Lee are being able to have one-on-one time with the professors, and spending time in the Squires library. There is always a spot where you can be alone in the library (except during finals). If I could do it all over again, I definitely would attend Lee University again."
College Junior,4,i enjoy what i know and have seen of the school so far.
College Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and although not all dorms are suite-style, they are all really nice and none of the dorms are bad dorms to live in."
College Sophomore,4,I love Lee. I would get better Humanities professors that don't leave you out in the cold when you need help.
College Sophomore,4,I love living in Sharp-Davis. My RA and my RD as well as my chaplain are the best around.
College Sophomore,4,I rushed a sorority and got in but due to my studies I decided to pull my application so that I could focus more on my work.
College Sophomore,4,I love my college thus far. I just recently got accepted into the nursing program and I really could use financial help.
Alum,2,"Had to transfer here from another college because of family circumstances etc. I see other reviews and how people are saying its an awesome college experience and they would not have it any other way/go anywhere else. Well, as someone who as experienced college at another university let me start by saying Lee sucks. Sure, I guess its fun for someone that was sheltered their whole life and was constantly shoved with religion down their throat. If you're looking for an experience where you can finally be an ""adult"" and make your own decisions then Lee is not for you. There is literally no party scene and I feel like if you even mentioned you drink just a little bit other students would judge you, its pretty silly. Come here if you want to have the most boring college experience you can possibly have, unless playing a sport till 1am on weekends ( curfew) and singing kumbaya in a circle with a bunch of hipster homeschoolers is your idea of fun."
College Sophomore,2,I strongly dislike the Greek life at Lee. I have heard terrible stories about hoe they are treated once they are accepted. I honestly do not think highly of the people in Greek clubs.
College Junior,2,"Most of the ""Greek Clubs"" are basically service clubs. They try to act cool but they are really not."
College Freshman,2,"Cafeteria food sucks! Most of the time, they give the same food and it gets tiring after a while. Words cannot describe how bad the food is; it just sucks!"
College Freshman,2,"Everyone jokes about the cafeteria food, even the President! It is tasteless and of lower quality. My dad works with colleges around the country and this one does not offer the same quality as others."
College Freshman,2,"I do not like chain restaurants, and that is pretty much all Cleveland has to offer. Chattanooga is close and has a lot more options, but if you don't have a car or money, there's no hope."
College Freshman,2,The food choices on campus are awful. This is an area where the school could really grow. The hours are THE WORST. nothing is open late and the caf closes at 7....people do eat after 7. Especially athletes who have late practices.
College Sophomore,2,My only problem for now is the lack of scholarships that lee has to offer.
College Sophomore,2,"Variety of choices to eat on campus: Few, need more choices.

Dinning Hall: Rebuild a new dinning hall for the campus that looks like UTK's or UTC's dinning halls. It looks like a nursing home cafeteria.  

Pricing: some places are too expensive then others. 

(Example: Dunkin is extremely cheap then Einsteins but Einstein's has better quality coffee & food choices than Dunkin)

Ways to use your meal plan/flex: Make an agreement with some of the fast food restaurant (example: fazolis, checkers, wendy's, waffle house) in Cleveland to agree that students can come by and buy any meal combo with their lee card or flex. If they go over a certain amount (example: over $20 or $30 of food) the restaurant will give a small percent back to the students flex or give a small percent to the college/university."
College Senior,2,There is not really a party life here not one i know of.
College Freshman,2,"There are about 5 places to eat on campus, which all have weird hours. Dunkin is open the latest, 11pm on weeknights, and 10pm on weekends. If you don't have a car you have to make sure you have food in your room because there is no place to go later at night. The dining hall food is generally terrible."
College Freshman,2,"The greek ""clubs"" here are pretty laughable. They painfully try very hard to appear to be actual sororities and have a small community. Many of the girls are very nice and not bitchy, but there are also plenty of annoying girls. Not typically a strong ""sisterhood"" either. Initially I wanted to rush, but as the months go by I realize what a joke these clubs are and especially how poorly they are viewed by campus. Greek events are not fun, and usually weird people go to them. Some greeks party individually, but there aren't any real parties thrown. The only plus I would say to joining is that if you get into a ""top"" one like DTZ or Omega (or PKP for frats) than you have a better chance of finding parties (they are very sparse)."
College Freshman,2,"In the case of a sexual assault, there is no campus-wide text blast sent out as their would be for a storm or the presence of a shooter. This makes me vey concerned because as a female, I would want to know if their was a sexual assault and where so I could avoid that area. The town around Lee of Cleveland is ok, but I would not feel safe walking alone there and even with another person I am uneasy."
College Senior,2,"There is very little diversity racially, but there is a lot of economic diversity. Also, this is not a safe campus for feminists and the lgbt community. It's disappointing and needs to change, but probably never will. However, there is a HUGE underground gay community."
College Senior,2,"My advice is to get a car, or find someone with a car and befriend them fast. Otherwise you won't be able to get off campus."
College Senior,2,"The computer labs are plentiful but don't expect to be able to print. There is always something wrong with the printers. Also, the wifi is not always reliable in the dorms."
College Senior,2,"I did not have a good campus housing experience. While they did make an effort to make the halls a close knit community, cliques were quickly formed. Everyone is nosy and very loud. The quiet hours were not strictly enforced, neither was room check which was annoying because it meant that if you had a messy roommate or suitemate it could only get worse. The RAs all claim to care, but they play favorites. Not to mention, the rules. The rules for dorm life are intense. Guys are not allowed in the girl's dorm rooms and vice versa. No pda, not even hugging. My boyfriend leaned on me one day and an RA yelled at us. It's insane. Freshmen have a 12am curfew check on weekdays and 1am on weekends. It's a pain. Don't expect to be treated like an adult. I guess all of this can vary on what dorm you live in, but for the most part it's all very similar. Not to mention, the campus is sexist and holds the female dorms up to a higher purity standard that is not present for the male dorms."
College Senior,2,"If you have great SAT or ACT scores you can get a scholarship, but if you are a poor test taker it's difficult to get financial aid. Honestly, the Financial Aid Office is unorganized and unprofessional. I had to take out loans and at the end of my first year I found out that the Financial Aid Office had not processed my paper work correctly, so I was not getting the amount of aid I had applied for and been accepted for."
College Sophomore,2,Hate walking to class in the rain or snow. You must have a pair of rain boots and umbrella when it rains it poors and campus floods.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lee is not a very diverse school, which results in it being kind of an abnormal  place."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Don't go to Lee if you want to party. We have them, but why?"
College Junior,2,"My school is very strict.  There is no visitation in dorms, drinking is not allowed for anyone - underage or overage, drugs, sex, porn, homosexuality, anything that could be considered is immoral is not allowed.  We're not even allowed to have dance on campus that's un-choreographed."
College Junior,2,There really isn't a lot to do off campus.  Going to walmart is about it.
College Freshman,2,"It's really not that great. The caf isn't very good and it's super expensive if you don't have a meal plan. Also, the meals only cover a little over $4 for the different venues"
College Freshman,2,"It's super hard to find a place to park. If up you've got one, keep it! And campus safety is super annoying with parking tickets"
College Freshman,2,"It's the south. It's back and forth all the time. Almost no snow, rains a lot"
College Freshman,2,It floods often in Cleveland.
College Freshman,2,Its a christian school--it's going to have strict rules but many make sense. What bothers me the most that there are no visitation hours in the dorm.
College Freshman,2,The majority of the sororities and fraternities on campus are cliquey and shut other out.
College Sophomore,2,"Really strict, it just depends on how you want your college experience to go. You are required to attend chapel twice a week and once a month on sunday night. No boys in girls dorms, or visa versa, but they are allowed in the lobbies. Parking violations are enforced, but I see people get away with them all the time too. 50/50 chance of getting ticketed. I've never seen any protests or real demonstrations, but I've seen an anti-abortion booth. Most professors take attendance, but not all."
College Sophomore,2,"There's really no where in walking distance from Lee, except a coffee shop or two in downtown. Within a few miles driving distance you have the normal fast food options, plus a Hibachi Express restaurant with low costs, a few Mexican Restaurants with cheap-taco nights, Applebee's, Chili's, Longhorn Steakhouse, a few Chinese buffets. As for healthy options, there's Panera, Quizno's and Subway. Late night option's suck. I think Taco Bell is the only restaurant open past midnight. As a vegetarian, I can also say that there isn't much variety, although Mexican restaurants always have some good options."
College Senior,2,"There is no significant greek life at the school, the greek clubs usually do activities among themselves and occacionally host schoolwide events"
College Senior,2,"There is very little major nightlife a the school other than special events on campus, but the students usually find things to do to entertain themselves."
College Senior,2,"There are a few chain fast food type places where a meal plan can be applied, but the food is rarely fresh.  Bagels are often stale, Dunkin food has been uncooked before.  The food options aren't terrible, but it's definitely cheaper & healthier to not have a meal plan and to cook your own food instead."
College Senior,2,"Major meth county.  Safety at night is questionable and the areas are not well lit.  It's a very small town, so there is not much to do.  However, Chattanooga is 30 miles, Knoxville is about an hr away, and Atlanta is 2 hrs away."
College Senior,2,Small town & many places close early.  Student discounts are not very common.
College Senior,2,"When it rains, it pours.  The buildings are not well designed, so basements, low-lying buildings, and the newer buildings flood.  Lower areas on campus also flood horribly.  Wear shorts & flip flops if it's warm because you'll need to wade through 8-12"" puddles to get certain places, knee high rain boots if it's cold."
College Senior,2,"The Greeks have a superiority complex - girls are bitchy, guys are asses"
College Senior,2,"If you aren't Greek you hate Greek.  The Greek clubs are ""service clubs"" but the only impact they really have on campus is the occasional free food mixer they have once a year. The only other impact is the constant demand (harassment) for support through bake sales and other assorted fundraisers.  "
College Senior,2,"Good luck getting the lab computers to turn on and log in, also have fun figuring out how to change the toner in the printers. "
College Senior,2,"You don't really learn much as a Psychology major, there are so few requirements to meet that anyone with a quarter of a brain can pass. "
College Freshman,2,"It's not that big of a campus, therefore really doesn't need transportation."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking is terrrible and I park and walk from the church parking lot.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not enough parking spots and the ones that are available fill up quickly.
College Junior,2,"Because Cleveland TN is a small town their arent many healthy options off campus to eat other than big resteraunts. However if you are looking for some food different than the cafeteria or you want to go out with some friends, you can deifnitely find a variety of eating options off-campus for prices that please a college students budget. Most places even offer student discounts so check around!"
College Junior,2,"I am from Cleveland and attend Lee, and I feel safe on campus during the day.  However, some of the surrounding streets in downtown Cleveland are not safe to be on at night by yourself, so always have someone with you during the evenings/nights.  Also, I never see campus security anywhere except giving people parking tickets in the afternoon.  I do know how to reach them though if I were to ever need them, so that is good."
College Junior,2,"I feel very safe at Lee, but that has nothing to do with campus safety, I rarely see them out and about."
College Sophomore,2,It is a Christ Centered school and they follow the community covenant pretty strictly. Basically it's like you still have a mom and dad following you just not as bad
College Sophomore,2,"We have a lot of computer labs and nice computers. But we have TERRIBLE wifi. It's good in the computer labs, but absolutely terrible in the dorms. It almost never works right."
College Freshman,2,"Lee is upgrading to division II athletics soon, but the conference we are currently in is a joke. We destroy almost every team we play. Also, Lee is not a school centered around athletics. Instead of focusing on athletics, Lee is centered around spiritual matters."
College Freshman,2,"Not really true Greek life, more service clubs than anything else. You can't have true Greek life at a Christian school anyway."
College Senior,2,the weather is sometimes very bipolar. one day it could be rainy or cold and the next sunshiny and warm. but when it is lovely its ammazzing! i would definatly advise you to put some money into rainboots and an umbrella! youll need it.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is okay, but at Lee, no one is allowed to drink so they whole party element of the Greek life is kind of non-existant. They don't even technically recognize that they are Fraternities and Sororities, they just refer to them as ""social clubs"". They do more service work than anything."
College Sophomore,2,"The permit cost is about $40.  Freshman parking is very scattered and vague.  They give out parking tickets to anyone parked in the wrong spot.  If you have enough friends that can drive you around, having a car on campus is more of a hassle than a benefit.  The availability and convenience is not good as a freshman, you need to learn where you can park and know it well."
College Junior,2,"Unless You're a Commuter...Good Luck – Parking at Lee is quite terrible. If you are an upperclassmen you are allowed to park in your dorm parking lot, but everywhere else on campus is just for commuters pretty much. Luckily, the campus is not too big, so it is easy to walk around."
College Senior,2,Psychology Majors – Basically Psychology majors get the short end of the stick. We are not offered internships. No one helps with preparing us for grad school. You feel lost and no one points you in the right direction. You have to run down professors for help.
College Freshman,2,"The cafe is horrible but they also have Subway, Chick-fil-a, Dunkin Donuts, and Einsteins. They fit in your meal plan so no worries!"
College Junior,2,There are only a few small greek clubs. They aren't very big on campus.
College Junior,2,No Night Life – Lee University is a very conservative university. They do not allow drinking on campus or by any of its students even when off campus. The most active night life activity is probably sports.
College Senior,2,"Our girl's soccer team is beast, but I've never been to a game.  I've only been at a couple of men's basketball games at Lee and I didn't like them. We don't have much school spirit at Lee when it comes to athletics.  I think the biggest draw is the basketball games though.  I just don't like how sloppy the games are played."
Niche User,1,Being on the men's soccer team is a great health risk. The coaching staff and trainers knowingly put players back on to the field after being concussed.
College Junior,1,sports teams are great. but the fan section is not.
College Student,1,I have heard terrible stories about Greek life. They need to be looked into. Some people are having psychological and physical problems. Some of the stories are so unbelievable they knock the breath out of me.
College Senior,1,Wish they had school spirit
College Freshman,1,"I am extremely passionate in my distaste for the Lee University meal plan system. Want to eat healthy without spending any of your own money?? Too bad. Let me explain : 

The Caf: 

The cafeteria first of all has some pretty difficult hours. Every day they always serve hamburgers and mediocre pizza (unhealthy). There is a VERY limited salad bar with no options for protein. There is also a sandwich station which can be a good last resort. They also have an ""international"" station (usually burritos or some weird salad) which is usually a good option, but sometimes is awful, and a ""home style"" station that typically has some sort of chicken and MAYBE a vegetable. The rice and pasta (when available) is always overcooked and mushy. The vegetables are usually also overcooked and mushy, with little flavoring. There is rarely fresh fruit, except for a few green apples they will put out. You cannot eat healthy in the dining hall, but no need to worry -- there is always soft serve ice cream (sarcasm..). 

Everywhere else : 

The other restaurants on campus are expensive. I love Einstein's and you can usually get some relatively healthy options there, but our meal plans only cover around $4 of the meals you can buy there. That means you're using up your limited flex to buy healthier options (this concept applies at Subway as well). 

It's a struggle to eat anything GOOD or HEALTHY on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The only parties of which I am aware are the ones that my neighbors used to hold, screaming and playing music at FULL blast at 3am. I'm not exaggerating, I have video. The police ended up coming to break that one up because of the noise. I don't think those kinds of parties have a positive impact on student experience. The ones which I most remember and enjoyed were private parties for people's birthdays and stuff, not ones where people act like dunces and where strangers show up uninvited."
College Senior,1,"It plays a huge negative affect on the schools, except for the free food events that they host."
College Freshman,1,"This school is strict on pretty much everything. All freshman (or people under 30 credit hours) have a midnight curfew on weeknights and 1am on weekends. There is a campus-wide 3am curfew, although it is not as heavily enforced. No guys and girls allowed in each others dorms ever. To be honest, you could probably get away with drinking in your dorm because most people never drink so they wouldn't check, but this could vary in different dorms. On-campus apartments can have guys and girls visitation, but they have to leave at 1. The school hosts social events/ ""parties"", but they are horrible and end at 9 or 10pm, usually just freshman go. It is always difficult to find parking, and parking tickets are given for anything."
College Freshman,1,"The town of Cleveland is quiet and small. The ""downtown"" area is 10 minutes away on foot, and parts of it are very pleasant. However, it quite literally appears to be a ""ghost town"" and there are few people walking around or inside shops. There is a definite ""bad side"" of town and I have had more than one uncomfortable encounter very close to campus. If you have a car, you can drive to eat in other parts of town or go to Wal-Mart or Target. There is a sucky mall nearby as well. Chattanooga is about a 30-45 minute drive away and is nice, but gets boring after a while."
College Junior,1,Cleanliness of dorms are awful. Rules in the dorm are unrealistic and the RA's enforcing the rules are rude.
College Freshman,1,"As someone who enjoyed going to parties in high school, the party scene at Lee is basically nonexistent. Welcome week had ""parties"" thrown by Greek clubs, but they went from 7-9 and most people got bored within 20 minutes. Most people here frown upon partying and things of that nature. Most parties happen in apartments, there are never any on campus. Greek clubs are rumored to have parties with alcohol, etc., but there are no ""ragers"" of any kind, and any parties that do occur usually get busted."
College Freshman,1,"Campus safety spends most of its time writing parking tickets instead of catching car burglars, which is a frequent issue. No boys or girls allowed in each others dorms, also curfew is 12:00 on weeknights and 1:00 on weekends for freshman. There is a campus-wide 3:00 curfew and these are all very strict."
College Senior,1,The campus is very strict. You will not be treated as an adult.
College Senior,1,"People say you can always find something to do on campus at night but that's not really true unless you want to go to one of the Greek Club's boring 2 hour events. You have to go off campus and be secretive about any partying because it's against the school's ""Community Covenant."""
College Sophomore,1,parking is a main problem and they love to pass out tickets
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife. The closest club was 30 mins away and got shut down for sex trafficking
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife is little to none. Lee is situated in a little town. There's a few off the wall bars, but not much. You won't find parties on campus either because of Lee's stance on alcohol."
College Freshman,1,"The Wifi is extremely unreliable, finicky, and weak. Fortunately, however, the down periods are normally short."
College Sophomore,1,"Ugh, Cleveland, TN is not a very alive place after 6 or 7 PM unfortunately, and there aren't any clubs and very few bars (apart from Apple Bee's which is a few miles away)."
College Senior,1,"The school is very strict, but it's also easy to circumnavigate if discretion is exercised.  "
College Senior,1,"The drug scene is very easy to find, granted the University is located in a county where drugs are very prevalent.  If you want access to an illegal substance just ask around, almost everybody knows at least two dealers.  As per underage drinking, very very easy to find someone more than willing to provide.  
Both scenes are considered ""underground"" as they are both heavily frowned upon by administration to the point of denial, but very easily accessible by students. "
College Senior,1,"There is a short bus that rides around campus occasionally to drive people from one end of campus to another, but there is no set schedule and will take the longest route to get there.  Never use it before class as you will be at least ten minutes late.  "
College Senior,1,"First off: most males on campus are under 5'6"".  Second: most are performing arts majors, sorry ladies.  Third: If he is a religion major, RUN.  The guys tend to be socially awkward and have a tendency to be extremely misogynistic and will use their religion to back up their beliefs on the matter.  Finding an attractive male is difficult, finding an attractive straight male with  decent personality is not actually possible here. "
College Senior,1,No one really attends any sporting events and as a general rule the turn out for intramural sports teams is better than for varsity teams. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"The computers are out of date. There is barely enough for the students to use. The printers are need set up properly, which is EXTREMELY inconvenient."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is very limited and hard to find. You have to get to campus half an hour before class to even get a spot near the building you're going to.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone at Lee complains about the parking. They are long overdue for a new parking lot to be built, but they never do. They will build new building and food places, but no new parking."
College Freshman,1,"I despise this school. I am hoping to transfer to another university but do not have the financial means to do so. This university is full of very close minded people. Not only do the students bash gay people and atheists, but so do the professors! Attending Lee University is like going back in time to the 1940's. Most of the people here are white, snobby Christians who are racist and homophobic. It is not the place to be if you are a free thinker. They expect you to conform and conform you must."
College Freshman,1,"There is not really any transportation here. They do have a couple of shuttle buses but those are mainly for certain classes or people who are injured and cannot walk. However, the campus is relatively small so it's not too hard to walk around by yourself."
College Junior,1,"If you are an on campus student you must walk to class everyday even if your dorm is a mile away, because they do not allow you to drive to class.  If you are an off campus student you will be lucky to find a spot before you are late to class.  Parking is limited all over campus and the tickets are given out all the time."
College Junior,1,"Next to Nothing to Do – Lee University is located in Cleveland, TN. There is nothing for students to really do in Cleveland, so most students travel to Chattanooga; which is only about 25 mins away. Chattanooga is full of things to do, such as the Tennessee Aquarium, the walking bridge, and the Art Museum. Or students make their way the opposite direction to the Ocoee River or the Hiwassee River. They then can enjoy beautiful scenery, rafting, swimming, cliff diving, and hiking!"
College Senior,1,If you want to do a internship you have to do it on your own. They don't help you with anything.
College Freshman,1,"The only type of transportation is the Lee University Trolley and it only goes to places on campus. Although it doesn't cost a thing, it's not really useful."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security Is Not the Best – I feel relatively safe personally while I am going from one place to another on campus, even at night time. However, campus security could definitely be better. We were told that if we are going to leave our car here at Lee over a break we must park in designated areas. So, one of my best friends, Olivia Hall, did just that, trusting campus security's word that they would regularly patrol and watch those areas. She has a Jeep Wrangler with the soft windows. Over the break, the windows had been sliced open and everything in the car was stolen. Facing the fact that these things happen despite what campus security had said, she accepted it and went on to the campus security office to file a report and was told there was nothing they could do and a very meaningless ""sorry"". Another incident with campus security that I actually have had personally was when I got back very late one night after driving in from Nashville. Remembering at the first of the year when campus safety had told us that if we ever needed a ride or felt unsafe, especially with us being girls, they would be more than willing to give us a ride anywhere, just simply call. So, having the number saved in my phone (which they heavily insisted that we do since they are ""so reliable"") I called them around about 12:30 AM and explained that I had to park across campus and was alone and had a lot of luggage to carry which I couldn't carry on my own and would also not feel safe walking by myself struggling with the bags, etc. However, campus security's response to me was, ""Well, didn't you say you have a car? I think this isn't necessary for our assistance tonight, thank you"" and hung up. Those are just two examples out of many to where they have either been unhelpful or just rude to two Lee University students."
College Sophomore,1,Its Ridiculous – You cant dance on campus or where a hat in chapel nor listen to rap publicly
College Senior,1,"The only issues with strictness was when you're living on campus in a dorm. The curfew for freshman is to early that they can't have any experiences outside of the dorm at night for the first year. This is unless they sneak out or just don't come home. In which case they get ridiculous service hours like cleaning dishes or passing out toilet paper. Also, not allowing boys in your dorm room is crazy.  I understand they are trying to stop the temptation of having sex but that is only a small portion of people that try, the rest just want to hang out with their friends in their room and not in some dinky common room where 5 different groups of friends are trying to hang out."
College Student,1,"I went to the financial aid department for help in getting more money. I asked to speak with a counselor and told them I was having problems understanding where I needed to go for help. I was given a few fliers and told basically ""Good Luck, you're on your own."""
College Senior,1,"Extremely Strict – Lee has been working hard to become more lenient, but I have to say, it is still quite lacking. Dorm curfew for freshman is 12 during the week, 1 on the weekends. Members of the opposite sex are not allowed in dorms anywhere except the designated ""meeting areas"", and even the on campus apartments have very limited meeting hours. Some teachers are extremely picky on attire, i.e. not allowing students to wear shorts or hats. Attendance of chapel is completely acquired, with only a few excused absences. However, if you're not willing to adhere to these rules, I would recommend not applying and signing the form that you will in the first place. It definitely makes for a clean party-free campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"""Greek Clubs."" Not Fraternities/Sororities – First of all, the university doesn't officially allow fraternities or sororities. However, the ""Greek clubs"" are a dominant feature at Lee. If you are in them, you love them. If you are not, you hate them. Professors hate them because most students' GPA's drop significantly after they join, and the students devote more energy to their clubs than their academics. They can be a lasting source of friendship, but friendships can be made at Lee regardless of whether or not a person was in a Greek club or not."
College Sophomore,1,"Community Covenant – Lee is VERY strict. When you come to Lee you must sign a community covenant which basically says no drinking ever, no tobacco, no drugs, no sexual activity whatsoever, etc etc. If you get caught with anything they deem inappropriate, you will get called before the dean and most likely get expelled. There is a curfew for everyone below 30 hours and also members of the opposite sex are not allowed past the lobbies of the dorms."

Junior,5,"They offer a wide selection of online courses that are structured very well. You get what you pay for, however they still are a great option. They offer a good amount of winter and summer courses online which are perfect for earning credits in a short 5-6 week period."
Sophomore,5,I transferred in to Fitchburg States nursing program which is very difficult to do and all my professors and the staff were extremely helpful throughout the whole process. They always seemed to have my best interests in mind and I ended up really enjoying the courses I took and made great connections with my peers and professors.
Sophomore,5,"I initially started off with one online class, it went very well and although the professor seemed a bit hard on her students she gave them every opportunity to do a great job in her course. When the pandemic hit, all my classes went online and I can imagine how hard it was for professors who usually teach in person, but they made great adjustments and where always there to help with the curriculum."
Alum,5,"This is a great University with an awesome campus. I was a commuter so I don't know much about the dorms or on campus activities but the campus is beautiful and I always enjoyed going there for classes. The parking isn't great- but that goes for every school I think. Don't park illegally because they WILL give you a ticket.

I majored in Criminal Justice, and was so lucky to have been able to learn from the professors in the Criminal Justice and Psychology programs. The professors mostly all have backgrounds in the field, and they shared their personal knowledge and experience which was so beneficial. 

The advisors (specifically Dr. Weiss) go above and beyond to help you pick classes that work with your lifestyle and job. They also help you explore the work force by finding you internships, giving you network connections, and being great references. They are so smart and experienced, and really want to see you succeeded and find a job you love."
Alum,5,"The online classes I took were great. I prefer learning in person, but did take a handful of online classes to fit it into my schedule. It also stinks that they charge an extra $150 for each online class."
Sophomore,5,"Not only is this campus by far one of the best I've seen but the staff are superb as they stay attune to each students needs. Alumni push students to be their best selves in education, work, and life. Incredible experience to attend this college."
Freshman,5,At FSU there are so many options. They have just about anything for anyone! The financial aid office is very helpful! Just make sure you study and work hard!
Alum,5,Great for the MBA program.  I got my Bachelor's at UMass Amherst and considered going there for my MBA but it was a bit too expensive.  Fitchburg was literally half the price and the program was very good.
Niche User,5,"I was given a detailed Campus Tour. I was able to see the rooms, which were very spacious. WE were given a brief assembly at the beginning. Parents and students were given information about loans, scholarships, and a typical day and life of a Fitchburg State student."
Freshman,5,It's a wonderful college! the professers care deeply about the students and how they are performing in their class. the campus itself is a beautiful setting and very cozy!
Niche User,5,"When you first step foot into Fitchubug State, you feel welcomed. they are the nicest people and they always are trying to help you succeed in any way possible."
Sophomore,5,I love Fitchburg State University. I love the professors and how they are dedicate To their students and also the diversity is great.
Junior,5,I attend Fitchburg State for the Game Design major. I enjoy the college experience at FSU. The campus is full of exciting things to do and see. Even though I do not dorm I am still getting the best college experience. The professors are top notch.
Sophomore,5,"I love Fitchburg State! All the faculty is so helpful, from Professors, Deans, dining hall employees, and janitors. One thing I would like to see change is more recycling bins. There is barely any opportunities for me to recycle and I hate throwing away plastic."
Sophomore,5,"It is a smaller university, but holds opportunity for all that enter it's campus.  It has an involved community and compelling academic environment that encourages the students to go beyond expectations."
Sophomore,5,I liked how when I was transferring during the second semester they made the process very easy and simple. I felt like I didn’t have to do much and they took it over.
Sophomore,5,"I love Fitchburg State University. The campus is the prefect size, everything is so close together and the community is extremely close knit truly enabling it to feel like a home away from home. The clubs on campus work hard to plan events and programming that will engage the community, and they often succeed thus creating a fun, yet safe, environment for all students. I am so glad that I settled on Fitchburg State because it is by far the best place ever!"
Sophomore,5,Being at student at Fitchburg State University has helped me understand myself not only as a student but at a person in society as well. The professors take the time it make sure you understand the material and guide you with tips on how to be a successful student and person in life. I feel that I have learned a lot about my major in the short time that I have attended the school. There are always events going on around campus and SGA always makes sure that student become more involved in the community off and on campus. As I am entering my third year at Fitchburg State I have been instilled with confidence and perserverance and I am able to tackle any obstacle that I encounter on my path. I am proud to be a Falcon in my home town.
Niche User,5,"It was amazing there. I only went for an open house, but I really enjoyed myself while i was there. Everyone there was so nice and welcoming. Making me want to go the school even more."
Niche User,5,I can’t wait to start in the fall! Go Falcons!! My tour was amazing with the best guide ever. I am so excited to start my nursing future with Fitchburg. I am also trying out for Softball.
Niche User,5,"I loved how comfortable I felt the second I toured the school. Everyone was so nice and welcoming! As I toured I felt like I was already at home, already putting together the pieces to where everything was. To make everything better, I knew one of professors so I had the amazing opportunity to see one of the classrooms. With such an amazing student-teacher ratio and amazing professors, I could see myself in one of their classrooms. While on the tour, I was able to eat at the dining hall which was also very clean and had good food! It was a plus that they had an ice cream machine. The dorms were also an spectacular space because there was a common area where you could mingle with other dormers. Being close to where I grew up, I could really see myself at Fitchburg State."
Junior,5,"I knew this was the school for me as soon as I stepped foot on campus! This campus is so welcoming and there are so many resources to use. Professors here care and do not want you to fail. It is a small school, so you connect better with professors, friends, and other college help."
Freshman,5,Fitchburg is an amazing college that is small in size.  If you are from a small high school and don't want to move to a large college Fitchburg State is perfect for you!
Sophomore,5,The education is great! The classroom ratio with students and teachers is a great learning envroinment not too overwhelming. the university has a great evroniment and friendly students as well as the staff.
Sophomore,5,"Great school. Lots of diversity. Very LGBT friendly. Great selection of clubs/organizations. There's always something to do during weekdays, however, there isn't much on weekends since many people go home. Absolutely love this school though."
Junior,5,"I love the small campus at Fitchburg State University, and I enjoy having a tighter knit community to be able to be closer connected with professors."
Graduate Student,5,"I am getting a masters and it is a great school. It's cheap, but it still offers so many opportunities. The professors are great and the staff is friendly."
Niche User,5,"the kind, positive, ''family like'',  warming feeling i get when i walk on campus is my favorite. I enjoy the helpful/caring staff and faculty . they fully want you to succeed and allow you to see all the tools that will most definitely help you. the food is also terrific and is a buffet style which is awesome!"
Senior,5,Fitchburg State University is truly a home away from home. People on campus are so friendly and make you feel welcome. Professors and staff are there to help. Each student is driven to be the best that they can be. It's the best environment I've ever been in for a campus.
Sophomore,5,The school is small which is a good fit for me as I come from a small town. Students are very friendly. Quiet &  clean campus
Junior,5,"My time at Fitchburg State has been great. This school has excellent faculty, and an astounding community that takes pride in being a falcon. Extracurriculars are great, there's a wide variety and something for everyone. Building hours such as the library and dining halls could be improved, and the quality and quantity of food services could be increased, but other than that, Fitchburg State is wonderful."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the professors here. The courses are interesting and diverse. I've have one bad professor, but I ask friends before signing up for courses now so that won't happen again. The social scene is amazing here. There are so many clubs and it's easy to join. Greek life is probably the best choice I've made and I definitely recommend it. The parties  are awesome and easy to find Thursday through Saturday. Overall, I love this school and I'm happy I chose this place."
College Junior,5,"Although the campus isn't placed in the best neighborhood, I still feel extremely safe walking around because the campus security is always available and there are assistance poles located all around the campus if you need security to go get you if your don't feel safe."
College Junior,5,"Classes are interesting, professors have difficulty staying on topic yet always friendly.  Classes are usually small.  Professors are all from different backgrounds which keeps things interesting from each class."
College Sophomore,5,"I myself am a little biased because I chose greek life as an incoming freshman. I chose Sigma Tau Gamma National Fraternity in the fall of 2014, my freshman year, and I love it. It gave me not only close friends and skills to communicate but also connections with alumni that I would have never dreamed of."
College Freshman,5,Lots of parties all weekend. I think it makes the experience that much better.
College Freshman,5,"Tons of parties Thursdays through Saturdays. Some of them are pretty packed, but if you play sports or join Greek life you'll definitely know someone throwing one. There's also a ton a bars to go to if you're 21+."
College Freshman,5,"The areas not so great, but the campus is amazing. They have plenty of police around and you can call them up to get a ride any time."
College Freshman,5,Very diverse and accepting campus. It's actually refreshing to see.
College Freshman,5,"Tons of majors to choose from. Professors are great for the most part, but I'd definitely check rate my professor."
College Freshman,5,Courses are challenging but are easy to do well in with a little bit of hard work. Lots of resources to help you out.
College Freshman,5,Great internship opportunities. This school definitely has connections.
College Freshman,5,Amazing campus with grat people
College Sophomore,5,"My college experience so far has been great.  I have met SO many friends.  I have way more friends than I did in High School.  I love how this school is affordable and I am blessed I picked Fitchburg State University.  If I were to do it all over, I would have picked Human Services to begin with and not picked the Biology major."
College Sophomore,5,I love the school I am at. It has a great campus and I made great friends there.
College Freshman,5,I love the local restaurants around FSU they are great.
College Freshman,5,I love being on campus and having a sense of independence away from home
College Sophomore,5,Prefer over dining hall food
College Sophomore,5,"A lot of majors, minors, and concentrations avail"
College Sophomore,5,One of the best teaching schools in the state
College Junior,5,Some professors are better than others so its hard to say. The registration process can be a drag sometimes cause you may not always get the classes you need which puts you behind.  The workload can be fairly easy depending on what classes you are taking. Popular studying areas are the library or the falcon hub.
College Junior,5,"There is a shuttle system which is pretty reliable. All of the campus buildings are within 10mins walking distance, but the shuttle is nice on bad weather days. It also goes to the MART station, where students can ride the MART bus line for free or take the T in to Boston (not free). You can live here without a car, but most students have one to go home or work. Parking on campus is terrible, although there are plenty of spots they are not close to the campus at all. Even if you pay to park close, faculty take many of the pay student spaces leaving only the civic center or Mckay."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love my major! Not only is it fun but the teachers are amazing.
College Junior,5,"I originally went to Fitchburg state for nursing, however I switched my sophomore year to exercise science. I would love to continue on to grad school for physical therapy. The teachers of the department are so great and they are always there to help. The chairperson of the department was extremely helpful on making me feel welcome in the major and help me understand what I truly want to do in life. he helped show me I will get as much as I give into this program. I can't just show up to get a diploma I need to work at what I want. All students who want to apply should try to have an idea of what they want out of college, I wasn't sure with my program but I know I loved science. My advise is to make sure you are on top of your stuff and to apply for scholarships!!"
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of different options, and there is a diverse selection to choose from."
College Freshman,5,"Fitchburg state is the best state school in Massachusetts and has the best communications program, possibly in the country and I am proud to be a part of it."
College Freshman,5,"I am a member of Greek life. I am a sister of Sigma Sigma Sigma. I think Greek life at FSU does a great job of breaking the stereotypes of Greeks and influencing our campus and community for the better. As with anything, their are people who are indifferent, who dislike, and who like Greek life. There is currently no Greek housing available but you are welcome to room with sisters or brothers in the available housing."
College Freshman,5,"People from all different walks of life come to this school and we're all equally accepted and treated alike.  Because the school is so diverse, even the students seem to be pretty acceptable of one another."
College Junior,5,"My undergraduate degree is in Psychology and Communication Disorders and so I decided I wanted to get my Masters Degree as a  Mental Health Counselor. Fitchburg State University is accredited for the preparation required toward Licensure. Many of the professors that teach each subject have had first hand experience in what they teach. For example, Research and Development is taught by a professor currently in the field of Research, Ethics is taught by a professor on the Licensing Board, etc. I have been very pleased with my graduate work thus far. I am not sure of my immediate career goals, however, I eventually hope to be in private practice combining my spiritual training with my current mental health training."
College Junior,5,Everyone that I have come to know in my classes have been very supportive. They all really care about each other. Everyone puts most of the pressure to succeed on themselves and everyone works extremely hard. I am very grateful to be with such a wonderful group of students. I know they will make amazing counselors.
Junior,4,"Fitchburg State offers a variety of affordable, well-taught courses. They have a wide selection of majors to chose from. The majors I chose both were very informative and class sizes were fairly small. It is mostly a commuting type of college, yet the campus is large enough to include nice accommodations for students. Its an above average college experience with a small school price."
Freshman,4,"The university was small but very interactive. It was in the town of Fitchburg and Fitchburg is known to be very sketchy. Most times, students cant even leave the campus if they do not have cars, which makes them stay on campus. Not to mention that the only parking lot for freshmen are all the way down town about a seven to ten minute walk. With that, it's not even worth to bring your car. I also was a out of state student and I had troubles trying to gain the knowledge about how the state works. Especially cause the teaching curriculum is different in this state than my home state. Otherwise, I had fun and was great meeting new people and sharing new experiences. A very good start at dorm life as a freshman. The freshman dorm building is very open and friendly and is a great place to hang out with others and to have events and gaming area. A good study area as well."
Sophomore,4,I have transferred to Fitchburg State University starting this fall 2020. Although due to the covid-19 lots of things have changed where I cannot directly view in person how the campus is like. But so far their admission has given me a warm welcome. Guiding me to be prepared with the admission process smoothly. It has been providing me with lots of help and their services. There is always a faculty representative to help me out with any questions I need. Their school website and other social media have provided many insights on how the students personally like Fitchburg state and also help us as new students with any question we have too. I cannot wait to start in fall 2020!
Sophomore,4,"Fitchburg State University has decent academics, it's a great environment full of diversity. I have met many friends her, there are a lot of activities and clubs to join in on campus. There are many ways to stay involved. There is usually always something to do which I love. Overall, it is a welcoming school with positive energy throughout."
Freshman,4,"Has a wide variety of majors, sure to be something you like. The Nursing department in particular I've heard is very good. The cafeteria is just fine."
Sophomore,4,"Fitchburg State makes me feel welcome and involved. There are plenty of diverse groups to join, fun activities to engage in,  and classes upon classes to explore what's really right for you. I wish it was easier to get in touch with people during busy times, such as applying for classes to be able to completely explore all that is possible."
Junior,4,"I love the nature aspect and the professors there. They are all willing to help you out in whichever way you need and they are very accommodating when it comes to students with disabilities. The only down side is the student environment. Alot of the students there are not the most social or the kindest, only a select few and rare to find."
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming school, faculty and staff are very accepting and treat you with respect. The dorm are generally nice, with the halls and facilities looking new and the dorm rooms themselves being average. I've found the dining hall to be subpar depending on the day, they do have good tacos and a salad bar, so that is a plus."
Freshman,4,"So far I’ve had an amazing experience, although I do not live there.  honestly I’m totally okay with it because their dorms and dorm bathrooms are nasty and their food is not that great either but I will say they have their days where the food is really good.  I personally love all of my professors this semester and most of them are very nice and understanding.  The campus has come so far and I think the university is beautiful.   They offer so many great clubs and opportunities to help you like FREE tutoring (cost is basically included in your bill) they are also so cheap (depending)  but you can get an amazing education there as well.   In the end I am beyond happy to be attending Fitchburg state for nursing because they have an amazing program and it’s just close to where I live and it’s affordable."
Graduate Student,4,"Fitchburg State University offers many programs. It is very affordable and the faculty and staff are easy to work with and care. The courses are hit or miss; some are rather complex and you will get something out of it. Some are ""easy As""."
Senior,4,"I like the programs that Fitchburg University offers and also its costs. The school always has events and activities to keep students involved and social. I also like the fact the school has many resources.However, what I would like to see changed at the university is  the access and knowledge about certain resources offered at the school being more open and public. I would also like to see  more professors in departments who lack the amount that is needed. I would also like to see a change in how classes are being scheduled. I feel that students should not have to wait until next semester to get the class that they are required to take. There should always be at least one class of everything. I would also like to change the cancelation of classes. The last thing I would change is the food. I feel that the food needs to be more culturally diverse and include more varieties."
Senior,4,"The students and professors are very personable. The class sizes are smaller so you always have opportunities to have one on one time with your professors. The professors also really care about their students and want to see them succeed. The campus is very diverse and accepting of everyone. Parts of campus are under some construction which is much needed, but everything is well kept for the most part."
Freshman,4,What I like about Fitchburg State is that the professors are authentic. They make you feel engaged in the classroom and more passionate. They’re understanding and actually seem to care for their students.
Junior,4,The school and professors are great. The resources on campus are amazing. You really do get your moneys worth. That being said the food is terrible and never fails to upset my stomach! It’s too expensive for what is offered. There is never anything new and it has no flavor. Financial aid office always loses paperwork and that makes it difficult for us to get our money on time. Other than that the school is excellent and some classes although challenging are very interesting.
Senior,4,I like attending fitchburg state because it is a relatively small school with means you get to know everyone better and you feel more welcomed when it’s like this
Graduate Student,4,"I am in the accelerated online MBA program at FSU. 
Pros: Get your degree, this is a means to an end. 
Cons: professors are less interested/focused on their students. It seems as though they don't care about their students as much and treat them with less respect that if they were to teach in person. Not the best experience. It seem professors treat students as though they are less intelligent than they are, perhaps because they do not meet in person."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the small community of people who are willing to help you with anything and everything:)
Sophomore,4,"My experience at FSU has been a rocky road but I've gotten through it and will continue to. Majority of the professors I have had were very helpful when it came to understanding the work, criteria, and curriculum. The activities and events were planned well and were great, especially for those who were new. The workers on campus, including tour guides, orientation leaders, office employees, etc were helpful as well."
Graduate Student,4,"Fitchburg is great academically, however, the area is really rough. I'd like to see the area surrounding the school be cleaned up. This is slowly happening, but it will take some time before FSU totally transforms that area....although it's well on its way."
Junior,4,The campus is very nice. Everything is centrally located. The school is located in a tough area. I am getting a great education.
Freshman,4,"I really like the small community here, I feel like I always see a familiar face. The professors are very professional and unbiased. The main thing I would change about this school is the dining hall hours are very inconvenient."
Sophomore,4,"The smaller Massachusetts State University has allowed me to flourish as a student thanks to help from tutors and teachers that are easily accessible.  I also like that I am noticed in class. At big schools, it's easy to get intimidated by the numerous students in a lecture hall."
Freshman,4,"I play basketball and live on campus. I love the campus and living there is so much fun. The education level is difficult, but very good and I have already learned so much."
Senior,4,"I liked the academics, some professors are better than others. It is easily to get involved and there are many options. Dining hall can be improved."
Junior,4,As a transfer student Fitchburg gives many opportunities to catch up on my classes and offers a variety of online classes too which are perfect for me as a commuter.
Junior,4,I like how everyone is always willing to help. It is a good learning environment. There are a lot of resources that can be helpful during college and also preparing for the future. I would like to see that they have more clubs and activities on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love the quality of the academics for the price, I wish the school would invest more in what the students want and pay more attention to them by giving them things to do, more activities and places for students to go to"
Freshman,4,"The school is great, it has a lot of great resources to help you depending on which career path you choose to take. The  professors i have had so far are amazing, they really help and make sure you understand what goes on. There is so much diversity on campus and I just love it, you would definitely a group of friends to talk to or at lest hang around with. There's so many clubs and 
 great opportunities on campus so make good use of it while you can."
Senior,4,"Fitchburg State University has the perfect smaller ""high school""vibe, where you can walk down the street and know everyone you pass, but also are exposed to so many different cultures. The classes are amazing and you really get the same education as a more expensive institution, but in budget."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy this school and living on campus, everything is close by and is not hectic while trying to reach classes."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of the college. I come from a small town and I am very comfortable here. The students are very friendly.
Junior,4,What I like most about Fitchburg is the diversity of the student body. It's important to get out there and get involved as much as possible and meet new people. I am in the ROTC program at Fitchburg so it has led me to meet all new people and professors and given me the best experiences so far.
Graduate Student,4,"Great University. Online classes are well organized, I learned a lot so far. Only thing I have to complain about is that they recently raised the tuition fee."
Junior,4,Overall it is a really nice campus and so far most of the teachers I have had are very passionate about their work and helpful to their students. Other than the freshman dorms most of the residence halls are actually quite nice. one thing I'd really like to see change however is the food most of the time it's either a hit or a miss and the hours on the weekends for the dining hall are really inconvienent.
Niche User,4,"My first time being at Fitchburg state was for a party but being there i seen how beautiful the campus was , i got a good look at Fitchburgs  library the tall glass windows and the whole room filled with books and the handful of people on the computers doing research. It made me feel like i wanted to go to college and be one of those people to turn down a night of partying to finish up homework in the library because my dorm is just ""to quiet"", i also got to witness how everyone interacted with eachother,  it was legit all love and support, the party was a ""rep your flag"" event where we all bring a flag from where ever we came from and we represent it for the night and i think that made Fitchburg stand out to me because it helped to open my eyes and see the diversity in the school. The thought that we all come from different paths of life and we all made it here to celebrate"
Freshman,4,I loved all the friends I made  my first year of college. It was perfect only the dining hall food has to be better.
Freshman,4,My experience at Fitchburg State has really opened my eyes to the world and all the different things there are to offer and all of the different people I can meet. College has made me more mature and responsible and I feel like I have become more of a man since I came here.
Freshman,4,"Fitchburg State is a great and affordable school. They are constantly trying to improve, and have even just purchased a huge theatre in the heart of Fitchburg. The campus is small and easily navigated. The professors really care about their students and their profession. There's many programs and clubs on campus, so there's always something going on."
Sophomore,4,"Fitchburg State University is an interesting place to say the least. For those looking for degrees in Nursing, Education or Film Production, then I highly encourage you to attend. All three of these programs are incredibly strong and lead to internships in the field after you graduate. Other programs are also well worth it to attend here, but those three majors are stronger than many colleges that charge four times the price."
Junior,4,It's a great school with a really good internship and Graphic Deisgn program. After being there for a few years I realized the faculty isn't 100% the best. Sometimes the professors play favorites and the people working in the offices have no idea what they're doing so you have to be a little bit independent if you want to get by there.
Freshman,4,"Fitchburg State University has beautiful campus. I would like it more if there were better dining. The campus has it's own police force. All of the officers I have met thus far have been very friendly. I'd say it's pretty safe on campus, but it's not recommended to really walk outside of campus at night. Overall, it's been a great experience for me so far."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is very nice, and it had many activities to keep you busy. Each week there are all sorts of activities for the students to enjoy.  The only thing that I believe should be changes is some of the dining hall policies.  They do not have times that are convenient for most students, and it is very difficult for most of us to make it in the time that they do have it open.  Other than some of the dining hall issues, there is nothing wrong with the campus itself.  The students are all very welcoming, and there is not a dull moment while you live here."
Sophomore,4,"Fitchburg state is a very diverse school, with a relatively small campus, which I enjoy a lot. The campus is very pretty during the fall, and all your furthest class can only be a maximum of 10 minutes from your dorm building. Overall a very good school. "
College Junior,4,I feel very safe and secure when I am on campus. Campus crime is very low and I feel that my personal safety is never is danger. The campus police as well the city police are both very active and do a great job of securing the students and campus.
College Junior,4,Living on campus has been an absolute great experience. I love living on campus because the environment is amazing. The facilities are great and the social life is even better. I love every thing about the dorms and the peers that i lived with helped make the experience an even greater one.
College Junior,4,The athletics at my school is great. Students attend each and every home game regardless of what sport it is and we all support each team equally and passionately. The  majority of the teams perform well and are contenders our conference each year. The games are always full when it comes to attendance because our school's team spirit is excellent.
College Junior,4,"The athletics at my school are great when it comes to the teams that are doing the best at the time, but other than that students won't really go to support the school at games if they don't have the best winning streak. Personally I love the recreation center at my school because it has all the basics to workout and a variety of weight machines to use. We also have access to the track, and basketball court. There is also a separate room where you could dance, stretch, do some weighted exercises or yoga."
College Junior,4,"Although I have only attended my school for a semester so far, I still love it. All of the students and faculty there are extremely nice and always trying to help out. We have a lot of fun activities always going on around campus. For me, this is the perfect school because the campus is small which makes it easier to have more time to work with the professors one-on-one in class."
College Junior,4,"I definitely think that if you put your all into what degree you're pursuing,you'll go far in the working world."
College Junior,4,Overall the courses I've taken for my major have provided me with a plethora of information and I'm very happy about that.
College Junior,4,The equipment for excercise and sports activities are in really good shape and used by athletes and non-athletes
College Junior,4,I love the community at school and the size of the campus.
College Junior,4,"As an English Major courses offered seems limited and difficult to find something suited for my field.  Art classes are also highly limited and difficult to enter.  Lottery for class selection seems strange and hard for students to get classes need for their majors and that fit their schedule.  Professors also set strange class times.  Class sizes are small which allow for individual student attention, and professors are diverse.  Students do learn something from every course although it might not be what the student expected."
College Senior,4,"Campus Police are always there when you need them. The campus is very well guarded because the police station is on campus. Depending on the time you may even see police on bikes patrolling the campus, and there are plenty of safety spots in which you can press an emergency button if you are being attacked or followed."
College Sophomore,4,I love that class sizes are small and each professor can work with you if you need it individually.
College Sophomore,4,The value of a degree from this school will be great for someone like me who wants to continue on to graduate school and finally find job oppurtunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel generally safe on campus. Since I am a commuter, most of the time I am just going from one building to my car and back so it is not an issue walking alone."
College Sophomore,4,"Even if you don't attend many sporting events, there is always a way to find out how the sports teams are doing. School spirit is shown all through out campus with the Fitchburg State gear everyone wears! This shows that we support our school and all fans for sporting events rock out in the school colors."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very engaged with their students and very passionate about their jobs. They show this passion during class and it helps to motivate the students.
College Sophomore,4,"My university is academically great. The professors really care about their students' success and they work hard to help them with whatever they need. Also, students are hardworking and even work together in order to succeed. If I had to choose my school all over again I definitely would."
Junior,2,"The dorms are a mess. There is very little diversity, so as a person of color you feel left out and uncomfortable. It isn't the most challenging. You can still pass with doing minimal work."
Freshman,2,"The hygiene at Russell Towers is a joke. There would be hair in the shower stalls and the bathtubs have dirt in them. People leave their personal dishes in the sinks and the faucets would be dirty sometimes; some people don't even flush the toilets after they use them. The kitchen in Russell Towers would be sometimes from the other students leaving scraps and trash in there; the vending machines sometimes don't work in Russell. The B elevator in Russell is broken sometimes. The wifi at Fitchburg State breaks down 70% of the time. The food at the dining hall is okay overall. My favorite food there is the breakfast stuff really. What I don't like about the dining hall is the fact that the pizza is burnt most of the time, depending who cooks. During warm or hot weather there would be flies flying around the desserts and even at the tables. We also can't food out, which is stupid."
Freshman,2,"I would not recommend Fitchburg at all. For one, it is a suitcase campus so everyone goes home on the weekends, so forget about having fun then. The parties are okay but even then the majority of them are Greek Life only. Academics are just okay. Dining sucks and their hours are awful especially on the weekends. As for dorms, Herlihy and Russell are where you will most likely end up as freshmen, and it is awful. So noisy despite quiet hours; I cannot count the times it has been 2am and someone has been screaming down the hall and no one does anything. Toilets are usually broken, there are pee stains and weeks' worth of hair in the shower, and the stalls have pads or tampons (sometimes wrappers, sometimes used pads and tampons) for the girls' bathroom and poop with pee stains in the guys'. The area around it is boring even if you have a car. I would not advise you to walk off campus (whether you are a male or female). The professors are the only good part of this school."
Recent Alumnus,2,the parties get out of control and the public has too much access to being on campus allowing students not to be safe
Recent Alumnus,2,Fitchburg is not a safe city to even want to be in a fraternity or soroity.
College Sophomore,2,"The classes are fine, don't go here unless you know what you want to do for a career and are sure they have what you need. Staff is difficult to deal with at times. Most professors I've had are great."
College Sophomore,2,"I received a Pell grant for the 2014-2015 academic year for over $2,000 dollars that i used for this years tuition, financial aid just recently called me months later to inform me that there was a mistake and are now taking the Pell grant away. I am paying for college on my own, however since I live with my father i recieve little financial aid besides governement loans since they took away the Pell grant. It also took them months to get me my award letter last year."
College Sophomore,2,"Fitchburg is kind of a dumpy town, but coming up with the renovations and improvements of the school campus and such, but off campus, the town itself is a little sketchy."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Commuter Cafe is pretty great-especially the Subway-but the Dining Hall isn't that great.  It doesn't have a good reputation among the student body, but it's one of our only eating options so we're stuck with it."
College Junior,2,make sure you make the deadlines!
College Freshman,2,"too much work just to go to school, the whole entire system is backwards and i hate it."
College Freshman,2,there are not a lot of places to park for a commuter school.
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do in the city of Fitchburg itself.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The financial process is a very rigorous process that seems to be troublesome every year, but i seem to find a way to get financial aid. My goal is to receive a scholarship for graduate school."
College Sophomore,2,The sports teams are bad.
College Junior,2,"Snowy and raining days do make it easy when having to walk from building to building, especially from McKay to the Rec center."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They could do a lot more to insure that busses arrive in a timely manner, particuarly in areas that are dangerous to walk."
College Sophomore,2,There are 3 sororities and 2 fraternities. None of them have an off campus houses. They are low-key and mainly do philanthropy events. Most Greeks are social to non-Greeks in social events.
College Freshman,2,Bad snow storms hit the campus hard because of bad parking arrangements.
College Senior,2,"Depends on the Sport – As a very small school we have a limited pool of athletes. Our facilities are very modern with a brand new rec center and football field, however the gym is a disaster it's only a couple years old but is way to small to cater to teams and students. Hockey is the sport to play here, they are really good and have the biggest following of fans. Football is the exact opposite (don't tell the players though, I think they're under the impression they play ivy league)."
Freshman,1,"Do not come here. I am so heartbroken that I chose this school. I plan to switch out as soon as I can. You are not really guided, you are just put into things and you have to navigate your way around all by yourself. It’s just a mess. And things are so overpriced for no reason!! The online courses are also a mess, it’s hard to understand where to go at first. I had to look for someone to help me and let them know I had no advisor because they forgot to give me one ."
Freshman,1,Online is a mess. So bad at starting you up. It’s really confusing because no one ever taught me how to use blackboard.
Sophomore,1,Having to come home so soon due to COVID 19 I had to switch to remote learning. Most of my professors were not at all reachable for assistance causing me to perform poorly compared to what I know I am capable of achieving. This also resulted in me withdrawing from a class.
Niche User,1,It is unfortunate the be an over 50 year old woman and want to further my education at a college that is only 30 minutes away.  They do not hesitate in taking your $50.00 no refundable application fee and then deny your acceptance.  It is quite humorous to know that I make more than the admissions department that denied me acceptance.  Don’t waste your money if you are over 50.
Freshman,1,"Coming here has been the worst mistake of my life. The people here are rude, the professors don’t care about you and  the food is terrible. Living in Russell towers is literal hell, the bathrooms are nasty, the people don’t shut up and are always banging and yelling at all hours of the night. This place has made me so depressed and I'm very excited to transfer out of here next semester. I can not stress this enough to people don’t come here"
Freshman,1,"Worst month of my life this school is terrible, the professors don’t care about you, res life is ridiculous between the dumb rules to the people down the hall blasting music at all hours of the night and screaming like they are in kindergarten. The food here is terrible and never fails to make you sick I stopped going to the dining hall because it made me so ill. The people here don’t care about your well being and overall this school has caused me nothing but sadness and pain since I started in the fall. Can’t wait to transfer at the end of the senmester and never come back. Seniors, when your deciding on what school to go to don’t go to FSU"
Freshman,1,Do yourself a favor and don’t come to Fitchburg state. The classes aren’t bad but the food is terrible and never fails to make you feel sick. Res life is terrible for someone who doesn’t party and is here to try and get an education it’s annoying that music plays all night long and people screaming in the halls like they are second graders. I’ve been here for two weeks and it’s been the worst two weeks of my life. I can’t wait to transfer at the end of the semester and never come back to this god awful school.
Alum,1,"This university looks amazing on tours, and the tour guides pull you in with lies.
The advisors dont care about the students
the faculty and staff dont take action when needed
illegal activity is turned a blind eye."
College Senior,1,"This will be my first and last semester here. I have had a lot of issues since even before I was able to register for classes. I kept thinking, ""it will get better"". I was wrong.

Transfer:

I am a transfer in from another college, and I had my transcript mailed in from the previous college. I transferred as a CIS major to a CIS major and only 40% of my credits transferred, even though the coursework I took at my previous college was either on par, or superseded what was given here. I was not allowed to meet with an adviser who specialized in my Career field until after courses started, and wasted $3000 on cash. The courses were super easy (because I did them already in my previous college).

Advising:

After attempting to speak with an adviser, I was granted a small window of opportunity to talk to him, however, as a commuter I would have to scheduled my whole day for it, and that would mean I would lose an work day. I eventually spoke with the dean, and they pulled me out of my classes and put me into something more suited to my skill level.

Classes:

I was taking a basic Math Class (1300), and I was not able to get the book because the book store was out. I needed to wait for money to purchase it, and the software required for the class. I purchased it 4 weeks late, and after seeing the course scheduled for that class. Which, involved a huge assignment due EVERYDAY. It appears this class in particular is suited for someone without a family to tend to or a full time job. I was not able to make up the missed grades, and decided to withdrawal to prevent a GPA loss.

Withdrawal:

You need a form signed by the professor to withdrawal from the class. After obtaining the form, and getting it signed, I went to the registrars office with withdrawal. NOPE. I am not allowed to withdrawal because i have a medial records hold on my account.

Conclusion:

Steer Clear!"
College Sophomore,1,I wouldn't bother with the Greek Life here. Nothing compared to bigger schools.
College Junior,1,"Parking is the biggest problem here. There are plenty of spaces, but parking is so mis-managed that it is going to leave you quite upset. Civic center parking is free and always available, but it is nowhere near campus. Resident parking is $100, and is always oversold, which is then made worse by faculty using resident/commuter lots. The faculty lot is usually empty because it is far from the academic buildings. Upper Ross should without question be a residential lot, but instead is a commuter lot that is almost always filled with faculty."
Recent Alumnus,1,Internships are done external and are either acknowledged by the school or not.
Recent Alumnus,1,Colder in winter than the nearest Metropolitan area and snows 60% more during winter and even into the spring
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you only have one semester left, they will not allow you to apply more than your normal HALF of your annual limit to you bill, to save on the out of pocket costs."
Recent Alumnus,1,Do not live in dorms.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Programs do not cover any vital information. They only care about grades and attendence, not about preparing you for work."
College Sophomore,1,Financial Aid is nearly impossible to come by. I received most of my money though private loans and high school scholarships. I pay for my own school and my parents make no contributions yet the school barley provides me any financial aid.
College Junior,1,"At Fitchburg State University, the students I am personally surrounded with are too into partying and seemingly uninterested in their academic performance. I had a lot of difficulty getting everything set up for my first semester here, and then more problems spread out from there. I had a professor who would always show up to class; one day he showed up 40 minutes late and asked if he was early. The parking is not at all great, and many of the students make their own parking spaces. The cafeteria is nice, but I try to spend the least amount of time I possibly can on campus! I'm attending Fitchburg State University because I can easily commute. I'm currently double thinking that choice!"
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid was the worst. I have had such a bad experience with it here. I applied for financial aid and only received a bit. I had to come crying to the school, begging in order for them to give me more money. After that, they still did not give me enough. It got to the point where I was planning on dropping out of school because I could not afford it and they would not give me money."
College Senior,1,To be honest I do not really find anything unique about the school. We did just get a new student lounge area and are in the process of a new science building.

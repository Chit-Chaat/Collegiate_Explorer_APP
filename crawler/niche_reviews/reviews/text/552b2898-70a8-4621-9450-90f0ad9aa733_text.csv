Junior,5,"I love my school! Campus is absolutely beautiful, big enough that you don't feel cramped, but small enough to have classes in multiple buildings and still get there on time. There is always something going on to get involved with, and the teachers are so nice and really know what they are talking about. After coming my sophomore year from a community college I was overwhelmed at the thought of being at a University, but I have been able to get the best grades I have ever gotten. I really believe that this is because I love my school and how the classes are constructed. Not to mention the amount of research help we have access to in the library! For a social work major, this has helped me tremendously."
Junior,5,"I have taken at least one class every semester I have been in college online. I have never had an issue with online learning. With covid-19, we had to move all our classes online fo 4th last eight weeks of school this spring semester. I was still able to keep connected with my classmates and my teachers still continued to show how much they care about our education and offered their assistance if we needed it for an assignment at any time. It is easy to navigate, and most of my classes are a hybrid class so at least 75% of my classwork is online now and I honestly like it much better now."
Freshman,5,"While having to take online classes with the pandemic going on I thought it was going to be harder than expected. However, that wasn't the case. All of the USI staff members where super helpful and understanding. We get weekly updates on what is going on so that when we return in the fall things will be good as new."
Freshman,5,My first year at USI was great! All the staff and students are very welcoming and only want to see you succeed while you are attending this college. The University is a smaller school which helped me a lot because there is more student to teacher interaction while in the classroom. My first week I met a lot of new friends! While the pandemic everyone at USI was very helpful and informative while making safe changes for their students to come back.
Junior,5,Very good! professors are willing to meet During office hours to help with questions and are very good about responding to emails in a timely manner.
Junior,5,"Love this school- teachers really care about your education and helping you succeed, the campus is beautiful."
Senior,5,Wonderful and safe campus. All my professors care and want to see me successful. Everybody on campus are welcoming and fun to be around.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed going here! Most of the professors were very nice and helped so much. I think something that could change is parking, and better outlining where visitors parking is. I think this would resolve many parking tickets. Another thing I think they should change is how late the campus food stays open. I remember I would try to go get food and some places were closed before 5pm!"
Senior,5,"I am a non - traditional student and have received nothing but encouragement from all professors to continue my path.  Even though I am no 10 plus years older than my cohort, I find it very easy to engage with and feel very much a part of the USI community.  The courses are challenging yet realistic in that I am able to seamlessly apply my studies to work and life."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my experience at USI. I am from Evansville, so my only complaint is that for my personal, ""ideal,"" college experience it wasn't the best match for me due to a lot of students I had already knew or went to school with. I just imagined seeing all new faces I guess. All of my professors in my two semesters were excellent. There's ample resources if you need any help and all the staff is pretty friendly. The campus is a great size and it's always nicely maintained. Their housing options, although are few, are all solid choices. There's constant events/activities going on for free and so many clubs you can join!"
Freshman,5,I love attending the University of Southern Indiana. I am able to commute because it is not too far away from my home and I love being apart of Greek life at the university.
Freshman,5,The University of Southern Indiana has an amazing campus and the professors are great. Everyone is very friendly. It does get a little boring on the weekends because there isn't much to do but it isn't hard to entertain yourself.
Sophomore,5,"I could not ask for a better university! I was welcomed with open arms and presented with numerous opportunities to get involved on campus. USI is unique in its ability to provide top notch education, with a community that supports you in other aspects as well."
Freshman,5,The school is amazing. The professors truly care about you and will make sure you are doing the best you can. So many opportunities available to students in extracurriculars and in academics. Truly feels like a family environment.

Niche User,5,Everyone is just so nice over there! I have visited many times before and it genuinely feels like a second home. At first it was scary to go to a college since it’s so big but there is nothing to worry about! Everyone is so outgoing and down to earth. Everyone is treated equally there which is why I love this college so much. :)
Senior,5,"I love the University of Southern Indiana! It's the perfect college for kids who want a home away from home after high-school. It's not too big, and it has a beautiful landscape, perfect for students who live on campus, I enjoy being able to walk through the trails on my way to class every morning. Classes are small, and professors are able to spend quality one on one with a student if you're struggling in a class!"
Alum,5,Great experience for college life in a smaller campus. Professors and staff are great to work with and care about their student's success
Senior,5,"I have been very impressed with all aspects of USI. I live off of campus so I do not know what the dorms/housing is like. All staff, professors, and those is charge of the college are amazing. They truly care about your success and want to do whatever they can to help you. I have been impressed with everything starting with the new student orientation I first attended!"
Freshman,5,Great living conditions and they are very reasonable with all of the costs. Their guidance department has been nothing but helpful throughout my application process. The campus is beautiful and there is plenty of stuff to keep you busy there.
Alum,5,"My father, mother, and sister both attended USI and loved everything about it. I have visited the campus many times and fell in love with the atmosphere. One thing I would change about USI is that freshman can live in the apartments on campus if they wish."
Sophomore,5,"I have been at this University going on 2 years now and it is such a great campus. Everything about this campus is fantastic whether it be the staff, food, housing, programs, etc. This University is great in each and every way."

Sophomore,5,"Attending the University of Southern Indiana was an amazing experience. With living on campus I had the opportunity to have the view of the campus and the recreational center, being close to the campus gave me more chances to be involved in the activities happening on campus and meeting new people. USI always finds a way to keep the students wanting to come back because of the warmth they give with the campus and the professors on campus, Teachers go above and beyond to help their students succeed and prepare them for their careers. I would reccomend USI to everyone."
Niche User,5,I have toured this amazing campus a couple of times I know many who have went and are still going or even graduated from here. I always here about how amazing it is and I would just love to be able to attend this University.
Freshman,5,Absolutely amazing! I toured and had my orientation and fell in love! The campus is beautiful and everyone was so nice and helpful. I cant wait to start in the fall!
Sophomore,5,USI has a beautiful campus and  excellent professors. Choosing this campus was a great decision. One thing that can be a little frustrating is the people working within Financial Aid and the Bursars office.
Sophomore,5,"University of Southern Indiana is a wonderful university for individuals who prefer smaller classes, a secluded area, and more one on one attention from teachers. I personally love this university because I come from a small town where the description is similar. Most of the professors even know me by name without looking at the sign in sheet. I can also walk to class which allows me to add some exercise into my day without it being excessive. In addition, I always feel safe on the campus and compfortable. I couldn't imagine attending a different university."
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful and big, but not too big you'll get lost, similar major's building are close so you don't have to travel far across campus. The rec center is awesome. Campus is safe."
Sophomore,5,University of Southern Indiana has lots of opportunities for students to be successful and to get involved on campus.
Alum,5,"I would not want to go anywhere other than USI. The campus is small, making it easy to get from place to place. Most of the class sizes are generally small, as well. The campus itself is secluded from the rest of Evansville, which is really nice. There's ton of extracurriculars to do on campus to help get new students involved. The campus also is very beautiful with walking trails. Anyone would feel right at home!"
Graduate Student,5,"loved the professors, convenient to home, campus is growing which sometimes makes it difficult to find classrooms, but overall enjoy it"
Niche User,5,"I attended at USI for one academic year in 2014, and I am intending to go back this fall and finish my degree. It was an outstanding school. There were always activities and events going on for the students. The professors were very helpful with assignments. The campus is absolutely beautiful with a great fitness center and wonderful library. Admission cost is affordable."
Niche User,5,My experience with Southern Indiana has been great so far! They have helped me through my whole enrollment process. I love the new Exercise Science/Kinesiology center they have so much to offer when trying to get a good education in order to be successful. They also have very good living options. They're dorm rooms are very spacious and the apartments are a good option for after your freshman year.
Niche User,5,I went for a visit recently and look forward to attending USI after high school. What I liked most about the college was it was easy to get around and it felt safe. Everyone was friendly and helpful.
Freshman,5,USI has a beautiful campus. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about their students. I like how safe I feel on campus; I enjoy being able to walk  throughout the campus and the surrounding area without worrying.
Niche User,5,I felt the environment of USI was very friendly and my tour guide was very helpful when we asked questions.
Freshman,5,I love USI! The professors are amazing and you aren't counted as just another student. The professors take the semester to get to know you and will wave to you outside of class. The dorms are very clean and have a decent amount of space for being a dorm room. USI has a ton of clubs to get involved with. The workers in the loft are so friendly and always inviting. I've never seen someone so excited to serve me chocolate chip pancakes.
Freshman,5,"University of Southern Indiana is a terrific school for anyone. Being here you will meet a lot of people and build bonds with them. This is a school that makes you want to come back any time you are here. Academic wise, the teachers are very intelligent and considerate with their students. Not only do they hope their grades are good, but they also want their students to learn and and strive to become successful young adults in today’s society. Our sports teams are outstanding, they continue to stive to win and achieve their goals without giving up at all. Perseverance is key to being a screagle, its very hard to give up at this school, because teachers and other students preserve you and make sure that you are doing the best you ca do. USI is definitely a college anyone should try to attend because, it is another place for you to actually call home"
Freshman,5,"University of Southern Indiana is has a beautiful campus. They have great sized dorms, great food, and a great atmosphere. They really hope to see you strive to be successful! Love my college!"
Niche User,5,"The campus is very clean, modern, and a good size. The campus has a lot of options for food. The diversity of the school is outstanding and feels very welcoming. The theater is absolutely gorgeous. The only problem is I believe there should be more parking options. I love the ability to live on or off campus"
Works Here,5,The school is midsize which I think is perfect.  I am pleased with the teaching and all the opportunities at USI for the students to get involved.
Alum,5,I loved it. It was a great school with a lot of opportunities. I was able to have more opportunities here than I would have at a larger school.
Sophomore,5,"The facilities are clean. The professors are very kind, reachable, and prompt. The classes are easy. The support staff are awesome. Great bang for your buck. Overall very friendly place to study."
Senior,5,"This campus is so welcoming and has great community involvement. The freshmen, especially, are encouraged to join organizations, meet new friends, and stay active. This helps you stay healthy, avoid homesickness, and make the best of your college experience. I love the USI community because it feels like home."
Junior,5,"Professors will help you get the help you need
Very diverse campus
Have apartments for upperclassmen and some freshmen"
Freshman,5,"Al of my professors worked with me, especially those in the LA department. All of my professors entirely cared about the classes they taught and their passion showed through. Semi-small campus that’s easily navigable and has plenty of things to offer."
Niche User,5,"I had a very good experience at USI. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, answering very thoroughly any question I or others had ."
Sophomore,5,It was a very fun and adventurous learning experience with lots of free campus events with food. There’s a lot of events with special guests like magicians and hypnosis. It’s a great opportunity to get familiar with the campus and meet new people. There are plenty of internship opportunities and travel abroad.
Sophomore,5,"University of Southern Indiana is a great university! This unviersity has so many opportunities to get involved in or out of campus. For my first year here on campus I met so many great new people that became great friends with me. These friends become like family and people I can count on, they may live far away but they are still great and stay in contact with you. This campus also has many opportunities to get to know your professors, advisors, and mentors. The University of Southern Indiana brought me not only great friends but amazing group orgianzations to be involved with also, I am currently apart of the Student Ambassadors that give tours of the campus and not only that but for next year I am not your Emerging Leaders Mentor Leader. This places has so many great opportunities that look outstanding on resumes when you go to apply for a job in the future. It is small but a safe campus that makes you feel at home."
Junior,5,Beautiful campus with friendly professors! The athletic program is steadily growing and the school is becoming more well known.
Junior,5,"There is a great sense of community and the campus is very safe and beautiful, easy to connect to the community in this college"
Senior,5,They have always been so helpful and such a great resource to go to when I need answers! They have always been direct and clear with instructions and issues.
Graduate Student,5,The University of Sothern Indiana is a wonderful place to learn and grow. There are lots of wonderful professors who are interested in helping you succeed.
Freshman,5,"I have only been at this school for a year now, but in this short period of time I have learned so much. All of my professors and advisors have been excellent! There is nothing I couldn't ask them for help with. All of my classes that I have taken have been very nice, some were hard to start with a little bit of a struggle with, but overall great learning classes."
Niche User,5,I like how it a small college and can get anywhere without having to take a car and go to the area. The the classes can be small and big but most of them will be small and for most people they like small classes so it a positive in the end.
Senior,5,"The campus community is incredibly welcoming and close knit. Walking between classes you can always find a familiar face to stop and chat with. The professors are incredibly involved and will do anything to make sure their students succeed. Furthermore, the campus is breathtakingly beautiful. Main campus is distinguishable by its iconic cone, prominent Rice Library, and modern-age business center. The wooded nature, walking trails, and Reflection Lake on the outskirts of campus also contribute to the university's beauty. I would also brag on the activities and programs at USI.  Some free events include painting classes, free movies & popcorn, building stuffed animals, blow-up obstacle courses, dinners, and more. USI has also provided free admission to community attractions such as the zoo, ice rink,  museums, hockey games, trampoline parks, and laser tag/mini golf. Conclusively, I would definitely choose it again and could not imagine being anywhere else."
Niche User,4,"I took several online courses, they were always easy to navigate through using blackboard. It would occasionally take a week to get answers/responses from professors, bursars, or other departments but they would always get around to answering questions."
Niche User,4,"I love the campus, plenty to see and do when on campus. I enjoyed that it was a commuter school, it helped develop small knit groups after school hours and bring life to the weekdays during classes. All the professors and staff were great to work with. Food options were great compared to other schools."
Freshman,4,"The school setting is very well laid out. The dorm rooms are extremely nice. With the virus, it's not the same as it could have been so not many activities to do on campus to meet people. The food is great there are plenty of choices to choose from and the teachers are very engaging."
Freshman,4,Online courses were not as bad as I thought they may have been. Teachers are good at keeping up with uploading assignments and lectures. It's not overly difficult to keep up with. The teachers do a good job of explaining how their course page works so you can access all the information you may need to succeed.
Graduate Student,4,"It is a small campus and everything is within walking distance. They care about their students; however, there is not a lot of communication on financial aid, you have to go searching for it."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the Covid-19, part of my second semester had to be completely online. I feel like most of my professors did well in the transition and made the classroom set up very easy to keep up with assignments. Most of my professors laid out the weeks assignments and we had until midnight on Friday of that week to complete the assignments. My sociology professor was the only one I really had any problems with because there was little communication actually from him to ensure that we (the students) were actually getting anything from the lectures he posted."
Sophomore,4,"I really like my school because the campus feels like its own little community due to it having its own exit. Most of the buildings are located around the quad allowing for easy access to all the classroom buildings. The cafeteria always offered the same food items, but you could easily get something different everyday. The only thing I wish would change about my school would be the inclusiveness of the different organizations to other students. While the organizations held their own activities on campus for their members, I wish there were more organizations that held events for all students as well."
Sophomore,4,"It's pretty good overall. The apartments are nice for the most part. If you don't have your car on campus, there is a shuttle bus that will take you to and from campus. Everyone here is really nice. I haven't met one mean person yet."
Freshman,4,"I love the size of USI. It's not too small, but not too big. You can walk around and easily recognize people you know, but could also meet someone new every day. Most of the class sizes are small, so you get the opportunity to get to know your professor."
Freshman,4,Its a medium sized school with staff and students that genuinely care about you. There are so may opportunities to get involved on campus as well as off campus. I have had the best experience so far my freshman year and have made so many friends!
Senior,4,"I love this University. It is peaceful and has a lot of trees and beautiful flowers. The professors are easy to talk to and they try their best to help you with your studies. The Library is a dream, with a variety of comfortable places to study. There is not much here to distract you from your schoolwork; so, if you are looking for nature filled, sunny, and safe campus, then University of Southern Indiana is the place to be."
Junior,4,just started here but this place has a very friendly atmosphere and a good learning environment. The art department has a very knowledgeable and caring staff that will do anything to help you succeed if you make an effort and show that you really care.
Freshman,4,"When I first heard about the university of Southern Indiana, I didn't think too much of it since I believed I already chosen my school, University of Springfield at Illinois. I had a change of heart once I reached the campus. What separates Southern Indiana from Springfield was the presidents' mission to diversify his school. I'm a strong believer of diversity and it really caught my attention to help him with his vision."
Freshman,4,My experience at University of Southern Indiana was and absolute blast. The campus is very nice and the faculty is excellent. The university has a wide array of clubs and intramural sports to participate in.
Senior,4,Great online in state school for RN-BSN program.  Academic advisors and most professors are wonderful.
Junior,4,"I like the school, overall very good environment for both students and professors. Classes are easy to find and once you learn the campus everything is easy"
Freshman,4,"I love the size of the campus! It isn't too big and isn't too small, plus if you are the type of person that feels anxious in big areas this school would be perfect for you to avoid that. On top of it all, the tuition is cheaper than any other school in the area."
Alum,4,"It was challenging but not too challenging. Great, liberal school that has lots of opportunities to meet people. The location is great, as well. Evansville has a lot to do if you know where to look for things. The professors are all great and willing to help. The gym is amazing and the staff there is great as well."
Freshman,4,"I love how small the school is, I love the people who go here. The only major thing I would change is the food services and on-campus housing."
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Indiana is a great school for a pretty affordable price. The nursing program is one of the best in the state. The professors always seem to go above and beyond for their students. My only complaint about USI is the student life. Many people like myself are commuter students, and as soon as I am done with classes I am off campus. If you are not part of a Greek organization then there is not much to do on campus."
Freshman,4,"There are tons of classes you could take, and so much diversity when you look around you. Everyone is very outgoing, friendly, and eager to help even if you don't know one another. But although USI has some programs such as the Occupation Therapy Assistant program, they are not diverse in that area. I would love to see more programs, programs such as the Physician Assistant program."
Freshman,4,It's a fun time and there are many things to do with your friends. ON the campus there are many places you can eat including Chick-fil-a.
Senior,4,"Very relaxed campus, nice dorms, definitely worth it's cost. A mix of good professors some not so good ones. Housing around campus is cheap."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, I love it here. Yes, some of the courses and proffessors are difficult, but they are trying to make sure that you are prepared and that you achieve your best potential, while you are still in school. They offer many different things to help their students feel comfortable and acclimate themselves into the working field of their choice. There are many different advisors who are always willing to help. I do wish that the campus would focus of diversifying their students more, but besides that I would highly recommend USI to anyone."
Niche User,4,"As soon as I arrived on campus, I was welcomed. I would pass students on the sidewalks they all looked happy to be at USI. The campus is vibrant in color and makes everyone feel at home. This isn't an extremely large campus, but it's just big enough to find what is best for every individual."
Junior,4,"What I like most about my school is how well everyone works with you. I have a certain work schedule and I have never not been able to get my schedule to work the way I need it too. The atmosphere is also very welcoming and the campus itself is located by itself and everything is close together, which is nice and safe."
Junior,4,Great professors faculty and staff. Programs such as engineering and nursing are given the most weight. Computer science isn’t that good.
Senior,4,"I love my school. There are a few problems I’ve had that were logistical, problems signing up for classes that were frustrating or not having an advisor that knew what they were doing, but overal I’ve had a wonderful experience here. I’m a theatre major, and that’s really where I’ve found my niche."
Sophomore,4,"University of Southern Indiana is a beautiful campus. The advisers here help their students succeed and plan the right track for them. They have many programs for students, and allow students to study abroad. I do wish their was a program that was strictly event management. I also wish we had a football team."
Senior,4,"They offered me a full ride, which was great because I transferred from Texas. The professors are knowledgeable and kind,  but push for your best work. They expect dedication and quality in everything you do. It's a good public school with a lot of options."
Freshman,4,i enjoy USI very much! i love the size of the school; its not too big or too small. its the perfect size. the teachers make sure they are avaliable to students and make sure that the students know their resources for help. only bad thing is the amount of parking. it seems like there are more students than there are parking spaces.
Freshman,4,I always feel included- they always create activities for all of the student to partake in! I just wish they had even more.
Freshman,4,"The University of Southern Indiana was one of my first choices to choose from after high school. I applied early during my senior year, and when I found out I had gotten, I was very excited. The location is a very nice area and is away from central parts of Evansville. The tuition is not too bad, and it is close to home. I have met some interesting professors here at USI. The professors in my major are extremely nice, and I was so invested in one of the classes that I joined the club. I participate in the club frequently and talk to my professors often. Even though I'm still a freshman, and it's my first year, I have really enjoyed the college experience and expect to continue to succeed in my classes."
Freshman,4,"When I took my first tour I fell in love. It was the most personal experience I have been on. I had a one on one conversation with the counselor. The tour guide was so involved in the tour and was asking and answering questions the students wanted to hear, not only the parents. Then, when I arrived on campus it felt like home."
Freshman,4,"As of now, I am wrapping up my freshman year at the University of Southern Indiana. Even though I will be transferring to Ball State University in the next school year, I still loved my time here at USI. I was so nervous about entering into my first year of college but at this university everyone works together to make sure that you feel prepared and confident in your school work. Being at the University of Southern Indiana has confirmed my future career goals and has made me so excited for post college."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about USI is that is a decent size and secluded. The campus is well kept, the majority of the professors are helpful and genuine, and there are multiple ways to get involved. With the price of tuition and housing, it is easy to say that student's get their money's worth. It is definitely an underrated university."
Junior,4,The teachers are pretty chill. I like the overall atmosphere of the school and I love the easy commute between the dorms and the campus. There is a ton of stuff to do on campus.
Senior,4,Bang for your buck! Good academics with not privy tuition. If you get involved you will enjoy your time.
Senior,4,"I would not change anything.   The classes are the right size and the Professors take pride in their work. It is more of a family environment than school environment in the classroom. I do not attend any of the campus gatherings because I work, but there is always something going on for the students to get involved in. Class availability could be better, but I realize they have to follow the educational plan for everyone."
Senior,4,"I am an engineering student at the University of Southern Indiana.  The classes are pretty tough, but as long as you do your homework and attend class you should do just fine."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I love everything about this school. The academics are great, and the professors are extremely helpful and want the best for their students. There are a number of activities and clubs for students to participate in, and the campus is a great, safe place to be. 
There was some difficulty with the financial aid office in terms of basic costumer service. Other than that the University of Southern Indiana is a great school to attend for various degrees."
Sophomore,4,"USI feels like a new home and it's a place where I actually enjoy going to classes, not endure them!"
Sophomore,4,It's a smaller campus which is ideal for a more comfortable experience. It's kept up very well. I've had very good teachers as well. Many of them are very knowledgeable and helpful to those who need it.
Freshman,4,The campus is clean and appealing. I love the size of the campus and the size of the student body. I wish there were more food options and dining areas.
Niche User,4,I've visited here several times because my boyfriend goes to college here. He enjoys being here and I love visiting. The campus is very tiny and warming. There is always something to do and the food is amazing.
College Sophomore,4,"University of Southern Indiana has been a great school. The professors there love their job and they are there to help you succeed. They are willing to work around your schedule for exams, especially if you do a sport or have children. They even help you on their off hours if you need the help. USI wants you to succeed and they will help you accomplish that!"
Junior,4,"University of Southern Indiana is a great school to attend, with many accredited programs to choose from.  Professors and staff are very helpful and compassionate. They are there to educate students and create a relationship with us. The housing is great, because I get the adult life that I want as a college student. USI also has a wide verity of good food to choose from. One thing I really enjoy about USI is the location. There are many organizations to get involved in, off campus, such as volunteering at different nonprofits, shelters, and many hospitals. There are many organizations and clubs on campus to be apart of. USI is a great community with very passionate educators and students. I would highly recommend attending USI for your college. "
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience has been so positive.  I knew when I came on my visits to the campus this was where I wanted to be.

Even then staff and students were so friendly, never hesitate to offer directions, when they see you are lost!

The staff  you feel like a part of the campus, not a number.  And I love the fact that they utilize the upper classmen in 

the study labs.  So they are getting hands on experience in their field of studies and we under classmen are getting

the help we need....   Great work ethics there."
College Freshman,4,I am planning on going into nursing and they have one of the best nursing programs I found out there.
College Freshman,4,I'm still new on campus so I haven't really been directly involved with the Greek life yet.
College Freshman,4,"The Varsity Sports are fun and great to watch.  But we also have a lot of intramural sports that even the athletes encourage everyone to participate in.  The work out and sports complex are great and I have found it is a great way to meet new people on campus.  There is a Large array of work out equipment, walking track, rock climbing wall, pool.... it's great!!"
College Freshman,4,If you do it you do it if you dont you dont
College Freshman,4,I havent really looked into it
College Freshman,4,My school does the best that it can to help in anyway it can.
College Freshman,4,I thought about rushing but it is too much money
College Freshman,4,I know really know anything about our sports
College Sophomore,4,Every semester there is a job fair to meet local businesses as well non-local. Professors also help set up connections if asked. The career service center will also help look for jobs as long as one signs up.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe on campus. Walking around at night I feel safe and although I do not suggest doing it all the time, there is really nothing to worry about. Campus security walks around and we have the sheriff out walking around too sometimes."
College Sophomore,4,There are on campus dorms (Freshman only) and then on campus apartments that are pretty nice as well. The dorms are closer to classes however the apartments give it a more off campus feel. There is plenty of space. It is slightly expensive and laundry is not free. I enjoyed my accommodations for the most part this past year though.
College Sophomore,4,"Our athletics are pretty good. Students are involved and have many opportunities to become very involved in athletics and different parts (i.e. support, school spirit) and the facilities for both athletes and non-athletes have very nice equipment and training use."
Freshman,2,"It's only been two weeks and a day but I don't like it here. I just feel out of balance because of the lack of diversity here. I'm sure it's a great school, it's just not a good fit for me."
College Senior,2,Greek life at  USI is decent.
College Sophomore,2,I don't know any off campus restaurants near the school
College Freshman,2,"If you want a party school where everyones friendly, there's school spirit, an actual football team, the fraternities and sororities do it right, where you meet a lot of people, and have an overall happy and nice atmosphere then do not choose the University of Southern Indiana. Besides this being a place where there is nothing to do and dreams go to die, this is a place where kids who are not serious about schooling and want only a half-step up from high school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I want to be honest because I had a problem every time I tried to speak with someone from financial aid, they seem like they didn't want to help me and I have been having huge headaches because I still don't know how I'm going to pay for my school this year, and that is why I have to drive thirty minutes on Thursday to speak with someone and hopefully receive the help I need."
College Senior,2,"Eagle Village are the closest apartments to campus as they are within walking distance. They are super overpriced and it's such a hassle because they are terrible with communication. The upside though is having your own room, being able to have alcohol if you are old enough and a washer, dryer, and dishwasher in each apartment. BUT IT IS NOT WORTH IT. On paper it seems so nice but I have lived there and many people who I know that also have lived there agree that they should have chosen somewhere else to live. As far as other off campus living, gas prices and traffic are a big deterrent but quality of housing and prices seem to be better"
College Senior,2,"The school only provides aid to: incoming freshman, those in a limited number of programs, and transfer students from Illinois and Kentucky. I am a transfer student but I live in the state and did not attend straight from high school so I recieve no help from the school besides work study which is technically government money not school funds."
College Junior,2,They do not really assist married couples with housing. Not all students are 25 or younger. Older students need housing assistance also.
College Freshman,2,"Personally, Evansville is not a fit for me. USI is a couple miles outside of town so you always have to drive to get off campus. The city is more of a really commercial center then a city. I don't know a lot to do in Evansville besides eat and go shopping. The city is largely culture-less."
College Freshman,2,"I live on campus, but the only close off campus housing I know of it Eagle Village, and if any other they are a couple miles away from campus."
College Freshman,2,"I do see a lot of international students at USI. But for the most part, it is a lot of white, conservative, and christian, people. There is a lot of diversity in economic status though, since it is a cheap school, and also a convenient school for people in the tri state area. A lot of different people come here for those reasons."
College Senior,2,USI needs to get or construct more parking lots because it is frustrating to find parking spots. I feel like there are not enough parking spots for students. I once drove around for 20 minutes just to find a spot and it sucked. 
College Senior,2,"Indiana weather is the worst. especially in the winter. It gets so cold on campus however, inside the buildings are pretty warm. "
College Sophomore,2,"conservative and boring, because their is little to do on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"not many choices and all food options close early and even earlier on weekends ,if they are open at all."
College Sophomore,2,"mostly see them at the speed signs and giving out tickets.And driving around in their truck.
"
College Sophomore,2,"It would be helpful if everyone knew what they were doing, and at least tried to pretend that they cared if you could afford the university for more then one year.
"
College Student,2,"a lot of places on campus are not open later, have poor quality, and not  lot of options"
College Senior,2,At school the RAs differ when it comes to strictness.  My particular RA was pretty laid back about his rules. The campus police were helpful if needed.  Drinking or having alcohol on campus was not tolerated at all.
College Junior,2,Fairly average. Not really something that is exploited
College Junior,2,"Dining options are limited. There is a Burger King, a pizza/pasta place and a Sub Connection in the UC. There is a relatively new salad/wrap place and Mexican place ( a la Qdoba or Chipotle). There are a couple of satellite cafes and a frozen yogurt shop. But if you are eating on campus every day, then plan to eat the same thing a lot."
College Freshman,2,"There are many big companies around so it is quite easy to find an internship, no matter what year you are. But evansville is nothing special."
College Freshman,2,There is almost no interaction with other students on campus. Students go to school and go home. School sponsored activites happen but are not highly advertised. Buildings are nice and new.
College Freshman,2,Seems to me that there is nothing to do at night or on the weekends. They do have movie nights every other day though.
College Freshman,2,"There is parking available, but the rows and rules are kind of confusing. They are also very crowded."
College Sophomore,2,"I would say that the Greek life here is not all that it could be. The Greeks that I have met are not nice and are very cliquey, which I think is what they are not suppsed to be like."
College Freshman,2,"It believe it would be very hard to live off campus. There are apartments very close to campus called Eagle Villiage but they arevery expensive. Also,  parking is absolutely ridiculous on campus and i feel that everything is easier to just live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus can be frusterating. Make sure you arrive 30 minutes early at the LEAST. Especially on the first 2-3 weeks of school. Most (freshman) arrive super early to get spots for parking because they either don't know if parking will be available or arrive early to locate their classes. But after the first 2-3 weeks parking becomes much easier. Students are getting out of classes all over campus generally every 15-30 minutes, this means there are people leaving and spots opening up if you have a class in the afternoon. All campus locations are in a close area meaning it can be easy to find a spot and not be too long of a walk across campus. The reason I gave USI Parking a C is because at certain times of the day parking is packed and if you cannot find a spot close to campus then there are lots that seem to be 1/4 a mile away from campus. So parking should not be an issue, just where you park - that is the issue."
College Junior,2,They don't really cater to the minority students. Diversity here sucks.
College Senior,2,"Parking in campus housing is about as bad as commuter parking. It is always hard to find a parking spot. The only times parking is easier to find is on the weekends, holidays, and breaks."
College Senior,2,Most of the scholarships were aimed more toward Indiana residents. I hardly found any scholarships for somebody not from Indiana.
College Freshman,2,To Expensive – Although it is convenient it is overly expensive to live on campus and really not worth the money you pay to live here. My half of a 2 person 2 bedroom apartment is 3500 for 3 and a half months and then another 3500 for another 3 and a half months not worth it at all. They are nice but still i could go somewhere else and live a lot cheaper than i do here.
College Junior,2,"Not a Lot – There aren't really a ton of places to hang out in Evansville. USI is a ""dry"" campus (as much as they can be) and much of the nightlife is for the over-21 crowd. Anything for those underage usually closes at around 9 or 10 pm."
College Sophomore,2,i really do not think theres no unique thing about USI. More so like an high school.
College Sophomore,2,it really affordable but i didnt like i had ants in the apartment.
College Freshman,2,"Food Prices – USI has many food varieties, but the prices on everything is extreme."
College Senior,2,"The commute from off-campus apartments is really short--only 2 or 3 miles. However, the main road leading into school (Lloyd) is extremely dangerous and there are never enough parking spaces on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The parking on campus was so crazy at first, you couldn't find a spot anywhere and if you did then it was 20 miles away.  But now that a lot of people have dropped out of college already parking isn't as bad as it used to be."
College Freshman,2,I am not really into the Greek Life on campus.  I see the students who are active but I have no interest in this.
College Sophomore,2,"Expensive Living – There are several convenient apartments off-campus in Evansville, the only problem is they are all super expensive. Some are a little more affordable, but in the long run the cheapest thing to do is either live at home, or find several roommates."
Graduate Student,1,"The small campus atmosphere offers great student to professor ratio. Unfortunately, I feel as though I have returned to high school. I enjoy learning, but there is limited challenges here."
College Junior,1,"They are not helpful and do not communicate well at all. I lost out on scholarships because I never heard what I was awarded for the year and missed the deadlines for scholarships. Very unhappy with the financial aid office. Also, they are no help when it comes to scholarship information either. My program advisor and the internet is more helpful. It is a shame really."
College Junior,1,"We have to walk all over campus to get from class to class and to the library and any food, so when the weather is bad it really sucks!"
College Sophomore,1,"night life is not very easy to get to, not much of a variety for a college town, and we are a dry campus , so we have no outlet."
College Sophomore,1,The campus is a little more close minded then I thoutht
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone complains so far, no one talks about internships.
"
College Sophomore,1,"There is virtually no gluten free friendly food besides salad. At Salsa Rico, the Mexican Sodexo place, they charge for things like lettuce, which NORMALLY comes with ANY DISH outside of campus dining. Also, they recently went to this sensor on the bottom of your cup thing where you can only fill it up TWICE in thirty minutes which is terrible if you are the kind of person who has to take medication prior to eating and after consuming your meal. Overall, it is the WORST experience ever."
College Sophomore,1,If you don't arrive very early int he morning you will not get a parking space anywhere close to campus because the lots are not near big enough to hold all the cars trying to park in the spaces.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms/on campus apartments are absolutely awful.  I lived on campus for two years (four semesters).  The apartments are not only tiny cramped and dirty, but completely out of control.  My first year I had roommates across the hall that smoked pot and threw away my glass dishes, and never did their dishes.  My second year was quite as horrible, but was still dirty and cramped.  I would be kept awake many nights by students in the parking lots and in apartments with their windows open yelling and partying throughout the night.  I called security plenty of times, but it never did any good.  Sometimes I wouldn't be able to get any quiet until just hours before my test.  And with all that trouble, you think it would be super cheap right? It isn't.  The the housing market around the college being so low, it is much cheaper to rent an apartment or get roommates off-campus.  This has been my first year off campus and my stress levels have dropped significantly, and my grades have gone up."
College Junior,1,"It was terrible. There was nobody there to walk me through the financial aid process, and anytime I asked for help I didn't get a clear cut answer. Papers got lost too which resulted in me having to redo some important papers and they didn't let me know I found out because I called them to ask if they had everything they needed. I even drove over to the college over summer break to get stuff taken care of, which is an hour drive there and back. I would say the best way to ensure you get loans or financial aid is to be on top of it, get your fafsa and information filled out as quickly as possible and keep track of your school emails and website at all times for new information. Also if you have any questions stay on top of the financial aids office until you get answers."
College Freshman,1,There is no permits so parking is very hard to deal with. Enforcement is all around campus writing  tickets so you have to be careful. Parking takes a long time so you have to add that in when getting to classes.
College Freshman,1,It's very boring here. There is nothing to do here in evansville.
College Freshman,1,Everyone Is Drinking – Everyone drinks its impossible to look out your window on a weekend night and not see someone stumbling around but no one ever really seems to do anything about it.
College Junior,1,"This College Is Lacking – I may just be biased, considering I transferred from the University of Evansville to this college... but even compared to most other college experiences, USI is far below par. There is no comradery amongst students, know central locale in which students may gather, no team spirit, no enthusiasm for the future, and the Greek life is terribly pathetic. The dorms are situated in such a way that it discourages togetherness amongst students rather than encourages. Not to mention the fact that they seem to be under the impression that housing four girls to a room is a great idea (it isn't). I have never ever had so many roommate problems, financial aid problems, security problems and classroom problems until coming to this university. They need to get their act together, pronto."
College Junior,1,"Hot and Rainy – The weather in Evansville has two switches in the summer, fall and spring: super hot or super rainy (and sometimes in both). In the winter it also has two switches: super snowy and super frigid. All times of the year prove to be especially troubling for those suffering from allergies such as I do. Being in close proximity with the river must attribute to the moldy, dingy weather that so commonly irritates allergies year 'round."
College Sophomore,1,Not Many Sports. Not Supported by Student Body – USI is a campus where most students wear shirts and apparel supporting other universities
College Sophomore,1,"The parking on campus is horrible. There is never any spaces available. For a growing campus the parking seems to be shrinking. We now have over 10,000 students, and yet only a few thousand parking spaces. Some days there isn't even any available unless you want to walk two miles."
College Sophomore,1,"The Word Terrible Is an Understatement – If I could give an F- I would. The people who work in finical aid are rude and completely unwilling to help. It was impossible for me to get them to help me at all, and it had nothing to do with money, just the people didn't feel the need to work with a student to help them out."
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs and Alcohol Are Abundant – You can score easily, even if the campus is supposed to be dry and drug free."
College Sophomore,1,"In general living on Campus is boring, there is nowhere to go nothing to do and no Greek life on campus."

Sophomore,5,This is the first year Dayton will be offering online classes and they are already starting out super strong and they require a great support system for struggling students.
Sophomore,5,"Great people are at this school!! One of my favorite things about Dayton is the campus. Nothing is too far of a walk, and all of my classes are generally in the same building which allows me to schedule classes back to back."
Alum,5,I loved the emphasis put on community at UD. Faculty and professors were always available to help me down the path of earning my degree. There were unique opportunities to be involved in service and experiential learning.

Dayton offers a $500 textbook scholarship to kids who tour the school. Most professors really care about their students, which makes this experience a lot better. I highly recommend this school!"
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the University of Dayton. It has a great environment to learn and your professors really care about you. It also offers a lot of programs and internships for you to pursue that are catered to what you want to do.
Junior,5,"Everyone is so welcoming and friendly at the University. Strangers smile and wave as you walk by.  UD is known for its parties and while the party scene is incredible, their academics are also top-notch. The small class size enables teachers to dedicate more time to their students; they are all very responsive and they genuinely seem to care about their student's success. The campus is beautiful and UD offers extensive opportunities to get involved."
Freshman,5,This is a super well rounded college.  It is easy to find your place no matter who you are.  There is a great balance between academics and social life.  I highly suggest if you like to party.  That is a big part of the culture here between Thursday and Saturday night.
Niche User,5,Small classrooms and transparent costs.  Great sports programs and wonderful conditions on the dorm rooms.  Food is above average.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed being there and getting to experience everything that came with college life. It is expensive, but they give out really good financial help to many students."
Freshman,5,Dayton has amazing professors and amazing learning classrooms. The teachers set up hours and time to always help improved your grades.
Alum,5,"I was a non-traditional student. Financial Aid representative was clearly unhappy with someone in my age group. Very young employees in Admissions as well.  One saying, ""We don't want non-traditional students"". I wish I'd gotten her name & reported her, but I had other priorities.  Was admitted as Honors Student (due to having just graduated with High Honors from Sinclair's UD tract) but never got the appropriate information to participate in the program from Admissions.  Deans and Professors EXTREMELY welcoming & helpful! Many welcoming, kind students as well. Graduated Summa Cum Laude! Due to previous business experience, received many high paying job offers. LOVED MY UD EXPERIENCE & classes. It takes grit & determination to attend as an older student!"
Junior,5,"everyone is very friendly so its easy to make friends.  the housing is nice, and the professors are all pretty good."
Niche User,5,Love the school and all the people there.  It feels like a home away from home and it is something that everyone will fall in love with quickly

Freshman,5,"I like the diversity of all the people, there are so many people from different parts of the country."
Freshman,5,I am happy at the campus and have met many great friends.my professors are supportive and encouraging. I was already recommended to be a tutor by my engineering professor.
Niche User,5,"From what I could tell of the campus tour and talking to students- everyone loves it. They talk up their ""sense of community"" but I could feel that it was real; as soon as I got on campus I felt at home. My relatives who graduated from there would say it's the best college in the world, and they're flying the Dayton flag outside their house whether they're a little older than me and just graduated, or if they've been out of Dayton for 40 years."
Freshman,5,"University of Dayton is a wonderful institution dedicated to making all feel apart of the community. The academics, student life, food, and safety are all stellar, and I believe any prospective student should consider applying to University of Dayton."
Sophomore,5,I love it here! The community is amazing and everyone is very welcoming. There has never been moment were I regretted coming to UD. Go Flyers!

Niche User,5,"The education at UD is amazing. They have amazing professors, amazing dorms, and food options. The campus is also beautiful. The sidewalks are always clear when it snows. There is plenty to do on campus including a lot of activities the university recommends to students. The student participation in activities is excellent. The University of Dayton is a family and it is the right place to be."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere there. I felt welcomed by everyone I met and comfortable with the friendly admissions officers during the tour and presentation.
Junior,5,Community is great. All the professors are very supporting and people of all backgrounds are welcome
Sophomore,5,From the minute you step on campus you know you are a member of the community. The professors are well studied in their topic areas and care about the success of their students. The campus and students are open and welcoming to people of all backgrounds and cultures.
Junior,5,"I love the community here at the University of Dayton, you get to know many of the people you are going to school with. People care about each other here at UD. The only thing I would change is to have more diversity, it is a predominantly white school."
Alum,5,"The University of Dayton was my home for 4 years. I have never felt so connected to a place and people before in my life. From the moment I stepped on campus my first day, I knew I never wanted to leave. The dorms, the food, and the people made it so comfortable. I was excited to go to class and to parties and see all the people I did not live in the same dorm with. The student neighborhood is always so welcoming because it feels like home with all the houses and students hanging out on the porches. I have never wanted to go back and relive 4 years of something so great before. I still talk to 16 of my closest friends each day and have met the man I will marry at this university. I cannot thank the University of Dayton enough for what it has given me in this life."
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at the University of Dayton and I absolutely love it. The campus is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. Everyone is very friendly and the point the University tries to emphasize is that the University of Dayton is one big community. It truly does feel this way, and it says a lot about the roman catholic values that the University portrays."
Junior,5,The community and people you will meet at UD is unlike any other campus! There is a very welcoming feeling the second you get on campus that I have never experienced anywhere else. It is an incredible place to study and the perfect size. SO many opportunities for experiential learning and involvement outside of the classroom. Also an amazing place to meet new friends and have fun :)
Freshman,5,"The University of Dayton has a wonderful college campus, with such great people. It really felt at home."
Sophomore,5,"Although it may sound cheesy if you know anything about the University of Dayton, but I love attending there because of the community. It's big enough that you see new faces everyday but not too big as you are still able to see familiar faces as well."
Sophomore,5,"The first few weeks away from home were difficult but being in such a welcoming community was essential in getting through it. It may be cliche to say but UD is truly my home away from home. I love the campus, the buildings, the atmosphere, and the people. Classes were great and all my professors were extremely open and available if someone needed assistance with understanding a lecture. Going to basketball games at UD Arena was an experience of a lifetime. I've never been in a stadium so loud. You get chills listening to the starting line up every game. Overall, community is a big thing at UD but their community is a lot more unique than other schools. Words can't describe the feeling I'm trying to convey, but it is truly a special place."
Senior,5,I love the University of Dayton. The culture is very welcoming and there is a very strong sense of community. My professors are very helpful and want to help me to succeed. The intramural sports are huge here and are a great way to stay in shape and have fun with your friends.
Junior,5,"The University of Dayton is a very friendly campus, the students truly care about each other and there is a very strong sense of community amongst students, faculty, and staff."
Graduate Student,5,My experience at this university has shaped me into the adult leader I wanted to be when I was graduating high school. The courses I took helped develop my interpersonal and communication skills. The surrounding city was always lively and provided me the opportunity to meet my life long friends. The professors were well equipped to teach a diverse community of students and worked for our benefit. You will be challenged to be the best version of yourself at this university and you will be given the resources to do just that. The campus is beautiful and is one of the safest environments you can learn in.
Freshman,5,Tours and Events include many current students. They are open to sharing real life information. The words that constantly comes up are community and home.
Senior,5,"I've grown so much throughout my college experience at the University of Dayton. Personally, I've developed from a shy, homeschooled kid to an outspoken leader. Academically, I have been able to take part in courses totally outside of my specific major and has helped hone in on my creative side through classes like theater. Lastly, professionally I've been able to work alongside my college career as a co-op which has resulted in me getting work experience even before I graduate and better prepared me for the time after graduation. I can't imagine having this experience anywhere else, go Flyers!"
Niche User,5,"I attended the overnight for admitted students on March 24-25th. The campus is so well connected to all of the buildings. It only takes about 5 minutes to walk from one side to the other. The overall sense of community is deeply rooted in each student you encounter. I felt so at home when I was on campus and accepted. I felt that I could fit into the community during my time at UD. This is a feeling that I have never gotten when touring campus or attending overnights. The professors were very honest about their courses and the workload that entails, which is not a very common aspect of professors these days. Overall, the experience with this university has been overall a very positive experience."
Sophomore,5,The University of Dayton is such a welcoming university that values community. It is filled with people and professors that want to help and see you succeed in the future. I have loved every minute of my experience at the University of Dayton thus far.
Senior,5,I love UD!  The only improvements I would like to see is more diversity. I have spoken to several administrators and they have been implementing several programs to try and bring in more minorities but being an expensive catholic school there are limitations.  The professors are extremely caring but tough and I could not imagine getting a better education.  There's always plenty to do with clubs and sports and there's something special about the culture here that makes you feel like your are with family.  I am normally a very shy person but I have made so many friends at school that I hope to have for a lifetime.  The party scene is great but I don't have anything to compare it to but let me just say it is enough for me - I couldn't ask for a more fun group to decompress with.  The internships are awesome!!! Overall I am very happy with my choice and will miss my time here after I graduate.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere of UD. I had transferred in the second semester my freshman year and I am so happy that I did.  It is so easy to get involved and make friends on campus.  I love how personable the professors are. I feel very at home here.
Sophomore,5,"University of Dayton feels like home.  At UD, people know your name, hold doors open for you, and overall feel like family.  The campus is quiet and safe, but that does not mean there is a lack of excitement.  Around every corner there are opportunities for fun, ranging from the student neighborhood where students gain real responsibility as home owners without ever leaving campus to school-sponsored activities where you can experience different activities for a fraction of the price.  OVerall, UD is an amazing chool."
Freshman,5,"First year at UD at living it. Fun, exciting, safe, feel like I am at home. My new home for the next four years. Classes and Profs are excellent.  Food is to die for. Meeting lots of new friends. Could not have made a better choice for college."
Niche User,5,The University of Dayton is all about community. It is amazing to be a part of such a wonderful family.
Niche User,5,Right when I got onto campus I knew this was my home. The upperclassman accpect you and make you feel welcomed.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school and everything included in it.  The people surrounding you, the classes offered, and the overall community is amazing and would highly recommend to anyone considering colleges in any area."
Niche User,5,I visited the Universirty of Dayton many times a a prospective student. The campus is beautiful especially during the summer and the stundent to professor ratio is small so stundents really get that 1 on 1 attention with their professors.
Sophomore,5,UD is a great school where everyone is friendly and a close community.  This school gives many oppurtunities for a bright successful future. It was always a fun time at school with a lot of fun on the weekends especially.
Freshman,5,"I have never felt more at home than at the University of Dayton. The campus is absolutely beautiful and I feel so lucky to be able to see that view everyday. The professors put in a tremendous amount of effort into their classes and are readily available to help any student who comes to them for help. The food at Dayton is top of the line, we truly are spoiled. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved and meet more people and UD makes a substantial effort to include everyone as a community."
Freshman,5,"I love UD! The second I walked on campus I knew this was the place for me. We are one big community. Their academics are rigorous, but they have great student life to help you relax through intramural sports, to clubs, to Greek life, to the parties it’s a great balance. GO FLYERS!!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Dayton is the definition of community. I was lucky to be a part in planning the annual Christmas on Campus event. This event invited 1,200 Dayton public school students to be buddied up with University of Dayton students where they were able to participate in different Christmas activities around campus. This event was also open to the public. This is one of the many reasons why Dayton prides its community."
Sophomore,4,"Here at the University of Dayton, the faculty , and students seem to be generally dedicated to the idea of ""the common good"". This creates a community that fosters joy and appreciation for one another. I have enjoyed my time here at the university and I hope to finish my time here with my best foot forward. 

However, the University has handled Covid 19 in a way that I have disliked. The majority of students have returned to campus, but due to outbreaks we are recommended to stay confined in our rooms until the cases are reduced. However, now that our classes are online we should not be on campus. I find this to be a bit stupid, considering the fact that cases continue to rise despite students staying indoor."
Sophomore,4,"I took all my classes online during the Coronavirus outbreak. Despite having to put online classes together in such a short time, all if my professors did an excellent job on converting to online classes. They were also all very understanding of special circumstances."
Junior,4,"The education level is amazing. The way that the staff has handled everything with COVID-19 is very well done. My only complaint is, as a transfer student, there are some things that I missed my first few years that those in my graduating class know that I’m unclear on."
Graduate Student,4,great on line program professors are understanding and the flexibility of the courses goes far beyond other university on line programs.  the communication from the staff is continuous and timely and the learning platform is easy to use. the IT department s 24 hours so if you are up late doing work and have system issues you have someone to call to assist you at that moment and you do not have to wait for a ticket to be addressed

Freshman,4,"I have applied to over 20 colleges, so the process was very daunting. UD was very cooperative, constantly willing to help in any way they can. Talking to them is always a pleasant experience. I am also a first-generation college student who currently doesn't have the means to attend a college with such high pay. Though UD gave me a significant amount of money towards my tuition, their housing payments are really high, which is why I am looking to outside sources for aid. I appreciate everything they have done for, but I wish they had more options for housing payments."
Alum,4,"The University of Dayton was an amazing school, both academically and socially. I highly recommend it!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Dayton has been my favorite college out of the three I have attended. The other two where Sinclar college and the University of Cincinnati. Overall this college has a very tight nit community compared to the other two. I haven't had any problems with any professors, and the college is always willing to help you out if they can. Because I am a commuter, I can't speak for the dorms and food experience but haven't heard any horror stories witch is not something I can't say for Cinncinati. If you have finances under control, I would recommend this school for Ohio."
Freshman,4,All of the teachers want you to succeed and are very open; teachers are eager to help students and they have very useful and effective office hours for extra help.  Also the atmosphere is very inviting and comfortable and the campus has amazing food!
Freshman,4,I really feel like the faculty and staff really care about my success and wellbeing. The campus is beautiful with a ton of flowers and trees planted throughout it. The campus is also interesting because of the student neighborhood and the shops and restaurants people can go to on brown street.
Senior,4,"Dayton is a true community.  I have had an amazing experience as a student there. In fact, I have been hard pressed to find anyone who has NOT loved their experience at UD.   The size of the student population is perfect , large enough to provide diversity but small enough to provide intimacy.  I have been very pleased with how involved the staff has been.  Most of my classes are taught by full professors, not grad students.  I have had had easy access to my teachers and advisors. I have particularly enjoyed the intramural sports which are very popular at UD.  Overall, I feel I have received an outstanding education."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and there is a great sense of community on campus. The teachers are inciteful, but I have noticed a common problem of professors thinking their class is the only one students are taking."
Junior,4,"My overall experience with University of Dayton is bittersweet. I would say that the education is great,  however, the financial aid department of the school could be better. The financial aid department botched up my financial aid package and now I have to worry about how I’m going to afford college. Other than that, I would say that the University of Dayton is a great school with many opportunities for it’s students."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy most of my classes. Most of the professors and staff are very kind and helpful. The financial aid office, however, is extremely unhelpful. The parties can sometimes also get out of control. Overall though, a very welcoming atmosphere."
Freshman,4,I like the feeling of community I get at the University of Dayton and how there are many opportunities to help me succeed.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy how the community at UD is very caring and open minded, making it feel as though the university cares for you as an individual and not just a generic part of a student body."
Freshman,4,I especially loved all the help from academic and financial counselors who helped me put a schedule and plan out my college experience financially.
Alum,4,"The students and staff are so welcoming and supportive. There is a very strong sense of community that is visible in every aspect of student life, from people always holding the door open, to always offering help to those who are in need. The faculty is understanding and encouraging and genuinely want to see you succeed. The food offered in the dining halls has a wide selection that includes a lot of healthy options and the meal plan options are flexible so you won't be restricted to eating at certain times. The dorms and housing buildings are nice, but the student neighborhood is the best place in the world. Most of the student houses have porches and back yards, which provide many opportunities for day drinks and having a great time."
Freshman,4,"Im going into my freshman year at Dayton and they’ve been nothing, but excellent the whole way through."
Senior,4,I really like the focus on being a well-rounded individual. I took classes like writing and history that were interesting. One of my biggest dislikes is the new President does not encompass the same community aspect as our former president did.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman who is going to attend University of Dayton in the fall, when I went on my campus visit I loved the friendly atmosphere that the campus had, and everyone was very welcome. Also, I feel that the way everything is set up for finances is very straightforward and helpful in me planning my future four years there! I am very excited to see how the University of Dayton shapes me into the person I'll be in the next few years."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at the University of Dayton, and so far I am enjoying my time here. The campus is nice and there are a lot of friendly people here. There is not much outside of school and the diversity is not that great, but it is growing."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere of the university. Obviously college is intimidating, but UD is a place where your peers care about your success and you are sure to be comfortable when learning."
Alum,4,"I loved the community at UD - everyone was willing to help! There were so many great opportunities here, it made the 4 years the best of my life. Wonderful business school teachers, structure, and mentors."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Dayton has truly become my home. The people are amazing, the professors care about their students and the material they are teaching, and the school's marianist values are encompassed in all it does. The newest president is not the best, but overall I would highly recommend this school"
Senior,4,"After four years at the University of Dayton I can say with confidence that it is a great school. The campus is breathtaking, and the professors truly want to see you learn.

The campus living situation is unique with an on-campus neighborhood. Most students live on-campus for the entire four years at the University of Dayton! Students can easily walk to class from any on-campus housing option. The size of the campus is the perfect blend between small and large. 

With a variety of majors and huge selection of on campus involvement opportunities, I have met a diverse group of life-long friends!"
Freshman,4,"At the University Of Dayton I currently live in a first year dorm and love the enperience. I am attending the University of Dayton because I got a decent scholarship but as soon as I got here, I knew I picked the right school. The University of Dayton has a very positive community and family experience. There are also so many tutoring sessions provided at Dayton, It is almost hard to flunk out. Unless you get too wrapped up in their amazing party life which is hard not to do."
Junior,4,"Dayton is a fantastic school.  Its the perfect size at about 10,000 students to where it is a big university, but small enough to get the personalized education of a small school.  The student body is very interesting and not always the best, but there are lots of amazing professors and people here."
Alum,4,"I went here for undergrad with a major in biology and a minor and psychology. I would classify this school as a moderately expensive PWI (primarily white institution), but its strong emphasis on community and Marianist Catholic values sets it apart from other colleges in the best way possible. I am gladly returning in the fall for a graduate program and anticipate 2020 graduation."
Senior,4,"Dayton is a wonderful community filled with supportive professors, students with diverse backgrounds, and numerous opportunities to try something new either on or off campus. With nearly 90% of students living on campus all four years, it is easy to make lasting, meaningful relationships."
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming and easy to make friends. Teachers tend to be very helpful. Food is not the healthiest, limited options. I feel like we pay more for than what we get. Safety is very important here and they take it very seriously."
Sophomore,4,"I am a current sophomore at UD. The community at Dayton is very friendly and welcoming, especially as the only person who came here from my high school. I feel like most professors care about my success and personal wellbeing."
Niche User,4,I've visited the University of Dayton multiple times and I continue to be impressed with the administration and facilities. The student life is incredible and very well prepared for careers. I look forward to attending the college and spending my future there.
Niche User,4,"It is a great mid-size catholic university with awesome staff. They really work toward getting students through school and into the next level, the workforce."
Freshman,4,"University of Dayton is an incredible college. The academics, professors, and campus may be excellent, but what really makes Dayton special is what happens out of school. An example is when I joined the Ud dems,  a group for democrats in the university. This allowed me to be in group with other democrats, like me. Dayton is also a very kind, welcoming school. It has a warm atmosphere with many sociable, outgoing people. Though the college is so marvelous, it has flaws. The school tries it's best to include as many different groups of people as possible; people with disabilities, Muslims and Christians, Indians and Asians, whatever it be. Though the school is not very diverse. There is a major difference in the size of White people and Caucasians.  Therefore my experience at University of Dayton is a 4 out of 5 stars."
Freshman,4,"The University of Dayton is a catholic university, but never forces religion or belief on its students. I wish that housing and board was cheaper, but they have a good system and a plethora of groups that students can join for more diversity and fun. As with any University,  there are professors that students would rather avoid, but I love a bunch of my professors in the engineering and English and philosophy departments."
Alum,4,"Attending the University of Dayton was an excellent decision in my opinion.  The environment is set up perfectly for a well rounded education, from invested and helpful professors to classmates willing and interested in collaborative learning."
Alum,4,"I received a fantastic education at the University of Dayton that prepared me for my field. Since graduating in 2012, I've never had difficulty finding a job, and I've felt competent and adequately prepared to do good work in my specified area. I would love to see the cost of attendance decrease to make it a more affordable option."
Freshman,4,"Huge party scene, campus food gets old after awhile, great basketball team, there really isn't a Walgreens or cvs close to campus so a car is a necessity"
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman but so far I've really enjoyed the UD experience. You'll never go without hearing the word ""community"" in a day. We take that really seriously here. Most of the professors I've had so far are very friendly and do care about my success. They are accessible and easy to reach via email. The social scene is really open and you're free to do whatever you want, whether that's go out or stay in. Everyone is super friendly here and always willing to give someone a hand. "
Alum,4,"I enjoyed UD a lot. The community aspect made me feel like I was at home. Everything felt right when I was there. The people were so kind and always held the door open for you. Everyone always u=invited people they did not know in to socialize. That is just how everyone at UD is, very kind and friendly."
Freshman,4,"The international student office is super helpful and it is easy to contact administrators and officials should you encounter any problems. The food in the dining halls isn't super varied but you can eat healthy if you try, and it still tastes good. Very cozy and friendly campus."
College Freshman,4,The Rec Plex is great for working out and the arena is beautiful
College Sophomore,4,"I think the academics and the student life it great. I do think the price is a lot and it is very hard to work with sometimes. The path point system is a fantastic idea but there should be more ways to get path points. Some of the housing facilities are old, gross, and need renovated."
College Sophomore,4,"They offer a wide variety of ways to get in touch with alumni that help guide students in the path they want to go, although the amount of programs available are limited."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is pretty small and there is the student escort service which is very helpful and appreciated.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is extremely welcoming and friendly. The professors are really easy to talk to and the classes are small enough that it is easy to reach out to someone in the class, including the professor."
College Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at dayton.  My favorite part about the school is the community.  Everyone looks out for each other, and it is easy to find your place.  The school is very helpful with your future career so it is nice when you can depend on the university."
College Junior,4,Parties happen most every weekend in the student neighborhoods. They are very welcoming and usually do not get too crazy. They are safe and you dont feel uncomfortable at them
College Junior,4,Nightlife is good at Dayton is does not get crazy but there is always welcoming parties to attend. If you aren't into drinking there are other options and usually campus events that are alcohol free
College Junior,4,Lots of classes avaliable but hard to get into the ones you want sometimes
College Sophomore,4,Sports are not that big at Dayton besides basketball. Nobody goes to the football games.
College Sophomore,4,I feel like after I graduate the University of Dayton I will become a more well rounded person. Most people here are happy.
College Sophomore,4,"Nobody will pressure you into it, but a lot of people engage."
College Senior,4,I will always love UD
College Freshman,4,My friends love it there
College Junior,4,For the most part the campus is very safe. There are random events from people outside the UD community that cause issues.
College Junior,4,"Had opportunities at plenty of co-op/internships within the mechanical engineering industry. Enjoyed my time there as a student, and grew immensely along the way."
College Junior,4,"Never really had issues with my housing options (Stuart, Campus South, Irving Commons, Lawnview Apartments). The housing lottery seemed to have some issues though."
College Junior,4,The school has a great community of students and faculty. Majority of the teachers come prepared for the entire school year on a class by class basis.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at the University of Dayton has not been very good. The school is small and cliquey so I feel like I'm in high school again. The campus is surrounded by a city that does not have much to do and is not very safe so you have to stay on campus and I feel like I'm trapped.  The party scene is not very fun and is very hit or miss, and sports are not a very big deal. The school is extremely expensive and honestly not worth what it is."
College Sophomore,2,"Its pretty much all white people from catholic high schools - middle to upper middle class. Christian values. I know almost zero gays which was different for me because my high school had a lot of gays. If you are gay, the guys will mock you. Don't come here. There are so many SAUDI ARABIAN foreign exchange students it is unbearable."
College Sophomore,2,You don't need to be in a frat to get into a frat party
College Sophomore,2,Courses are easy to follow but accommodate too much for non-hardworking students who would rather drink and rot away .
College Sophomore,2,"Student  body is nothing but alcoholics, stuck up snobs, or insecure posers. Do not go here if you want to make real friends or feel included in campus life. Very stuck up on who gets invited to parties and dont waste your time here"
College Sophomore,2,Poor training and sub par athletic compared to other schools
College Freshman,2,"This school used to be about having fun with everyone within the community, but recently the administration has ruined it. Now joining a fraternity/sorority is crucial to having a good time for all four years."
College Freshman,2,"This school is predominately white, with minorities but no interaction."
College Freshman,2,"This school's administration claims to be safe, but in the last three months there has been multiple robberies from locals in dayton. In addition, there has been attacks from locals on campus and most recently a girl has been threatened by knife right by the chapel and the KU dinning hall."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't like house parties, there's not a lot to do. Everyone either goes out to the student neighborhood and parties or stays in and watches Netflix, there's no in-between."
College Sophomore,2,"While I do feel very safe on campus, I also feel it is at the loss of some freedoms. For example, most residential buildings only let people who live in that building inside after 10 making it difficult to have friends over especially ones who don't attend Dayton. Also, while the streets are safe, the house parties aren't always the best since hookup culture is pretty prelevant here."
College Sophomore,2,"If it's not men's basketball, nobody goes. I went to one football game and when I showed my ID to get in, the guy at the gate had to ask a manager where the student tickets were. The marching band outnumbered the student section by easily 3:1. I didn't even know where the baseball team played until my 4th semester attending the school.  Its really sad how people rally around our basketball team despite it not being all that amazing. Sure we win the A-10 and have a couple tournament appearances here and there, but we're no Kansas or Duke or Kentucky. But the students here like to think that we are and it really gets annoying. If we win an NCAA tournament game, the riots get so bad that students have been tear gassed and the University brings in the Dayton riot unit before the game starts."
College Freshman,2,"The only reason I say it is bad is because the school has a poorly thought out registration process, that left students like me with an undesirable schedule, and professors that other students did not want to take. Class size from me is usually around 30, and the school forced me, and all engineers, to take core classes that feel useless and like a waste of my time."
College Freshman,2,"People come to Dayton to drink, a lot. If you don't like getting trashed all the time you feel very left out."
College Junior,2,"High school changed grade point system from a 4 point system to a 5 point system.  Under new system, qualified for more  academic scholarship.  School stated it was too late and then questioned if we really needed it...this was not need based, but performance based.  Denied appropriate scholarship."
College Junior,2,"Food is good but way, way over priced.  Everything is a-la-carte."
College Sophomore,2,"Because most upperclassman live in the student neighborhood, landlord options are few and far between."
College Sophomore,2,"As long as you like sandwich shops, you are good to go. There is hardly any other options within walking distance."
College Senior,2,"There is very little diversity on campus. However, those of a different ethnic background are very well respected and treated."
Recent Alumnus,2,a lot of houses are run down and too expensive for what theyre actually worth
College Sophomore,2,"It wasn't that bad when I was a freshman, but they are trying to restrain us more after all the incidents from 2012-13."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never lived in an off-campus or landlord facility, but my brother did his junior year and had some difficulty with the landlord.  The University essentially holds a monopoly over the housing in the surrounding neighborhoods, but in my opinion that is what makes UD unique and forms the sense of community that we are known for!"
College Freshman,2,"While there is a large international population, they seem to be isolated from the rest of campus. Other than that I would say 90 percent of the population are upper middle class Caucasian. Almost exclusively catholic or Christian not including those without religious belief. "
College Freshman,2,"Coming from Chicago, there are only expensive busses and flights. Ride sharing is the way to go but sometimes that can be a pain. "
College Freshman,2,Sometimes I'm not sure that they even exist. 
College Senior,2,The university owns the majority of the houses around campus but there are a few landlords who own houses in the student neighborhood.  Rent is expensive because they have a monopoly
College Freshman,2,I do not like the cold weather.
College Freshman,2,Internet is barely usable. have to be plugged into the eternet port to use.
College Sophomore,2,This city of Dayton is almost the complete opposite of the University of Dayton. I live close to Dayton so after I graduate I plan on staying the the Greater Dayton area but not necessarily in the city of Dayton itself.
College Sophomore,2,The permits are outrageously expensive and the lots are kind of far from classes and from apartments/dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"Public transportation is okay. The times are sometimes difficult to adjust to, so I tend to not use it. "
College Sophomore,2,"Scholarships are okay and I got enough to pay for my academics, but I have no money left to pay for housing for next year. They do not provide scholarships for that."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no computer labs on campus, while you can get a computer at the library. The speed of the wireless network is not as good as it could be. Also for the wireless every time you want to use Wifi you have to log on which gets pretty annoying. Cost of printing is pretty average, I Believe copies are 10 cense and I am not sure about printing but around there. Finding printers and copiers is pretty challenging, there are some in the library and one of the dinning halls lobby, so it is pretty inconvenient"
College Junior,2,"UD has the Red Scare, which is the name of our student section. The Red Scare is great, but only during basketball season. Our men's and women's soccer teams are pretty good, but our football team is a joke and the only sport anybody really bothers to watch is the basketball team. Athletes at UD are often pretty unnoticed. People support IM teams more than the actual football team."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's There If That's Your Thing – There are some fraternities and sororities. I was not in one. Since almost everyone lives in a house their junior and senior year, living in a frat house isn't much of an incentive. There are so many clubs and activities and UD isn't a huge school, most people quickly find a great group of friends and don't feel the need to join Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,"Few Options – The transportation kind of sucks. The only good part is that since Dayton has a relatively small campus, busses aren't needed to help us get to classes or around campus. However, if you don't have a car it's really hard to leave campus. The only options you really have are cabbing it which not only takes forever, but is expensive, or using the sketchy local Dayton bus. Also, Dayton doesn't offer any shuttles to and from the airport which is a big pain for those who fly because a cab to the airport is at least $40."
College Freshman,2,DONT Get Caught – UD wants your money and they will get it everyday they can
College Freshman,2,"UD Is Out to Get Your $$ – No, UD Cops are ass****s. All because of a smashed bottle I had over 300 dollars worth of tickets and the university handed it over to the city and I had to appear infront of a judge. Do not get caught."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at The Unvirsity of Dayton is prevelant, but not heavily emphasized. Whether you join a sorority or fraternity, it won't make who you are. Yes, they have special events and parties, but by the end of the night, anyone is welcome to come. Greek life does not determine your status, but you do meet alot of people!"
College Freshman,2,"Nothing Is Easy – Our computers are not macs and we are asked to constantly sign in for the internet, something called ""cisconet."" It gets extremely annoying and I find myself hesitant to close my computer because as soon as I open it again, it will ask me to log in again. Sometimes it will ask me to sign in again regardless of whether or not I shut my computer. Also, the printing process is very confusing and is not a one-step process. Therefore, it can be frustrating. Out internet connection is very fuzzy sometimes and skype quality is terrible. Having a personal computer and a personal printer would DEFINITELY be beneficial."
Alum,1,"Students were told to come back to campus all summer because they were going to be able to go back to class. The night before school started, administration went to all virtual classes .  They treat COVID like it’s a behavioral issue that the students can control, rather than a contagious disease ."
Freshman,1,"Not at all supportive to international students , as we had been asked to move out of on campus housing in March , UD promised us to that it would credit us with the housing and meal plan money that we could use . However as I decided to not continue my journey in ud , UD is refusing on reimbursing me with the credits of housing and meal plan due . How is it fare on my side, neither could I get the value of the money I paid nor am I getting it back . An unexpected action from UD leading the whole morale of the Catholic university (the non-profit organization ) down in the eyes of international student ."
Graduate Student,1,"Worst place ever 
Discrimination in its worst way 
There mission is to steal student money without offering any knowledge 
I don't recommend it"
Freshman,1,"the social scene is extremely cliquey&sickeningly fake. in my experience the academic advisors blow off students they don’t think will stay at UD.the school has a policy that you can’t take more than 4 finals in a day; I scheduled to take my bio final at a different time and my professor forget and decided to force me to take it the original day or I’d fail,violating university policy.the chem program is on probation.my advisor gave me the wrong code I needed to register for my classes and I got shut out of a class that I needed for my major,so im behind. Also I went to the health center with a cold and LITERALLY walked out with antidepressants. The doctor asked me how college was doing and I was honest. After ONE APPOINTMENT I was prescribed sertaline. she didn’t verify any of my medical history.The housing process is terrible, to move out of a dorm room you have to attend seminars about religion and social justice to gain points. Worst year of my life."
College Sophomore,1,"The new housing system ""Aviate"" just sucks. Students are forced to attend lectures outside of class to receive points. The more points you have, the better the house. This creates a competitive environment and away from the Dayton Community feel. It makes no sense and a to of students are completely pissed off with the housing system often leaving with no housing and forcing to sue. GET RID OF AVIATE. GO BACK TO THE LOTTERY SYSTEM."
College Sophomore,1,"No point in trying to make friends here when you are automatically excluded and left out of the scene here. People may even question whether or not you go to school and are very selfish , though will still fake a smile constantly and unecessarily feign niceness, to the point where it is uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,1,students have been transported by ambulance after drinking too much. Pretty bad here IMO. Escapism is a tough and real issue among this school
College Sophomore,1,"Not worth living on campus, housing sucks and students are very stuck up. Do not waste your time"
College Sophomore,1,"Pointless, uninteresting and only select those who come from the same background as themselves. worthless"
College Freshman,1,Very strict. Do not mess around or you will be kicked out/suspended. very strict.
College Sophomore,1,Mostly everyone here is a white Catholic or an international student.
College Sophomore,1,"Beer flows through the streets on the weekends. A lot of kids drink in Thursday and Friday classes. There are very few parties that don't involve beer and age is not a problem to people throwing parties. High schoolers could probably get alcohol on this campus, that's how accessible it is."
College Sophomore,1,"Freshmen dorms are tiny. We always joked that living in the dorms was like sticking two people in a shoebox. Sophomore and upperclassmen housing gets better with space but it's nothing to brag about.  Now the real housing issue, is the housing points system. Instead of basing your housing assignment off of your GPA or disciplinary record, they base it off of the number of university sponsored events you attend that they deem eligible. And it's always events that not a lot of people would go to such as drinking seminars or political/social justice speeches.  The system is very broken and is just a way for the University to further keep you under their thumb."
College Sophomore,1,"Simply put, Dayton is not worth the money at all. It has nothing special that separates it from Ohio's public schools and I feel actually falls short in some categories compared to an Ohio State, Cincinnati, Miami, etc. For starters, the housing system is atrocious. While the university encourages involvement in student groups, they also base your housing priority off of how many ""point eligible"" events that you attend. These are usually at inconvenient times and coincide with other student groups. 

Next, classes are very difficult to get into. I had to wait a year to take my second English class, simply because all of the sections were full, even when I scheduled as soon as possible. I also am now behind a semester because two classes I needed to take were both offered at the same time and only had that one section for each class.

Campus itself feels fairly safe, but the some of the surrounding areas are fairly crime ridden with the exception of Oakwood. There isn't much to do around campus and you feel as through you are stuck on campus, especially for freshmen and students without cars. My friends and I usually go to Columbus or Cincinnati for the weekends because the city of Dayton and the campus life is just that boring. Unless that is you like to drown your liver in cheap beer several times a day since that is all that happens, every single weekend.

The University internet is very slow with residential buildings not even meeting broadband speeds as set by the FCC. The WiFi is very unreliable and I find myself using a lot of my phone data since WiFi is not always an option.  The online homework system, Isidore, is very clunky and not the most user friendly piece of software.

At the end of it all, I find myself counting down the days until I can leave the University of Dayton. If I had to do it all over again, I would have never even applied to UD."
College Junior,1,Very poor process for assigning housing.  Underclassmen are frequently prioritized over seniors in housing selection.  System for assigning housing is an unfair and consumes significant resources.  Assigning housing basis credits earned and GPA would use much less resources and be much more fair to students.
Recent Alumnus,1,public safety does not do the job they should be doing. they take things too far and get away with it. cause harm to students and students do not feel like public safety is their for their safety.
Recent Alumnus,1,UD needs to work on increasing diversity.
College Sophomore,1,"We have Greek life but it is nothing special. Its not like other schools where if you dont join you will be left out. Plus its not worth paying all the money for things you can find on campus without paying for. If you want to meet new people just look around you, you dont need to pay funds just to meet people or be part of something that will be worthless after college."
College Freshman,1,"Commuters have to park 10 minutes away from campus until at least 4 except for weekends and university holidays. And the trek is uphill, not fun in the winter or summer. Breaks aren't completely university holidays, so the commuter lot is still needed when visiting campus for work or otherwise. At least during Christmas Break and summer there is a small parking lot behind one of the student apartment complexes that is quite a bit closer to campus."
College Junior,1,The housing isn't all that great. I could live better in my bathroom in most cases.

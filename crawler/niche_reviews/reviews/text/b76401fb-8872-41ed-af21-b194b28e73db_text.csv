Freshman,5,I have taken one online class this semester and the professor is very organized and is always willing to help us understand the topic if you don't understand the lecture. Its also nice because I have been able to work at my own pace without drowning in work.
Sophomore,5,The community is kind and welcoming. The college has excellent academics and is more diverse than what many people expect. I highly reccomend!
Freshman,5,Calvin was a great school. It has great academics and student life opportunities. It is a strong faith community and is pretty diverse.
Sophomore,5,"Great student community and excellent tuition. Amazing professors who are genuinely interested in your growth as a student. Many opportunities for growth including study abroad options, internships, student research etc.c"
Sophomore,5,"Had to switch online due to the coronavirus. Teachers were prope trained for this switch and it was a generally smooth transition. The quality of teaching stayed the same and the faculty were very supporting. Overall, a great experience"
Alum,5,"I graduated from Calvin two years ago. After I attended grad school in Boston, I can deeply feel that I have a higher competency compared to other classmates who graduated from other universities. Calvin has a very excellent academic level and high quality of career training that prepared me step into the world, and it has a great community with great professors and staffs that support students in many ways during the important four years of college life."
Alum,5,I didn't take any online course during my years at Calvin. But I heard they are good as professors are very delicately helpful to students.
Freshman,5,"The first online course I took, I just thought that the work for the course could be put off until I had time to do the work. In doing this, I got very far behind. It took me awhile to catch back up with the assignments and I promised myself that I would never let that happen again. The thing I love about Calvin is how professors encourage students, without professors I would have catchup with my online classes and still pass. The main Lesson learned in online classes is that don’t procrastinate."
Freshman,5,"My freshman year experience at Calvin have been awesome and great, Professors , staff and school employees are always there to help. In the classes I took all the professors were amazing, they made sure everything was understood in class and outside the classroom, I wish Calvin would improve on the food side, since there isn’t a lot of options"
Freshman,5,"I love the warm christian community. Everyone treats one another as their own brother or sister, we're one big family. The church and bible study on. campus makes it easy to grown in ones faith especially how every hall has a private room where you can pray which helps a lot."
Freshman,5,"Calvin has been a fantastic experience so far, and what sets it apart is--truly--the people. When I visited Calvin during my senior year of high school, despite being determined to hate it, I was shocked at how kind and welcoming everybody I met was. (I had visited a lot of other colleges, and none of them could compare.) As a student here, the same holds true; I was able to make good friends very quickly. So if you're unsure about Calvin, please come visit!!
I was a 4.0 student in high school, and just by looking at Calvin's rankings, I was somewhat worried about its academic quality. But my classes so far have been great. Professors are knowledgeable, understanding, and genuinely helpful, far beyond what could be expected. I can especially recommend Calvin's new Honors program, which is a small group of students who take interdisciplinary classes together. It's challenging and engaging, and it forces you to think deeply about important issues."
Niche User,5,Calvin University is a great school! They have amazing sports facilities and academic resources and Grand Rapids is such a fun little city! The moment that I stepped on campus I could envision myself at that school!
Niche User,5,"I have had a great experience at Calvin University. All the professors I have had the privilege of being taught by are extremely intelligent. They are all willing to answer any questions you may have about the subject material or about life in general. Many of them love connecting with students and getting to know them on a deeper level. I have also been impressed with the quality of Calvin's academics. I have been thoroughly challenged in every way, particularly in the STEM field."
Freshman,5,"The professors are great. Mine have been very helpful, and they want to get to know you. The campus food gets old pretty quickly."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Calvin and so far I love it! Everyone, students, professors, staff, are all incredibly friendly. The campus is beautiful, full of lawns, trees, and cute squirrels. What I love most is Calvin's intentional faith community. The variety of chapels, individual dorm bible studies and worship, and the team of committed chaplains and pastors make deepening my faith easy."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the community at Calvin College and the friendships I made here. I feel challenged in my classes, and my Professors push me to be the best student I can be."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Calvin. Although it isn't the most diverse school and they could use some updates in their dorms, it is extremely challenging academically and has a good reputation. Calvin has so much for students--if you have an interest, there's probably a club for it and if not, they are happy to have you start one. They plan a lot of activities that students can participate in as well."
Sophomore,5,"A wonderful Christian community aimed at developing the potentials of students. A school aimed at helping individuals live wholeheartedly and contribute positively and sincerely to the society. Calvin is a place to find your place in the world and your role as a Child of God. It's a College with Professors who really care about you and are aimed at improving you and developing oneself and one's potential to glorify God.
Calvin is endowed with multicultural diversity and a peaceful and environmentally friendly environment, with various world class courses and a remarkable classroom experience. I believe the non-toxicity of the classrooms, the energy and enthusiasm showed is one of Calvin's greatest strengths. 
Calvin is an awesome place to be!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I have greatly enjoyed the character of Calvin College. Most faculty members work hard to make Calvin a welcoming, Christ-centered, and environmentally friendly place. I have met great friends here and have appreciated the recreational activities offered."
Niche User,5,"While I have not taken classes there yet, the campus is beautiful and everyone I know who went to Calvin is extremely happy with the education they recieved."

Niche User,5,I like Calvin because it is very welcoming! The professors here are really nice and the faculty here is amazing!
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have loved my experience at Calvin! Through integrating Christian beliefs in classes, I have grown in my faith and continue to learn more with each class. Furthermore, the professors truly want you to succeed and take the initiative to connect with their students in and out of class."
Sophomore,5,"Calvin is such a great place to learn and grow. The campus is small enough to bring new people together but also big enough to always be meeting new friends. Also, the professors are so great. They are always eager to help you do your best in their class."
Junior,5,Calvin’s Community is amazing. It becomes him. You feel safe and loved. The location is not only beautiful but inspiring. The professors are considerate and truest invested in their students.
Junior,5,Calvin is a very close knit community where it's easy to gt the support you need to excel. I would recommend it.
Freshman,5,"I like Calvin's campus, it is very well maintained and beautiful. I really like that the classes are small and the professors take the time to know each student's name. The professors are excellent and are excited about what they are teaching. I would really like Calvin to have a bigger dance program. However, their Dance Guild club, which is run completely by students,  is really fun and well organized."
Freshman,5,"I am so thankful that I chose to go to Calvin. I absolutely love it here. The staff are incredible and always take the time to ask you how you are doing. They care about you as a person, not just a student. Some professors even invite international students to their homes for holidays such as Thanksgiving and Easter. The community here is also superb. I have felt so welcomed since coming to Calvin, which was something that I was worried about before going to college. The size of the school is perfect for me, as it is not too large and not too small. Overall, I am so thrilled to be here."
Niche User,5,Calvin College prepares their students for the future. Many amazing professors and staff to help you with any problem!
Alum,5,"I am a Calvin alum, donor, and (hopefully) future parent.  Calvin holds a dear and special place in my heart.  I learned and grew so much during my time at Calvin.  Calvin wrestles with big and challenging issues and prepares young people to live profoundly world changing lives in response to the love of Jesus Christ.  There is not enough space here to even get started on how wonderful Calvin is."
Sophomore,5,Calvin College is setting me up for success.  I am getting a wholesome academic experience that is teaching me to be a better steward of my faith and knowledge.
Freshman,5,"Great atmosphere, small town kind of college. I am involved in the Calvin athletics and it has yet to let me down. The classes defiantly have a rigorous curriculum, and the professors are hard but I know im getting a great education."
Freshman,5,I love my experience at Calvin College. They welcomed me very comfortably and the college is very diverse. I loved my first year here and all the professors are very kind and engaging.
Freshman,5,"Calvin College is truly the place to be. Although as young freshman, I was terrified. Truly traumatized to start this new chapter in my life. When I got there, the students were truly so kind. They helped me feel at home, gave me directions, did not make me feel small, and were so loving. Within the first months of college, I have met some of the most kindhearted, open, generous people who I have become close too. The teachers are so respectable, and want to help me understand to better my future and schooling. Calvin has so many activities, that there is always something to so, from rock climbing, to the plays or dance gill or just to have a spa night with your floor. It truly has been a blessing, and I have grown from my small faith that now blossoms. I cannot wait for what Calvin has in store for me throughout the months of my first year and later to come."
Freshman,5,"Excellent school with a great community. Calvin has lots of academic opportunity, and is a great place for everyone to learn. Rigorous academics and a great social atmosphere, this school provides an excellent and challenging college experience."
Sophomore,5,I love life and studying here. It's hard and busy at times but the environment and the amazing relationships help me get through.
Freshman,5,"So far, I have no regrets at Calvin. I love the students and the professors. Indeed, the school is aimed at helping every student to succeed in life. I believe Calvin is the best place to prepare you for life after college. Calvin is also the best when it comes to spiritual communication with God and your entire spiritual well being.
I love their summons,and it makes me always remember that God is truly a living being."
Alum,5,Calvin College helped me to develop a concrete world view to embrace and live out my vocational calling as a nurse.  Calvin gave me the opportunity to question my beliefs and lay the foundation for me to become a functioning and contributing member of society.
Sophomore,5,"It's fantastic. Calvin College is a place where students can learn more about themselves, their God, and their community while studying their major and being trained to think deeply, act justly, and live fully. I was nervous going into freshman year but the community on campus is very positive and loving. The academics are fantastic, with some of the professors coming from schools like Harvard and Yale. They challenge the students, but in a way that's more ""I know you can handle this tough stuff"" and less ""suck it up"". The core requirements (gen eds) can be annoying for people who already know exactly what career they want to get into but a lot of those classes end up being really interesting because, again, the professors are great and so is the overall community. In summary, Calvin College is a great school for people who want to make a difference in the world for God's glory and get to know a lot of other people while getting a high quality education."
Alum,5,"I loved my 4 years at Calvin. I grew so much in academics, friendships, faith, and in myself as a well-rounded person. Professors are extremely approachable and helpful, location is amazing in Grand Rapids with a lot to offer, facilities are well-maintained. There is a great community spirit when it comes to sports and rivalries. Downsides would be cost of attendance."
Freshman,5,"Calvin college does a great job at connecting students with teachers and finding a good match for dorm life, while also providing a safe environment for their students!"
Sophomore,5,"Calvin is wonderful. From the moment I first visited I felt at peace and at home.  I met great friends, always felt safe, and grew not only in spiritual growth, but also in my self. I would highly recommend Calvin College to anyone who is interested in finding God, to grow in faith, and to have an education and a community that will help you in your vocation."
Freshman,5,"I've attended Calvin for a semester now and appreciate the challenge in the classroom and unity  across campus. The academic workload is challenging and requires many hours to complete all assignments and study, however, the content we are expected to learn expands our worldview, as it is a Liberal Arts college. 
The professors are engaging and show that they want their students to succeed by making themselves available and approachable in and out of the classroom. 
Student life is very unity-orientated. In the dorms, at sporting events, and other special events Calvin puts on, I have never felt a great divide between different groups of students. Everyone is accepting, encouraging, and helpful."
Senior,5,"I love my school. I have worked in different capacities at my school (food service, resident assistant, etc.) and I have always had good experiences with it. I love how Calvin has caring professors, incorporates faith into learning, and cares about society and social justice issues."
Freshman,5,"So far I like nearly everything about the school. It is a predominantly white school, which isn't surprising given it's location. One thing I dislike is that Calvin is so pro-diversity (which is great) that they come off as being almost anti-white (which isn't good). That's pretty much it for my complaints though."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Calvin, and so far it has been the best time of my life.  I enjoy my classes and professors, and have made a lot of friends already.  "
College Sophomore,5,There are many options and classes you may choose from which is incredible.
College Sophomore,5,"Calvin has grown to be a great college and when you have a degree from Calvin, you are recognized and respected."
College Sophomore,5,"The fans are fantastic on attending the games in large groups and cheering athletes on. However, cheering when our team is losing is difficult at times."
College Junior,5,Students at Calvin show a great deal of support
College Junior,5,I love the community here. Everyone is so friendly and working toward the goal of serving God's kingdom.
College Freshman,5,"Along with a great variety of on campus jobs the school also hosts a website where local jobs can post looking for Calvin students. I have already begun the application process for many babysitting and restaurant jobs, and plan to start applying on campus after orientation. I believe I will be able to find a worth while job while in school, and that Calvin will prepare me for an amazing job after graduation."
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. I've not heard of any crime. As a small Christian liberal arts school, violence isn't really something I would expect of the faculty or the student body."
College Freshman,5,"When I review my actual logical reasons for choosing Calvin over my other top choice (even though it's really because I'm just in love with Calvin), housing was definatley a big factor. The dorms, while obviously tiny, are reasonably spacious; bathrooms are set up suite style, sophmores usually sharing a bathroom with freshman, decent sized, and with great cabinet/closet space; hang out areas are plentiful and really nice; RAs are awesome; just the whole dorm experience is amazing."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, I wouldn't rate anything about this college as anything but the best. However, their athletic department seems really appealing. I love that there is more of a focus on basketball and soccer more so than football. I like the uniqueness of the sports community. I've seen and heard great things about the intramurals, and there's even low commitment weekly soccer games- perfect for someone not entirely focused on sports like myself."
College Freshman,5,"While I have not yet begun my first term at Calvin, I am entirely head-over-heels in love. Having toured campus and stayed over night with a current student I am confident that Calvin is the best possible college for me to attend. It's diverse, has a great community, offers multiple opportunities to bond with professors and students, had amazing professors, and is just absolutley incredible."
College Freshman,5,A great school with lots of opportunities. Grand rapids is an awesome city with plenty to do. The academics will challenge you but will prepare you.
College Freshman,5,Easy to get connected and get a job out of school
College Freshman,5,"Very safe, nothing to worry about on campus"
College Freshman,5,Great athletics with some of the top teams in division 3.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Calvin has been awesome so far. All of the people here are super nice and build the strong community here. Professors know you by name and are always willing to help you when you don't understand something. With COVID 19 most of the classes have been in person and they try their best to keep college as normal as possible. Food could be better but we are also living in a pandemic currently, so can't really complain."
Sophomore,4,"My professors were flexible and understanding during the pandemic. We have the option to attend classes online if we are experiencing symptoms. Overall, Calvin does a great job of still providing an excellent education even though it is online."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the atmosphere. The campus is a good size, pretty, and cozy, but still right in busy Grand Rapids. People know each other so it is nice to walk to class and see people chatting and hanging out. But, I do wish that the dorms were nicer."
Freshman,4,"Online class was pretty good and the teaches were helpful and I leaned a lot online.  Although taking online classes is difficult, the teachers were very helpful."
Sophomore,4,The professors are all very helpful and not only to they help with any questions you may have regarding the schoolwork they will go out of their way to try and get to know you as a person which I thought was very nice.
Junior,4,During the Covid-19 pandemic all of my classes transitioned to being exclusively online. The academic experience was good. My professors were very willing to meet via phone calls or zoom and were available to answer questions and be as helpful as possible. Overall it was a good experience.
Junior,4,"Calvin has really great professors who typically care about helping as much as possible and are willing to help. The work load can be a lot. Besides academics, the social life is alright. Since it is so small, cliques easily form which can be suffocating... but it's still a great option for small class sizes and great opportunities to meet some amazing people"
Freshman,4,"I love the academics here at Calvin. The professors genuinely care about us and the academics requirements are relatively high motivating the students to achieve higher standards. I also love the Christian environment here. Going to the chapel before class and attending Sunday night services (Loft) with student-led worship are my favorite things to do. I have made amazing friends here from all over the world and it is such a valuable experience. It is so mind-opening, makes me step out of my comfort zone, and motivates me to work towards who I want to become. I love Calvin. :)"
Senior,4,"The professors are the biggest draw for Calvin College, they truly care about their students and are invested in seeing them succeed. The downside to this school is that some classes are needlessly challenging, strictly based on the professor."
Senior,4,The liberal arts education equips you with a outlook on life that money can't buy. I feel well rounded and am thankful for the learning experience.
Alum,4,"Calvin College was a wonderful experience for me. I grew in my christianity, my political knowledge, my education, and my friendships. Christianity-wise, there were always god-fearing people and professors around who you could feel comfortable talking with. Also learning more perspectives that Christians take within the realms of evolution, marriage, absolute truth, etc. Politically, I would say most students were on the left, but there were clubs for republicans and democrats. Educationally, I was challenged. I could not slack off here. I also made the best friends here who I value and think are wonderful people. Overall a great school."
Sophomore,4,"Yes, it's a Christian, Liberal Arts college. However that's not all there is to it. It’s a small campus, so you’ll probably run into someone more than once. There are many student body organizations that help you acclimated your first year. It's located near Grand Rapids, and there is plenty to do there. Will there be nothing to do sometimes? Yes. There will, especially if you aren't a very social person or sports fan, but hey, if you like the solo life, I won't criticize. The food, oh man. It will be good or bad. If that doesn't suit you, then there are multiple restaurants and pizza places nearby. The average classroom size is about 28 people. The professors are pretty good. Some will put you to sleep, but all have pretty flexible office hours so meeting them for questions or just a cup of coffee, or tea, isn't much of a problem. Athletics are solid. If you're looking for a small college with a Christian foundation, then look into it. It might be for you."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my first year at Calvin College and I love it there! However, it is facing low enrollment rates at the moment, which makes it difficult for the college to be able to grow (especially because they seem to be in a bit of a financial pickle at the moment). I love Calvin, but the administration seldom communicates with the students before they make executive decisions that directly impact the student body (such as cutting the Student Activities Organization that organizes concerts and on-campus movies throughout the semesters). 

However, that being said, Calvin offers a wonderful Christ-centered community that makes an effort to discuss topics such as racism and discrimination with a mindset of loving everyone in God's Kingdom. The people and professors at Calvin are also pretty great (for the most part)--the students at Calvin are friendlier than students at any other college that I've visited."
Niche User,4,Calvin is an all around great school! I love the amount of diversity because they tend to have a good amount of exchange students. I found that the professors are super helpful whenever you need a little extra help.
Sophomore,4,"I have had a very positive experience with Calvin College. As a nursing major, I have taken many science classes on campus here, and I love being taught the concepts from a Christian based standpoint. 

Additionally, the professors are amazing. They want to see you succeed and they are willing to do anything they can to help you succeed."
Alum,4,Calvin has great academic programs. The professors are passionate about their job and want their students to succeed. The campus is beautiful and there are always plenty of things to be involved in.
Sophomore,4,"Calvin College is a great place to be. There are plenty of opportunities for students to get involved on campus through joining clubs, playing intramural sports, doing dorm activities along with other events. Calvin tends to be a Christian bubble, which has its good and bad sides. Calvin is a place where Christians can grow in their faith and can be challenged--especially those of different denominational backgrounds. The faculty at Calvin is very helpful and wants each student to reach his or her full potential."
Freshman,4,"Professors are very proficient in their field, and are ready to help when asked. Despite the somewhat large sticker price, they do offer a variety of scholarships if you apply."
Freshman,4,I loved how everyone at Calvin was so welcoming. The community life at Calvin is what really drew me in.
Alum,4,"I recently graduated Calvin College and loved my experience. I loved how much my professors showed they cared about their students (Especially once you were in your core group/major). I was an RA at Calvin for 2.5 years during my sophomore, junior, and the second half of my senior year. Just like any school there are things that can be run better, communicated more clearly, and choices that the administration makes that could have gone better. Just like any institution, it has to be run like a business. Debts, money, costs, and marketability are all constantly being examined and altered for the betterment of Calvin.  But, in the end, Calvin has it's students in mind in all of it's decisions whether we (the students) may like them or not. Calvin, although a social bubble in some ways, was an excellent way to see the world through different eyes via my peers, employers, and professors. I loved Calvin. Period. I couldn't have picked a better school."
Sophomore,4,"All in all, happy with Calvin.  I like being involved in dorm leadership and look forward to returning in the fall if I can secure some funding.  It's expensive for what we are getting in the dorms and in the food service department, but I like the other students and for the most part, have had some good professors."
Junior,4,"I really liked the academics, the students, and the faculty. The only difficult thing was the tuition being raised drastically annually and the difficulty of fitting in as a minority."
Freshman,4,"I chose Calvin because it has a dynamic close knit Christian community and small class sizes that would help me to develop my intellectual abilities and personal growth. Calvin college has dedicated professors who do not weed out on any student regardless for race, colour or gender. They make you their priority and make sure you succeed. Calvin has a beautiful campus and friendly students. Calvin college also offer semester interim programs in countries like Ghana, Peru, Germany, Puerto Rico and many others. Calvin college has second best undergraduate teaching ranked by US news and world report. Calvin college is ranked as number 1 regional college Midwest. Calvin is located at the third safest college town in America, Grand Rapid, Calvin College also has a wide variety of scholarships and offers financial aid as well."
Sophomore,4,"Your Calvin experience all comes down to perspective. Great professors and challenging classes foster a pretty positive environment for learning. Interim classes may seem like a waste of time, but pick something that interests you and you'll be surprised. Don't slack, work hard, and you'll be fine. Dorm housing is nothing to complain about, being so close to academic buildings. There are solid people at Calvin, but it takes a while to figure social out. If you're not from the area, Dutch, 6""2, or wear shorts in winter, it may be a little jarring, but there are great people out there. This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble. If you're from out of the country and are used to nightlife, it's painful to watch. Overall, Calvin's a good place that gives you space to develop as a person. Students listen and learn from each other, regardless of opinion."
Junior,4,Calvin College is an excellent school for those who want to be challenged academically and who desire to engage the world from a Christian perspective. The professors at Calvin are genuinely interested in seeing their students excel and thrive in their fields of study. This faculty mindset leads to excellent teaching and mentoring for all students who put forth their best effort.
Sophomore,4,Really enjoyed my time here so far. The profs are great but the campus life is lacking. There are also a lot of rules about open house hours which can be frustrating.
Junior,4,Most students are fairly friendly in class. People are not afraid of leaving their things behind in the library. Professors are extremely understanding in the case of emergencies!
Freshman,4,"I love the professors. They actually want their students to succeed and sometimes would give personal time to connect with their students. it's kinda hard to get around without a car though, and public transport aren't the best."
Freshman,4,"Calvin is amazing school that really cares for all of its students! I have loved it so far, and have found it to be extremely welcoming and academically rewarding."
Junior,4,"Integrating multiple disciplines and allowing themes to cross over subjects is a great learning perk. I love my professors, they are very personable and ready to help. Calvin prepares their students to be knowledgeable citizens of the United States and of the world. Professors allow students to express their faith, no one pushes Christianity upon you. The dining halls could be improved, the food isn't great."
Freshman,4,Great School. All professors I have had are passionate and very involved in their christian faith and integrate it into classes. Most everyone is friendly and the Student faculty (RA's and such) are amazing at fostering good communities in dorms and classes. I've had a few problems with professors and technology but i'm pretty sure that'll happen anywhere
Sophomore,4,Calvin College is a fine school for anyone. Whether you're a Christian or not Calvin accepts accepts everyone here. The campus is very safe and welcoming with events just about every weekend. There is so much to do and the Professors are all very involved and invested in their students.
Freshman,4,I love the efforts of the Multicultural Student Development Office. The  advisers in Academic Services really helped me a lot. The students take academics seriously and respect their professors. I like that it has a small population. I just wish there were more diversity
Senior,4,"Being here for 3+ years already, I have been loving the area and had gotten to know it way more than I wanted to know. There is a nature preserve that becomes so beautiful during the fall so that place is a must-visit during the season. The fieldhouse which is the sports area for the college is very well-built. Overall, this is a good college for Christian students. "
Sophomore,4,"Calvin is a great place with great people and a beautiful campus. I love how willing the professors are to help you, and how there are lots of resources available if you're struggling in anything. The one thing I would like to see changed is the ""Calvin Bubble,"" which is all too real. Most of the people in Calvin are really sheltered -- perhaps even more so than the international students who come in to study. I want to see them become more open-minded and willing to try new things. "
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the Christian character of this college. The Campus is amazing. Dorms are a little old but work well as far as dorms go. There are two on campus cafeterias, one which just recently was renovated. The variety of food is good."
College Sophomore,4,"It is taken seriously, there are courses online for this."
College Sophomore,4,I love how the professors know who you are and what you are like and are concerned about you. The size of the classes are incredible and you feel very persona with everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"In the beginning of the semester, we were required to watch and answer questions on sexual and domestic violence and how to help when witnessing."
College Freshman,4,I didn't attend Calvin College yet but I hear that ii is a great school.
College Sophomore,4,Students from Calvin are very accepted in all fields.
College Sophomore,4,"Many, many students become involved in many intramural sports."
College Junior,4,Dorm life is what helps build the community most
College Junior,4,Calvin give students a great sense of community.
College Junior,4,The professors are very knowledgable and engaging.
College Junior,4,There are many job fairs and websites like Calvin Handshake for connecting with employers.
College Junior,4,There are campus safety people that drive throughout campus 24/7
College Junior,4,The dorms are nice and there is a nice amount of space. Very close to classes and dining halls.
College Junior,4,I run on the cross country and track teams and the coaches and equipment rooms are great! A lot of people attend the soccer and volleyball games-- especially when it's Calvin against Hope.
College Freshman,4,Living in the dorms is fun and there was great community on our floor. Always stuff to do.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety works hard to ensure a safe atmosphere, and I generally have felt safe around campus alone at most hours of the night."
College Sophomore,4,"For me as a nursing major, I believe I'll have very good prospects after graduation for a job."
College Sophomore,4,"School spirit is present generally with big rivalries, and there's decent support at athletic events. Sometimes for non-athletes the facilities are not available and not as well kept."
College Sophomore,4,"Since Calvin does not have a football team, all other sports are loved and attended equally!"
College Student,4,Living on campus is like instantly joining our own friendly community.
College Sophomore,4,"The average class size is about 23. My freshman year I had a math class with 8 students. This is really helpful for students like me who need more one on one help from professors. One thing I wish was different was the style of the classrooms. The school is slowing turning some classes over into more modern styles, but there are still many classrooms with chalkboards."
College Sophomore,4,"We have so many options for intramural sports of all kinds. There's climbing, dance, kayaking, badminton, racket ball, then all your typical sports. The gym facilities are amazing. They are not only a place to get a work out, but there are places to study by a fire as well."
College Sophomore,4,"I would pick a school where it's easier to get off campus. There are a lot of great places to study and hangout, but sometimes it's nice to go out into the ""real"" world."
College Sophomore,4,Most are great. Could give more leeway to what a postBA student needs to take.
College Sophomore,4,They have an active career center and will alert students to job opportunities in their field.
Sophomore,2,My profs were not very understanding  with the switch from remote to Online learning due to covid and I was doing more work than usual. My profs were also not willing to compromise with time zone differences.
Niche User,2,"Went there on a campus visit with my child--at meal time, all of the families of color dine alone. Of all the concerns that parents have for their students when leaving them on a college campus, being ostracized should not be one of them."
College Sophomore,2,So very hard to get enough sleep. Most exciting events happen way too late at night.
College Freshman,2,"Calvin College does not have Greek life, so I tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability."
College Sophomore,2,"Although Calvin is a very encouraging and comfortable environment, many aspects of this college suck.  The nightlife is awful and most people go home for the weekend because they live close by to Calvin.  The people here are very cliquey and judgmental.  Also the school is really strict on drinking, drugs, and breaking open house hours.  From my honest opinion, even coming from a private Christian school, Calvin is like another 4 more years of high school.  You aren't given the freedom a college student should have.  I find it hard to branch out and meet new people because the only events that actually go on are boring and ""floor dates"".  Not to mention the only people who are actually involved in those events are socially awkward and a majority of their conversations consist of what their devotions were on or how they are working on their relationship with God.  I have nothing against talking about God and expressing my Christianity but it becomes overwhelming when you're constantly surrounded by it.  All in all, Calvin has some good qualities don't get me wrong, but this is definitely not the place for everyone.  And by everyone, I actually mean Calvin is not enjoyable for the majority of people."
College Senior,2,"I feel like Calvin really only helps people with internships in the business department.  If you aren't in that department, you're on your own.  Even career services doesn't have good resources for people not in business."
College Senior,2,"The school doesn't really help at all with students finding off campus housing.  It's super hard to find housing.  Most of the housing is a walking distance from campus which is nice, but the crime rate in those neighborhoods is pretty high.  Basically all housing is rental houses, apartments around here are way too expensive."
College Freshman,2,I deserved more for my gpa and test grades.
College Freshman,2,"I wish drinking was acceptable here, but the CRC money donors are strictly forbidding towards drinking, smoking etc."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I haven't heard of any parties. I know they are out there, but I think to find them you have to be looking for them-which i'm not"
College Senior,2,"Again, people do definitely smoke and drink, but don't wear it on your sleeve. If you're obvious, you'll get caught and get kicked out. But seriously, who wants to stand out as an obvious drug user? If you do this is not the place for you."
College Freshman,2,"The winters are brutal. They are long and extremely cold. However, the fall and spring seasons are nice. 

Because I live on campus, the weather hasn't affected me dramatically, but it just has an impact on my general mood."
College Sophomore,2,There are no transportation options provided by Calvin unless it is an event by Calvin such as sports or a class trip to the beach.
College Freshman,2,"If you do not like winter, do not come here. It is very, very cold."
College Freshman,2,There is no real diversity here on campus. A lot of Dutch people on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Being from Chicago where we get snow and ice anyway, Michigan is pretty similar but with more snow. Its snows a lot and is very cold during the winter. Other than that its pretty beautiful on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There is a definite Dutch majority at Calvin, but there is a large Korean population as well. Most of the students express at least some type of Christian background and beliefs. The political beliefs of students are more diverse, but overall the Calvin students are very accepting of student with other beliefs and orientations."
College Freshman,2,The only transportation available besides friends with cars is the bus system which is not the most reliable and not as frequent as I would like.
College Sophomore,2,"the parking is average, not horible but not great either."
College Sophomore,2,"Winter is not fun. When the sun comes out, everyone's outside. I'm from SoCal so the weather I'm used to doesn't even compare to Michigan's weather."
Alum,1,"I have two major (and many minor) issues with Calvin University. I will only focus on the major issues here.

First, they openly discriminate against their LGBTQ community. The evidence is contained in their student handbook. In one paragraph, they claim not to discriminate, and in the next they go on about how they don't recognize gay marriage. They are trying to have it both ways, and it's nauseating.

Second, they do not take accusations of sexual misconduct seriously. While their ""Safer Spaces"" people claim to have rules about how they look into such things, they rarely follow their own rules, leaving many with no recourse. They are more interested in finding any reason to deny due process and accountability than they are in making Calvin a safer place.

Attend at your own risk."
Graduate Student,1,"I get the appeal of this school but truly beneath its Christian “liberal arts” disguise this school is truly a cesspit of bigotry, ignorance, and an administration that couldn’t care less for its students. My freshman year of the college had a great beginning. The Dorm system the college has does make it easy to make friends. However due to its strong CRC influence you will be perceived as an outsider and judged harshly depending on your religious view, sexuality and yes, even race. (Google Calvin and you can find stories of students drawing swatstikas in the snow) I am semi greatful for my time at Calvin but for the massive 45,000 price tag a year my time would have been better spent attending any other college that specializes in anything other than “Liberal Arts”."
Niche User,1,"Calvin College was the worst first two year college experience I could have had. The only thing that has made it tolerable were the few friends I had on campus. Student life is heavily divided and segregated because everyone has useless biases towards each other. If you aren't tall, dutch, white, and CRC, good luck getting by. As a student of color, I truly feel that the only people who truly invested in me, were other people of color.

If you wind up having to file an appeal, lie and bolster the letter because honesty won't get you back in. Calvin College is NOT WORTH $40k+. 

Professors tend to push too much onto their students, then guilt trip when the students find themselves unable to keep up with the work. People who talk about feeling unsafe are more often than not projecting their bias onto a person of color because they looked at them in a way they didn't like or raised their voice."
College Senior,1,we don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,"If you're looking to party, you've come to the wrong place. A lot of people will judge you if you party, as it is definitely a widespread Christian community here. If you want to party, you will have to go off-campus, and sometimes they can be difficult to find."
College Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate the winters here, I want it to be summer every day of winter."
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife at Calvin is pretty much dead, unless you smoke becuase there are always people at the designated smoke pits."
College Sophomore,1,"Te lab computers are VERY slow if your are using a PC, however the mac computers in the lab in the Heckman library are very up to date"
College Freshman,1,Students would be expelled if caught with drugs on campus. I have not heard or seen anyone with drugs.
College Freshman,1,"Some people go to parties but i do not know much of such things because i'm not really interested in such things. Most nightclubs are 21 or older especially those on weekends. There are some 18 clubs on weekdays.On campus, there are hardly ever any parties except for those organised by the school. i've heard some people have parties in their own homes but i've never   visited them."
College Senior,1,"Not Good – Parking is fairly limited in terms of actual space, there are a few lots which are often mostly full. For those who live on campus, a parking permit costs an outrageous $50, just to park in a spot that's super far away and totally inconvenient. It made (when I lived in the dorms) grocery runs incredibly inconvenient. As for off campus parkers, the permits are cheaper, but it doesn't mean you'll get a closer spot than the on campus vehicles. Also, any car left in any lot past 2 am, which, as a college student with a lot of late nights, happens often, gets a ticket. So it leaves people kind of in the lurch about working late nights. 
The bus system is fairly good in Grand rapids, so some people can definitely get by without a car getting to and from campus, which is great. Biking and carpooling also happens a lot."
College Sophomore,1,"As far as Calvin goes, their nightlife is rather lacking. Occasionally they try to throw themed parties with really bad music and a snack table and such...no. Just no. They're no fun at all. If you want to do something on a friday night, you're better off making friends with somebody who has a car and mooching off of them."
College Junior,1,People Are Tall – My school has a large population of Dutch students. They are all very tall. It can be pretty cliquey because so many kids have had family members that have attended the school. Generations attend. The students are fairly well off and don't realize it often.
College Junior,1,Dorms X 2 – We have to live in the dorms for both freshman and sophomore year. I think that they are great for freshman but more options need to be given to sophomores. The dorms are not too far from any academic building and are set up fairly nice.

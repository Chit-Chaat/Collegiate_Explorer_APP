Graduate Student,5,"The faculty is very attentive and caring. This is a new university so there are limited extra-curricular activities built into the campus, but the area has lots of local places to explore."
Junior,5,The teachers are extremely supportive and willing to give time to helping you learn. The students are friendly and the classes are pretty small.
Sophomore,5,"Iâ€™m currently a student in nursing. I have completed my 1st semester of clinicals and I absolutely love this university. This is my first experience attending college and Iâ€™m only sad that my financial loans are already maxed out and I have 4 more semesters to finish. So Iâ€™m greatly distressed that all the hard work Iâ€™ve put in to this education may be lost and I will be nearly $60,000 in debt without my degree. Iâ€™m not certain how this has happened as Iâ€™ve followed all my advisors advice and took every required course they said I was required to take. Very expensive! Wishing I can graduate. ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³"
Alum,5,"Amazing school that truly lives their mission both in education and community.   The only thing it lacks are sports team, other than that a fantastic school to attend."
Senior,5,This is by far the most caring school that I have been to. The professor's make you feel like you are more than just a number or a dollar sign. I also love the religious background because it shows that the university has certain standards that they want to uphold and make a difference together.
Niche User,5,What I like about Franciscan Missionaries Our Lady University they are a very small intimate school with a religious base. The instructors are willing to help you and want you to success. They have events often together the students to participate.
Niche User,5,"Our Lady of the Lake is a private college founded in 1923 that has an excellent nursing program and many other health professions majors. After touring the Lake, I find that a smaller campus size is better for me because I can talk to the admissions counselors about any questions that I have and they know me by name. Overall, I would recommend anyone considering a medical career to attend this college because the faculty and staff want to see their current and future students succeed."
Alum,5,"The faculty and staff are amazing from the President of the (now) University to pre-advising students with transcripts or financial aid.  The student life is fantastic for being a smaller institution hosting monthly events for students.  Job placement is not a problem either as all of the programs have 85% - 100% (majority closer to the 100% mark as well) on national board pass rates as job placement (I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure those statistics are correct).  The campus is small, but very nice and easy to navigate as well."
Niche User,5,Our Lady of the Lake is an amazing college with well trained individuals. It even offers programs for high school students to participate in to help them decide if the medical career is right for you.
Freshman,5,"Honestly have never enjoyed my classes as much as I am now. Everyday I am excited to go and learn. It is a small school, but it is also filled with great students and faculty who all have the same end goal."

Junior,5,"Great Community, and teachers that care.  The school is small which allow the professors to know everyone and actually interact with all the students."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy Our Lady of the Lake College because of the small classes. The teachers really work well with you to see that you reach your future goals in life. The campus is small and is very easy to get around. If I have any problems there is always someone to answer my questions. The staff is awesome. The school is located in a very nice area. It is also right next door to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. The only thing I may change would be to add more parking and add some living arrangements for our out of town students that are closer to the college. Sometimes traffic to and from there is very bad. But other than that I really enjoy my time there. I am so looking forward to being a graduate from Our Lady of the Lake College.
Junior,5,My experience at Our Lady of Lake University has been an rewarding experience. I love most about OLLU is the staff and instructors. I get a chance to work with the student body; which I get a opportunity to network and build with like minded students. I would referral other to have the chance to excel and help Hispanic community.
Alum,5,"I loved the Masters program, it was extremely difficult and challenging.  My undergraduate program was not as challenging in some aspects but very challenging in others.  
I had some of the most interesting classes and amazing professors. I would have never made it through my Math classes without the amazing teaching skills of Dr. Napoli."
Junior,5,The professors care! If you need anything always there! The Christianity part of the college is awesome! All religions are welcomed! 
College Junior,5,The biology program has the best simulation class that trains health administration/medicine majors on how to effectively take vitals and install an IV!

College Freshman,5,"The school is small, but it helps build better relationships with the staff and students. The staff actually cares about you, and you aren't just a number."
College Freshman,5,You should definitely attend OLOL nursing program if you are looking for a school that cares.
College Freshman,5,Everyone graduating from here almost get a job immediately!
College Freshman,5,"Everyone here is basically in nursing and we know we have a good shot of getting a job at the hospital because they are affiliated. The curriculum is fair and makes sense, but the fact that we have to take a certain amount of electives is not."
College Sophomore,5,They are always having job fairs and other opportunities for students to get a feel for a job in the future.
College Sophomore,5,"Any time that I had a problem at school I could easily walk up  to the office in which it involved and they gladly helped me fix it. I feel very confident that I can ask any of the faculty there for help and they would be eager to assist me. the only problem that I had was with financial aid, but with only a few visits that was cleared up. otherwise very easy to ask for help and receive it."
College Sophomore,5,"The environment at Our Lady of the Lake is quite motivating. I feel very welcomed and appreciated to be here. the program that I am going into has a requirement of 50 volunteer hours in the hospital which allows for great experience and let's me get a feel for the job. after doing a couple hours in my program I feel like I would love to go toward this and am excited to get into the clinical work. the workload at this point is somewhat moderate. I am still in my general studies class so the assignments are hard, but not unbearable. The great thing about Our Lady of the Lake is that even if the classes do get unbearable they always have someone there to help you, whether it's through tutoring or through counseling. Everything here is hands on as well, so once the students graduate and get a career they are better equipped because they had the experience, and that to me is an amazing opportunity that I am truly grateful for."
College Senior,5,Everyone wants to help you out and there are only a few students on campus.
College Senior,5,I had no problem transferring credits and since I have a specific program my classes are already fixed into place.
College Senior,5,"It is a medical training college, there is a hospital right across the street, if you are looking for a great place to learn and get hands on experience; OLOL is great."
College Junior,5,The school is very flexible
College Junior,5,I love all the students they are amazing
College Junior,5,Very tough but worth it
College Junior,5,"This was the easiest transition to a college I have ever gone through. No long lines, you get personal attention, and they help answer and concerns or questions you may have. I also have no problems what so ever transferring previous college credits. the councilor even had everything ready to go for me to schedule my classes"
College Junior,5,"This is the third college I have attended and I have to say it is my favorite. Our Lady of the Lake treats you as a real person. The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel welcomed. The school helps you every step of the way in your path to success, which explains their high success rate."
College Junior,5,The fact that you have small one on one contact with the teachers and administrative staff and you always feel welcomed.
College Senior,5,The financial aid office is great. The counselors work hard to try and assist students.
College Senior,5,"My major is nursing and I hope to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing. My curriculum is very hard and several people in my cohort has already dropped out and failed this semester. I am grateful that I am not one of those students because I am highly motivated to become a successful nurse. The faculty is great and they assist all students throughout their courses. Since it is a small college, the facilities are quite small."
College Junior,5,Students at the Lake are all very hard working and study hard. Most students know what program they want to pursue before the attend the college and they work hard to get there and make good grades.
Graduate Student,4,The campus is conducting didactic courses through Zoom and Moodle. They are very proactive on making sure classes go smoothly online.
Junior,4,"FranU is an excellent University. Everyone of the professors genuinely care  about each student and go out of their way to help. It is a small campus which allows students to get to know their classmates better. Sometimes the administration can be a little scattered with their information, but other than that it is a very good school to attend."
Sophomore,4,The teachers are very nice and helpful and that helps out. Everyone in the main office is helpful and gets you on the right track.
Sophomore,4,"The university here is great for studying! The campus is small and feels very safe. There are no dorms. The only thing missing is food and more social things on campus. Classes are small, and your teachers know who you are. They are always willing to help when you need it. I just hate that the price of tuition increases every semester at least 4%."
Sophomore,4,"One thing that I love about Our Lady of the  Lake College is that is has a small classroom environment. Therefore it allows me to talk to my professors one on one about any questions I have. The professors also care about how you do in class and want to see you succeed. The school has a lot of medical programs and are adding others and expanding. It's a commuter school so you get to meet new people and learn to form friendships. Although, I  do wish there was more food choices available because you have to leave campus in order to eat."
Sophomore,4,"Classes are small,you get to know all your professors and your classmates.The campus is really safe(like leave your stuff unattended safe) & on top of that EVERYONE who works at the college is helpful and there are free events(i.e crawfish boil)Now with that being said,the college is boring.Seriously boring.This school is essentially an all girls catholic college.Literally nuns walk around and an intro to theology course is required to graduate.It's also hella expensive so if your parents aren't rich or you don't have a job rethink your choice. The environment, in my opinion, is better for working parents or people with degrees making career changes.THIS IS NOT A SCHOOL THAT YOU TRANSFER to unless you like to gamble with your career.The school is SO small & program space is limited ESPECIALLY in the Rad Tech and PTA programs.I could go on & on but to be short,if you want to have a social life, live on campus, & not see Jesus on the cross in every classroom choose another school"
Alum,4,"My undergrad! So glad I chose a small, private college to fulfill my bachelor degree goals.  And a plus for being healthcare related! "
College Junior,4,"No problem all clear on what transfers and what does not, no catches"
College Junior,4,They have a CRNA program that many BSN students plan to pursue
College Junior,4,A degree from Our Lady of the Lake College shows you are ready to give back to your community
College Junior,4,"While the workload is heavy it is not ""hard"" it is just a lot."
College Junior,4,"Very personable and helpful, easy to walk into the offices and get answers!"
College Junior,4,The class sizes are very small which makes it easier to talk to your professors one on one!
College Junior,4,They help you find a job
College Junior,4,They help you find a job when you obtain your degree!
College Freshman,4,So far school has been pretty convenient with my life and job.
College Freshman,4,I'm not really sure about this.
College Student,4,Since Our Lady of the Lake college mainly focuses on Medical degrees your classes develop around it. Also you have great job opportunities since we have our own hospital.
College Student,4,"Our Lady of the Lake College is a great college, but it has its flaws. The school is small and very diverse. Since the school is small you have more interaction with the teachers and your grades are better. Since the school is small there is not as many students so its harder to make friends and theres no social groups. (frats and sororities) The school is great overall just not your typical college."
College Freshman,4,They offer multiple doctorate and master degrees for nursing students to further their education.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree from this school is very good. you are almost guaranteed a job once you graduate from their nursing program.
College Freshman,4,They have an amazing Nursing program and i am looking forward to starting clinicals
College Freshman,4,I absolutely LOVE Our Lady of the Lake. It is a great university.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very excited to teach and very approachable.
College Junior,4,This school makes you feel apart of something important and that your career is something that means somethings to all the professors to help you achieve.
College Freshman,4,The classes have about 20-30 people and it's awesome! We also have a liberal arts program.
College Freshman,4,We have tutoring. We do not have any athletic things. Our campus has a lot of fun days where we get free food!
College Freshman,4,All the professors care about you and want you to do good! We offer tutoring which is a great thing!
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of different religion backgrounds and it is very cool! Everyone respects each other!
College Sophomore,4,"The academics that OLOL offers are many and the way they teach them really prepare students for the future. They do a lot of volunteer work in the hospital along with the community. This helps give the students a better perspective of what it's like to work with other people. The registration process is kind of tricky for first time students, but the advisors and registers office help out very well to make sure the students are getting exactly what they need."
College Senior,4,"I chose OLOL because I wanted to do clinical lab science. OLOL offers a lot of medical training jobs and has a hospital across the street.  If you are looking for job security and excellent training, come to OLOL."
College Senior,4,"Although the classes are intense and there is a lot of work to be done for each of the classes, I feel like I am actually learning and will be competent when I go into the workforce. I am actually training for the job I want not taking just taking classes."
College Senior,4,"I only know the students in my cohort, but they are wonderful and if that is a small sampling of those who attend the college, I believe it is an excellent student body."
College Senior,4,"Since I am in a very specialized program, one is encountered with the same people everyday and you get to be really close and involved in your niche. You can help each other out and the instructors understand how best you learn.  Class sizes are small and there is a high level of technology in each of the rooms."
College Junior,4,"The student body is very diverse and accepting to the needs of others. A lot of student clubs or groups hold different activities or benefits throughout the school year to welcome new students and to provide a stress free, fun atmosphere."
College Junior,4,"It's a very friendly campus. Most people are helpful and nice, which is a major positive. Most teachers are willing to go our of the way to help provide a better education for you. My favorite experience was in pharmacology with Mrs. Martin and she was so excited about showing us a funny video about a specific medication we were learning. Her enthusiasm motivated everyone. She would go beyond the call of duty to help you gain a better understanding about the topic of discussion."
College Junior,4,The library and study rooms are very helpful when it comes to exam time. It makes a huge difference when you have a place to go to study in between classes.
College Junior,4,Awesome academics and professors at the school.
College Junior,4,I would chose my school again because of the hospital it is affiliated with.
College Junior,4,It's a beautiful campus in a city setting.
College Junior,4,"if I was missing any paper work the Financial aid office promptly contacted me to have the errors corrected. This is a private college so it is a little more expensive than say a community college. However, as a nursing student it is the best private college in the area and worth the extra pennies."
College Junior,4,Our Lady of the Lake is a Professional setting for a school. Everyone wants to succeed and everyone wants to achieve their goals.
College Senior,4,"It is great in aspects such as the curriculum, good professors at the upper level courses, able to form close bonds/study groups with peers. The major negative is that tuition and fees are so expensive."
College Senior,4,"The academics are geared towards careers in the healthcare field such as nursing, physician assistant, respiratory assistant,  biology, and liberal arts. Some professors are good, others are not. The registration process takes place in person for your first semester and online until you graduate."
College Sophomore,4,My credits transferred  easily.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are nice and care about how you are doing in their class.
College Sophomore,4,"The work load is a lot, but I know it's preparation for my career."

College Senior,4,Awesome student body. I love those that I have met and still have close relationships with those that have graduated.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone going to this school is hard-working. They are all going for a health related career.
College Sophomore,4,"There have been some classes that have been hard to schedule because there is only one time, but most of the gen ed courses have been offered at lots of times. "
College Sophomore,4,"Teachers expect a lot, but that should be expecting going to a school for a health career. They want us to learn and be able to apply what we learn for a successful career."
College Senior,4,"The tuition here is pricy, but the faculty make it worth it. "
College Senior,4,"I started off at a bigger college, not only not succeeding in what I wanted my career to be, I got discouraged. The classes were too big, and the faculty was not helpful. I choose to come to Our Lady of the Lake two years ago and it was my best decision. The faculty helped me and encouraged me on the path into Nursing. I love going to Nursing school here, and have met awesome new friends! If I would have known from the start how much I would have loved it here, I would have started here!"
College Senior,4,"The faculty is great! Always there to talk about my concerns! By being in a smaller college, I feel like I am getting the attention I need to succeed in my career in Nursing!"
College Sophomore,4,"My school has a Writing Center and its really awesome. Not only do the people who graciously volunteer their time help you to write papers, many of them who are skilled in other subjects help you study as well."
College Sophomore,4,"I did not run into any struggles during the transfer process at Our Lady of the Lake College. All of my credits transferred, which was nice and made the process somewhat easier. Scheduling my classes was simple and easy and my school schedule fits in with my work and clinical schedule."
College Junior,4,"Although the institution is very expensive, the education I recieve is worth it. The financial aid office has always answered my questions and been helpful."
College Senior,2,only a few post grad degrees available
College Senior,2,"A very small private college, so none of these."
College Sophomore,2,The one online class I took had so many problems. The quizzes were messed up and there was little or not communication in the class. If you were having trouble with the material it was impossible to get touch with the professor.
College Senior,2,"We have to pay to print. That is a struggle for most students. We do have wifi, which is good. "
College Senior,2,Poor. We need better teachers that know what they're talking about. Way too expensive to have low quality teaching.
College Senior,2,"As far as socially and getting to know students, the atmosphere is great. The students are fun and easy to work with but on an academic, it's very poor."
College Senior,2,I feel that the tuition prices are extremely expensive for the quality of learning that we are taught. There is also no help whatsoever with grants and financial aid assistance. Mostly loans are given which will have to be paid back eventually.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is basically a private school. It costs $1400 for one class, not including books. The school is one of few that offer medical related degrees. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is opportunity to get involved, but not so much when you are taking night classes."
College Junior,2,The library and student centers are great for studying but there are no athletic centers.
College Senior,1,"A small college, so none of those things."
College Senior,1,"Coming from a university,  and to a private college I would expect it to be more ""glamorous""; however there are no athletics and little to no extfra curricular activities to get involved in. I love the academic half but the general aesthetics need great improvement."
College Sophomore,1,"The education I have received is an A, however, the financial aid process is a nightmare.  They are rude, and expect you to know what questions to ask and how the process works.  I would advise anyone to speak to the head of the financial aid because she is the only one who is kind and knows what she is doing.  Plus, with the amount of money we pay ($6,500/semester), we should have better computers (half of them do not work because they are so old), wireless printers, more parking and coffee!"

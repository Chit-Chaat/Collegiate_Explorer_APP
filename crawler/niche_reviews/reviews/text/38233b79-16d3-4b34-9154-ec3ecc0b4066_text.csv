Niche User,5,"I attended BCC as a High School student taking courses to get my high school credentials in order to graduate. I highly recommend any high school student who school provide college classes at this school should go and take advantage. This school  is great Berkeley have so many little shops and food places for you and friends to go eat. The school itself is really nice, the people there are so nice and down to earth, the education is taught well here and the professors are amazing. The school is so close to Cal Berkeley so you and other can go check it out and site see if your unfamiliar with the school. Overall I highly recommend and high school students please take advantage it's such a nice school in a beautiful area"
Sophomore,5,"Berkeley city college is right in the heart of downtown Berkeley, and have very easy commute. Bart is just 1 minute walk distance. It is near UC Berkeley so you can visit some of their libraries. Berkeley city college is very diverse and celebrates many cultural festivals. It’s one 5 stories building so finding class rooms and other facility rooms is super convenient. Parking lot is the building next to it and there is also a new parking lot opposite to it. 
Staffs are super friendly and will help you through any problem. You have easy access to counselor’s appointment. Every Tuesday you get free fruits and vegetables. And every once a week or month a rep from UC or any other university will be available to have a session with. 
Jobs in the campus is available. There are students and TA available to help you with classes in learning area room for free. There is also food court to chill and eat lunches in between classes. 
Over all Berkeley city college is best community college ."
Sophomore,5,"Berkeley city college has good instructors with good learning environment and facilities. Labs for science courses are equipped with good tools. 
Teacher’s office hours are very effective and also easy to reach out with very good responds."
Junior,5,"The eruption of COVID-19 pandemic has made me feel so grateful to be a part of Berkeley City College. Their late actions with the pandemic; however, did not disappointed me. The stigma that online classes won't be helpful has totally disappeared. My only worry while taking online classes is the difficulty to communicate with professors; however, the reality was so different. Quick response to students emails, flexible grading options as well as online resources have proved how professional they are. After one semester taking online classes, I feel extremely enjoyable and motivated to learn more.  I can't wait to have my next semester full of online classes."
Junior,5,"Berkeley City College provides me an ideal environment to reach my full potential. At Berkeley City College, I have the chance to explore my interests passionately and fully through various campus activities. The college has the most wonderful and friendly staff that will support students unconditionally and guide them through successful pathways in education. Choosing Berkeley City College, I have had the most worth-spending experience ever."
Sophomore,5,Most of the professors already conduct some of their classes online so the transition to full online instruction went by a lot smoother.
Sophomore,5,I enjoy all of the services provided here but I wish there were more areas to sit and converse with other students.
Sophomore,5,I love it here! Although it seems like i have been here forever. I would not have wanted to be anywhere else this long.
Freshman,5,"It’s my first year studying here in California and I am grateful that I chose Berkeley City College because they are very welcoming, friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,5,"No school is perfect, but attending Berkeley City College has truly been something positive in my life. I have tested the waters of 2 other community college campuses, and Berkeley has been my favorite. It's geographic location a block away from UC Berkeley is significant. Being so close to UC Berkeley gives Berkeley City Collge a similar attitude of academic rigor. There is also easy access to UC Berkeley's public libraries and study spaces. My professors at Berkeley City College have for the most part been engaging, friendly, and very professional. Some of the downsides are lack of cafeteria, field, or pool. Despite this, I have had luck making friends, and finding a supportive community at Berkeley City College."
Sophomore,5,"The environment is very relaxed and makes it easy to be able to focus on one's academics. Plus with all the offered tutoring, they really help you succeed. I wouldn't say all teachers but many of the teachers are really concerned with keeping you on track."
Alum,5,Very small community college. That was always a positive for me. Easy to get in and out and take care of business. In downtown close to public transportation and food.
Freshman,5,It's a great campus with great professors. I would take all my classes there if they were all available. I wish they had more varity when it comes to majors though.
Sophomore,5,I have had a lot of fun at berkeley city college for the past 2 years. Everyone at berkeley city college is very friendly especially when it comes to helping their students. There are a lot of resources at berkeley city college that college students are fortunate to have.
Sophomore,5,"I've been a student at BCC for over a year, and I appreciate the support from all faculty and staff members I've encountered. There are lots of resources available, and the ability to meet with potential colleges/universities representatives. BCC offers workshops that encourage high education and cultural awareness, which keeps students connected to other communities (as well as their own)."
Niche User,5,"Overall BCC is a great school for those that are looking to stay close to home or even fly across half of the nation to attend. The school offers great financial aid, public transportation is simple and easy. The teachers truly do care about you succeeding  in life, the TA's are the exact same way. The housing situation is a hassle, but seeing as you do live in Berkeley it is expected. I personally recommend finding housing outside of the city, yet close enough to BART."
Freshman,5,"Berkeley City College is a very good place to study in. It is just a few blocks away from the University of California- Berkeley, so students of Berkeley City College can often go to University of California- Berkeley to hang out and study in the libraries on campus."
Sophomore,5,"This school is very diverse, many different classes, yet the school is built like a tiny high school. Also, they have college hours and club rush to ensure students are active on campus."
Alum,5,"I loved this school! It's tiny, but has a great community and wonderful teachers! I enjoyed every day that I went here (and I'm honestly not the biggest fan of school). Not to mention the school is in a great location so if you have a large chunk of time between classes and can't go home, you can always find a way to occupy your time. The only thing that was a hassle was setting your schedule in a way that your classes would not conflict. Some classes are only offered at one time so be mindful of that. Overall this is one of my favorite schools!"
Niche User,5,I take classes in the Multimedia department. My focus is animation and digital art. The teachers at BCC are excellent. I recommend Mary Clarke-Miller who heads up the department for animation. She really cares about the success of her students. Valerie Mih is a great teacher for the technicalities of 3D animation. Pamela Stalker brings a lot of enthusiasm to 2D animation.
Sophomore,5,Community college is a great experience and stepping stone for individuals pursuing higher education.
Alum,5,"From all the Peralta District colleges, Berkeley City College is by far my number one choice. 

Most of the professors there are passionate about their job and care about their students. Aside from the professors and academics, their campus is rather unique and effective. It is literally impossible to get lost there.

For those who like sports, sorry but BCC does not offer any sport. There is also no campus food, however, many restaurants run nearby, walking distance. 

It is a diverse college with many different ethnicities and international students."
Freshman,5,"conselor is the best among peralta. you get honest advice everytime eventhough it gets busy all the afternoon. but the conselor are willing to work with your schedule and help you to success. I used to be in DVC as a international students, and you will need to wait 2-4weeks to an appointment. and by the time you meet them, you already fall of the class.
teacher whiles it depends. some are the best, and some are not. really goes to both ways. 
getting the class you want is alittle hard, since there arent many class in a one type. but is still way better than DVC. in DVC, you need to pray to get the class you want, because students really fight for a class in one minute of their register time. wtf?!!"
College Junior,5,It depends on what class I choose. Some class I'm taking for transfer credit are best online or hybrid.
College Junior,5,Straightforward answers and you'll get it right.
College Junior,5,Class sizes are ideal that each students are given attention.
College Junior,5,Instructors are knowledgeable and hold PhDs.
College Senior,5,There's always posts and bulletins of job and internships around campus.
College Senior,5,"I've had no problems! I like the counselors too because they suggest which class to take...well if you have a regular counselor they'll suggest it more personally to cater to your personality. For example, mine suggested a interpersonal communications course because she knew that I was shy and didn't want to talk much in front of the class as for a public speaking communications course."
College Senior,5,"I think BCC is a great school as well as the other Peralta colleges. This one differs with only having 1 building as it's entire campus. At first I didn't like that but it's nice to occasionally run into professors and I think it helps them remember students. I don't feel like just some face in the crowd like I've heard about colleges. Majority of the staff are wonderful at explaining their material during lectures, others go more into depth if you go to office hours, and they're pretty welcoming too. 

The students are so-so I guess but it depends on the class because some are just plain mean or act like you don't exist so you feel isolated. I feel like it's due to competition but it's not exactly the mean teasing/bullying experienced in high school or middle school. Maybe that's just how it is in the real world? I'm not sure but I feel like it's similar to the work environment.  

The area is nice for food since there's so many places to go and public transportation is so convenient by Bart or bus, however parking seems to be a hassle esp price wise since this campus doesn't have student parking."
College Freshman,5,Classes at this college are small which is really nice for students who want the classroom environment to feel more personal. It's easy to talk to the professors as they are friendly and willing to help students any time. The professors are very knowledgeable of the subjects they are teaching. There's a wide variety of classes to take at different times and days to work around schedules.
College Freshman,5,"Students of the Peralta College District (BCC is one of four) have easy accessibility to each school's website and we have a site dedicated to what students need to do prior to or during the semester, what classes they're taking, GPA, etc. and we can add/drop classes on that as well. It's very easy to use and it's convenient for students to handle thei business if they know how to without having to see a counselor."
College Freshman,5,Transfer and graduate students of Berkeley City College seem to some back to visit and tell current students about their paths to success and share tips about what they did to get where they are now or what they would've done if they could go back in time. The transfer rates are good because the school has agreements with a lot of California's four-years and it really helps students get to where they want to be in life.
Recent Alumnus,5,It's a modern school with incredibly diverse students in a very diverse environment.
College Senior,5,It was easy to enroll everyone was so friendly and didn't  mind helping you through enrollment
College Senior,5,I have had such great support from programs like TSC and the professors that I have had for transferring
College Senior,5,I have not had any bad teachers throughout my experience. They are all passionate about their subjects and invested in their students' education.
College Senior,5,"My school is diverse with regards to age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political ideology-it is a great environment to learn in. You are learning even when the professor isn't talking!"
College Senior,5,Everything is so affordable and with the tax exemptions for being a student almost everything is paid for!
College Senior,5,I have class with department head and he is an excellent professor! The other classes within my major (including the online classes) are also superb.
College Freshman,5,Everyone here is really understanding and you really just have to talk to them and youll be good to go.
College Freshman,5,I really like it here.
College Freshman,5,I love it here at BCC.
College Freshman,5,The people who attend BCC are absolutely great. It's really easy to make friends with people there and they all seem to be very academically driven. Everyone is so hardworking.
College Sophomore,5,Financial aid staff is great! Just get your stuff done as early as possible so if you do have problems you can get it done sooner than later
College Sophomore,5,I am getting my AA in Spanish and an AA in African American Studies and it is absolutely wonderful. My teachers are great and the workload is manageable. The study material is excellent especially for spanish and I have learned a lot.
College Sophomore,5,This is my first semester and luckily I got excellent teachers this year that have both really changed my life and my thinking.
College Freshman,5,the diversity of the school is very strong. since the school is in a very open minded and trendy location many people can be found. all people are very respectful and calm. they tend to want to help each other and are very interactive. since Berkeley city college is a few blocks away from UC Berkeley this also brings more diversity to the location but also the school
College Junior,5,"Very rewarding experience: learned a lot of new things and perspectives on the world. Professors were engaged and passionate about the subject. 

Many classes are offered and quiet a variety of classes. More subjects are being introduced every year."
College Junior,5,"The school work closely with 4-year universities in the area, permitting access to students to a lot more ressources and a bigger network. The school alos helps you get internship or get in contact with local companies/organizations."
College Junior,5,The tuition is reasonable within the means of local students and if not financial aid is there to help cover the fees
College Junior,5,The one on one time with staff and students.  Easily fit in with the college  community.  It is a friendly enviornment on both ends (staff and students) and exudes positivity at all times.
College Junior,5,"We have more than enough computer labs to accommadate the students at Berkeley, the speed could be a little faster.  Networks are good though and the need for personal computer and printer is not even an issue."
College Junior,5,I have no problem with the flexibility of my classes it does not interfere with my work schedules at all and am still able to do everything I was doing before school started.
College Junior,5,What  it comes down to is that Berkeley College is a diverse atmoshere.  We have staff that cares about their students in and out of school.  Acceptance is not an issue on any level ay Berkeley everyone is welcome with open arms and are pushed to their highest potential in a positive way.
College Junior,5,"In my specific major, it is a small class but easier to handle and comprehend the material.  It also makes interacting with classmates and teachers that much more easy. The work load may be a little too much but the staff makes every effort to be there, to help anyone who asks for it.  We always have a form of contact with our teachers."
College Junior,5,"I love my school! For the first time in a long time I actually enjoy and look foward to going to my classes.  I make friends easy there for study groups and class projects.  The teachers and staff are constantly involved with every student, and suprisingly it amazes me how they know who you are eveytime you walk down the hall and ask how everything is going with school. I love how the class sizes are smaller and teachers are more one on one with their students I don't find myself struggling to keep up or embarresed to ask questions in class.  I also find myself more drawn to school, attending Berkeley College than I ever did througout elementry and high school but am happy to be here."
College Freshman,5,"The class registration process is very simple. Classes are set up to be two days a week and it is all done online. There are many different choices of times for morning and evening classes. We can also register for classes at other Peralta campuses which gives us more opportunities to get into the classes we need. Some great student service programs are EOPS, TRIO, and PACE that help keep you on track to graduate and help with transferring."
College Sophomore,5,"This school has a wide diverse range with students and staff. Many young students, however there are plenty non-traditional older students. It creates a great open perspective for students to envelop themselves in and learn from eachother."
College Sophomore,5,The class schedules are very flexible and there are always doubles of classes so I can usually fit things around my work schedule.
Niche User,4,"Online is overall completely different but it's going very good. I'm currently taking American Sign Language 2 and the way my professor have it set up is so perfect to where I still understand the work as if I was back on campus. It is hard to catch up on work since it based on your time, but the way the teacher have it set up it's really helpful."
Junior,4,"If you have the right teacher, the class can be engaging and informative. If you have the wrong teacher, it will make it seem as though you are wasting your time."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken some online classes through BCC, all the courses were satisfactory and the professors followed up really well on me, even though it was an online formula."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are all very in tuned with your education. Almost every teacher I have had has encouraged me to strive harder and work for myself. Coming from a lower-class minority background, I have been scared of higher education. BCC has really allowed me to work my best and hardest for my academics."
Sophomore,4,Great professors but the counselors need to work better on helping with the process of transferring. I was told the wrong information by some counselors which was worrisome.
Sophomore,4,"The classes at Berkeley City College are a hit or miss. I've dropped classes within the first week of the semester, but there's also wonderful teachers I'd take again and again. There are many classes to choose from so that I could get them to work with my work & family's schedules. I just wish some teachers and classmates could be more engaged, so I didn't make many friends here."
Niche User,4,"I attend Berkeley city college as a concurrent enrollment high school student. It has been very easy for me to get the classes I need (as long as it is scheduled in the evening, which as been a bit of a problem for me). The counseling department has been supportive and helpful, and has made it easy for me to work withing the college. I also like how easy it is to get to the college, since it is really near the BART and there are buses that are close. The professors have been really good and I like that the students come from all over  - from freshmen in high school to people much older than me. It's a great college to go to if you need or want to start out at the community college level."
Alum,4,"I started at BCC when I was 15 and I am graduating tomorrow at age 18. I think it is a great start! I will be attending UC Berkeley. Since BCC is part of Peralta I got to play water polo and swim at Laney which was one of the best experiences of my life. If you got to BCC, check out the Peralta college sports."
Sophomore,4,This school is the best one out of all of the Peralta community colleges. The support system from the professors and transfer center shows throughout the students.
Junior,4,"What I like most about BCC, the professors and counselors. I feel like they're there to help us no matter the situation; they'll always have a solution for me."
Sophomore,4,"Good value for media classes, small class size, easy to commute, helpful instructors. Friendly community."
Sophomore,4,"3.5 
One of 4 Peralta Colleges: Laney, Alameda, Berkeley, Merritt
Great teachers and good preparation for transfer to a four year
Could do more to promote athletics; the only sports team I know of across the four campuses is the women's water polo team."
Sophomore,4,"Great evironment. Good people. Good teachers. The counselors are very helpful and the student body is very friendly, especially after the front desk!"
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, subject of material interesting and kept me engaged. I would suggest they improve the Financial Aid Office, maybe hire someone who can guide students instead of just giving general information."
Sophomore,4,"Berkeley City College contains many helpful staff and the teachers I have experienced so far tend to be interactive with students and eager to help you understand the subject matter. The counselors, shoutout to Mr.Barton and Denise, are wonderful and go above every means to help you succeed. The campus is not very great for social life or making friends, however. And there is no cafeteria unfortunately, but plenty of good eats around shattuck and telegraph! This is a school to attwnd if you want to transfer from a cc to a 4 year university. Most students have that goal in mind, and the location of uc berkeley right down the street is a strong motivating factor."
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty small, which is why you get to see the same people most of the time. It's more of like a small tight community where everyone may know anyone. The professors are super passionate about their field, overall staff are nice and friendly. Only thing is that there is no cafeteria, so you'll have to buy food outside at downtown Berkeley, but they offer good food!"
Niche User,4,"Berkeley City College is nestled downtown, great access, but away from traffic. The entrance allows for customer service/ security desk to help with logistics and is disability accessible. The staff are well informed as it relates to my experience with the counseling department. Very pleased with my primary campus option."
Sophomore,4,"Berkeley City College encourages diverse community and self-development in an environment where rights are completely supported by everyone such as students who are immigrants and either documented or undocumented. Nothing is impossible when you become a student of Berkeley City College because everyone is treated with privilege. I like that the campus is accessible to everyone who live and don’t live in the city as it is also convenient for students who are differently abled. Security and safety are the number one factors that the college focus on as there has been no campus crime history since the year 1974. I like that the campus is the smallest campus out of all the Peralta Colleges, but I think it would be a lot easier and convenient for students if there is a cafeteria as nearby restaurants around campus can be a little bit pricey. It would help the students a lot if they wouldn't have to go out and pay for high priced meals since the campus is located in the heart of downtown."
Junior,4,"Berkeley City College is an amazing community college that feels like any other college.  Other community colleges lacked this feeling because there really was no ""college life"".  That's very different here. There is a strong sense of community with a focus on education. The diversity on campus is absolutely beautiful. The counselors and professors are really there for you whenever you need them. There are a number of different clubs and groups to get involved with. That surprised me because when I attended other community colleges there were little to no opportunities to get more involved on campus. Berkeley City College is located in the heart of Berkeley. It is surrounded by delicious restaurants. The only thing I would improve on is the size of the campus. I would be awesome if there were more areas to study because the Library fills up pretty quickly."
Sophomore,4,"This a great school especially if you are looking to experience new things and meet different people. The professors support the students greatly and the counselors easily will help you make your transition from high school into college. The only drawback is that we don't have a cafeteria, it is the smallest campus out of all the Peralta colleges, you know? Nearby restaurants can be pricey because of school being located in the heart of downtown and if you're on a budget as well. Definitely if the campus were just a little bit bigger with a cafeteria, it'd be a lot easier for students! "
College Junior,4,ive learned alot of applicable things
College Senior,4,flexibility between classes and work schedules were fine! i did not have any trouble.
College Senior,4,"the flexibility of the classes were good, i could easily schedule work and school without a hassle."
College Senior,4,my focus is sports marketing and management and i wish more schools offered that setting but most dont. the amount of courses were good though.
College Senior,4,"my overall experience of the school was great! I loved the people, the teachers and the clubs were also a big part of the fun at the school. the location was amazing, the only thing was the pricing!"
College Senior,4,"my first semester at BCC was a great one, i made friends very easily and the teachers were wonderful. The classes i feel were actually i think a bit too easy for me but they were great. My professor really cared about my success as well as the other students. The location of BCC I would say is the best thing about the college, its right in the middle of everything and literally a 1 minute walk from the BART station, so there is no excuse for being late to class!"
College Junior,4,"Easy to navigate through, only difficult thing I would say is making sure your exams, written assignments, and final is turned in on time before the system locks you out."
College Sophomore,4,The are an unlimited opportunities in my school
College Sophomore,4,The smoothest process in my college career.
College Sophomore,4,Easy to transfer my previews college credits
College Sophomore,4,Simple directions and smooth to maneuver around.
College Sophomore,4,The career center has guided me on the right path
College Sophomore,4,"Enrolling into courses was smooth and they have a huge variety of classes to choose from. The interaction with professors is great, they truly care for your education and are not just there for a paycheck."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Took an online course over the summer and had a great experience: instructor was very clear about expectation and workload, he was very helpful and always gave feedback on homework and assignments, students had to post weekly on forums. Also took an hybrid course that met once a month and had a great experience too. Instructors was available when needed and expectations were clear."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Instructors are committed to help students reach their goals. They are prepared, pick textbooks reasonably priced and always offer the option to borrow the textbook from the library. Syllabus with clear and detailed instructor expectations and scoring are provided at the start of each class. Small class sizes provide individual attention, and most instructors make a point of learning student names."
Recent Alumnus,4,"BCC is a great community college. It is in a great location and easy to access by public transportation. The instructors are committed to educate the students and help them reach their academic goals whether they want to transfer to a 4-year, take prerequisite classes for post-bac programs, or obtain an associate degree."
College Junior,4,My college is the best because it values students.
College Senior,4,"During the 2 years I've study in this school, I can confidently state that this community college has given me countless opportunities to shape my potential as a conscious scholar. This college not only excels at the quality of education by having qualified-experienced professors (the majority holding doctorate's degrees), it also encourages students to think outside the box by allowing everyone of us to create our own clubs or fund organizations."
College Senior,4,From what I've seen students go back and work in the lab a TA's so the job prospects are good.
College Senior,4,There's a wide variety of courses offered at BCC some are only here out of the Peralta college system!
College Senior,4,If you make connections with students and professors it's great for job prospects but I'm not sure about alumni where you'll have a good word put in for you.
College Senior,4,"I'm majoring in the STEM field and I'm not sure how close it is to the real world but it feels somewhat isolating and discouraging because of lack of minorities. It's mostly male dominated but I prefer to have female friends to talk to in class since I get along with them better and there's no pressure of dating or feeling intimidated or disrespected. However, as a minority I find that the few women in my class don't want to be associated with me, surprisingly some of my male classmates were more friendly and willing to have a study women. Also the older students are more friendly compared to my peers.

Only a few of my math and science professors were terrible but I found out the hard way despite warnings from peers and rating of those professors online. One seemed slightly racist and the other couldn't teach and would have tests that didn't relate to their lectures!"
College Freshman,4,"Highly qualified professors who are extremely dedicated to all student success and who provide many resources to aid students.

Small classes (30-40 students usually)

Emphasis on critical thinking"
College Freshman,4,"Really excellent sociology teachers who place our curriculum in context of the real world.

Discussion of current events and issues, and an emphasis on developing critical thinking."
College Freshman,4,"Great experience, dedicated teachers, diverse students and faculty.

Small class sizes but a wide range of available courses. 

Easily accessible online resources as well."
College Senior,4,"There's a wide range of classes that fit my schedule. Even though I'm enrolled in seventeen units, I still have time to study and possibly work."
College Senior,4,"Forced to comment on other's works, which is good"
College Senior,4,New job posters are always on the bulletin boards
College Senior,4,The professors know what they're talking about
College Senior,4,New job posters are posted on bulletin boards
College Senior,4,Teachers allow you to experiment. There's freedom
College Senior,4,"The teachers are friendly, which makes school good"
College Senior,4,Going to school is fun because as I'm learning new skills to apply for jobs and to build to a career. I've gotten to meet a lot of diverse people from all walks of life. It's been a wonderful experience and I look forward to the next step in. Y journey.
College Senior,4,The counselors have been so helpful with preparing for transfer.
College Senior,4,If I stayed longer I think this would be more applicable to me because I could get an AA degree.
College Senior,4,I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of taking an online class and how comfortably it fit with my other classes.
College Senior,4,The professors are all great and offer tons of office hours and are always willing to chat about anything.
College Freshman,4,The only downside is how long financial aid takes to get back to you.
College Freshman,4,The sociology and psychology department is great. You can even take psych classes on the UCB campus as a BCC student.
College Freshman,4,"The professors are really there for you, they are super welcoming and are absolutely willing to help you by all means. They do not mind staying over their work hours for their students."
College Sophomore,2,"I've attended three very different schools in three very different places. Berkeley City College is by far the worst. At this point, I have come to the conclusion that the quality of classes will be more or less identical regardless of where you attend school (unless you're attending a school for a specialized field of study). What makes each school different is a) the location and b) the quality of the administration, including the resources that you, the student, have access to on a regular basis.

Berkeley City College scores well on location; it's basically across the street from what is arguably the most prestigious public university in the country. Plus, Berkeley's an awesome town. The bay area is gorgeous. The people are great. The food is incredible. You will never be bored if you come here (if you can manage to find an affordable place to live).

BCC's administration is abhorrent. Through all my travels, my years of schooling, and my uncountable dealings with counseling offices at universities and local colleges, I have never experienced more incompetence than I have at Berkeley City College. It seems there is a blatant miscommunication between the academic advisors; every time I ask to meet with someone about choosing classes or IGETC requirements, I am told something different. I have been barred from taking classes I am overqualified to take (as a transfer student). By overqualified, I mean I began taking a course at a prestigious four year university and had to drop it based on a scheduling conflict. When I tried to take the exact same class at BCC three semesters later, I was told I would need to retake the prerequisites because I did not meet the requirements given my ""academic history.""

To top it off, I was told I would need to remain at BCC for six, yes, SIX semesters in order to meet all necessary transfer requirements. At this point, I am convinced they are simply trying to profit off unsuspecting college kids."
College Senior,2,Berkeley city is not very unique or different from any other school. The only thing I would say is unique about it is that it is a smaller school in which there is only one building for all the classes and departments.
College Senior,2,"Berkeley city is not the biggest school, so the resources on campus are limited. There is no athletic department or many campus activites. The school does have a reliable student center and library, but other than that it falls short in comparison to other schools."
College Student,2,I dont know since i dont get any tuition and financial aid
College Student,2,Most of the teachers are not that good but the work load is very easy to handle.
College Junior,2,It's been a little hard to transfer some of my credits. It didn't really feel like the counselor really cared about helping me. He certainly didn't go out of his way to see if he could transfer my credits
College Senior,2,No athletics on campus. Library is miniature with limited study space. I have never heard of us having a student center. The only campus activities that occur are the speeches people give publicly and are heard throughout the building.
College Senior,2,"Career services doesn't offer much service, you have to do everything yourself. The offices consists of one person who sits there observing you while you  look lost going through a million flyers with no help."
College Junior,2,"The school has a decent educational system however if you want to speak to a counselor or a financial aid representative you can not call them, you have to physically go to the school and wait for up to three hours to talk to them. Also some of the people who work in these offices seem fairly unsure or uneducated about the topics they are supposed to have knowledge in. This makes it frustrating for any student who needs to work and doesn't have the time to wait for misinformation."
College Junior,2,I am currently an out of state student.  Compared to my last school the out of state tuition is not that bad.  My problem how ever is with dealing with financial aid.  I have had and am still dealing with some issues that I have with them.  Not only was it a difficult process just to sign up for financial aid but it seems that the staff is not very helpful in aiding you when trying to navigate through the process.  I think the school would do better in training or employing people that have better knowledge of the system and better customer service skills.
College Junior,2,"we don't really have a lot of resources, our library is very small, are computer are old, and the software is out of date."
College Freshman,2,Limited to Absloute Nothing – This is very small campus with no gym and very limited with activites. Has a very beautiful library for the occasionally reading here and there.
College Freshman,2,"Stuck There – I'm grateful that the school exists, but unhappy with the lack of resources for the students, and the availability there is of people who can help me transfer successfully. My experiences have been with almost every department with services to offer students and each time I have been displeased with the ""help"" I received. However, I do experience many good professors that make me want to learn more and explore more after every class. I find most professors accessible, and open to talking about my grade if I've been dong poorly. With that said, I only see one other issue- the online classes. They are not organized well, the syllabus does not coincide with the course material most of the time, and the professors are unreachable."
College Freshman,2,The library is awesome. The tutors are great. However some of the teachers you will really need to go get help from the tutors or else you will be struggling.
College Freshman,2,"This school was not picked by choice but more by convenience. I will be transferring in the fall to Montana State University. My teacher's were OK but not above and beyond. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this school to others."
College Freshman,2,"It takes a long time especially if your a new student to apply for financial aid even when you applied a month before school starts, they find a way to make sure you do not get financial aid. I am still waiting for my financial aid and its been about a month and a half."
College Freshman,2,"Quality of Faculty – The teachers are not so bad as far as personality goes, but most cannot effectively communicate the message in their curriculum. They don't captivate their students too well. Plus, due to the budget cuts, physics courses are not offered anymore and forced some good teachers find work elsewhere."
College Junior,2,It has been pretty convenient being in Berkeley City College except that financial aide process was really hard and its been 3 months and i still havnt heard anything. Classes are great and transfer of credits was fairly easy.
College Junior,2,"Expected Better.. The teachers in my class are really great and i love how they make an effort to help you understand. what disappointed me was the financial aid office that takes forever to give you results and also the councelors arent much help either. Maybe its because of the lack of staffs and too many students, i dont know. students are really nice and from diverse backgrounds. Not all science classes available and classes fill up really fast."
College Junior,2,"Variety Kinds of Students – Most of student I've met are American residents. Some of them are American, some are American of Africa/Mexican/Asian descent and so on. I have just transfered to this school this semester from Texas A&M University; Therefore I haven't had enough time to understand the resident students here. However, In my feeling, I feel that students here are kind of love individual working. For example, in my math class, there is no interaction between students in class because there is no group assignment.Students just came to class, listen to professor, and go out right after class time. They seem do not want to talk or to make new friend."
College Student,1,This school was a HUGE disappointment I am upset i didn't do more research before I entered.  There is NO campus life whatsoever. There's no cafeteria or place for students to hangout.  There is a room in the basement but only one clique is always there and they are only interested in each other.
College Student,1,They dont care about you the admin sucks in all the peralta district
College Student,1,There are no sports or very many clubs that people care about
College Junior,1,The people who worked in the Fin Aid office seemed to not be able to answer common questions that they should know.
College Junior,1,"we have a very sufficient amount of books, and our technology is not up to par."
College Sophomore,1,"The tuition is not the issue, until your financial aid comes into play. If your financial aid wasn't so impossible to access and finish the paperwork for, then the tuition wouldn't be a problem for many students. Financial aid office hours are very limited, with long lines, and staff is not direct or aware of required paperwork for each student's situations which prolong the process and headache for everyone involved, and keep students without books, or supplies money."
College Student,1,There are no campus activities and no sports teams
College Junior,1,"Really mean people , they look down on you as if your just another student trying to get money for other reasons I guess. No solid answers or solutions. Judgmental and disorganized but sometimes you get nice people but its a rare occasion."
College Junior,1,It could be better but it's a community and for a community college it's some what good.
College Sophomore,1,"Its not so diverse,so I'm experiencing a highschool atmosphere.Trying to attend and stay attentive to the things that are more important transits into me not focusing the stuff the actually is important.Hope I'm not sounding confusing,wish the staff and people around were more helping since that's why there put there."
College Junior,1,"Student Store – I don't really like the Student Store. I got a special check that can be used only once to pay for all my books and supply. I go to the store and get all my book but one of them is not there so i have to order it. One of the guy that work there- I'm guessing he is a student, rings me up. i tell him i need to order this book and i'm paying for the rest. he PUTS all the book i have INTO a bag and the has me fill out a order form. he writes on the check the total amount and does what ever he needs to do. i get the recreate back and see i have only paid for one book. I could have walked out of there with about $300 worth of books. i tell him, ""where are the book i have in this bag?, i don't see them on the recreate."" it turns out that he didn't ring them up so i had to pay with them with my credit-card."

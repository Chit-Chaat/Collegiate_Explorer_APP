Niche User,5,"FGCU was very accommodating with COVID as they offered many different zoom calls. The admissions office is accommodating different needs for those impacted by COVID. When making a call, they will get back to you within 24 hours promised."
Niche User,5,Very kind place and feels like home. I am a Florida resident and I feel as if the highlights of Florida are used in this school. This school also has a focus on student life and still making academics a priority. All sports are included and there is a place for everyone.
Freshman,5,Great school overall! There are a ton of events always going on during campus and the school really cares about the students! There are a ton of things to do nearby and the water front is a fun place to go on campus. There is a ton of diversity and clubs for different ethnicities! The school really focuses on sustainability and the environment so it is nice to go to a school that cares about the Earth.
Freshman,5,Your online learning experience really depends on what teacher you have! Some are very hands off and some of them will guide you. For the most part online learning is really easy at FGCU. There are a few different types of online learning but it is simple to grasp once you leadn about them.
Alum,5,"It was required to take a minimum of 9 credit hours during the summer, so I accomplished this through online courses. Most of the coursework focused on case studies which I find to be sufficient forms of practical learning and keeps the online format from becoming boring."
Alum,5,I greatly enjoyed my time at FGCU due mainly to the  small class sizes that allow for a more personalized and hands-on learning experience. The only thing I would possibly change would be to add more diverse subjects and programs to allow for greater creativity and practical learning.
Freshman,5,FGCU offers so much help with any class you take. The staff are extremely helpful with anything you need and the professors genuinely want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,Online classes are easily accessible and the requirements for each class are clearly listed. Great communication between professors and students.
Freshman,5,This school is really cool. I think that my favorite part about this school would be how sustainable this school is. The amount of resources available in this school is amazing; there is a good support system.
Freshman,5,"FGCU is the place to learn, and have fun at the same time while enjoying a peaceful Forrest scenery around you."
Junior,5,"Being a smaller university, you get more individual attention and support from professors and staff. Additionally, I have created several personal relationships with my professors, making it easy to find help or advice on coursework and possible career paths."
Senior,5,"Florida Gulf Coast University is a university that puts its student's needs first. From being clean and organized to the professors taking the time to individualize each class, FGCU is a place where you are able to get accustomed to quickly, and still feel that you are able to speak to your professors if you have a question. The academics at FGCU are amazing and very educational, and the safety on the campus makes sure that each student is taken care of. I would recommend this school to anyone that is looking for a small, quaint place to call their educational setting and make lasting impacts on their lives."
Senior,5,"For Summer 2020, we were switched to online classes due to COVID-19. Florida Gulf Coast University was able to quickly switch over the classes to an online platform, and this transfer was quick and painless. The professors made it easy to continue our education and experience for each class through this online platform and really made an effort to make this setting not as hard as what it would have seemed from going to in class online. The school made sure that each student's needs were met and that the online classes were still educational."
Junior,5,"FGCU has been a fantastic school to go to. They really care about their students physical and mental health, providing a medical clinic and counseling center on campus for free or severely reduced to all tuition paying students. FGCU has also been  very vocal on their support of LGBT+ students with a week long pride event, students of color given 2020's political climate, and environmental studies."
Junior,5,"Online classes are held on Canvas. The program is easy to navigate and organized. Home screens show what online classes the student is taking as well as overall grade in that class at that time and any assignments due within that week. Teachers are prompt to respond to any issues, whether with canvas or in the students personal life (loss of family, hospitalization, ect)."
Alum,5,"I was an undergrad student when the college was still new. I graduated in the 1st four year class graduation in May 2001. I have seen this fledgling university grow and expand over the years. The school has so many more programs, buildings, opportunities, including athletics. FGCU has filled a great need for higher learning in SW Florida and now draws students from all over the country. It was a great experience then for me and could be a great experience for others."
Sophomore,5,I took an art appreciation course online and it was really easy. The online textbook and quizzes were very easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,"FGCU has been an amazing experience for me so far! Living on-campus, there are so many resources to help you succeed and a ton of events to get you socializing!"
Senior,5,I love taking my classes online at FGCU. Professors make sure that you’re understanding the material and it’s a great alternative to going on campus.
Junior,5,"This school is simply superb. I transferred here a year ago and have gotten the taste of what campus life is all about. The diversity of students is quite amazing, and I have been given the chance to meet so many individuals who share the same interests as me and who are goal oriented."
Niche User,5,I like how there are many different races and it’s a good campus where there is great security. The food is delicious and the students are very nice as well as the professors. The music program is amazing and I want to learn many things about it over there.
Sophomore,5,I love the intellectual diversity. One thing I would like to change would be the way you get around campus.
Senior,5,"Here at FGCU, everyone has the ability to do great. This school has educators who are waiting to help their students to achieve their potential goals as learners. The maximum security this school has is incredible. Since I enrolled here, I have never heard of anything bad related to security purposes. Overall, FGCU has potentials for everyone to succeed in one's career paths."
Freshman,5,"As soon as I visited the campus  I fell in love, they have amazing  Academics to choose from. The physical campus is beautiful and so full of life."
Junior,5,"Florida Gulf Course University is extremely engaging and proactive in involving its students in activities and projects across all boards. Being an environmental major, I have been given amazing opportunities to work with professors working in fields I am interested in. In my time here, I have gained so much hands-on experience in the exact role I wish to pursue when I graduate."
Freshman,5,"I really liked that there are a lot of clubs and organizations that you can be involved with at FGCU. I thought the professors were very helpful to the students, and the classes are challenging but manageable."
Niche User,5,Something I would change about Florida Gulf Coast University is to have better assistance with the football team since it's brand new and it hasn't reached its fullest potential.
Freshman,5,"As a student in the BSN program, I have had a wonderful experience at FGCU.  I love my programs and everything that accompanies it."
Niche User,5,"I love campus it is beautiful. The professors are amazing and the curriculum is great. Overall, I think the school has a lot of majors to choose from so there is something for everyone at Florida Gulf Coast University."
Niche User,5,I have visited the school 3 times now. I am a senior in high school and I fell in love with the school from the first time I saw it. I recommend visiting before you make your final decision.
Niche User,5,I honestly love the college from the time I took a tour of it last year. From the suites to the classrooms I honestly can see myself going to the college. I also love the spacious campus even though it can be a hassle to get from place to place I still like having space to walk freely.
Junior,5,"FGCU is located on a lake, which is so beautiful. They offer a number of water sports to be enjoyed on the lake. It would be great to have a football team.  The increased school spirit and  camaraderie  would be a be icingon the cake!"
Junior,5,Great school with a great academic system. Advisers are always will to help and the classes are a small size compared to other colleges so the professors know each of the student very well. There are lots of clubs to join and tons of student life. Its a great place to study.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Florida Gulf Coast University is the eco-friendly environment the school promotes. Seeing the natural flora grow as I walk to class, looking out the ponds during breaks between classes, and getting lots of sunlight, it makes Florida Gulf Coast University a sight to see. There are different activities to do that can put one with nature but without disturbing nature, including the nature walks, boardwalks, and even a food forest where the school grows fruits and vegetables throughout the year."
Freshman,5,"FGCU is a beautiful, lively campus. There are so many things to do here, from clubs, to shopping, to the beautiful beaches."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed FGCU very much. There is so much activities to do on campus such as walk through nature trails, boardwalks, kayaking, canoeing, boating, wake boarding, water skiing, tanning, and partying . FGCU is a located on a nature reserve with beautiful nature all throughout the spectacular campus. Getting around campus is easy because there is a bus service or you can drive around campus. The academics are awesome too."
Niche User,5,"Super organized, focused on academics, a big name in the sports scene, and loves to have fun with the community! Wouold recommend to those wanting to go into marine biology or hospitality!"
Freshman,5,"The faculty are extremely nice. The classrooms are small. My normal size is 30 or less. It is extremely easy to meet new people and there are events happening almost every day. There are also a lot of different clubs. I am currently in Ignite which is a through the church near campus. I am also in an ice skating club. There is a lot of different options for food, whether you want to grab a quick bagel at Einsteins or diner at Sovi Dining, there are many choices. This school is also extremely eco-friendly. The campus is built on a nature preserve, so there is wildlife.  You can see many different species of birds and lizards and the occasional alligator. Overall, Florida Gulf Coast University is a great school for anyone who wants a small school vibe even though there are around 15,000 students."
Sophomore,5,The fact that this school is a smaller one makes me confident about the quality of help I receive and how smooth my college experience will be.
Freshman,5,The school is relatively new and has a very pretty campus. The class sizes are around 30 people or less. They have a lot of different activities to do on campus such as going on a boat for a day on the lake.
Senior,4,The students are a fairly diverse population and the professors are very chill! There are tons of events on campus and so many ways to get involved that you won't get bored!
Senior,4,Online learning is not too bad. It requires a lot of self-discipline and time management but it is not too hard if you are dedicated and committed.
Freshman,4,"The teachers were as helpful as they could be, considering our circumstances. As inconvenient it is, I, surprisingly, found the Zoom setup to be comfortable to use."
Freshman,4,"Very easy and simple to work online, and I get the same amount of information as I would in the classroom."
Junior,4,"Because of COVID-19, half-way through the spring semester, all courses were placed online. I found that my professors adjusted fine and had little problems continuing assignments and presenting topics."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience was okay. I prefer in-person classes because I think it is better to learn that way, especially since you can interact with your fellow classmates and your professors."
Junior,4,Florida Gulf Coast University is a good school and I like it so far. There are a lot of things to do to keep me engaged in the student life activities and my academics.
Senior,4,The online classes are very easy to handle and all of the information that was provided was very easy to access. Sometimes communication would be off and some material needed an special access to get that the teacher forgot to provided to the class.
Senior,4,"With Florida Gulf Coat the atmosphere is friendly and always has activities to do wither on campus or in dorms. Teachers are very nice and are very easy to talk to with either one-on-one help or in classroom setting. The only hard thing is that when choosing classes and getting the extra help with advisors, it can be difficult and hard to stay with the same advisor. But is it a great school with a really good location."
Alum,4,"During my undergraduate time at FGCU, the majority of my classes were face-to-face. However, some were online or set up to have an online/web component. These courses helped to expand my technology experience and skills while learning the academic content. My experience with these courses always ended up being very positive."
Senior,4,"Professors and staff are great. Very tight knit university. A little expensive, but overall great school."
Sophomore,4,"I completely enjoy the upbeat and happy vibe FGCU gives on campus, with clean dorms and clean buildings. Only changes I would like to see are more meal plan food options or just overall more food options on campus for those who live on campus and cannot commute anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,Overall an amazing college. Would recommend to everyone. Good professors and even better students. 10/10 recommend.
Junior,4,They tried their best to be as accommodating as possible. They made all of the classes as pass/fail options.
Junior,4,I enjoy going to the school. It offers many opportunities and is in a very good location. The campus is also kept very clean and there is a private beach that you can go to.
Alum,4,"I only took one course online, which was required by the university.  It was my freshman year.  It was a humanities course, which I think would have been much better appreciated in person."
Freshman,4,"I have had nothing but a positive experience with FGCU so far, and cannot wait to continue my life at this university. My only issue is that it took so long for them to accept my application, without giving me any insight as to why it took them so long. In the end, I am hopeful for the next few years I will spend at FGCU and cannot wait to fully experience life at the campus."
Niche User,4,I am an admitted student and find the school and campus to be beautiful. The staff have been very helpful with my admissions and I look forward to attending.
Sophomore,4,"FGCU's has a great atmosphere, from the people to the campus. The professors are great, the dorm rooms are beautiful, and you will feel right at home at this school. There is so much social life at this college. However, it is not as academically acclaimed as other Florida Universities."
Alum,4,"Overall my experience was quite positive. The school always offered services to students and there were lots of passionate teachers and students ready to take part in extra events. The campus itself was beautiful and the facilities were excellent. The administrative staff was kind and reliable and the local natural areas were all wonderful. I don't have much that I would like to change about the school, but I wish the local area had more things to do for young people."
Freshman,4,FGCU has been great to me. The professors care about their students and make sure each student gets the attention they deserve. The classes are not as large which gives professors a greater ability to work one on one with students.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. It is the perfect size for me. I love that my school is devoted to being environmentally friendly and trying to find new ways to be sustainable. I feel that like all schools there are good teachers and bad teachers. However, in my experience, all of mine have been amazing. T"
Alum,4,"2016 Alumni , really enjoyed the small classroom atmosphere and getting the help from professors as needed. University is very diversified and is continuing to grow as well as the college population and the student-life with new dorms with the community around university expanding as well."
Niche User,4,Florida Gulf Coast University has a beautiful campus and gorgeous dorm rooms. Has amazing programs and is technologically advanced with the times as well. They also have amazing accommodations to students and staff with dietary restrictions. They have many options available for those restrictions with their foods.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful with the surrounding wild life. I love the lake side view from my dorm. The dorms aren’t the worst, definitely better than most college dorms. The rooms are apartment style which I love. I like having the room to cook my own dinners each night, or sit in the living room to hang out with friends."
Junior,4,I like that it is a smaller school. It makes it easier to develop relationships with your professors that will help you out in the future.
Niche User,4,"I like how it is public, and I would like to see them have a football program. They have many majors that a person can study. A College student came to my school to talk to us about FGCU and the programs they have there."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, it is full of wildlife and landscaping. The student body is also diverse, as well as professors. Small class sizes. Only downside is the housing staff. They do very little to resolve issues or fix maintenance related things."
Sophomore,4,"Florida Gulf Coast University is a great, cheap, state college in a beautiful area. The campus is one of the nicest in the nation, academics are not hard but challenging, almost every professor on campus has a higher education degree and no TA's teach a single class on campus. While I was skeptical my first semester at this college, I grew more and more comfortable and found ways to be involved on campus. Because of these changes I would never consider leaving this university and am looking forward to my remaining years in Fort Myers."
Sophomore,4,"Florida Gulf Coast University is a great school for those who value a calm, quiet environment. What I admire most about FGCU, is the small size of it. Most colleges in Florida are rather large, which can be overwhelming for some, especially incoming freshman. However, FGCU is a fairly small campus, which makes it easy to discover new friends and build close relationships with professor. Not to mention, smaller classroom sizes allowing for quality education and easy access to resources. I would like to see FGCU place emphasis on building school spirit through sports. Although we have an amazing basketball team, I would love to see a football team develop within the next couple of years."
Sophomore,4,It’s a very beautiful campus that is very student centered. A few things that could change are the dining and parking situations.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see more diversity on campus. At FGCU, there aren't a lot of Asian groups around campus and it would be nice to see some change or a better asian club on campus."
Sophomore,4,I have loved my time at FGCU so far. I've had mostly great professors who are incredibly knowledgeable in their field and genuinely want you to know the content. While the campus is smaller it can really pick up to give that larger scale school illusion and there are also great resources for students of all interests.
Niche User,4,"Florida Gulf Coast University is a wonderful 4-year university. It has a lot of perks to it like the location, the variety of things to do in Fort Myers, the jobs available, it is a D1 school and has amazing sports teams, and it also is a beautiful campus. For me, I love a spirited campus with lots of sports teams and games to attend, while we do have an amazing basketball team and arena, i totally wish there was a football team! Otherwise, it is an amazing school and I love it here."
Freshman,4,"Great so far, first year away from home.  The resources and community is very helpful.  There is something for everyone!  Campus is easy to get around, shuttles, bike lanes and racks all over the beautiful campus."
Junior,4,I like how ecologically based this school is. They promote recycling and good environment tips and resources.
Niche User,4,"I honestly think their dorms should be improved, I looked over at Florida Southwestern State College and their dorms are more stylish and have apartment style living dorms. Though, I love the campus and history of FGCU. Its quite beautiful, I've visited over 4 times now and I would love to come again!"
Niche User,4,I went to Gulf Coast University with my ADVID class and we did a tour of the school. It was so interesting to see the dorms and all the students that were walking around going to their classes. I have never seen anything like it and the experience makes me want to go to that school. I like how in the dorms that they give you a lot of space to work with and it gives you freedom
Freshman,4,"Overall FGCU is a good school. It is located in a small beach town. They should have more housing options off campus. All on campus dorms should be available to all students, not seperated by class. The school offers reasonable tuition, caring teachers, and staff. Could have more advisors.  Advisors need better training.  Students know more about registration than they do. Did not like mandatory overnight orientation, waste of time, one day would have been better. Orientation was disorganized and registration for classes was put on hold until orientation was complete.  Financial Aid office processes disbursements extremely slow.   I would like to see a better Art Program.  More courses should be available for Art, specifically in animation."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed orientation and the opportunity to create my schedule for freshmen year. The campus is really nice, with its own beach,"
Sophomore,4,I love FGCU's respect & commitment to the environment. Over 50% of the campus is preserved land! There are a plethora for fantastic majors to chose from. My favorite part academically is the small class sizes.
Sophomore,4,It's great! I love the vibe that I get when I am there. Everyone is so nice and helpful. It's a great learning environment.
Alum,4,"FGCU is a great school, but it is also very young. There are a lot of internal kinks that need to be sorted out, this includes the requirements needed to graduate on time. A lot of the requirements worked well when the school didn't have as many students, but due to its growth, it can be hard for the programs to accommodate to each and every student.  Although, there is new President at FGCU, who has a ton of experience, and has been making numerous changes that I believe can only benefit the university."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and everything about it. They have my major and everyone there is very nice. The school is close to my hometown so he drive is not bad. They have very nice housing and it is cheaper then other colleges. The one thing that they need to work on is their website, it needs to be updated."
Alum,4,Flexibility between online and on campus courses. Professors are all well experienced in their subjects and it reflects through their teaching.
Freshman,4,"Overall the school Florida gulf Coast university is great. The campus is beautiful and they’re always holding events out in the grass next to the dorms. Some professors could care less about you but most of them are really helpful and supportive. The parties can be better, wasn’t much of a fan. The students there are often invasive and nossy if you’re studying outside your own room but for the most part everyone is friendly. I really appreciated the separate rooms that came within the dorms. Yes you have to share a room but it’s generally separated so you have a lot of privacy."
Niche User,4,The campus is absolutely beautiful. It is the perfect size for in my eyes. It is a smaller school with a big school feel.
Junior,4,I like FGCU because it gives students an opportunity to broaden their horizon. There are so many degree programs to choose from and great advising staff to help you pick.
Freshman,4,"Florida Gulf Coast University has a wonderful campus with many amenities to help with both academics and out of the classroom activities. The downside, however, is that this university lacks a football team as of now."
Freshman,4,"It's a great college, stress-free and the teachers have so far been good. The classes aren't complicated and they get to the point. It has a well-made layout that makes it easy to get from place to place, even without a car or using a shuttle. As well as having many kind students to help in your transition into college life."
Sophomore,4,"FGCU has a beautiful campus and great dorms. The school has a good size, but provides small classes, so that you can build a relationship with your teacher. The food on campus has food for those who are vegetarian and those who eat meat. In fact, the cafeteria closes at midnight, so if you're hungry late at night, they are open to provide food for you. The library also has school supplies that you can rent for free. There are also many programs and clubs you can join and enjoy with other students.Overall, the school has a great campus life and many students are friendly and approachable."
Niche User,4,I went on a college tour trip with my school and I enjoyed it. It was a beautiful college. It also had good academic standards.
Freshman,4,The financial aid office is really the only problem I have had with FGCU. The academics and clubs they provide help almost everyone find something they enjoy. If there is not something that satisfies you it is very easy to start your own club.
Sophomore,4,"Florida Gulf Coast Universty has such a beautiful campus with beautiful people all around. Coming from high school to college, everyone is so diffrent and nice. Everyone is always willing to help each other through anything. FGCU has plenty to offer to help students achieve their goals and to be prosperous towards their future."
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the school is. Growing up in a small town, I didn’t want to go to a very crowded College. The staff is very friendly and responds to emails right away."
Graduate Student,4,"I liked how FGCU was very close to nature. Since my interests were in the natural environment and studying it, having the subject of my study a short walk from my dorm room was encouraging. It is unfortunate that the presence of the university has led to the development of the very natural environment that brought me to study there in the first place."
Sophomore,4,"My one year at FGCU has been great. It's not an FSU or UCF but it has a lot of things to do regardless. Classes are great because usually it's real centered and you can easily talk to your professors. And most of the time they really care and want you to pass. The campus is beautiful, despite your occasional alligator walking around or possum digging through the trash, the campus is stunning. There isn't that much diversity but they make it work. Going out is fun but can get repetitive sometimes considering we use the same 2 bars on repeat. But overall it's a very good school."
Sophomore,4,"FGCU is a great school that is amazing for the education, science and management fields. It is a medium size school with a large school feeling. Students are incredibly involved within the resident student organizations (RSO's) and the community of southwest and south Florida.  Being in the music program that is quite small at a school that has much larger programs within the institution is amazing because there is no competition for spots and the teacher student ratio is very small and intimate. Really getting to know everyone in the program allows for networking in the future and creating these relationships early on in a career develops social skills as well. Over all this school is amazing for those wanting a large school feeling with getting a personalized education experience as well."
Junior,4,"Great environment with a beautiful campus. FGCU has recently celebrated its 20th anniversary along with its students. Although a fairly new school, FGCU incorporates new and improved teaching methods and a vast array of resources for students and faculty."
Junior,4,"the campus is beautiful, and they make it a point to be eco friendly since it was built on land with a wide variety of wildlife. I also like the advisors, they've been really helpful with putting me in the right direction."
Sophomore,2,"I took some classes online when COVID-19 forced all classes to be conducted online, and all my professors were very caring and considerate about the changes and made the course as comprehensive as possible despite the changes."
Sophomore,2,Online was really tough and the professors tried their hardest but they weren’t doing very well with the new technology.
Niche User,2,My daughter has been accepted to 3 different colleges and FGCU was her first choice.  After getting her acceptance letter we followed the directions for the next steps to enroll.  She paid the housing fees and signed up for housing and orientation.  She NEVER received a personal counselor.  Our emails went unanswered.  Our phone calls were not helpful.  We were given short responses and told to refer to her GULFLINE page for information.  On the other hand the other two colleges assigned her a counselor and were in constant communication with her offering personal guidance even though she had not registered with them.  She was disappointed with the lack of personal communication she was getting from FGCU and ultimately decided to go with a different college.  Her personal counselor has been with her since the beginning and is walking us through each step which is how it should be.
Niche User,2,"I haven't been there but, my sister has and she told me it was a alright college because some teachers don't even care."
Senior,2,"Florida gulf coast university is a great place for students who are able to go to school full time. FGCU offers a wide range of daytime classes, but their schedule doesn't always account for students who are part time or students who need to take night classes. The amount of evening and online classes are very limited. Dorms are great, very clean and very safe. The campus itself is beautiful as well."
College Sophomore,2,"FGCU does not have any Greek housing on campus as of yet, but most Greeks do tend to live together in the dorms or off campus. Greek life is severely prominent in every day life at school. They always have tables set up supporting whatever event they have going on, and there are almost always parties or fundraisers Greeks are preparing for. However, Greeks are negatively viewed by non-Greeks. The Greeks give off an elitist vibe from their organizations, and most of the fraternities or sororities only spend time with other Greeks."
College Freshman,2,I am not involved in Greek life. We do not have Greek housing at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am indifferent towards Greek life.
College Freshman,2,There are mostly white christian conservatives here
College Freshman,2,FGCU is a pretty bad school. Classes are super easy and small so it feels like high school again. The classes that FGCU offers are small so when you sign up as a freshman you get none of the classes you want. I never do anything outside of class or study because there is nothing to do at this school.
College Freshman,2,"There is no housing for greek life on campus so greek life is only used to make friends. The kids that are in greek life are very cliquey, its like high school all over again. The girls in greek life are all exactly the same and annoying."
College Freshman,2,"Most ""parties"" occur at bars where there is a cover charge."
College Freshman,2,Almost all house parties get busted and the main way to get invited to any party is if you're associated with Greek life. It is very disrespectful and not enjoyable.
College Freshman,2,Living on campus was awful. I couldn't sleep with everyone running around the hallways during quiet hours and studying was nearly impossible. SO many rules were broken from other dorms and it was blown off as no big deal but it was interfering with my learning.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of unmotivated Floridian children who are more interesting in getting high and going to Rusty's than actually putting in work for their future and career. Drug ring problems, alcoholics, etc...... Campus and school originally a commuter school and well, sorry to say that it should have stayed that way."
College Freshman,2,"Annoying frat and srat members in monogrammed clothes that say 'like"" every other word. They think the world revolves around them."
College Freshman,2,"As a student athlete FGCU is not fully funded. Lots of inadequate funding. From team budgets, to puny study hall facilities, to having to share the weight room with the rest of the student body,FGCU does not have a chance to ever compete with the best of the best. We will always be one hit wonders"
College Freshman,2,"Huge Drug problem. Centered around drinking. Inactive unmotivated students who are lazy and just scraping by in the classrooms. Physical campus is too small for the current population. No parking, floods whenever it rains, pretty bland. Don't come here"
College Junior,2,The majority of the school are middle income white students. There really isn't that much diversity.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life at FGCU is almost non-existent there is no housing available and I rarely hear anything about Greeks in the social aspect.
College Sophomore,2,I am not learning anything and the faculty is unqualified
College Junior,2,There are very few apartment complexes near FGCU. the closet one is coastal village apartments. The management is poor and extremely ineffective. The are not concerned about the residents because we are all college students and they have no concern for your own privacy.
College Junior,2,Everything near campus is a chain restaurant. So the quality is great but the uniqueness is missing.
College Junior,2,"I suppose living in your own house with roommates isn't a bad plan, but I've heard a lot of complaints about not having enough parking or the landlord is rude and unaccommodating. Coastal Village Apartments is the WORST and I feel bad for anyone that chooses to live there. The management is terrible, the prices are horrible, and it's just an overall disgusting place to live."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many parties, people mostly go to bars or have ""kickbacks"" in their dorm/apartment. Sometimes there will be pretty good off campus parties."
College Freshman,2,"I had many issues dealing with financial aid. It was a difficult process and I ended up not receiving any. This does not make sense, because my sister got it and our information was the exact same."
College Freshman,2,There was not much aid in FASFA at FGCU. it is an ongoing process to get any aid.
College Junior,2,"FGCU isn't a party school. Come here to learn, not party anyway!"
College Freshman,2,There needs to be better dining solutions off campus since the ones on campus aren't that great.
College Sophomore,2,The only real option is Costal Village which a lot of friends dislike.
College Senior,2,Campus dining is expensive and not anything I couldn't make in my microwave.
College Sophomore,2,"Many students get financial aid, but the process make most people angry."
College Sophomore,2,The school does not offer transportation but the public bus passes by for students to use. Discounts are available for college students. The bus routs are very limited.
College Freshman,2,"I don't usually have a problem with the Greeks however, my roommates are Greeks and they are stuck up snobby and rude. They are the ones who ruin everyone else view of Greek life."
College Junior,2,No parking unless you're an Art or Music major; plan at least 10-15 minutes for finding parking and walking to class AFTER arriving on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Our school is a no tolerance dry school. No alcohol or drugs are supposed to be on campus no matter if the student is of age or not. 
College Sophomore,2,"To get off campus is kind of difficult with few options if you dont have a car. There's a campus shuttle that takes you to Town Center but only Thurs-Sat and until 9pm. If you want to go anywhere else you have to either take the city bus, ride a bik, or ask someone for a ride."
College Junior,2,"Permit is free, but even with multiple parking structures, it can be difficult to find a decent spot. Hang your decal or they will nail you for a $30 fine. Dorm students are probably fine without a car, but a must for commuters. "
College Student,2,"I don't know any discounts
"
College Freshman,2,"The Greek Life at our school doesn't stand out much. They don't have special housing and barely have events. Most of the time you only know Greeks by the shirt they're wearing not by reputation. The Greeks also seem to be treated normally, like any other student would. "
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any financial aid. This was a horrible experience and took a very long time to deal with. I live with my mom who is a substitute teacher making a very low salary, but still did not receive financial aid. I do have florida pre-paid so maybe that's why. They never gave me a reason, just said I didn't fit their criteria of need."
College Freshman,2,"Literally no parties, clubs, or nightlife. Most bars and clubs are 21 and up. We don't have frat houses so thats out of the question also."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from someone out of state, trying to get financial aid is a nightmare. I graduated high school with a near perfect GPA and pages of extracurricular activities and I got nothing. The office is also very difficult to work with."
College Freshman,2,"Although there is no cost to park on campus, it is extremely difficult to find a spot in the parking garages. The garages are also very dangerous, cars are constantly whipping around the tight corners."
College Freshman,2,It's pretty bad. They have failed health inspections for the past 2 years. There are bugs crawling on the floors and the silverware is usually always dirty.
College Sophomore,2,Wifi in the library sucks. The computer lab is often packed
College Sophomore,2,"parking is bad, but it's probably not as bad as bigger schools. just make sure you get to a parking garage at least 45 minutes before class, just in case."
College Sophomore,2,"people look at the amount of money my parents make combined, but I still need help. there are not many options in financial aid other than loans that can help me"
College Senior,2,Parking fills up fast but they are working on adding more 
College Senior,2,There are bars you can go to all the time but they are just ok. Holidays are the time for a party scene but other than that it's quiet around campus 
College Sophomore,2,The students around campus are not afraid to show off their religious backgrounds and beliefs. Every so often there will be tables set up about religions and students there to answer questions and talk about it. Another thing I've noticed is a couple students getting together with megaphones and screaming there religious views across the library lawn.
College Sophomore,2,FGCU is extremely helpful when it comes to academics. They have advisors available to everyone to help figure out classes and class schedules and they're also there to help out with any questions. The library has multiple floors and thousands of books to help study and make things easier on the students.
College Sophomore,2,"Since I'm only in my second year, I only know some aspects of the business program. FGCU has it's own building dedicated to the business majors and classrooms. "
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process is extremely frustrating and daunting.  Staff is not very clear or thorough with the process. If you are an out of county student, I would suggest calling all during the summer as you may loose financial aide."
College Senior,2,Buses from housing are nice but the public transportation to get off campus is pretty awful. It's really slow to use and isn't widely available. The campus and surrounding area definitely needs more public transportation.
College Sophomore,2,"The school has a no tolerant drug policy. If you get caught with any kind of drugs or drug paraphernalia, you are at serious risk for losing your housing. Most RA's are actually super cool if you get to know them, and they honestly don't want to bust you. TO be safe though, I would recommend not smoking pot or anything like that on campus at all. Cops are always around. Drinking is way more lenient. If you get caught drinking they usually just make you pour it out and give you a warning."
College Junior,2,Second worst college I ever went to. Wish I didn't
College Sophomore,2,"I wish there were more options for food here. We have Einstein's Bagels (Great), Jamba Juice (Bad smoothies and service), Chick-Fil-a (okay), Blu Sushi (Good), Subway (Good), Taco Bell (Good), Starbucks, The Link (expensive Cafe) and a connivence store with snacks. It seems like theres an okay amount of choices but there's really not. You'll get sick of it pretty fast. I wish we had more to choose from."
College Sophomore,2,"You'll find off-campus dining options like Pollo Tropical, Mc Donalds, Elevation Burger, Red Robin, Foster's, Joe's Crab Shack, Cheddars, Olive Garden, Longhorn's, etc. They're pretty much all fast food and chain restaurants. It's also rare to find ethnic food."
College Junior,2,If you go to any social gathering not endorsed by the school (NOT including Fraternities/Sororities) there is always alcohol present. Marijuana is not as present than alcohol however there is a definite presence of it on campus
College Freshman,2,The parking garages do not have enough room for the amount of students who need to park in them. It is a long walk to get to the main campus from certain garages.
Niche User,1,"The Financial aid office is horrible!Bunch of unprofessionals!Did all we had 2 do in regards to paper work, they misplaced them or just felt lazy to search for them, they requested again, submitted THEM AGAIN,they ask for them again right b4 school STARTED.Faxed them,called to make sure they got them,they said they did and it was processing, 2 days later they requested AGAIN,sent it AGAIN!Result :Financial Aid didn't kick in on time,my daughter was withdrawn from her classes,had to pay 3050$ all at once for d 1rst semester + 200$ LATE FEE!SUCH A SHAME THIS IS A GOVERNMENT UNIVERSITY!IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY, NEVER ABOUT GETTING EDUCATED!SHAME SHAME! Ah, it didn't stop there.When paying, had to b there personally to write a check or use my card. Mind me, that I live 2 1/2 way!Tried to make transfer to my daughter's bank, she could only withdraw 1500$a day.She missed 4 classes, no credit for that and on top, 200$Fee. F GRADE PROFESSIONALS! WATCH OUT!"
Junior,1,DO NOT LIVE IN THE DORMS... THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!! NORTH LAKE DORMS ARE OLD AND THINGS ARE CONSTANTLY FALLING APART. I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE LIVING ON CAMPUS! WASTE OF MONEY!
Niche User,1,"It wasn't all that involved for me. The instructors were too adamant about reminding me and every other student in class that they were only here for the pay grade, nor did they care about if we failed or not."
Freshman,1,"I attended Florida Gulf Coast as a Freshmen and was extremely disappointed with the school. I entered into the Honors program which has now be transitioned into an Honors College, however they have barely notified any of the students what the new changes are to the new program and the different requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to graduate with Honors. The University itself is a commuter college, with many students coming to take classes and then leaving. If you are looking for a ""college town"" or ""college community"" do not even apply to this school. Furthermore I had a recent death in the family and found that there are no services offered to help students contact their professors. I tried to contact the advising system and they told me that all they advice they had was for me to contact my professors and that they hopefully will reply. Not one staff member has recommended any type of grieving services, or any other help. Overall horrible experience with this school."
College Junior,1,Non greeks are skeptical about greeks
College Freshman,1,"Pretty bad. NLV is old and well worn, been used pretty hard by the time I moved in. Many drug busts and illegal drinking. Not to mention how the RAs aren't respected, pretty sad how they do not have any authority. People get pets, such as dogs, cats, and bunnies, which is against code and a  punishable action. No parking especially on basketball game days when the Police clear out all the lots for gray haired fans and there is no where to park."
College Freshman,1,"I continued to resend the application and I still can't be eligible for it. I ask people at school and at the financial office but they tell me what to do, but as I do it on my own free time to do it it isn't working out. I want somebody to be right next to me and help me through it because I need the financial aid."
College Freshman,1,"I do not appreciate Greek life, nor do i care about what they do. I honestly do not see the point of having fraternities and sororities."
College Junior,1,Administration seriously needs to consider that the student body needs healthy food. We have an organic farm on campus! Put it to use and serve it at an on-campus restaurant. It can have really cool dishes and attract visitors as well. It can serve as a lesson on sustainable agriculture too (why aren't we doing this?)
College Freshman,1,There really aren't any parties here which makes me reconsider my decision of attending FGCU
College Senior,1,"Other than college night on Thursdays, Gulf Coast Town Center, near FGCU's campus is dead and when there are events covers and drink charges are ridiculous."
College Senior,1,Very difficult during scheduled class time and the beginning of every semester.
College Sophomore,1,"FGCU seems to enjoy maintaining a monopoly out of the housing options around the school. Most places that would normally be considered off-campus FGCU has actually bought out, so they are then under the on-campus category. There are a couple places around the school, one of the most popular being Coastal Village (FGCU is looking to buy this too I believe), as it has a bus running from the housing location to campus. The others are a fair distance away and happen to be quite costly. The market all around FGCU is generally richer retirees, so cheap and affordable housing designed for students is pretty scarce at the moment. This will likely be the case until the university grows quite a bit more in size and developers see promise in creating off-campus housing.
I understand this is for off-campus, but if I may plug on-campus housing, it is much safer, much more clean, and if one really wishes to still be far enough away from campus, I would suggest West Lake Village. Perfect location next to the town center, a bit more affordable than many of the other options for off-campus housing, a bus running frequently, and everyone gets their own master bedroom and bathrooms. Did I mention it comes pre-furnished?"
College Freshman,1,"I'm going to start by saying I highly suggest that if you are an incoming student then you shouldn't live in the FGCU campus housing.  I currently reside in North Lake Village which are apartment-style type dorms.  There are four bedrooms (you will have three roommates), a living room, a kitchen, and two showers.  However, they charge $737 a month for EACH person living there (a total of $2,948 per month) which means the four bedroom apartment is a total of $23,584 (yes, you read that correctly) per academic year, which is eight months.  However, if money is not an issue, then you have to hear what the FGCU housing department has to say.  Every building has a resident adviser (aka 'RA') who lives in the complex and is there to enforce the housing code of conduct, which are a sophisticated set of rules and guidelines, not federal or state laws.  If these rules are broken, you can get permanently removed of housing, meaning you can never live in FGCU campus housing again.  These rules include breaking the roommate contract that you are required to sign.  A friend of mine was recently kicked out because, according to her roommate contract, no dirty dishes can be left in the sink over night.  She made the mistake of falling asleep before she could clean her plate.  Her roommates brought the 'issue' to the director of housing who, in turn, permanently removed my friend from ever living on campus again.  Oh, and don't forget, if your RA knocks on your door, you have to open it.  Not just open it, you have to open it all the way or you are breaking the code of conduct.  Now, living on your own in a new apartment may seem fun and relaxing, but the money and this schools' code of conduct will make sure that fun and relaxation are out of the question."
College Junior,1,"Great if you don't like parties, however if you're looking for the typical crazy college experience this isn't it."
Recent Alumnus,1,FGCU controls every scholarship you can get and you have to fill out a form through the school to even be eligible for the scholarships that you already get. If you miss that deadline even though you have worked hard to get those scholarships you can not get them.
Recent Alumnus,1,The only drug program that I have ever heard mentioned at FGCU is in my nursing classes. There is no mention of drug safety on campus except for the fact our campus is a dry campus.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't a day that goes by that I don't hear about someone getting busted with drugs. It's pretty bad down here.
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife at my school and there is no much of a bar/club scene.
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus sucks! There are different parking garages but good luck finding a spot quick. And only commuter students are allowed to park on campus during the day. They have buses for everyone else.
College Freshman,1,The Typical Student – The typical student looks like your average jock or cheerleader. There really isn't much diversity since all of the guys dress the same: Sperry's and khaki's. All the girls overuse make-up and aren't very friendly.
College Junior,1,"Very Unhappy – It seems that unless you are ""dirt poor"" you are unable to get any of the scholarships.  Need based ones are great, but there really should be more options for people who are working full time and still need help.  Going to school isn't sheap!"
College Sophomore,1,"UPD Are Just About Prison Guards. RA's Aspire to Be the Same. UPD are not lenient whatsoever. They cut you no slack and don't give a **** that you're in college. They will write you up, even arrest you for the most minor violations. RA's are vigilantes as well. You can forget about parties on campus, you WILL get written up. Very major reason I am transferring."
College Sophomore,1,"Typical FL Retirement Town – Located on the outskirts of Fort Myers, we are pretty much in the middle of nowhere. Besides the ""town center"" (open-air mall), nothing in the immediate vicinity is worthwhile. Clubs/bars are a 15 minute drive at least. Old people of course aren't too fond of us either, and cops even more so."
College Senior,1,"Limited parking available and constant parking tickets being issued for ""violations"" of the very vague parking restrictions."
College Freshman,1,Not Much Help Whatsoever – The professors at my school do not help all that much with job research or any other type of internships involving the given major that i have selected. every once in a while there will be a short internship that involves a day or two of attending but not much else is done
College Sophomore,1,No Help! I had issues multiple times with receiving my refund check. I was denied financial aid and the financial aid office was absolutely no help to me whatsoever.
College Junior,1,NEED MORE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN NOT AFFORD COLLEGE
College Junior,1,"There are nice at our FA office but its really hard at least it is for me, to get any kind of scholarship now a days. It stinks! I a college student need money!"
College Freshman,1,Parking spots fill up really quick. If that happens you have to park in a lot full of dust that makes your car dirty. Ticket prices are outrageous.
College Junior,1,I wish there were online sororities for distance learning students.  We like to be part of social functions in our community that can be shared with other online students.
College Senior,1,"I am a ""sports girl."" I love very sport. However, I live off campus and am never informed about games. I only find out if there are games if I come in the main entrance to FGCU and there are signs. I obviously wish there was a football team but that is not an ""overnight"" process. I just wish more students who live off campus were notified about events or games. At my previous college, Sacred Heart University, all students were emailed about games or events that were taking place. This allowed off campus students to adjust their schedule to make tiem for these events or games."
College Junior,1,"If you don't like bros than this is not a cool place to go, but if you exclusively shop at hollister and listen to lil wayne 24-7 this is the place for you"
College Junior,1,No Party – The school is super strict about fun and happiness.
College Junior,1,"Parking at the campus is horrible, if you go at a specific time. I would finally find a spot, but the spots that I find is for faculty or visitors. They have just built a new parking garage so we will see how it helps in the parking."
College Freshman,1,"What Night Life? FGCU, doesn't seem to have anything here that is open past 9pm, catering to the elderly populations. As college students, we are ashamed of the area we go to school."
College Senior,1,Ironic enforcement against students – They enforce rules against the students and yet allow radical groups on campus to disturb the day to day functions of learning
College Sophomore,1,"The Police Are Way Too Strict – I'd say the police are about a 10 out of 10 on strictness. There are no exceptions. My first parking infraction was $100 because I misread a sign. They are ridiculous about speeding and speed trap frequently. I haven't heard about any drugs raids or party busting, but maybe that's because students are smart enough to keep it off campus."
College Senior,1,"They Need Freinds – I don't get the same vibe from the girls, but the frat guys exude unwarrented cockyness. I haven't met one that I like yet.  Plus the school lacks the tradition to have an effective Greek life."
College Freshman,1,"Although we try and promote diversity, I don't see the diversity that the school claims to have. I was born and raised in a diverse community and know when there is no diversity. I never felt like the odd man out."

Freshman,5,"Trevecca is a place that cares about its students. Even in the midst of this Covid craziness, Trevecca has been able to put policies in place and control the spread on campus so that we do not have to shut down as some large universities have."
Freshman,5,None of my classes this semester are online but all of my friends who have had online classes have enjoyed them.
Junior,5,"I did not take any online courses, but for the time online/remote learning was made for all students since the COVID outbreak, the transition was very easy. My professors didn't complicate studies and provided lots of external links and information if I needed it. They also provided their email in case of any question or concern that could rise during the remainder of the semester.
There were only two courses that were problematic because of an assignment that required using an outside website. As a whole online studies were fairly simple to complete."
Freshman,5,"Trevecca was quite an experience my first year of college.   My first day on campus was explosive.  The campus staff have an entire field day of fun planned out for all new freshmen.  The entire campus was filled with joy, food, and fun.  There were an event comity in place they passed out gift bags and Trevecca field day t- shirts.  We even traveled by buses to a huge carnival to have meet & greet.  That was awesome."
Freshman,5,My experience with my online classes were great.  Each professor was precise and to the point.  Meaning they keep their class agenda simple and their lectures clear. The class assignment were well thought out and they were very strict on the due date of each assignment.  I was able to email any questions or concerns I may have had to any professors with out any issues. An awesome experience for a new freshman.
Alum,5,"This is an great school with professors and staff who genuinely care about you as a person, a student, and help you with your journey."
Alum,5,"It was challenging but also something that fit my schedule. I was worried about keeping up with this, my family, and my full time job. It turned out much better than expected."
Freshman,5,My professors assigned assignments everyday and uploaded every resources needed to help! They were very understanding with due dates and deadlines. They’re always willing to help with whatever we need.
Freshman,5,I love my University!! My freshman year was a blast!! I enjoyed our freshman experience class called link/trek. The environment on campus is really great and everyone I meet is sweet!

Freshman,5,My professors assigned assignments everyday and uploaded every resources needed to help! They were very understanding with due dates and deadlines. They’re always willing to help with whatever we need.
Sophomore,5,It is a great university and everyone is welcoming and willing to help. It is locates in a great city and offers a variety of great opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"It was really good. They had day to day activities and provided a very good response system that consisted of either asking other classmates or asking the professor itself which could yield an email response or a face to face response through video. The professors are very available and the classes have a very logical way of functioning. The work that is due on the day can be turned in at any time of the day since people from all over the world could be taking the course and you are given a profile which you can edit in order to get connected with everyone else. You are given online access to the books and materials as well as the option of reseaving a shipment of the materials of you wish to have a physical copy. Depending on the course and level of Difficulty you could have a harder time with some courses than others, but overall it was a very well planned and pleasant experience with some previously recorded lectures and very few lectures at locked times."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I love attending school at Trevecca. I was impressed before I even started the school because I had an adviser who was truly interested in helping me get an admission. I haven't ever had a staff member at a school be so helpful in the admission process."
Freshman,5,"Trevecca Nazarene University is a perfect Christian university! Chapels are held Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays to enlighten the Christian community. Attending a Christian university comes with an abundance of rules to follow; however, I believe that it is one of the best campuses in the near area. Being in downtown Nashville is also a bonus for those entering the music industry, like where else would you want to be?"
Freshman,5,Trevecca has been really good for me. I have learned so much about myself and how to love other people. If you are looking for Christian University this is a really good place to go. They really enforce their faith values into everything that the school does. The teachers really care about each student that they have and they care about you personally and not just you as a number.
Freshman,5,I love learning in a diverse environment where my professors truly care about my success. I am constantly challenged to be the best version of myself and to grow in every situation. My experience at Trevecca has helped me explore my passions as I find my place in the world
Freshman,5,"I love Trevecca Nazarene University. The over all environment is welcoming and accepting. The faculty really care about your well-being and that you learn in their class. As always, there are ups and downs (the cafeteria has some off days) but Trevecca stands out above all the other colleges I looked at."
Sophomore,5,This first year was amazing. It was definitely a life change and I’ve learned so much about myself as a person. I met some amazing people that support me and I’ve grown in music knowledge and am growing as an artist.
Freshman,5,"Great community, extremely helpful and caring staff. Good location and small campus size is nice. Dorms are always kept well. Affordable for out of state tuition. Great churches in the are."
Junior,5,I would highly recommend Trevecca to students looking for a place to attend college. I have loved my time here.  I've felt that I have grown not only academically but spiritually as well. I'm thankful for the Christian aspect that is brought into the classrooms. The class sizes are not too big and the professors care about the students as individuals. The campus is great and has become home.
Senior,5,"From the recruiters to my academic advisor, this school takes pride in ensuring that students are set up form success attaining their degree and post graduation."
Graduate Student,5,"I have attended Trevecca in the past and lived on campus, but now I am attending online as a graduate student. The classes are both challenging and interactive. I have learned so much about myself as well as approaches and logic that apply to life and work. Along the way I have also enjoyed getting to know my classmates. Glad to be a part of TNU!"
Junior,5,"This is my third year attending TNU and I must say its a great school, filled with great professors, and the knowledge gained will surely help you in your future field of study. You feel very welcomed from the beginning, its a small campus, and its in the heart of Nashville."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment here at Trevecca. It's a rather small school with pretty small class sizes so the teachers really get to invest in you and they want to see you succeed. Even doing things after hours or in the summer to help you advance in your academic goals.
Sophomore,5,"Trevecca Nazarene University is a very small private Christian school in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee. Trevecca offers a lot of four year programs and graduate programs. The professors and the university staff members are very friendly and do their best in making sure that everybody who is willing to work will succeed. The school has a wide variety of  local, national and international students from all over the world. This creates a nice atmospheric mixture and a great learning environment on campus. In addition there are many different clubs and associations on offer for one to join during his or her spare time."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love Trevecca.  I haven't attended yet but i will this fall. I know that the campus is beautiful and very safe. I cannot wait to attend!
Niche User,5,Treveecca Is a great place to make friends and get to know God and Get really great food and college life is great small classes are really are really really great as well
Freshman,5,"I have only been with Trevecca as a freshman for a couple of months, but I absolutely love it!The campus is beautiful and safe. I know I am getting the most out of the experience academically because the professors are so engaged with students individually."
Junior,5,"I personally love Trevecca. Trevecca gives the home away from home vibe, that is what every college should do and Trevecca does a great job of this. It is also about 3 miles from downtown Nashville, exploring Nashville is an endless task."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Trevecca Nazarene University has been amazing. I have made several new friends, have learned a great deal of information, and have met amazing professors. Overall, I love Trevecca Nazarene University and I am glad to be a Trojan!"
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Trevecca Nazarene University. The classroom size, the professors and the atmosphere are excellent for any learning experience.  This school is awesome."
Alum,5,"Trevecca is a private, Christian university that helps you grow personally, academically, and spiritually. The university offers many spiritually deepening experiences such as chapel and prayer walks. Trevecca also has an outstanding faculty that are there to help you reach your full potential. They are not there to work on large research projects, but are there to help personally guide each student through mentoring and small classes. The professors have multiple contacts in Nashville at other universities and do all they can to provide meaningful internships to allow you to build your recognition. Trevecca is a great place to shape your future in a community that promotes personalized education and spiritual deepening."
Freshman,5,"Trevecca Nazarene University is a great school. It is a private Christian university so it is very GOD and Christian oriented. If you are looking for a university to go to and want to be surrounded by Christians and the word of GOD then Trevecca is the place to go. The academics is phenomenal, most of the sports teams are great and fun to watch, and the environment you are in is excellent."
Sophomore,5,"Trevecca Nazarene University is a university which provides excellent opportunities to grow academically, athletically, and spiritually. Furhtermore, the university has a strong and growing leadership program."
Niche User,5,"I have had nothing but great experiences while visiting Trevecca Nazarene University. I love their campus, although it is very small. Also, I like the variety of programs that they have available for students. I have not seen anything that I would change about Trevecca Nazarene University."
College Junior,5,"Like I said previously, I was offered a job right on the spot and my work schedule works with my class schedule perfectly. All employees take pride in their job and the school."
College Junior,5,All of my professors are extremely helpful and really care about me as a person! I was offered an on campus job right on the spot at orientation! I'm really excited about my schooling at Trevecca.
College Junior,5,"Trevecca  is extremely safe and has policies in place in case something bad were to happen. During orientation, they explained that an extremely low number of instances have occurred in the amount of time the school has been open."
College Junior,5,Everybody is so welcoming and so willing to help you with whatever you may need. The teachers and staff aren't just there to help better your future career but also your future as a Christian. Out of the three colleges I've been to; this is the best one yet!
College Freshman,5,"Fun, fun, fun...  No need for drugs or alcohol."
College Freshman,5,Good clean and sober activities.  You can have fun without drugs and alcohol and this school does it well.
College Freshman,5,Excellent variety to choose from.  You get out of it what you put into it.
College Freshman,5,"Dry campus.  If people sneak it in, we don't know about it unless directly involved"
College Freshman,5,"Only had experience so far with freshman orientation.  If that is an indication, this school is top notch."
College Freshman,5,Trevacca students are well known to businesses in Nashville .  Good work study relationship which I plan to take advantage of.
College Freshman,5,"Smaller campus, so easily secured.  Security is visible and accessible."
College Freshman,5,"It's great that laundry facilities are free...common areas are spacious, so waiting for laundry to get done is a social thing.  Pool tables, tvs, goose all, air hockey, great for guys."
College Freshman,5,"There are none, so no stigma associated with this on campus, which allows students to focus on other things and no pressure."
College Freshman,5,Was able to meet many of my professors at orientation and I am very excited.  Trevecca is a school you can count on preparing you for the real world and success in your field of study.
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy Trevecca Nazerene university. It has a variety of diverse students who are all different but also unique. I have never met anyone who was mean to me or disapproving. There are so many activities and clubs as well so you will never get bored and you can make many new friends. The professors are all very encouraging and when you ask them a question they always gives you helpful responses that will better your education. Trevecca isn't just a university, it's a community. I wish I could go to school there forever but I have three more years so I hope to make them last and count."
College Senior,5,"I absolutely love the professors, especially the professors in my field. They really care about me and want to see me succeed. Though the classes are challenging and stressful, I learn a lot and feel like I have gotten a lot out of my academic experience."
College Senior,5,"I've never feared for myself on campus at all. I never hear about anyone being assaulted, and the administration has recently taken steps to educate the students on how to handle or prevent sexual assault. Other than that, sometimes people's stuff gets stolen, but that's about it."
College Senior,5,The professors are really nice and seem to care about their students!
College Senior,5,"I absolutely love this school. I have had such a great experience with the faculty and staff. You can ask anyone for help and if they don't know, they will point you in the right direction!"
College Freshman,5,"I am nowhere near finished with my degree and have not yet started persuing an intership. But I do know that the alumni network is a big part of the funding for my school, which says a lot about the quality of a degree from this school. The CLCS (Center for Leadership, Calling, and Service) is a great place to go to get help. I've gone there for CLEP testing and to discuss how to graduate early. I do have to have an intership eventually, and I can already tell that my advisor will be there for me every step of the way to help me set that up and ensure that I'm put where I need to be."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely loved the professors at my school. They were all so passionate and unique. They made class exciting. I changed my major twice because of how awesome the teachers are. There is also a wide variety of classes offered that I wish I could take. There's very interesting English electives about super hero movies and fun film classes with movie-watching homework. And I love how small and intimate the class sizes generally are. It makes learning easier.
College Sophomore,5,The professors have worked in the industry that they are teaching
College Sophomore,5,The course is appropriate and the professors are more than engaging
College Sophomore,5,My experience from registration to class has been awesome. All the staff make sure they are available and the professors are awesome.
Junior,4,"The two years in which I have attended Trevecca Nazarene University have been an amazing experience! Since I first set foot on campus, I've been surrounded by a loving and accepting community, both by students and faculty. When my first semester began I was given enough information for extra help and other on-campus resources available to students.
Every faculty member is willing to help each student in reaching success and give the necessary advice to do so. Now there is the fact that Trevecca is a smaller campus, and will only offer certain degrees. Religious, intercultural, social justice, music, and worship studies seem to be the emphasis on campus. Speaking as a current business student, the business professors are well-experienced in what they teach. However, some aren't as professional in  teaching method and could use some improvement.
Overall, Trevecca pushes for community and I've certain felt part of the community on campus!"
Senior,4,"The online classes at Trevecca are pretty well; the university has great professors. Trevecca is a good place for support and small classroom, but in terms of diversity and life on campus is not very good."
Sophomore,4,"Trevecca offers strong academic programs and the professors are highly qualified. The community on campus is encouraging to be a part of, and allows students to make connections that may be beneficial after graduation. There are many opportunities to be involved in extracurricular activities and community service."
Sophomore,4,Trevecca lives up to it's motto of Christian Education. Christ is at the center of everything. What I would like to see change is more chances for Christ-centered bible studies outside the classroom
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the atmosphere of Trevecca. The community of people is amazing,  you constantly meet people who are genuinely interested in being friends and helping you through your college experience. The professors I’ve had classes with have been so kind and encouraging in our studies. They are there as mentors and have times they set out in their day to speak with students to make sure they are on a successful academic path."
Freshman,4,"Trevecca is such and awesome school. As soon as you walk on campus, you can feel how loving the environment is."
Freshman,4,"Great college. Small, but very cozy and friendly. Everyone is like family here. However, since it is quite small it can seem boring at times. Once you find your friend group however, you start to enjoy it here."
Sophomore,4,Great school although I'm only online they still give me the look and feel of actually at times being right there in class its great.
Junior,4,"I am very glad I decided to attend Trevecca. The main downsides are the cafeteria food and the limited housing/parking. The professors are great, the music and business schools are well established in those industries in Nashville, too."
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking for a small school with a beautiful campus in an urban setting, with a family environment that takes care of their students, Trevecca is the place to be. Whether you are apart of the christian faith or not, Trevecca accepts and welcomes all people. Everyone is kind to one another and being in the south, you can feel the southern hospitality. I would suggest however that there were more campus/student events both academically and socially. Overall, this christian university in the heart of Nashville brings light to people all over the world and is truly a place like no other."
Senior,4,I liked the community. A smaller campus where you became friends with all the students and the professors really care about you and know your name. The downside is that they are strict with rules.
Junior,4,"This was the only school I wanted to go to. I visited once during my high school years, and I fell in love with the campus. It is a registered arboretum in the state of Tennessee, and while my allergies sometimes don't like it, it is such a beautiful school. The faculty and staff are excellent. The professors take an interest in each student, and honestly want to see them grow and mature. Many professors are more than willing to take time to talk with the students after class just to get to know them."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere on campus and how close the community is. Everyone is friendly and the professors really care about the education of well-being of all the students.
Freshman,4,"Trevecca has a fantastic faculty with amazing programs of study. Professors take the time even in larger classes to really get to know all of their students and encourage them with their studies. The Student Government is very active and there are always ways to get involved on campus! They do a wonderful job of trying to make everyone feel included. 

Rated four stars because many of the buildings are not wheelchair friendly and difficult to access. This is not the best accessible campus. Also, the food leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone who lives on campus is required to be on a meal plan, and there are limited options other than a full meal plan. Overall it's overpriced for the quality."
Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore at Trevecca Nazarene University. I never wanted to go to another college when I visited Trevecca's campus. The campus is a certified arboretum and it is beautiful the three seasons. Academics are excellent with solid teaching and very nice and knowledgeable professors. Dining is average but dorms are excellent.
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely breath taking, and the people are always there to help you with whatever you are going through, the administration is very helpful with anything you need."
Sophomore,4,"Trevecca Is a great Nazarene university. There is a great sense of community here, and there are many events to go to. Many resources are also available on campus like the library, science labs and a tutoring center. From aspiring musicians to studious doctors, everything you'll need is more likely than not on campus grounds."
Sophomore,4,Just got done with my freshman year of college at Trevecca Nazarene University and I can say that it was one of the best years of my life. I had my ups and downs with some people but at the end of the day it was worth it.
Senior,4,Great university that provided the christian and educational aspect perfectly. I was a transfer student from another christian university and the change was not that noticeable. That is to say that I enjoyed it very much.
Graduate Student,4,"I'm working on my MBA and I have to admit, I'm really happy with my learning experience.  The classes are small and done in a cohort fashion.  Professors are usually quick to respond or contact students when something happens.  I've kept most of my books from my classes to reference when I graduate and I've already been able to ""publish"" some of the materials I've written for my classes after making some recommended tweaks.  I feel good about my education.  Trevecca's campus is small and feels safe at night even though it's located in a semi-questionable part of Nashville.  The only complaint I have is our academic advisor has switched out a couple times which has made it confusing to get a hold of my class schedule or to ask questions about it."
College Junior,4,"I haven't moved in yet, but I have visited and the buildings are up to date and clean!"
College Junior,4,There hasn't been a sporting event yet but the faculties are up to date and suggest that Trevecca takes pride in their sports team and/or intramural sports.
College Sophomore,4,I love the smaller class sizes and I thrive in that type of environment.  I feel like I have one on one experiences with my professors because of the small class sizes.
College Sophomore,4,There is opportunity for internships and several music majors have gone on to become famous.  I am excited for what my future holds.
College Sophomore,4,"I wish the dorm rooms were a little more spacious, but I love the ""suite"" lifestyle and it creates a sense of ""friendship"" when you have so many guys in one space.  Someone is always there for you to talk to when you need it."
College Sophomore,4,I like that they have intramural sports.  I wish that had a football team.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is small and creates a ""community"" experience and get you get to know everyone quickly."
College Sophomore,4,Very strict on drugs and alcohol
College Sophomore,4,The classes at Trevecca are kept relatively small and that makes it very easy to connect with the professor and get 1 on 1 time. Professor want to see you succeed!
College Sophomore,4,Trevecca Alumni are always on campus
College Freshman,4,"Trevecca has some sports, but not a lot.  Basketball, but not football, no swimming."
College Sophomore,4,I like living in Johnson hall. The RAs were great last year and the events we had were some of the best on campus. I didn't have really an problems with people that lived in the dorm hall. I was able to interact and enjoy watching one of my favorite TV shows downstairs with some people on sunday nights. The dorm rooms are sort of small but pretty clean and very dueable. The furniture is very convient to my living style and academiclly very helpful. We have to clean every week for a certain day and also have assigned things to clean so the enforcement on that is really good. It helps us be better rounded people. My roomates and suite mates were also really respectful and we hung out at times.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are great. Well prepared and experienced, most of them really care for the student to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,Campus is not gated. Community around is not so safe but school is pretty safe with campus security
College Sophomore,4,Trevecca Nazerene is a great school overall. There is now an increase in diversity on campus and it is just great especially coming from a diverse high school. The classrooms are average sized and the professors really want to see you succeed. They're open to questions and love them. The only downside is if you're not into a music major or want a different way to have fun each week then you're out of luck. Treveccas way of having a good time is by having students singing live almost every week. It's cool at the start but towards the end it's not
College Senior,4,"There are many employers that come to campus, but I have personally not taken a step towards jobs or internships quite yet."
College Senior,4,"Even in light of being on a questionable road, I feel very safe on campus. Health wise, I am fine, but it is sometimes a hit or a miss with the clinic being open."
College Senior,4,"I don't play sports, but the workout gym is nice!"
College Junior,4,"I looked around at several colleges about online courses and had a hard time getting someone to help me with the information needed to get enrolled. Trevecca online counselors were great and had my financing information and enrollment forms in no time at all.

Cathy"
College Freshman,4,"This past year, I can only think of one crime I heard about on campus. Two girls had their purses stolen by non-students as they were walking on campus. The campus security is very nice and always present. I feel safe with them always driving around and keeping an eye out."
College Freshman,4,"I'm sure it's great. I didn't go to a single game all year because I commute, but I know our soccer and baseball teams are really good. And I know that everyone who does attend the games gets super pumped about it by dressing in all purple and painting their faces; it's a big part of campus life."
College Freshman,4,"I chose to attend my school because it is a small, community oriented Christian university. I love all the professors; they have a way of making whatever they teach very interesting and applicable to real life. The small campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. They have very fun and interesting events and game nights (most of which I didn't attend because I commute, but I still appreciate the uniqueness of it all)."
College Sophomore,4,I have evening classes and when I leave security is present
College Freshman,4,"I believe the responsibility falls more on my shoulder than on theirs once I graduate. The school does offer great opportunities for internship. As for recruiters, my husband was recruited his sophomore year and it's still working for that company."
College Freshman,4,"I didn't rate excellent because I would like to point out you can only be safe while inside the campus. If you dare to walk out alone, you're entering an extremely dangerous/shady area."
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience is great! However, I would not recommend non-Christians to attend this school. You will definitely feel left out since the school has a strong and solid Christian base. 

It's a small school and professors care and follow up on your achievements. They're there for you and will do whatever they can to make sure you know their subject once the semester is over."
College Junior,4,"The registration process is super simple, students can pick their courses online, go and talk to their advisor to make sure everything is correct, and then the academic advisor then approves everything in the system. Workload typically depends on the course and the professor."
College Junior,4,"I have only ever heard of one situation on campus where two students were mugged. Campus Security handled the situation very well by sending out an electronic/text alert on the situation and what actions were being taken place to handle the situation and prevent it from ever happening again. I have never felt threatened by anybody on campus and I do feel safe on campus at during the day and at night. I have no issues walking to places by myself at anytime of the day. I love that the campus offers to let students take a seamster of a self defense class, and I feel it offers students a way to stay safe on campus. I have taken the course and I believe that it better prepared me on what to do if I am ever in a situation on campus where I am left to fend for myself. Security locks all academic building at 10 pm and all residential building are locked at midnight and students must then contact the residents assistant to get into the residents dorm building. The library is opened to students until midnight and 2 am during the weeks of finals but is then locked my library staff. Campus secretly drives around campus from 10pm to 8 am and are walking aound campus a lot of the time as well. Sexual assault is never an issue on campus. Campus is all together a very safe place."
College Junior,4,"I enjoy going to my schools baseball and basketball games. This season for basketball, we have had more students involved than past years. We have a student led group called the Moore Maniacs and it has been a ton of fun this season. We have some cheers we do and during half time we play some games such as musical chairs and get kids involved with half court shoots. At the end of every game, win or lose, we all come out on the court with the team and sing the ala mater. This season there as been a lot of more school spirit as well and it has been great to see. Our cheerleading team gets more pumped about games, students and other sports teams are in more attendance that usual as well. While sports aren't the big thing at TNU, they're still fun."
College Junior,4,I personally don't know much about the sports facilities. However the coaching staff is passionate and driven.
College Junior,4,There are plenty of extracurricular activates lead by the students.
College Sophomore,4,"Many people say the don't like Trevecca, but I seriously have nothing negative bad to say about it. They have helped me in everything I need. I was not eligible for any sort of financial aid because of my immigration status. Trevecca helped me out so much and believed in me regardless of my ACT scores or GPA. I don't live on campus and most, if not all, of my professors are great with communication."
College Junior,4,"The Dorms aren't the best to live in, but they are large Suite's with multiple rooms each housing 2 people except one which houses 1 person. Lots of oppurtunties for friends because of the suite set up. Everything is relatively close together. No extremely long treks to get to class or anything like that. Really nice buildings, especially compared to the part of town around it."
College Freshman,4,"It was a transition to live in a dorm but it gave me the opportunity to experience my first year of college with other female freshman. Our dorm included a small fridge and a microwave which allowed us to make food in our rooms when we did not have time to go to the café. I was lucky to have had my dorm paid for by the school my freshman year, however, the cost of living is very expensive. The buildings are older but I believe the school is in the process of building a new dorm. I was able to get to all my classes in at least 5 to 10 minutes which was very covenant."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are nicer than some I've seen on other College campuses. Also, for every four girls there is a bathroom ( which I love, being a girl and all). There is toilet paper, a vaccume cleaner, and cleaning supplies in each floor's closet! The social atmosphere is amazing! With all the events that the Residence Association provides within each hall, there are more than enough opportunities to interact with all the other girls. As far as the guys dorms go, I think its about the same. The cost is not so bad and the housing process is quite simple."
College Sophomore,4,I believe Trevecca follows through with all rules and regulations out into place and do the best to look out for its students.
College Freshman,4,I love the dorm life at Trevecca. A few modifications could be made.
College Sophomore,4,"Trevecca is a school that caters to a specific kind of person; the rules are pretty strict, but if you are willing to get past that, the people, the professors, and the administration are pretty fantastic when you make the effort."
College Sophomore,4,"In Nashville, you have great options, but considering the place that the campus is located, it takes a bit to get to the really good places."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though Trevecca is not in the middle of the safest place in Nashville, the campus itself feel really safe; even though I am a nineteen year old girl, I feel almost perfectly safe walking across campus at night. If I feel unsafe, I know that I can always call security and they will walk me to my dorm, or anywhere else on campus."
Freshman,2,"Trevecca Nazarene University is a Christian based college found near downtown Nashvile, Tn. The students and staff are extremely friendly and are always willing to help. You learn a lot about God and why you are suppose to be in college while earning your degree."
College Sophomore,2,People from music related mayors hardly get involved with people form other mayors
College Freshman,2,No one cares about any sports but basketball
College Freshman,2,There school is overly strict and in a terrible neighborhood
College Sophomore,2,"The hub is greasy, the cafe doesn't have variety, and we don't have healthy after hour snacks."
College Sophomore,2,I love trevecca but the caf is amazingly bad. I don't think it should keep you from going to school here but just don't expect your mamas cooking
College Senior,2,"There is not a lot of variety for those needing gluten free options, also the hours for dinning are not very useful if you have a night class or a late lunch hour ""class"". Hot food is only put out at certain times."
College Senior,2,The area that is directly surrounding the campus isn't the safest. Some of the are affordable housing projects so college students wouldn't really apply for that.
College Junior,2,"The kitchen staff are nice, but not very helpful. They've needed to change food service for several years now. It's just not very good food. The options for people with allergies are very limited. It's also very hard to eat during dining hall hours. It really should be a 24 hour food service, but they only serve at specific meal times. If you have a class or other obligation, you're out of luck."
College Junior,2,"Socially it's great to live on campus, but the housing needs some serious attention. Everything is old and breaking down. Even worse, they don't seem to be in any hurry to fix it."
Recent Alumnus,2,Sports are not really a big deal at Trevecca. Sometimes the athletes are the subject of many jokes around campus. The people on campus who have the most fans are the musicians.
College Senior,2,The facilities are very clean and nice. The athletic center could use some work though. Athletes and students share the same workout gym so it can get pretty crowded at times. It is also very small and limited for such a well kept up school. The library is pretty big for the size of the school so there is plenty of room in there no matter what. There are some campus activities that are fun but that normally takes place the first week of school and after that its dead. Also most students go home or else where on the weekends so the campus is pretty much dead.
College Sophomore,2,Process Could Have Been Better – The financial aid process could have gone a lot smoother
College Freshman,2,"Trevecca is located in the worst part of Nashville, and the outskirts at that. However, you are close to downtown and great attractions if you find it worth going off campus."
College Senior,1,We have no Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Junior,1,we don't have a greek life at my campus
College Junior,1,Let me live off campus if I want to.
College Junior,1,"Honestly this is the worst part about Trevecca. One of the reasons I go to a Christian College is not be around to much partying, but its ridiculous here. I agree with a lot of the rules, but a lot of them are to much. I appreciate that the dorms are not co-ed but visitation is to strict. If you're even in the midst of alcohol you can get social probation. Two words for Dean Lilienthal, Chill Out."
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't provide daily transportation options.  The city of Nashville also has poor public transit. It is essential to have a car if you want to venture off campus.
College Freshman,1,The Greeks do not have an effect on the social life on my campus.
College Junior,1,You pay 12$ a meal for food that taste horrible I'm sure jail food is better than that mess! Half the time the food is over/under cooked the pizza taste like cardboard!
College Junior,1,You can't graduate in 4 yrs they will screw you over to get more money from you!
College Sophomore,1,"Most days, the computers at Trevecca Nazarene University are extremely slow. It takes 5 minutes just for the computer to load your material"
College Freshman,1,"Southern Style Mishap – Our food on campus is horrible.  And students will say that too.  There's not a big variety; I find myself eating salads and cereal everyday because there's nothing GOOD to eat.  Just southern style grease, and oil."
College Sophomore,1,"There really isn't any. Unless you're a commuter or you are a certain age, or if you lie."
College Sophomore,1,"The apartments get broken into and are dirty and unkemp, its old and ragged and poorly taken care of."

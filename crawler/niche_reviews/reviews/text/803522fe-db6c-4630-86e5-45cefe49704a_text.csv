Sophomore,5,All my online classes have gone really well. When we went remote due to Covid 19 my teachers went out of their way to help us with questions we had and still found ways to make it fun. The other students were also very interactive in the online forums which not only made the class easier but significantly more enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,"I'm having a great experience here. All of my professors have been nothing but kind, caring, and invested in my learning. The other students have been nice and there is a large student life that is working to make the atmosphere even more welcoming and inviting to everyone."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy learning and this has been a great place to start. I am 25 and didn't start college until this year. Great classes, teachers, and town."
Sophomore,5,"Alpena Community College is a great college to start your education. I was able to finish all my prerequisites for a low cost! The professors are amazing and able to work with students one on one. The community surrounding the area is very kind, lots to do and full of life. The class sizes are small and allow for the students and professors to make friendly personal connections. There are a lot of important utilities offered to the students here as well, such as a computer lab, library, dining commons, gym, workout room, and more!"
Alum,5,"I love the range of programs offered at ACC.  For such a small community college, there are multiple career and technical programs that a student can enroll in, complete, and have a nearly guaranteed job in a well-paying field.  Without requiring transfer or additional studies, a student can graduate with immediate employment in nursing, welding, utility tech, concrete tech, auto body repair, and many others."
Freshman,5,Alpena Community College is an excellent school to attend. All of my professors thus far have been fair and knowledgeable. The board of directors is willing to converse with students as well as do what they can to improve the school. A welcoming community that is open to varying opinions.
Junior,5,I love the small class sizes at Alpena Community College. The student/professor ratio makes a friendly learning environment and professors are often available to their students.
Sophomore,5,Alpena Community College is an amazing college. They are very personable when it comes to the classroom. The smaller size classes makes it a better learning environment because it makes it easier for the teachers to make one on one time with their students
Freshman,5,"Alpena Community College offers extremely professional educational services. For a small town college they offer a wide range of courses and degrees. Every professor I have met is helpful, caring and kind. Administrative representatives go out of their way to ensure everything runs smooth."
Freshman,5,"The professors and staff are extremely helpful in providing a successful learning environment. The college provides a wide variety of classes that can be transferred to many different universities. Also, they have a great nursing program. The science department at this community college is great, and offers some high level courses."
Sophomore,5,"ACC is a great college!  Great professors and coaches!  The teachers are very willing to answer questions and help during their office hours.   Administration is active, out and about on campus, accessible."
Alum,5,"This is a great place to dual enroll while still in high school. Ahead in your high school credits? Then you should definitely consider using your time wisely and instead of wasting it on a useless high school elective, attending ACC to get that jump start on college."
College Junior,5,"There was some difficulty in scheduling my classes this semester, but other than that scheduling for classes is very simple!"
College Junior,5,The school makes considerable effort to notify students about internships and military enrollment. The alumni on campus is greatly honored and treated with the up-most respect!
College Junior,5,"An almost exotic selection of courses offered, class sizes are small, professors work one-on-one with students to help them succeed."
College Junior,5,"Workload is reasonable, teachers work one-on-one."
College Junior,5,"Unlike a large university, ACC is a great place!"
College Junior,5,There are clinicals each semester that students participate in to get a feel for our career pathway. The hands on learning is the best way to get your education I believe. The amount of students that apply each semester for the program shows how well it is doing.
College Junior,5,The program is very selective giving lots of work to keep students active in their learning. The opportunities to participate in labs and clinicals in our own small town is great as well.
College Junior,5,I love the small town atmosphere and the small class sizes. The school offers a great environment to learn and I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.
Freshman,4,ALPENA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A GREAT COLLEGE TO EITHER GET STARTED AND TRANSFER OR TO FINISH AND GET A DEGREE IN ONE OF THEIR PROGRAMMES  LIKE NURSING. THEY HAVE SMALL AND PERSONAL CLASSES WITH PROFESSORS OFFERING HELP AS YOU MAY NEED IT.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy how small the campus is.
 It is easy to navigate and people are friendly. When my car broke down a girl from class and a professor offered to drive me across campus if I needed it to make my class on time.  They want to see you succeed and will check up on you in the halls or after class. Very personable.

The second reason I chose Alpena again years later was the diversity of online classes. I am a mother of 2 children and one on the way. It is difficult to manage going to school full time, working, balancing time for your family and driving time plus school time away. Online classes allow me flexibility to be with my family and meet their physically and emotional needs, while maintaining financial success by living within our means and bettering our future. I recommend.

What I'd like to see change would be the email response time. 
 When I need an answer via email it can take up to a week to get a response. However if you call or drop in they are very responsive and quick."
Sophomore,4,"Its so easy to sign up for online classes and set up everything you need for online including meetings, online lab demonstrations and face to face academic planning.
 
 Webex is easy to install and professors are very active. You also use it for classes and tests in real time. I haven't had it lag yet.

I am pleased that they offer online classes now and so much has been added in the last few years. I am a mother of 2 and expecting soon. It is easier for me to work from home as much as possible and still provide time and care to my children. I am attending Alpena Community College online to provide a better future for my children. I couldn't do that as well if I were taking more time and money away from them temporarily.

Financially I am able to live easier because I am not making the 56 mile one way trip every day or every other day to Alpena. I am saving money in gas, wear and tear on my car  and baby sitting fees that would accumulate if I attended classes on campus."
Freshman,4,"Nice community college. Dorms are nice, 4 person townhouses with private bedrooms and two baths. Easy walking to downtown shopping and restaurants. Small class sizes. Easy to get around and very affordable  great place to start your career."
Sophomore,4,Alpena Community College is a very nice college and a very good starter school. The tuition is  affordable especially for north east Michigan. Most instructors are helpful and the classes are ran pretty good. I am prepared for my next phase of education and perusing my bachelors else where.
Junior,4,"I liked attending Alpena Community College because of the smaller class sizes, which enabled students to have more one on one time with the professors. The faculty at Alpena Community College is extremely intelligent and helpful! My only complaint about Alpena Community College would be the ever-rising tuition rates. Part of the campus is located right on the river, so the surrounding area is certainly beautiful!"
Graduate Student,4,"Alpena community college is small in size but love the individual attention you get during and after class. The area of Alpena community college is beautiful and there are a lot of things s to do. Alpena community college has a hockey team, basketball team(boys and girls). Those sports students get to go see the games for free."
Junior,4,I have been going to ACC for my whole college experience and although its located in a small town is has a certified program through detroit mercy and one of the best concrete tech programs in the world. It has a very clean and friendly campus but the food is pretty bland and winters are rough.
College Junior,4,The area that i am perusing allows me to readily access the job market straight out of college.
College Junior,4,Normal but with the small town feel as well as the encouraging staff.
College Junior,4,The alumni is treated with high regard. Jobs are available to students who seek them such as in the cafeteria.
College Junior,4,The program I am in has a survey for all grads of the program and also one is sent to their employer to see how their education is in the workforce. The alumni of ACC are found all around the world and are easy to talk to about their education. The job prosepects especially in our own town are great. They are always hiring new nurses.
College Junior,4,The majority of the teachers enjoy their jobs and what they are teaching. They teach to the students level but also try to challenge students to be the best they can be.
College Student,4,"I really enjoy how small the school is. It's not rally by their choice, but it's nicer than going to a university at the beginning and struggling with classes and home life."
College Student,4,"I struggle with online classes, because I'm use to hearing a response and knowing if a tone needs to be changed a certain way.  Online school takes away from that, but I can go a bit more at my own pace with work."
College Senior,4,"For bigger classes, they usually have many days and times open for the class. But higher level classes, there is usually one set time for it. Ive never really had a problem with scheduling, Ive always found classes that fit my schedule."
College Senior,4,"The courses you do take are usually pretty easy if you're a hard worker. Main classes like English 111 are usually big but the higher level classes are smaller and smaller. It helps with one on one stuff if you're into that. There are not many classes offered if you're in acting, humanities, english, music, etc..."
College Senior,4,Teachers are decent and willing to help out as they can
College Student,4,"My major is in Art, we have amazing facilities, a great CGI lab, design studio, sculpture and ceramics lab. Also my primary instructor happens to be my advisor, that has helped me stay on top of my grades and any other issues that has come up."
College Junior,4,With this small community college there is a lot of time for one on one assistance if necessary and the teachers use it well. They have many open office hours if any question need to be answered. We also have a student center where you can get extra help. The library is mostly alway accessible and user friendly along with the open computer labs with free printing. There are not a lot of sport teams so the gym is almost always empty for whatever activities. Next to the gym is a workout room for the students use. 
College Junior,4,"Alpena is also great in this aspect. They have on their website a place to schedule and rearrange classes as you wish. However if you miss the early registration deadline it can be tricky to fit you in the classes you want. However, I am usually early to schedule and I never yet have had an issues findin a time to fit my classes in. "
College Junior,4,"Alpena does do a great job with actively keeping the students informed on universities that they may enroll in to further there degree. They have bulletin boards posted up around the school with different universities and often may times I see that thy actually have college representatives come in to talk one on one with the students. Another great example of Alpena being great at this is they set up free tours with the students to go visit the college they want, all expenses paid. "
College Sophomore,4,The student services program is phenominal! Their library isn't short of not too shabby either.
College Junior,4,The professors are very interested in seeing each student learn. They bring the real world into the class room. The campus is spread out so you get a little bit of a walk between classes. Everyone is friendly and the staff are always trying to help.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are some students here just to receive the financial aid checks. However, most are hard working. I was mostly math science, and that department is on par with any university, as is the work ethic of students there. Most are traditional, white students, but there are a few Russians, one Brit and a handful of different ethnicities. Most students work 20-30 hours a week on average."
College Junior,4,"Most people at my school are very focused on getting into a larger college or university, so they really dont focus on their social life and are not too open to meeting new people."
College Junior,4,"The student services center is amazing! It offers so many great tools for students like free one on one tutoring, open tutoring labs, a computer lab and a quite place to do homework."
College Junior,4,Very good school. Excellent stepping stone to get into a university.
College Junior,4,They have a lot of great services for a small community college.
College Junior,4,For the most part scheduling has been quite easy.  I haven't had any real issues with transferring from OCC to ACC.  I have only encountered one scheduling conflict which meant I had to take another instructor.  But overall I found the experience quite satisfactory.
College Junior,4,The education I am receiving is worth the expense.  I haven't utilized financial aid as of yet but I will be looking into it very soon.   I have been told by several sources that the nursing program at ACC is a very good one and I am very happy to be looking into attending there.
College Senior,4,"Alpena Community College is a great community college to attend for students. Classes range from all time of the day making scheduals flexible. The professors are encouraging and very willing to help students with any problems. If I was going to have to choose which school I was going to attend again, I would still attend ACC."
College Senior,4,Alpena Community College is a great place to start your further education. When it is close to home it is less expensive than going to a big college. The campus is small and enjoyable.
College Junior,4,Services Are Ok. I have not had to use their computers much.  I have been made aware of concerns of space on their networks.  I have not experienced any issues personally.
College Junior,4,Facilities Are Pretty Good – The facilities are pretty good.  They are relatively modern and get updated. We have wi-fi in the student services center and a library and gym.  There are dorms as well although I do not live there.   I haven't found anything about the facilities I do not like.
College Sophomore,4,i like the feel of the campus here and how the staff takes care of you.
College Junior,4,"Many Older Students – Many of my classmates are older adults going back to school to try to either find a job, or find a better one than they currently have."
College Junior,4,"The library is a great place to hang out with friends, use the computers or the quiet space in the back for studying. Free tutoring is available for any subject offered at the college. The gym is well equipped and maintained."
College Freshman,4,the flexability of the classes at ACC is very good there is almost nothing that doesnt workout
College Freshman,4,I believe that your tution expence is fair compared to the community around you. the financial aid process is a little confusing to new and incoming students.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many credits do not transfer to other schools, I know this because many of my classmates were complaining about this.  The school was not very flexible, they stated you should not even work if you attend nursing classes, they said it was a full time job, and it was because of all the busy work, I have thrown away a ton of homework after graduating, literally 3 big totes full of notebooks, handouts, concept maps, ect. My experience at ACC has not been convenient in any way whatsoever."
Recent Alumnus,2,"No employers recruited the campus for nurses, students were invited to the local hospital where clinical were held for recruiting but I have no interest in working at ARMC. Value of the degree earned is not good considering how much time I have invested in this degree. I am disgusted with ACC and how they were so quick to say the nursing program was a 2 year degree but I spent over 2 years taking prerequisites and over 2 years waiting to get into classes was overcharged in the process.  With all the time I have spent there are many other fields I would have chosen if I would have known I would spend this much time towards an associates degree. With the time I have invested in school I should be looking at  a possible six figure income but that will not happen in nursing, I can guarantee that.  I could have easily gone for a speech pathologists degree and be making six figures.  I feel ACC let me down in so many ways it is unforgivable. I did not even attend the pinning ceremony for my RN degree. I will never step foot on that campus again for anything!  I really don't have anything good to say unfortunately."
College Senior,2,ACC doesnt cater much to the arts or humanities. I am an English major and there are probably only 3 or 4 higher level classes for an English major. Transferring is definitely a must. There are no internship opportunities unless you are into something medical.
College Junior,2,"The diversity at this college is merely existant. Yes, it is a community college but the school itself is boring with barely anything to do. Everytime I see students they are quietly huddled in the corner, minding there phones or books. I wish there was more to do. I did get a job at the bookstore so it is time to save up enough money to move on from the community college experience. "
Niche User,1,"After a 13 year break from college, I returned to school figuring Id have to pay my summer semester. To my suprise they offered financial aid to me, i was overjoyed. I passed my two summer classes both with an A. Had fall classes lined up, books ordered and the Friday before online classes start I get a nice letter saying Im sol theyre pulling my financial aid. Why? Because of grades 13 years ago. How much did i miss the 2.0 by? .07 yep. Guess the 4.0 semester didnt matter, just enough to lure me back to pull the rug last minute after proving my dedication. Nice move, so not only are you out federal funding, but also my book money. Good job, really got one on me. Furthermore, I can transfer and guess what get financial aid! So guess I should thank you, you lost a student and more money (which from what Ive seen online you really cant afford). So way to hold a grudge for over a decade ago and you're the one that lost out."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I did take online courses at ACC, only a couple though, Humanities. They were a lot of work but from what I understand most online classes are more work than a classroom held class.  I never met face to face with my instructor. I am really indifferent to the online courses at ACC. It was a lot of busy work from what I can remember."
Recent Alumnus,1,Maybe ACC has other degrees where they supply job info to grads but not in the nursing program.  I did network a little during my first few years but when finishing up my RN I was so pissed off to just be at the college I was not in the mood to network or even converse with my classmates for that matter.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I still cannot believe some of the things that happened at ACC while I attended.  The couple good instructors are overshadowed by the overwhelmingly arrogant yet pretty much useless instructors.  If you sent an email or left a voicemail it was all in vain because you were not going to get any type of answer.  Basically you were stuck dealing with the problem at the next class when you would physically see the instructor.  Sometimes this did not work out for the best obviously. My classmates dealt with this as well of course.  Some instructors were also very vague with their assignments,  I failed one of my psych exams because I was wasting time working on a paper where the instructor drastically changed what he wanted the paper to cover and how he wanted it layed out There was no way to change what I had already done I had to start from scratch, and this was not an unusual occurrence.  My classmates all had to deal with it too and many were not happy.  Class size was small in the nursing program was prerequisites had more students, but this is relative, still small classes really.  In my opinion the class size does not matter if the quality of the instructors and programs suck.  Most instructors 95% would read off power points for lecture, not exciting or dynamic by any means.  The vast amount of negative overshadows the few positive things so much I could not possibly recommend ACC to anyone and in fact that I why I am here typing this review.  If it was a good experience I am sure I would not be doing this. Its not just the instructors who make this a negative experience, its the whole college, from the registrars office to the deans, I had no problem with the janitors. Besides them everyone else made the experience negative in one way or another.  To the point where I truly believe some of these people are sick. To the point they enjoyed messing up other peoples lives. I've dealt with passive aggressive people before but ACC is bursting at the seems with them."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The workload at ACC was intense, much of it busy work.  It varied from class to class though, there was fluff classes mixed in with the nursing classes, like Nursing Management, fluff compared to the meat and potatoes of nursing.  In my last semester the psych instructor decided for whatever reason to make the class extremely hard and two students including myself failed.  I failed by 1.23%, coincidently there was a student who had failed the previous semester as well.  This was the only class to my knowledge students failed out of. Another negative about ACC is if you fail a class you end up in a remediation type of program in which you must meet with a committee and show them work you have done to get ready to retake the class. The committee denied me my first time, adding over another  year to the length of time it would take me to get my degree.  They would not let me take psych until I made a new appointment with them the following year. The psych instructor told me the committee wanted to see you did a lot of work over the break, I had an awesome 60 page study guide I had made for the meeting. Right from the start all the instructors were attacking me and my study guide, saying I just copied out of the book, ect.. I still find it hard to believe they actually think they were helping me by holding me back for another year, not a year another year on top of the years they had already cost me. I could write a book about all the negative things that happened, there is so much detail I am not able to write in here because I am limited space for each section. There were a couple good instructors but that doesn't matter, the bad apples spoil the whole bunch and believe me ACC is rotten to the core. If you decide to attend there is a good chance you will experience some of the same tragedies as me, I would bet my life on it. I believe the majority of the faculty at ACC are not out to help students but are out to help themselves and improve profits."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I cannot think of much more that could have gone wrong for me at ACC. I was overcharged (wrongfully charged as non resident when I was resident) for 3 semesters costing me thousands in tuition I should not have payed and of course they would not give a refund.  The wording on the registration was misleading, I believe intentionally and I was told multiple times by registrars office I was getting charged the rate for a resident.  They cost me extra money by having me and my classmates take classes that were not needed for our degree by saying they would be needed by the time we graduated, they were not needed in the long run though so more time and money wasted.  Some instructors literally refuse to answer emails, voicemails or even hand you back your work.  My portfolio was missing a large portion of the work I did because my instructor never gave our work back to us or even met with like she was supposed to to review our clinical performance.  I never signed the paperwork for my clinical evaluation because I never had one. Simply pathetic.  The instructors at this college think they can do whatever they want and apparently they are right because to my knowledge there have been no ramifications yet. 

I was held up over a year at the beginning of my nursing program because of misinformation the college gave me.  Add another year on at the end because of misinformation a instructor gave me.  I have nothing but bad things to say about ACC.  If I could go back I would have not chose ACC, but once you start a nursing program you must finish it there, so they got ya.  The student is stuck putting up with their B.S. and jumping through their hoops if they want their degree which I finally have after almost 7 years. I could have gotten a degree for speech pathology in this time and be making much much more than nurses make. The worst part is I still want to pursue my bachelors but I am burned out on school.  My negative experience at ACC has taken much of my drive away."
College Freshman,1,"Awful computers, awful wifi, need more people interested."
College Freshman,1,"Needs far more work, better wifi, better computers, more people interested in me."
College Freshman,1,"Awful but with a few bright moments, would suggest it to college freshmen."

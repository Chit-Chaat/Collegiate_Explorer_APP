Graduate Student,5,"I loved attending here. The school actually cares about students' majors while focusing on the importance of cognitive growth. I attended 3 other colleges prior, none provided the interpersonal education and services that Boricua College did. This was the only school I was able to learn without feeling like I'm just another income to an establishment. I recommend this school to those who have a hard time focusing, the classes are small. I also recommend it to those with a busy schedule, the school and teachers are flexible and understanding. A lot of writing is necessary to pass the semesters but you'll for sure learn how to write a proper essay of any size."
Freshman,5,Boricua college in the Manhattan campus has amazing people and facilitator are really nice especially ms. Luz Soliz she won’t give up on you I’m in the bachelor program doing human service and so far it like family there a few cons they should be more computer in the library and should move faster
Freshman,5,"Im a transfer student from a CUNY school and i must admit, i love this school. Its small with with less than 20 students in each class. We all treat eachother like family and help one another. The best decision i made was transfering to this school to continue higher education."
Junior,5,"Boricua has a unique history as the first private Latino-Hispanic college on the U.S. mainland, specifically designed to meet the educational needs of Puerto Ricans and other Spanish-speaking people. Located in New York City, with its first Campus in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, a second Campus located in the historic Audubon Terrace of Manhattan’s Upper West Side and a third Campus in the Melrose-South Bronx section of the Bronx, the College typically enrolls over 1,200 full-time students in programs leading to an Associate in Arts, Associate in Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, and Master of Science degrees."
Senior,5,"Boricua college is an amazing school for anyone. It is a small school where everyone knows your name. You wouldn’t just be a number in the building. The faculty really engage in conversation with their students, like family."
Sophomore,5,Smaller classroom therefore it is easier for a  facilitator to help you with your work. Everyone there is pleasant and the professor make it their business to see you succeed. Also the building is very clean
College Junior,5,It is great to be allowed to move freely without the constraints of a traditional college.  Here at Boricua they work with ones one reponsibilities to accomodate both one's personal responsibilities to their educational advancement and responsibilies. Success is the one thing promised here.
College Junior,5,From my experience their is always employment opportunities offered for students and a vast number of the staff are alumni so I personally can not expand on this issue.
College Junior,5,"One of the courses is a one on one with the main facilitator that is a professor and may be a doctor in their field.  This one on one guides you through the curriculum and point out strenghts and weakness to work on.  The housrs are suffieicent and they are not overbearing.  during mid terms and finals each individual colloquium class gather a brunch to discuss the mid term experience and at the final, our experience during the past ful semester and our plans and hopes for the next semester.  Something that we look forward to and look forward to succedding and excelling at."
College Junior,5,"Having various campuses throughout the five boro's of NYC there is a better chance to move around throughout the city and discover all the opportunities of every campus as well the diverse neighborhoods and their residents. At my campus there are information bulletin Boards on every level where there is always many new posts, updates, career opportunities posted, every day. During any award ceremnony all campus' are invited to attend where the atmosphere is cordial and one feels at home, like they belonged to the campus. All are treated as one school."
College Junior,5,"Boricua College has some of the most knowledgable and experienced professor's any student will need.  They teach using the regular textbooks yet create an atmoshpere where te student feels like they have actually been there, when we are learning history as an example such as during the american revolution and all the debate's that arose out of that decision to revolt against the british king. When it is poerty and culture of the past 40 years written by our local poets we get to delve into the history of the poets as well as their surroundings and stuggles."
College Junior,5,"My first year at Boricua was eye opening, considering the myths that abound concerning colleges and the college experience. Everyday of class there was another new experience to look forward to.  Here during the first semester all students must recieve the Perceptual Development 1 course that allows the students to visit the five boroughs and attend events that are offered.  Occasionally these events are created inhouse, where possible to help develop critical thinking as well as a better understanding of subjects that are on the schedule, such as in arts,culture,differences in society.  It is a great school for people like myself that have not attended a classroom in over 34 years."
College Freshman,5,the professor are very attentive to the students needs
College Freshman,5,teachers are amazing and take the time to explain if you don't understand
College Freshman,5,"The faculty mad me feel important and know me by name and are very helpful. They get joy out of seeing us there students succeed, which is a nice and encouraging feeling you don't get at a cuny school which your just a number. I am glad i go to boricua it has changed my outlook on colleges in a postive way, and has impacted my life on a whole other level."
College Sophomore,5,I agree that school is the best  because it gives students a sense if I can accomplish.
College Senior,5,My esperience has been great the staff makes the experience so easy to go through because whatever help you need they are there to walk you through it . The schedule convience is definitely great for a mother of one who is also working and locations of the schools are also good because you can reach them by train or bus very local .
College Senior,5,"I loved my colloquium professor. She was very helpful, knowledgeable, and flexible. The professors I came across with in the hall ways were very friendly and willing to help. I love the environment in this school. the class sizes were decent and not too big. The classes are very organized."
College Junior,5,"the best part of my school is the fact that its student center, individualization and colloquium"
College Junior,5,"very happy and greatfull, most definitely will continue my schooling in this school.."
Junior,4,Boricua college is a Great school.  Small classes professors gets to know you and your strengths and weaknesses.
Junior,4,Boricua college is an amazing college the staff as well as the professors make sure you feel comfortable.  Seniors make freshmen’s feel welcomed at all time. The school is surrounded with positivity makes the students strive for greatness. The students are able to work all together as a team and make the school environment feel safe. Although it would be nice if the school would be bigger so that dorms can be available. For the students who are coming out of state who are interested in the school.
Recent Alumnus,4,It has been amazing so far.
Recent Alumnus,4,Its various depending how you may work and it will be back up work.

Recent Alumnus,4,The interaction here with students together and the work is great
Recent Alumnus,4,Majoring in Human Services has always been my dream career because I have always wanted to help individuals with necessary needs that need to be situated an accomplished.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Boricua college has became a great school environment for me. Here I learned to prepare myself for an intensive career goal. I learned to write modules in a specific way and how to understand a passage for not only what it is written but for the outside world. The faculty are always on top of the students to make sure they stay on task and lead in the right path. Faculty are always understanding to certain situation where students feel they are trapped or stuck in a specific subject.

  The students are well respected and have a character of helping others, and this is an environment where I know I know I can relate to because I am the same type of way as well."
Recent Alumnus,4,Class sizes are very small.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The modules take a lot of work, but once you get those done the rest of the semester is a breeze."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a great school and a different experience. If you want an individualized experience this is the school to go with. If you want sports teams, state of the art facilities, and full classes you might want to consider another place."
College Senior,4,"The class sizes are good for me (about 20 students or less), professors are always available and welcoming when time of need arises. The quality of courses are sufficient, however the variety of course can use some help, especially in the Business Administration area."
College Senior,4,"I honestly enjoy the college experience at Boricua, as it is indeed unique in its learning process, especially with the amount of faculty support available. I would not mind choosing Boricua College as my school all over again, only issue may be the limited number of areas of study."
Recent Alumnus,4,I like my school but hate the modules every cycle.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Boricua College is a wonderful small college. As a student I was very impress with staff. Everyone make you feel welcome and also everyone are very helpful. Boricua College does not offer remedial classes, do not look at any SAT scores, and their admissions test does not determined if you will be able to enroll to college. Also, Boricua College is a great college because professors and faculty are involved in your education. Everyone make sure that your are passing classes, and if you in risk  failing they all try to work together for the student not to fail. All i can say is great thing about the college. Everyone is so nice, helpful and caring. I recommend Boricua College to everyone."
Recent Alumnus,4,The schools strong point is on the convenience of schedule
Recent Alumnus,4,The career studies in the school are good!
Recent Alumnus,4,My internship was what made a difference in the education!
Recent Alumnus,4,The school works well with each student independently!
College Freshman,2,I do not get the a student center at my school
College Junior,2,"The school does have math tutoring Classes for English and math. The only group we have is the student Organization no other groups or activity, Organizations. The facilitators help the students understand. Great class size. Treated like family with love and care"
College Junior,2,"I am not the happiest with the, however i like the learning process."
College Freshman,2,"Classes/ Curriculum – In my school, the classes are very flexible. But there are hardly any classes being given to the students. There are people complaining that there aren't enough classes being given out. I know that we're suppose to be happy that we don't have a lotof classes, but it mak no sense to be at school for 3 hours and then go home to do the work. There needs t be more classes so that the students can get more credits."
College Freshman,2,"Computer Labs – There is only 1 computer lab in the school and the wifi has a password on it. If the students want to use the computers, than they're better off going to the Library or a friend's house. There aren't enough computers in the lab. Most of them don't work. In all my classes, I have to type a paper. I can't type a paper without a computer. I have to go to a friend's house to do all my work. Having my own computer would make my college work easier."
Graduate Student,1,"I loved my year at Boricua College...I had some issues with some professors but that happens at any college. The SAD part is after graduation. I submitted all documentation and passed all my exams. However, AFTER FOUR MONTHS I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE COLLEGE RECOMMENDATION to obtain my certification!!!!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no online courses at Boricua
Recent Alumnus,1,The school doesn't  offer this type of programs besides the library!
Recent Alumnus,1,They do not offer online courses!
College Junior,1,There are no resources available at any campus for this school
College Senior,1,"Our school lacks organization of various groups within the school.  In the two years that I have attended, I have never once met a representative of the student body.  They will announce meetings and events but they never come to pass."
College Senior,1,"They Don't Exist – Campus resources don't exist. There aren't any athletic teams, there are no books in the library, and there aren't any activities listed. This creates a lack if school spirit, and many times, students become disinterested in the school."

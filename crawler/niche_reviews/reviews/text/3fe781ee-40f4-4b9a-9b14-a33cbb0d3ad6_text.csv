Freshman,5,"The professors really take the time to try to help you out in anyway possible. Even from a far, you still have a great support system always available to you."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience has been absolutely wonderful! The professors who teach here are genuinely excited to pass along knowledge of their subject matter. Everyone, faculty and students, seem to always want to help each other out to become the best version of yourself that is possible!"
Freshman,5,"Stephens College is a beautiful, historical, and progressive women's college. Every student and staff member are so nice and genuinely care about you. Small class sizes give you a great opportunity to get a better learning experience, and large lectures are uncommon. Stephens focuses on preparing you for the career world, and will push you to be your best!"
Freshman,5,Supportive teachers. Positive environment. Delicious food. Great resources. I always felt accepted. Love that you can bring your pets!
Niche User,5,I love that the student body is about 700 students so that mean smaller classes and the professors get to know you.  I also love the basketball coach's philosophy on basketball. The campus was small but very welcoming! I also love that it is a pet-friendly campus and you can have your pet with you in the dorms OR you can foster a pet from a local shelter. Very cool!
Alum,5,Excellent experience overall. Being surrounded by highly motivated women taught me how to focus my strengths and find opportunities to achieve success.
Freshman,5,"As one of the oldest women's colleges in the nation, Stephens College is a truly unique institution. Here, you'll find an excellent theatre program (#3 in the nation, Princeton review). Although I don't do theatre, I enjoy getting a free ticket to go see their amazing shows. I've already made lifelong friends and would recommend Stephens to any woman wanting to further her education."
Graduate Student,5,Stephens College is a gem in the middle of the country!  Columbia is a fantastic college town and Stephens is an energetic and progressive place to continue your education.  The best college choice I've made!
Works Here,5,"Stephens College is a gem tucked away in the heart of downtown Columbia. It’s accessible but private, the best of all worlds. Stephens’ students are smart, diverse, driven, and hopeful. It is a great place. Great students, great staff, great School, great value, and great food too!"
Graduate Student,5,"As a current graduate student I am very appreciative of the supportive faculty and the ability to get to know others in the program. The flexibility of evening courses makes it easy for me to still work full-time, while pursuing my degree. The cost of the program is competitively priced with other M.Ed. programs; but, I feel like I gain so much more out of it since I have small class sizes and the opportunity to really engage with my professors."
Freshman,5,"I personally love Stephens College. It has been the best thing that has ever happened to me, being surrounded by driven young women who are pursuing their dreams and goals and who are passionate about their education means alot and it inspires me everyday to do good."
Sophomore,5,"Stephens is honestly the best thing that ever happened to me.  It's nice to just be on campus.  It's not too big and located right downtown.  I love the teachers and when I'm on break, I just want to be back there."
Junior,5,"It is a small, all women, private college, allowing individuals to express their creativity in all different ways. I also love having relationships with all of my professors."
Freshman,5,"Everyone, from staff to students, to the furry friends are the warmest people you'll ever meet. Everyone is so willing to help out and answer as many of your questions as they can. I definitely love everything about Stephens!"
Graduate Student,5,This college is truly amazing.  The professors are super supportive and go above and beyond to help one succeed.  They are always accessible and take a genuine interest in seeing that everyone understands the academics completely.  They just don't admit anyone to the school.  They have a knack  for choosing diverse students who all get along and aren't competitive.  I love my school.
Freshman,5,"Stephens is a beautiful college that takes pride in the way that the campus is set up. This also applies for how they treat their students. Even visiting campus people are very friendly, and willing to help. The staff treats students like their own family, while still keeping the professional atmosphere."
Freshman,5,Stephens is an extremely underrated school in my opinion. I have really enjoyed my time here. The staff and students are all so welcoming. When I first walked on campus it felt like I was entering a different world. Completely different from all other colleges I toured. Because it's such a small school you get to know the professors really well and they challenge you.
Sophomore,5,"There are many things to like about Stephens College. It is a place that encourages creativity, boldness and passions. Most students are striving not only to grow academically but personally. The professors care about the students success and the schools stands behind their future endeavors."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Stephens, overall, has been amazing. They have done such an amazing job to make everyone feel welcome and through activities, I have made many friends effortlessly. The campus is also diverse.  Stephens is a perfectly sized campus and the view on the way to classes is just so beautiful no matter the weather. I always love going to sport events when I have the time and the teams are playing at home. I am not one that parties, but I haven't heard any horror stories from the ""party scene"". I have loved the professors I have had so far. They all have so much personality; they are also inviting and quick to help. Living in a pet friendly dormitory, the dorms are super cleaned and are kept well-cleaned. I have always felt secure and felt like Stephens is my first true home."
Freshman,5,I absolutly love Stephens college. I never would have seen myself going to an all Women's aollege. But I love it! I have so many friends and the teachers are always so nice and so eager to help.
Freshman,5,I love Stephens college. Its so diverse and all the faulty are so helpful and nice. The community welcomes you like you are apart of their family. The college makes you feel as if you have a home away from home which will get through the days.
Freshman,5,"This school is one of the most amazing communities for strong young women like myself. Everyone there is helpful and understanding. Each professor is personable and easy to talk to. The class sizes makes the college feel more like a small family than a school. All the staff there are welcoming and helpful in anyway they can be. Plus, students can have their dogs on campus."
College Senior,5,The dorms can be very social and very nice to live in. One of the best parts about the housing system is that if you want to live in the same room again next year they allow you to.
College Senior,5,Stephens allows women to grow and became true leaders. It gives students multiple chances to take charge and create many creative outlets (such as creating your own student organization)  staff is very supportive.
College Freshman,5,My workload is easy to work with and I love my major and my team!
College Freshman,5,Love my classes and professors. Due to the small school I can get personal conversations with my professors and even president.
College Freshman,5,I was able to get a dorm three days before coming to the school. I think Stephens college has great places to live and all right next to my classes and the cafeteria.
College Freshman,5,My College's athletic program is amazing and the reason I am currently attending my school. All of our athletic teams know each other and support each other by going to games and reffing when needed. The athletic program at my school feels like my second family.
College Freshman,5,My school is one of the most amazing schools out there due to its small size. As a result of being a small school I have more one on one time with professors and there are more resources available.
College Sophomore,5,"Stephens has some of the best community I've ever experienced. Its like one big family, within your major and then as the school as a whole. Everyone is very welcoming and inviting. As for academics, it can get difficult, just like at any other school. But, our professors have amazing experience and are genuinely interested in helping us succeed."
College Freshman,5,Almost all full-time students receive 1/2 tuition!
College Junior,5,"They're all great! It's nice to see enforcement, to be honest it makes me feel safer. And it's a wet campus, unless you're under 21."
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of good food places but they are pretty pricey. Hardly any of them have student discounts which is shocking.
College Sophomore,5,The security is high. Cameras are all over campus and we are alerted if there is ever a problem. Emergency poles are all around campus so if you need help they can come to you immediately. Lastly they are on call 24/7 and can pick you up if you need a ride. I love our security staff!
College Sophomore,5,There is a lot of access to internships and many counsellors willing to help you find one. I plan to get an internship this summer and I don't think I will have much trouble finding one.
College Junior,5,The campus is open so people can walk through it at night which can be a little shifty but security will always walk with you if you call them.
College Sophomore,5,Treat us like adults un-till other wise
College Sophomore,5,Lots of opportunity and lessen concerns of future
College Sophomore,5,Alumni are always looking to intern us and so are the locals.
College Sophomore,5,"Each student has head of securities number, and his staff is every where."
College Sophomore,5,"We have housing that is pet friendly, so it makes the atmosphere on campus lighter. Most of the girls on campus are inviting and don't mind talking if needed. being quiet after hours is a little problem in some dorms but that's expected. Cost is about average, just varies on which dorm you choose to live in. The farthest dorm is 10 minuets from classes."
College Junior,5,"Alcohol and drug use is extremely low, if any at all."
College Junior,5,"Stephens is excellent at maintaining their high level of safety. Security is willing and ready to assist student in feeling safe in any way possible. For example, if you are out late, give them a call and they will come escort you back to your room. I have never felt safer than I do at Stephens."
College Junior,5,"As a college town, Columbia has a large variety of dinning options all within a short walking distance. Everything from authentic Mexican, to bistros and bakeries, to sub shops and all-American, to Thai and sushi, to coffee and frozen yogurt, to pub and breweries, to the best pizza you may ever have (Shakespeare's is where it's at!)"
College Junior,5,"I truly enjoy the graphic design program at Stephens. It is extremely unique in its workload and curriculum. Not only do students have in-class opportunities to work with real world clients, but Stephens also has a prestigious student run marketing firm, Creative Ink."
College Junior,5,"Although Stephens is just women, they rock the fashion. All types of styles are represented"
College Junior,5,"Graphic design is a new and emerging field. Across the country, graphic design programs widely vary. Many focus on fine art aspects like painting, illustration, and sculpture. Others may focus on production like printing presses and operation. Stephens' program is unlike any other, as it focuses on real-world application. We study a balance of design theory, technology, fine art skills, production methods, and multimedia as well as advertising and marketing – which are both essential in today's industry."
College Freshman,5,I would say Stephens College is one of the safest campuses. I think that a lot of the Stephens women like to be classy and classy women don't do drugs.
College Junior,5,The school is very expensive but they try to make it affordable for your needs.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Stephens College. My experience here has been great! 
College Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere in Columbia, Missouri is amazing! It a college town with a lot to do! "
College Freshman,5," Well since Stephens is only a girl school, we have a lot in common and go through similar situations. Everyone here has their own unique style and it is always exiting to see what you can find people wearing around campus. The girls at Stephens are very smart and dedicated to their education, I mean our slogan is educating women who will go somewhere. Social life is good there are many personalities so you will find the right group or person to hang out with. "
College Freshman,5,"  Student life on campus is pretty good as far as the buildings and many places to hang out in. The student union is open to all students on campus, you can play games watch movies even work out in our gym. There are several athletic centers, and the library is huge so you can find many resources along with help from the staff. At Stephens we can also go to the University of Missouri library and they can come to Stephens. Stephens has plenty of gardens and quiet places to relax or to just think.  There are always events going on, on campus all the time from movie nights at our very own Stephens president house to salsa night and dances. There are numerous of activities to do or you can join clubs or organizations, like the student government or Warehouse Theater group.  "
College Freshman,5,"  I have not have an internship yet, but here at Stephens they actually require you to go to an internship at least once. You would have to take a class for it first though. Yes of course I do plan to have one, actually each year I plan to. The more internships I have the better my resume will be, and the more experience in my field I will have. I do have concerns but we have an amazing career department to help me search for one that will fit perfectly for me. "
College Senior,5,"We have a wet campus, if the school has reason to believe underage drinking is happening they will get involved, but it is really lenient."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is in pretty good shape considering. Student hangouts, we have The Pit, which is in Stamper, pretty common area to hang out or there is the Student Union but hardly anyone ever goes in there for anything so if you want to study in peace and quiet, try going there. The library is really nice but sometimes it gets really hot when it's hot outside. The theatres are fantastic. Events, we have a lot of and they are almost always fun. I really enjoy them."
College Junior,5,Stephens has good food for a dining hall and as a vegan I can pick and choose from the many options including a huge salad bar and even chocolate soy milk! You can also use your meal plan points at the campus Khaldi's coffee and the school book store which is nice.
College Junior,5,The school is located in the middle of the city so there are lots of restaurants to go to that are close.
College Freshman,5,"I do enjoy it. I am being given the opportunity to study my greatest passion with people that share that passion, being taught by people that are experienced in the field and share the same degree of passion. Projects are production based and for the most part, professors are careful to provide assignments that test and can be graded solely on the merits/ elements being taught (e.g. your editing skills wouldn't be assesses in a first year sound class and vice versa). Eventually, one is expected to have integrated these skills and no matter the specificity of the course, one should show an ample grasp on all areas of production. But the pacing is perfect and they don't expect everyone to excel in all areas. They just make sure that people have an ample/sufficient background pool of knowledge to utilize/add more to if that particular area strikes their interest."
College Freshman,5,"This program seems relatively normal. One thing that is absolutely superb about it is that, even though the program is production intensive, if one hasn't had the opportunity to work at all in film or video before applying, that will not reflect on their opportunity/ability to be accepted into this program/institution. One need not submit a production reel or portfolio, only display a passion for film and a readiness to learn. Grades and academic ability/integrity are an import part of applying for this program. Be prepared to work hard, but at the same time realize that if you love it as much as your fellow students and instructors do, it will not seem as daunting."
Senior,4,"I first transferred to this college from a community college.  I thought I would get a better education than I would've at a university.  I do wish I had looked into transferring more of my classes manually given less than half transferred.  However the student initiated major has been a wonderful option.  I have met amazing friends, been challenged, and learned so much from this school.  It officially has given me hope to get work in theatre arts."
Senior,4,I feel like there could still be a chance the school is going under.  They provide limited programs with an outrageous costs.  Private schools should have more scholarships and they don't.  They are terrible at letting you transfer classes in or transfer them out.  They do have a strong theatre and fashion staff that has helped me tremendously with costume.  Being a small school there aren't many social activities.
Freshman,4,I love all my classes and my professors! I love how friendly people are and how much we are encouraged as women to be our best self and to be successful. It’s a little difficult to get involved on campus and we don’t have parties but other than that it’s pretty nice!
Works Here,4,Daughter loved her time at Stephens.  Stephens background really helped her in Graduate School.  Stephens not only helped her achieve her degree goal but also gave her live long friends and contacts that have supported her not only in life but also in her career.
Senior,4,I loved the Stephens College overall environment. The community and specialized experience that you experience here is unmatched because of the care and attention Stephens offers all of its students. Another plus is the feministic push on the women's campus and the strive for greatness because of the desire to have Stephens women break barriers and achieve their goals.
Freshman,4,Stephens College is a great specilized womens college with strong majors. Although they could have better general education courses. Stephens also needs to work on its advertising and socical media presence.
Freshman,4,Very good school! Absolutely beautiful. In a good part of Columbia too; downtown is a good place to get a job and whatever you’re looking for. Love the Sunday shuttles too.
Sophomore,4,"I have had a very good experience within my first year. Great activities and student involvement. Classes are also small and allow you to learn what you need. Some teachers may be unwilling to help as much as they could, but most of the time it is just right. As a student apart of the design program, I would of liked to see an easier way to obtain the fabrics and materials I need. Sometimes, I just dont have the money, and wish I could use my school money. The meal plan is amazing! The food is delicious! I could not ask for a better cafeteria. They do such fun things like midnight breakfast too. I know it is an old school, but I wish the rooms were a little more up to date. Everything is close by and near on campus. Getting to a Walmart of Joan's, however, is difficult without a car or bike unless you are willing to wait until Sunday when the school bus takes you. I absolutely love my school! GO STARS!"
Junior,4,"I love the diversity with Stephens College. Before attending, I came from a very low diversity town that had very different viewpoints on things like politics. This school, while it may be very liberal, has opened my eyes to viewpoints that did not exist in my hometown. The academics in the varies arts programs are amazing as well, with having top equestrian, fashion, and theatre programs, our school really is open to making the women who attend this college's dreams come true."
Junior,4,"Teachers in the Biology department are amazing, they truly want to help you succeed. Student success center is an excellent resource. Cafeteria has excellent food, lots of variety. The campus is small and quiet. Easy to find places. Dorms need work! They need to update several of the buildings. Scenry outside is beautiful, in walking distance of downtown. I was a transfer student and there was several problems that have come up throughout the year."
Senior,4,It's a good place that needs changes. The professors are the best thing about the college. They are amazing. The administrators are awful. The president has been known to be manipulative and political. The college to career program has driven many people away. But the sisterhood at the school is great and the teachers go above and beyond. The campus is beautiful and the class sizes are built for success.
Freshman,4,"Really great facility. The school has really set up a lot of programs to help you succeed. With the community engagement grant, so as long as you are involved in stephens, you can get up to $3,000 grant. Small, close campus near downtown with great atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small. Classes are a good range of easy to challenging. Most professors are really good. They care about the students. Administrative staff sometimes isn't very organized, but the campus is small enough that dealing with them is easy. Dorm rooms are larger than most schools, but not all are in the best condition. Dining hall is great. "
College Senior,4,Stephens has security on campus that will walk you to your car or dorm if you feel you are unsafe walking to them.
College Senior,4,Stephens helps students to prepare for there future careers.
College Senior,4,the students are generally supportive of Stephens sports team and cheers them on when they leave class for a game
College Sophomore,4,We have a program dedicated to making the college into career transition easier with workshops and meetings with our counselors.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the classes, food and the vibe that the school give off. I feel at home away from home when I am here."
College Sophomore,4,A good amount of space in the rooms and a home feeling to them
College Sophomore,4,"I love the different events that we host on campus, it helps get people involved and active."
College Junior,4,"Its a great school, but there is so much happening on campus that since I am living off campus I feel left out a lot and it makes it hard to make friends."
College Freshman,4,Stephens is an excellent college with a great atmosphere for learning. The small class sizes make it really great for learning and it is a lot of fun being a part of such a great group of people on campus. Being the only women's college in our area makes us really unique when it comes to all of the different opportunities we are given. I would choose my school a million times because of how great everyone is including the staff and getting to make memories with my now closest friends.
College Freshman,4,Our security persons are great and are very helpful. The only time I feel uneasy about walking across campus late at night after I get done working but I know they are always a phone call away.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are friendly and very knowledgeable about what they teach. They are easy to talk to if you have issues in the classroom or even issues with them. They are helpful and are there through many hours of the day to help; you just have to ask for it.
College Freshman,4,"The percentile of kids who actually are able to get jobs after graduating Stephens College is high. With all of the options and tools available to us, they teach us what to do and how to be attractive to future employers."
College Freshman,4,It can be hard to make friends here sometimes if you come unsure of what field you want to study because most of the girls are cliqued within their majors but there are a good amount that are open to everyone and what everyone has to offer.
College Junior,4,The campus does a very good job of keeping the students safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,During the recent Mizzou incident there was a huge population that came to Stephens campus to seek safety.
College Freshman,4,Most students on campus take the value of their degree in high respects. My Volleyball coach makes sure that we keep up our grades and study hard. On our bus rides to games my team study's for the majority of the ride.
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love the pet program at this school, and it initially was my deciding factor. However, once I got there, I liked it even more. The students and faculty are all so friendly, and you will be on a first name basis with 95% of them within your first year, or even semester. The dorm life isn't bad, and if you're in community style, maids will come in every day. The security is fantastic, for any worried parents out there. They go above and beyond, and will even come change a flat tire.

The only negative thing I have to say about Stephens, is that your academic program is really going to depend on your major. Some programs are much stronger than others, so make sure you do your research on that."
College Junior,4,Since Stephens is a small campus you get more one on one time with the teachers.
College Junior,4,Stephens college has many opportunities for learning new things and provides multiple sources for receiving help with school work. The school also provides opportunities for improving your leadership skills and expressing ones creativity.
College Sophomore,4,My school offers lots of different experiences that are open to all who are interested.
College Sophomore,4,"Although, Stephens is a rather expensive school, they make sure that each of the students and their families understand what needs to be done. It really helped for my family and I that they gave us check lists for what's left of our financial aid process!"
College Freshman,4,Small cafe owned by local soup cafe. Really good!
College Sophomore,4,"I feel like there should be more choices for upperclassman for more private room options, etc. It's great for community living, but there are never enough washer/dryers, etc."
College Junior,4,"I want more, but they can't give me enough due to savings I can't touch(just sitting there until I'm 26)- wish they'd take that into consideration."
College Junior,4,VERY friendly to differing food diets.
College Junior,4,"Small and pricey, but compared to the University I was at before(Arizona State University), it is fantastic. Quiet, clean, great heating/cooling system."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot to do if you have money. Many concerts and festivals are held in the warm seasons. There is always fun places to go downtown and around columbia. Lots of shopping and boutiques. It can be unsafe if you are wandering around downtown alone so just make sure you have a friend with you.
College Sophomore,4,It is definitely very expensive but the dorms are spacious and the heating and cooling works well. Community bathrooms can get gross at times but more often they are very clean. We have a lot of problems with the wifi and it's very frustrating. But you can always go to the computer labs or library which is only a 5 minute walk. The best part about Stephens is that we are allowed pets in our dorms and I don't know what I would do without my puppy with me.
College Freshman,4,It is a safe campus
College Freshman,4,It's a small city so all there is are parties
College Freshman,4,"Some classes are hard, some classes are ok. Not everything is going to be easy. You have to work for it."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus, the security is amazing. Now Health??? Ive heard students hypothesize that the doctor on campus is a myth because she is never in her office."
College Junior,4,Lots of restaurants downtown and bars.
College Junior,4,"Stephens is next to downtown so there is plenty of shops and restaurants to visit, and The Blue Note has worthy concerts. But Night Life is sketchy since Mizzou students dominate the town."
College Junior,4,Stephens has a lot off money to give and it's pretty easy to get an activity based scholarship.
College Junior,4,There's not really a party scene on Stephens Campus but most just go down the street to Mizzou's frat parties which go on all the time.
College Junior,4,"Bars and frats are close by, depending on what you're into, and their are many different dance clubs and a comedy club. There aren't really parties on campus very often but they can definitely be found close."
College Junior,4,"Stephens has rolling admissions so I was able to apply early, got accepted, and didn't need to apply anywhere else just in case I didn't get in. It isn't hard to get accepted but once in your program it's difficult."
College Junior,4,"There's a lot of off-campus dining options. Some are chains that are familiar and some are local. Flatbranch is a popular one, it's also a brewery!"
College Junior,4,We have a lot of work above tests which wouldn't necessarily happen at a larger school. This allows us to really learn the material. The teachers all really want to see us succeed and can give individual time since the class size is so small.
College Junior,4,Even if we don't know someone we're nice in passing. Everyone is also nice and will just come up and talk to you.
College Junior,4,We don't have too many rules past not being illegal. Guests can stay 2 nights and 3 days and if they need to stay longer you can apply for an extension.
College Junior,4,"There really isn't a need for campus provided transportation. Any point on campus, besides the stables which is about 10 minutes, can be walked to in 5 minutes. Shopping and dining are right downtown, also in walking distance. If you don't have a car and can't get a ride from a friend security drives a van to Walmart and craft stores twice a week."
College Sophomore,4,Three Mac labs and one PC lab. Both computers are available in the library and the special room in each dorms. Wi-Fi is in each building.
College Sophomore,4,"Being an all womens college, all looks of women can be found here, but we are all strong independent women."
College Sophomore,4,"Stephens shares Columbia with the University of Missouri and Columbia College. So there are plenty of people to interact with. There are plenty of clubs and bars to go to, along with the annual film festival and art festivals."
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty much everything is with in walking distance and the streets are biking friendly. If not wanting to walk or bike our security has scheduled shuttle trips to Walmart, and they are whiling to take use places if it urgent. If anything else there is always the bus system. The local one is called Fast Cat and there is a long-distance bus that will take you to Kansas City."
College Junior,2,"Professors for the most part are good, but very limited on classes to take."
College Junior,2,"No drugs, but alcohol is prevalent"
College Sophomore,2,"I hardly ever eat at Stamper because I'm gluten intolerant and there are always few, badly made options for gluten intolerant students. I'm not officially diagnosed as gluten intolerant because I cannot pay for testing at this time, and so I am unable to get off of the current meal plan, despite never eating what I'm paying thousands of dollars for."
College Junior,2,"Stephens does everything in their power to convince you that their dorm life is the very best when you are a prospective student. They show you the very best of the best and will only show you one room, a single room on the bottom floor. They do not show the bathroom, and there are reasons why. Stephens' dorm life is the worst. The rooms are small and normally awkward dimensions. The bathrooms have twenty layers of white paint covering everything, as if that will make it look any better. Hint: it doesn't. The sink in our current room is not even connected to the countertop. It is cheaply done. Everything is. The kitchen is in the basement and has probably not been cleaned since it was put in. Cockroaches are everywhere, especially at the beginning of the year. And the worst part? This happens in the more expensive dorm on pet quad. AND even if you ask to be put in cheaper housing, expect to not have your wishes granted."
College Junior,2,"The athletes at Stephens mostly play because they love the sport, they may not be the best or win a game but they have heart."
College Junior,2,Stephens is not a great college for athletics – we have sub-par talent and a huge lack of community support. Our soccer and basketball teams specifically have a very tough time competing and have won very few games this season.
College Sophomore,2,There are only a few times that I really like to eat at the school.
College Sophomore,2,"At first I was excited about being an education major at Stephen's, but I have since been forced into human development because I have not been able to pass the CBASE or MOGEA test that Missouri requires for teachers to pass to be certified.  I was also told by my advisor that even if I passed the test, she would not in good conscience be able to certify me as a teacher. That is pretty hard to take for someone who has lived her entire life dreaming of being a classroom Kindergarten teacher. I am looking for another school, but they all seem to be the same way. Even though they tell you they are there to support you, they really aren't."
College Freshman,2,We arent a huge school so we don't really have a transportation system. They do have a mini van to transport kids to walmart or target or the mall if they needed.
College Senior,2,"The best scholarships lately have only been available to freshwomen, and the financial aid offices seems to forget about you once you are past the first year."
College Freshman,2,"Stephens dining hall really isn't that great, sometimes the food options there are not so great, and the salad bar snit always fresh. we have a couple of gluten free students there and they really couldn't eat there because they didn't really offer gluten free options. The dining hall closes so early at 7:30 p.m and some students are working and have to pay to get dinner else where  because are dining hall is closed."
College Freshman,2,"There is a bus, but it is not just for Stephens students. It for all of the colleges and people in the surrounding area. It takes a long time to get a ride anywhere and it makes many stops."
College Freshman,2,I had 2 or 3 classes a week . I like the virtual classroom. that you had alot of support and patient and understanding positive employees there. also that you can be at schhool online. I like being able to learn new things
College Sophomore,2,"Most students have to take MoX to get to and from either the St. Louis or Kansas City airports. It's a somewhat lengthy bus ride and is a little frustrating that there are no other transportation options. Campus Security does provide a shuttle twice a week to Walmart though! This way, students don't need to bring a car to campus. Everything else is pretty much within walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,"We just recently acquired a soccer team. The support is not as a broad and strong as it should be, but it is possible it will get better. I think the other sports, like volleyball and basketball don't get near enough attention as they should, but then again, this is a liberal arts college."
College Sophomore,2,"I see a lot of the same type of people. A lot are from here in Missouri, but I have seen many from out of state. As far as ethnicity diversity, I see a lot of white and not enough color. There are probably a few dozen that aren't white. Everyone else pretty much looks the same. We need more Hispanics."
College Sophomore,2,"Condition Not Worth the Price – I was very disappointed when I saw the dorm - not the same one I saw on my campus visit tour.  The dorms are much too expensive for what you get.  They are very old and nothing has been done to them since the 1950s and mine had the highest cost of all of the options.  The walls are paper thin.  They could stand floors polished, new paint, a good scrubbing in the bathrooms - all before the students arrive.  Doesnt have to be brand new, but at least updated. Wasn't really impressed.  For a new building you would expect to pay more, but not for such an old room.  I will be looking at other options next year."
College Junior,2,A Major Complaint People Have Here – There is limited parking and security is very strict about students only parking in certain areas.
College Freshman,2,"There is a variety of students, but society's minority is also Stephens College's minority."
Sophomore,1,It was very hard to do online classes here. I only took one and ended up dropping it because the teacher never responded to questions or emails making it very difficult to be successful.
Alum,1,"Overall, this was a terrible experience for me. My personal beliefs were attacked both in and out of class. A lot of the women who attend are petty and rude. My program was extremely underfunded  (as were many others, essentially, go for fashion or don't go at all). Finally, from year one they screwed me over by never informing me that the academic plan I came to take part in had been dropped (plus they had dropped it while other students were still involved in it)."
College Junior,1,"Sports are an after thought.  For my sport we have a small weight room, no permanent field and only a head coach, no assistants."
College Junior,1,"As I write this my hands are shaking due to the lack of quality food provided to me on this campus. I am currently living off of the quesadillas and carrots, which is the only good food provided at the god-forsaken place that they call stamper. The people of fresh ideas are rude, and usually on drugs. There is no one on campus that likes fresh ideas food. The Stars cafe has pretty good coffee though that gives me energy despite the lack of nutrition provided by Stamper."
College Junior,1,"Unless your a fashion major, the majors here are pretty awful. The professors here have great personalities and are nice, but sometimes they are not qualified for the subject they are teaching or the curriculum is awful. The course program is very general compared to other colleges."
College Junior,1,"There are very few parking spots on campus. The most convenient lot is small and is supposed to be used for people who actually drive a lot during the week. Of course it isn't though, people will park there and not move until they leave for break. This makes people who have to get to work walk across campus which is horrible when it's cold."
College Junior,1,Students can't live off campus till their senior year and then financial aid gets taken away. This makes what could be a cheap housing option very expensive and not worth it unless you plan on staying in Columbia.
College Junior,1,Students are required to live on campus
College Junior,1,Greek life is practically non existent.  Very hard to get accepted.
College Freshman,1,We aren't doing anything in half of my classes. I feel like it's a waste of my time and money.
College Freshman,1,"There is honestly not much besides chain restaurants unless you go downtown, but those are all bar and grills. It gets old."
College Freshman,1,"The food is sometimes moldy, or undercooked. It just isn't good in general."
College Sophomore,1,The weather does not affect campus experience because it is a small campus and everything is so close.
College Freshman,1,"No Parties at All – There really aren't any parties at Stephens. But Mizzou is a short walk and there are always parties to go to there. If you come back drunk, make sure you are with someone and be really quiet around the security people."

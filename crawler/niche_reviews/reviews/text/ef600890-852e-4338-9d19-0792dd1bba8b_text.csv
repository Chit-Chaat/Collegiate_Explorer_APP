College Senior,5,I never had a problem or an uncomfortable situation with any professor in my three years at F.N.U. I believe that if you are responsible and show that you care about the class the professor will be very helpful and comprehensive.
College Senior,5,"When talking about how flexible the school and proffesors are its just the best. i personally dont have any complains at all they have been very flxible with my lige schedule and they have all try there best for me to get my classes

With any problems i really apreciate all there effort for acomodating the students to take there classes with any inconvenience."
College Junior,5,"I am online student, there is no one better than me to communicate such a pleasure with this wonderful and advanced technology we have. This new way to study works really good at Florida National University. It is not an easy course and I like that, they push you to be a better student everyday of class. I am pretty sure I am not the only student that is happy with it. It helps to manage your time when you have a busy life and it teaches you to be a responsible student more than if you were at classroom."
College Junior,5,The professors are very professional and devoted to the success of the students. Communicating with professors are excellent. Very prompt response to emails.
Recent Alumnus,5,The education I'm getting is well worth the money. I know my degree will make a difference in my career. F.N.C is a great collge.

Senior,4,"This school is awesome, Organization is well put together, faculty and students get along. Very nice area, no issues with safety"
College Junior,4,It's a 8 week class great size
College Junior,4,"They explain it through what to expect for nursing , the schedule for classes, the workload is alot but they help you, visit different hospitals for intership, and they help with job finding"
College Junior,4,It's a accredited school able to transfer to different  school if pursing a higher degree or if you just want transfer
College Senior,4,"The library is very accessible even for an online student, you can add the school code for the library department from your computer and be able to use the resources such as the plenty and thousands of school journals."
College Senior,4,At F.N.U. you have plenty options to choose a career of your interest and if you are not sure what program to choose the admission personnel will help you to find the right one.
College Senior,4,"My adviser is very helpful and she answers every question I have, and if you have problems with your curriculum the job placement department will help you to do one, and even if you do not do a nice one they will fix it for you."
College Senior,4,I receive many job options from my school but I was not interested because I was focused on my studies.
College Senior,4,"There are students from different backgrounds and races, some are very friendly and others just do not do many friends. I will say it is average."

College Senior,4,People working at F.N.U. is well prepared and helpful.
College Senior,4,"Its a great school, students are very nice very helpfull and good to work with as classmates. The professor are very professionals very nice with all students i feel that professor in this school actually care about there students. They care if you actually know the subject that its been thought they care if you study they are very flexible with students and are always weeling to help you."
College Senior,4,"Im have spoken to past student that have graduted from Florida National University and they have said that is great they do it in a very profesional way and very organizes. Looking foward when i het to gradute hopefully it would be the same or even better. I really dont know how they are this are only what i been told by other students that have ready been trough the process thank you in advance,

Claudia Diaz"
College Junior,4,"The professors are excellent, they really care about students and they are very pleasured to help with any question or problem. Also the Academic Advising office does a really good job guiding us throw all the academic process. The only thing that i don't really like is the classes registration process, they take long to post the schedule, they make changes, in my opinion is messy."
College Junior,4,"My experience with financial aid office is good. They are professional and take their time to explain everything. Even that tuition  is expensive, I agree that the education I'm receiving worth it."
College Junior,4,"The special thing about FNU is that professors and administrators are very close to students. Because it is a smart University, all the help that you need is right there, on top of your hands."
College Junior,4,The library and the computer lab are available all the time with professional assistance for students.
College Junior,4,"This is my first term in the university, so I haven't been in truble with transferring credits, changing schedule or something similar. However; my experiences during the enrollment process with admission advisor, academic advisor, and financial aid have been really nice. They are very professional and very helpful."
College Junior,4,"ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT FNU IS THAT THE PROFESORS HAVE TIME TO GET INVOLVE WITH STUDENTS BECAUSE WE ARE AROUND 15 STUDENTS PER ROOM , AND EVERY TIME I NEEDED TO STAY AFTER CLASSES BECAUSE I DID NOT UNDESTAND SOMETHING THE PROESOR IS MORE THAN WELCOME TO EXPLAIN ME .THE PROGRAM IS REALLY GOOD"
Alum,1,"Waste of time and energy. They treat you nicely so that you give them your money, once you have invested your time they treat you like garbage. The teachers barely speak English and they are very unprofessional."
Alum,1,The BSN and ADN program is the worst. They are the most condescending pieces of trash on this planet. Do not go there!
Sophomore,1,"I am a nursing student at this school. I wish I would have never stepped foot through their doors. The education is lousy, the teachers are horrific, the clinical dates are changed without a days notice. With jobs being so scarce at the moment, They don't even give you 24 hours to figure out what to do about the only thing bringing you income. They are inconsiderate and could care less about anyone's education. I am paying a lot of money and treated poorly. I am stuck because I cannot transfer my credits; even then I want to leave. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SCHOOL. They promise a lot before they have your money and then the abuse you."
Graduate Student,1,"I am a student who has just finished the nursing program at this school and my recommendation to anyone planning to start a career is to look for other options. Not only education is lousy but the attention the abuse and the imperative treatment by towards the students is indescribable. in addition they say that it is a cheap school but in relation they charge a great amount of fees and they are not even explanatory at the time of collection. The truth is that you are going to leave with a greater debt than what they tell you at the beginning of the program. Last but not least, it will make life impossible and the classes the most difficult exams and not related to what you give in class so that more than 50% of the students who enter the program have to leave with a fairly large debt and no title. It would seem to me that they did it with the aim of charging more to the students. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this opinion."
Graduate Student,1,"In addition, Online learning is not better than what was previously described.  Most of the professors will take weeks to give you the grades for your assignments and some of them never replay your emails."
Niche User,1,"I am currently student  at ADN program, and I advice to you no to choose this school, this the worst that ever experienced in this country. The administration is very rude, they playing with the schedule and  with the time testing in way they want, we are the one paying for the school but we don’t have values for a hem. The students concerns are never addressed. Their purposes of the nursing department is to make your life miserable. Please who ever reads this choose another school. They are no professional at all. Every day there is something new, my group right now is the testing group! !! And believe me never a change is pro student always is against. Right now I can not leave this school because if I do, I will loose everything and is a lot of money. Thank you"
Sophomore,1,"I was doing the FNU Associates in the nursing program, on the radio and all commercials that they have say they have a “flexible schedule in the morning and afternoon.” They wait until after you do you’re interview to get into the nursing program, to tell you that you need to pay about $2,000 out of pocket in a one month time frame. I tried to speak to the ADON of the program for the flexibility of the schedules which were ridiculous and impossible to work with, and he was rude and unprofessional gave attitude with bad faces. I decided I was going to drop and transfer out of the school. I have been in this process since September to get my $2,000 (which I have not used) and I’m still waiting for them to return my money. I’m not the only one who’s going through this, my fiancé is also going through the same issue. I do NOT recommend this school to anyone. It’s is probably the worse experience I have ever had with a school."

Sophomore,5,"I love Thomas, the people there, and the atmosphere is absolutely amazing. The food isn't the greatest, but no one goes to college for food."
Junior,5,I absolutely LOVE Thomas College. The faculty and staff do a great job of making sure students know they are more than just money in their pockets. Each professor takes on the responsibility to make sure their students are successful. They also do an amazing job of making the students feel valued. Thomas College is truly a community that feels like family. The students and staff come together to make a unique bond that I am blessed to be part of.
Niche User,5,I like how is a small community and all the staff are friendly. its a great place to make new life long friends.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshmen here at Thomas College. I love it here. The atmosphere, the students, the faculty, the facilities, and more make it so easy to learn, and to thrive. As a small school Thomas provides me with, almost, every need in order to maximize my potential and learning capabilities. I am a student-athlete here and the professors and coaches make it easy to learn, play, and succeed!"
Freshman,5,"I was extremely nervous to start college, as I'm sure the majority of incoming freshman are, but this truly feels like a home to me. The professors care about you personally and professionally, which helped me succeed throughout my first year here. I've learned a lot about my field already because the business program at Thomas College is phenomenal."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour to look at the campus of Thomas College and I loved the atmosphere. The students were all very friendly and welcoming as well as the professors. The study opportunities are fantastic, and there is anyone there willing to help you succeed at whatever you are attending Thomas for the food is great with wonderful kitchen staff as well as great environment to be in any where on campus including the cafeteria. The sports complexes are very nice and well maintained"
Sophomore,5,"The academics are stellar! The athletics department is great! Whenever you need advice or help with something, all the faculty are more than willing to do so! Atmosphere feels like home!"
Sophomore,5,"To say that I love Thomas College would perhaps be a bit of an understatement. Thomas has become my home away from home, and the students, staff, and sports teams have become my second family, one that I am forever grateful that I have found. We are a small college in rural Maine, but that by no means makes us close minded or behind the times; on the contrary, Thomas hosts a wide variety of people from around the world in a close-knit, down-to-earth environment that welcomes all with open arms. Here, the professors know who you are and they care about your individual well-being and success--as does the whole of the faculty and staff, and the campus as a whole. We are a community based school that thrives on the success of our students in their personal and professional lives, and there isn't another place that I would want to be."
Junior,5,"Thomas College is a great school all around. All of the teachers that I have had have been quite wonderful. I am currently a Forensic Psychology and Criminal Justice Major and have found that this school has tons of unique opportunities that are geared toward students like myself. Thomas College has no shortage of clubs; there truly is something for everyone. They also have tons of fun activities for student throughout the entire school year, mostly on the weekends. Thomas College feels very safe and secure. The blue light system really does help make students feel safer even though the campus is relatively safe as is. The Public Safety officers are also really great and can help you out with just about anything you need. Overall Thomas has been a great experience and I've already learned so many things that I've been able to implement in real life situations. I highly recommend attending Thomas college."
Niche User,5,It is a great place I feel I will learn a lot and make many friends. Great sense of community. Local and good commute time.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love it here, this school really is home for me. It is so evident that professors care about you and your success, there are always things to do around campus and the environment is one of a kind, in the best way possible."
Freshman,5,"I had great experience with the staff , students there , they make you feel welcome and comfort and you feel like you’re part of their society they always there for you and to walk you trough your success."
Junior,5,"Great investment, lots of ways to graduate early and save money, classes aren’t too difficult. Definitely would recommend."
Senior,5,"I am a current senior, graduating in May of 2018. Then i plan on going back for my masters degree in business administration in the fall of 2018. I have had the experience of a life time. I have been an orientation leader at Thomas for all three years and putting happy faces on the new incoming students. We start planning usually in April for them to come in August. Its such a small college that these students that are in your orientation group remember your name and your not just another face like you are at some schools. The professors know you on a one-on-one basis. I have also been apart of Student Philanthropy Team, FBLA-PBL, and a 3 year member of the baseball team. Ive also volunteered around campus in different departments like athletics and admissions."
Junior,5,"My experience so far through two and a half years at Thomas College has been something I will always remember and cherish and I’m excited to see what my next year and a half brings. I have met friends through socccer, classes and clubs. Without Thomas College and everything they offer these people would be people I most likely never met. The teachers have been amazing. They are always there to answer questions or give you extra help. Tutors are offered for even more help and if you use all the options there are to get work done and understand the material it makes the work load less stressful and very doable. The tight knit feel of Thomas College suits me very well and I am very happy to be here. Thomas has also given me the chance to continue playing the soccer and I am very thankful for that."
Freshman,5,This school is amazing!!  It's so welcoming and everyone cares for each other!  The professors are awesome.
Junior,5,"Great Classes, Professors, and Environment.
The college is well taken care of and has all the amenities you could want!"
Sophomore,5,I love pretty much everything about Thomas College. I love the student life there. I made friends there that I will have my entire life. The academics are very good and organized. They make it very easy to be aware of where Im at personally and very easy to sign up for upcoming classes. The only thing I would change is the food. The sodexo food there makes it difficult to eat healthy. They should have more fruit and the salad bar could be a lot better.
Niche User,5,"I stayed here for a week the summer after my junior year in high school. I took a full college course in about 4 or 5 days. The dorms were amazing, if just a little hot because the windows are too small for an air conditioner, not that they had any anyways. The teacher was incredibly involved and amazing to be around, the other students were fun and inviting and welcoming, and the food was absolutely delicious. They had options for everyone, including gluten free and vegan options! The classwork was tough, but not impossible, and the atmosphere and campus itself are just magical."
College Freshman,5,"The quality of the courses here at Thomas are fantastic. Every course I have taken so far I have gained valuable experiences from. The professors are engaging, understanding, and passionate about what they teach; they really follow through with their students and try to help them out in any way possible."
College Freshman,5,"Thomas College is truly a unique school; here I feel welcome, safe, and happy while still being academically challenged and studying a lot. The community here in Waterville and on campus is like a family, and I don't think I could feel as comfortable and satisfied with my education anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,"The students watch out for each other like families, public safety is always there whenever needed and school officials are like parents to students on campus."
College Freshman,5,First year seminar will help you through everything
College Freshman,5,Words can't explain how nice and beautiful the learning process is you have to experience it yourself
College Freshman,5,I run track at the school and it's the best team on campus but every sports team is really competitive and pretty good
College Freshman,5,I love thomas with a passion
College Sophomore,5,I am personally a pretty quiet guy. When I met my roommate I couldn't believe how spot on they were with putting the two of us together. Having my roommate quickly become my best friend made my transition into college so easy. I love the small school atmosphere. You quickly get to know your way around and meet some really cool people. I love sports and they have a lot of extra curricular activities going on most of the time. Tried out for the basketball team and got cut unfortunately. I was very upset about that but thankfully for my roommate and other good friends they have convinced me to try out again this year. My classes are all great classes. I feel like I come out of the class at the end of the year with a lot of new knowledge. I hope to become an athletic director and I feel I am getting to know what that would be like. looking forward to doing an internship soon!
College Freshman,5,"My school has many connections to businesses and organizations across the state, and the rest of New England. I have an internship program set up for this May, and that couldn't have happened without my school's help. I don't have any concerns about finding another internship in another year or two."
College Freshman,5,Most of the professors are easy to work with and teach all the important subjects in the class.
College Freshman,5,This area is very safe. There's a low crime rate and the police are on top of any suspicious activity.
College Sophomore,5,We just need more especially with the amount of people starting to attend.
College Sophomore,5,I love my major; professors very understanding willing to help at any point. It is very easy for my to get an internship while being here at Thomas College.
College Sophomore,5,"I am very content with my degree program at Thomas. Forensic Psychology has been something I wanted to pursue for a long time now and it feels good to actually be taking the classes needed to reach my goals. After undergraduate school, I wanted to begin working in the field after some internships and work towards my PsyD or Masters. My ultimate goal is to be a correctional psychologist and eventually do expert testimony for the courtroom."
College Freshman,5,I received s very good scholarship and it covers over half my tuition. It was pretty easy to get because it was just based on my grades so the letter came with my acceptance letter.
College Freshman,5,"The weather is beautiful, there are activities for any type of weather! The staff takes care of the walkways when it is snowing outside. There are snow protocols to plow and have good space."
College Sophomore,5,"Most people complain about terrible freshman parking, but Thomas has a lot of available space. There is always somewhere to park, whether you're looking in the residence parking lot or the commuter lot."
College Sophomore,5,There was no challenges getting accepted into the Accounting program at Thomas College.  The most important criteria for admission is the classes you took in High School and your grade point average.
College Sophomore,5,"All Over the World – My freshman year, there were more people from Bermuda than my hometown, which is just an hour away. Asians, Swedish, Bermudan, Austrailian, British, we got maad diversity. I'd say there are as many black students as white, as well"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Where in the World – There are so many people from other states and countries that all go to Thomas College. Also a variety of religions are brought together on one campus! It is really not a huge deal at Thomas where people are from, what religion they are or if they belong to the LGBT community. People seem to just fit in with everyone else. It is really an open and accepting college."
Recent Alumnus,5,Lots of Choice – There is a lot of choices of off campus dining. The prices are fairly reasonable and if you go to the right restaurants the food quality is awesome! My favorite place is Saleh Tea! It is a small tea shop on Main Street and it has the best tea and brownies I've ever had! It's a must go place in Waterville!
Senior,4,Overall it has been good but there have also been issues. Some professors clearly have no clue what they are doing. The food is very disappointing. The weekends on campus are always dead.
Sophomore,4,"Me personally, I'm simply one for online learning. I have trouble with online learning, but it works for some people."
Freshman,4,"I have only visited this college a handful of time, I’m accepted as an incoming freshmen. It’s a small very community/family like atmosphere, the professors seem to know their students by name and personally so your not just a number falling through the cracks"
Freshman,4,"Thomas College for me was the perfect fit for someone – like myself – who is a homebody. The feel of Thomas was perfect for me. Close to home and I had friends attending here too, making it like high school again. It still feels like home every time I walk around campus."
Junior,4,Thomas College is a great school! I’ve made some great friends and met my girlfriend my first semester. I’m currently the Vice President of the club I’m in and am a criminal justice major. I’m confident that this school will help me achieve my career goals!
Junior,4,Thomas College provides a great community feeling while attending the school. The small class sizes allows for students to be able to get more attention from their professors. The food is also pretty good in the dining hall.
Freshman,4,It's a great place to be. The teachers are very knowledgeable and friendly to students. College is set in a nice environment.
Freshman,4,"I feel that because Thomas college is such a small school, I have been able to accomplish much by forming a good relationship with the students and staff. I feel that the campus itself could use improvement, specifically the dining options. Overall, I greatly enjoy all of my professors and classes, and feel that because of Thomas, I will be likely to find success after college."
Senior,4,Thomas College is a great small knit community for anyone to attend. Class sizes are small but provide a great opportunity for networking.
Freshman,4,"I love how close we are as a college. A lot of people know each other on campus, which makes you feel important. At Thomas you are not just another face in a crowd. I would love to see Thomas improve there student hang out areas, at this point we have one room. Even though we are a small campus I feel like we can have more places for students to interact"
Junior,4,"Thomas College is a very personal community. The professors and staff are kind, experienced, and dedicated to helping students succeed."
Freshman,4,Thomas College has been a great experience so far. There are always things to do on campus and they go the extra mile to make sure that everyone gets what they need. The academic life is spectacular as well. The professors make sure that the students get the material and make sure that they get the best education possible.
Sophomore,4,"It's easy to meat others with similar interests as you. They have many events that make it easy. Housing is fine. Their food could be better,but they do offer many choices to chose from. The class sizes are small enough that the professor can get to know you."
Junior,4,"I like the small community feel that Thomas College gives off. Wherever you go on campus, you're guaranteed to know someone. To your professors, you're actually a person and not just a number in a class."
Junior,4,"This school is my perfect fit. It is small, personable, and accommodating. This is my second year at Thomas but technically my 3rd year as a college student for Thomas accepted all my credits from University of Maine at Fort Kent. Most classes here at Thomas are unique and want students to participate fully. The professors at Thomas College are personable and always available to help when they are needed. I think that this school would be a great fit for anyone wanting to challenge themselves but also don't mind receiving help when needed. "
College Freshman,4,"There is not much crime on campus that I am aware of, occasionally someone gets something stolen out of their room but that is usually resolved soon by campus police. Personally, I feel very safe here I have no issue walking across campus at night or during the day and public safety is very friendly and approachable."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman I don't have much experience with job and internship prospects yet; however, I do know that the guaranteed job program here at Thomas is an asset to all students. I feel very confident that when I graduate from here in 2019 I will be able to find a great job and work my way up to my dream job."
College Freshman,4,"The residence halls are pretty great; I live in the oldest building so my amenities are not as great. Cleanliness is fairly average I think, there are custodians almost everyday and as with any college residence there is a lot of trash but I think it's well taken care of. I really enjoy the social atmosphere, and there is excellent access to all of campus from every dorm building."
College Freshman,4,"There are a variety of student intramurals and varsity sports, and neither feels more important than the other. Sports are inclusive and fan support is great. Our facilities are really good, and our school spirit is great for such a small school."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Thomas are well supported by the students and faculty, it is rare to not see more than 100-200 students at each event"
College Freshman,4,This school is all about sports. Most people do sports here. I do not but love watching sports.
College Freshman,4,This school is so wonderful. I don't really like the GPH dorm but the school and professors are wonderful. The people you just wonder how did you get accepted here. But in all this is a great school.
College Freshman,4,I love the housing it feels like home
College Freshman,4,I mean I don't really have nothing so say about it bc I'm not in one
College Freshman,4,"I love my Coaches, Professors, and Club Leaders. It is easy to get involved in anything you want here. Students are overall very sweet and respectful. I run for the track team and Mike Anderson will work with you one on one to help get you to 100% My Adviser and Professors are all looking out for me and make time outside of class to help me with topics I struggle with."
College Junior,4,"Thomas is a great school! They have improved tremendously in the beauty of the campus! The professors, staff and students are all incredible and are always willing to help. It is a small school but the small community feel makes you feel close to your fellow classmates. Overall, it is a great school!"
College Senior,4,"Thomas College is a small, yet diverse campus that focuses on the success of their students not only during the course of their selected program but also after graduation once they reach the ""real world"".

At Thomas we are given the tools and resources to grow both academically and professionally."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Its a great school, the classes are small and the price is decent. great people that work there."
College Freshman,4,Any time I had questions I juts had to call and someone was ready to assist me
College Junior,4,"I was given a $10,000 scholarship upon acceptance, and I have received grants and other small scholarships that I wasn't expecting. out of $32,000 i only end up paying about $8000"
College Freshman,4,"I received the highest available scholarship at my school, and the best advice I can give to scholarship applicants is to keep your grades up as high as possible, and participate in a number of clubs and other extracurricular activities. It was stressful ensuring all my expenses were paid for, but eventually everything was sorted and I had a successful experience with the financial aid process."
College Freshman,4,"Gym just got a whole makeover, with brand-new equipment to be used by all students and faculty. Lot of work gets put in to maintain facilities."
College Freshman,4,"Very helpful and cooperative, as well as friendly. Some say they are too strict, but they are just looking out for us."
College Sophomore,4,"Class size is small, teachers are responsive to your needs."
College Sophomore,4,Thomas is a top notch business school.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a CED student. I contacted the school, submitted my new student paperwork and transcript. I was in class two weeks later."
College Sophomore,4,I am a business major. I enjoy my smaller class sizes. The instructors are kind and helpful. I enjoy being able to attend classes at night and during the day to obtain my degree.
College Sophomore,4,"I attend classes at night, I do not feel afraid to walk to my car alone. Lots are well lit and public safety is very alert."
College Sophomore,4,Many options to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,"The library is brand new, the building has only been open about 12 weeks now.  The facilities are clean, though not all modern some are very dated. The Campus offers a wide variety of things to do after hours for students the common areas are very nice."
College Freshman,4,"I love the intramurals. Oddly, people come to watch them too."
College Freshman,4,I've lived in this area so I know about places other students here haven't discovered yet.
College Freshman,4,It's fun to get to know new people and just hang out.
College Freshman,4,As a double major (Criminal Justice and Forensic Psychology) the class load isn't too difficult and the professors are great.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of my friends live off-campus and love it!
College Sophomore,4,It is nice for both athletes and non-athletes always very clean.
College Sophomore,4,It is very easy to get into the programs here at Thomas and you can switch into programs fairly easy.
College Sophomore,4,It is always great! Sometimes it goes down for upgrades but they bring it right back up to speed.
College Sophomore,4,"I met a serious boyfriend and it couldn't be better however school is expensive. I find myself struggling to stay in attendance due to college's cost. It scares me to be honest that I will not have enough money to finish, with that in the back of my head it keeps me wondering."
College Sophomore,4,The computers are very nice pc's. The newer ones have touch screens and are spread all over campus.
College Sophomore,4,Parking is great. It is close by the buildings which is good because it gets cold.
College Sophomore,4,"The students at Thomas are mostly laid back but driven. There is very little to no ""drama"" ever. Thomas is really a great community where everyone is friendly to everyone else even strangers. There is a great mix of types of guys and girls: small town, big city, athletic, artistic, but all are friendly and polite!"
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great variety of restaurants and quick stop places in the Waterville area. Whether you are looking for nice sit down meal with your family when they visit or just a quick snack after practice there is ALWAYS something available. Many places are open 24 hours for those late night cravings. Being a college town, price is usually very reasonable. One of my favorite places to sit down and eat or get take out is Ming Lee's Chinese Restaurant which is just 10 minutes from the campus. Price, atmosphere, food, and the service are all spectacular!"
College Sophomore,4,"Thomas for the most part is a business and liberal arts college. They provide mostly degree plans for marketing, accounting, management etc. They also have computer sciences and IT management as well as social sciences and others. Thomas has branched out from just business - related degree programs now and also added concentrations of a study within a field. For example, I am majoring in psychology with a concentration of forensic psych."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a sophomore this year in Thomas College and now living in the upper classman dorm. This dorm is like luxury compared to the freshman dorm I experienced last year. Although, it was not as pretty, I definitely got my college dorm experience last year. My degree program at Thomas is awesome, I love it, It's flexible with a wide variety in class selection to choose from in the psychology and criminal justice fields. The classes are also small like a high school class ensuring that students can receive any helped needed by the professors."
College Sophomore,4,"Thomas College is a very good school because each classroom has an average of 20 kids, maximum. There's a lot of work but definitely doable."
College Freshman,4,"The grading system is fair. The professors are great, they're knowledgeable and available to the students at any time. Professors are very flexible too. The registration process is manageable and classes are entertaining."
College Freshman,4,"I am a Forensic Psychologist major, with a Criminal Justice minor, and I'm personally very satisfied with my education so far in Thomas College. The professors are above excellence. My workload can be overwhelming sometimes, but I'm in the honors program, work study, and am involved in other extra-curricular activities. The classes are enjoyable and the programs are do-able."
College Freshman,4,"Thomas College is located in the small town of Waterville, ME. There are many different activities students can get involved in. They can join the local YMCA, catch a movie at Flagship Cinemas, get their tan on at Sun Tan City, or even play some pool at TJ's Poolhouse. Colby College is also located in Waterville. Husson, University of Maine in Augusta, University of Farmington are very close by and just about a little over and hour away."
College Freshman,4,"So far I've enjoyed my education, and I am happy with majoring in Psychology. I can handle the workload, and most professors are always available and are experts in their field. Not only do they share the knowledge they know they share the experiences."
Sophomore,2,"The food here is terrible, their newest addition to our cafeteria are pickled eggs and sausage...the campus life is a joke, and the student activities are rarely entertaining and always targetted at freshman. This school is a cash-grab and will leech freshman for every dime they have and dump them like it's nothing. The school is going downhill and everyone hates it here. The academics are OK, but some classes are way too easy and others way too hard. The college seems to have more old people (and no, not faculty) than students, they host weddings and barmitsfas frequently. Don't go here, it is a trap and they will try everything in their power to make you stay here or drop out, transfers are a pain."
Sophomore,2,"Thomas is a small school. It is entirely too expensive. Usually schools are expensive when they have a high attention rate, however Thomas attention rate is well below average."
College Junior,2,"Mostly pizza, chinese, and fast food. Not much else to pick from, especially as a broke college student."
College Junior,2,"Very little vegetarian options, so most of the time I don't really eat. Steve does a lot to help, including telling me what is available, but most of the options are either cold and have been sitting out for a while, or not very good."
College Freshman,2,"Not many parties happen on campus, I usually go off campus when I want to find a party. Otherwise, when  people try to set something up on campus, it will eventually get busted"
College Sophomore,2,There's a nightclub but it's pretty nasty to some. But there are plenty of restaurants to choose from and you can find something do to.
College Freshman,2,They have mini buses for events but not much else. You can call a taxi from school and they will come pick you up.
College Sophomore,2,"It seems to be always raining here, especially on the weekends or when something is planned for outside."
College Sophomore,2,"Slim Pickin's – There are five buildings (four different types)
Village: two motel looking buildings
Bartlett: Upperclassmen Dorms, 7 student suites, each suite being 3 singles and two doubles
Townhouse: Fancy mix between village and Bartlett. each building has doubles and singles, like a condensed apartment building.
GPH (Grant Park Heath): 3 halls with lobby, Freshmen only. I've only gone through freshman year so..
putting all the freshmen in one building (with the exception of a few in village) is a TERRIBLE idea.."
Recent Alumnus,2,The Tricky Truth – The off campus housing in Waterville are not associated with Thomas College. If you can find housing off campus there is not much at all. The apartments are run down and have loads of bugs in them!
College Sophomore,2,"Oh Goshy – Well there's only one dining hall and the food isn't all that great. Sometimes it's good, and sometimes there just isn't anything to eat but a salad or some cereal. I've only been going for a year so I really can't say much. It does seem pretty repetitive once in a while though. But sometimes the food is really good (corn never tasted so good!) The food is average and mostly healthy. I'm not a picky eater, but if something looks nasty I'm not eating it. It's a bit harsh a vegetarians, but at least they try and make something for them everyday. The worst is when the staff try to experiment for dished on every station; those days are never great."
College Sophomore,2,"Well, it only sucks if you don't have a car (like me.) But, there are plenty of people that have cars and most things are close by. You don't need to be ms/mr popular for one of your friends to have a car. especially if you're a freshmen. They have a mini-bus once a month, or something like that, that goes to Wal-Mart, but that's about it. Taxi's are only $6.50 a ride to anywhere in the area (I think), so if you have to go to a bus station to go back home, it's cheap."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at Thomas isn't really popular, and information doesn't get around."
College Sophomore,2,Resident Assistant Police – Some of our Resident Assistants (RAs) can be very strict with following the rules and making sure that there are no law-breakers on campus. Then there are those who could not care less about the Saturday night party going on. You know there is a wide range in the way different RAs act when students plan their parties based on who happens to be on duty that night.
College Junior,2,"Being a Commuter – I am a commuter. It took me a long time to find an apartment off campus that was affordable and nice. The convenience of the apartments being across the street is excellent, but they are expensive if you don't have a roommate. Everywhere else is extremely expensive unless you want to let quality go down the drain."
College Senior,2,"Not Much to Choose from – If you like chains, there are a handful. Most downtown places are SO expensive. Big G's is great but not a ton of variety."
Sophomore,1,Thomas College needs more and better people there and to loosen up a little bit. The food is terrible also and they do not fully cook anything and you also do not have many options as well. The Campus looks nice and he teachers all seem very nice but it is not your typical college as my friend and I call it the Thomas County Jail due to how trapped you feel in that place. Would not recommend this college for anyone who wants to enjoy there once in a lifetime college experience.
College Junior,1,We don't really have a greek life....
College Freshman,1,Tried getting a job on campus and was turned down everywhere.
College Freshman,1,We got rid of the one frat that ever existed on campus
College Sophomore,1,My college makes any type of smoking seem so illegal and frowned upon. More of a prison type feel then a homely type feel when it comes to smoking and drugs.
College Sophomore,1,"Winter is the worst, the cold temperatures and the snow during the cold winter months really put a burden on going to college in Maine."
College Sophomore,1,There is no public transportation around my school. I do not have a car so I cannot get into town to work. It's awful.
College Sophomore,1,"In the dining center, they do not cook their food very well because there is not much flavor."
College Sophomore,1,"With its gender-separated dorms and lack of anything interesting to do on campus, living on campus at Thomas is fairly boring. The dorms are rarely cleaned, and it's not uncommon to find trash thrown all over the floors."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek housing or programs.

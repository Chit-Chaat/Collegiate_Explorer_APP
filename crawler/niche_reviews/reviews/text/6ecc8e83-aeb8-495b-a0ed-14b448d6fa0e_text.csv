Freshman,5,"I took two classes online during the Fall 2020 semester. Both were very well run, and operated through Zoom. We had class discussions and submitted papers via Sakai (the online learning management system, similar to Schoology/ALEC/etc.). The online classes were very comparable in quality (and almost better than) the in-person classes."
Junior,5,"Notre Dame is an amazing place to spend your undergrad years, with world-class academics, great social opportunities, and the best gameday experience"
Alum,5,I did not have to take any online courses at Notre Dame. All my courses were taken in-person and on campus.
Alum,5,"Notre Dame offers a truly unique student life experience as well as a well-rounded education and powerful alumni connections. It may be difficult to justify the cost when considering one's return on investment, but I could not imagine going anywhere else and enjoying it half as much."
Alum,5,"They offered great online interactions with the coursework and engagement. That being said, I did not take any classes online."
Senior,5,My classes moved online during the pandemic. My professors remained engaged and were extremely understanding of students' circumstances.
Senior,5,"Nothing compares to the ND community. Student life tends to center around the numerous activities and events on campus, but Chicago isn't far away either. With a significant emphasis placed on academics, the ""work hard, play hard"" best characterizes the student body.
The dorm system is neat in that students are assigned to a random single-sex dorm their Freshman Year, and though students can opt to switch, they tend to remain there three, if not four, years. These dorms parallel Greek Life in many ways while being far more inclusive. Students can choose to be very involved in Dorm Life with sports teams, dances, fundraisers, and other community events."
Alum,5,I did not take any online classes. I graduated in 2018. We could take online classes during the summer but I did not.
Alum,5,"Stunning campus, great people. There's truly no place like Notre Dame. The four years here really taught me how to be a force for good in this world."
Graduate Student,5,"Strong school spirit, helpful faculty, and ample opportunities to explore and discover your passions. Alumni connections afforded me insights into companies and post-college life. Classes gave me exceptional problem-solving skills and included real-life applications that put me ahead of my peers."
Sophomore,5,"When online learning started in late March, I wasn‚Äôt sure how the rest of the semester was going to turn out. As time progressed, I got used to the deadlines and assignments and was able to finish off the semester strong."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Notre Dame is a very special place. From the dorm communities to the friendships built in classes, one can easily make new lifelong friends. I‚Äôm excited for the rest of my years at Notre Dame!"
Freshman,5,"Best college experience I could ask for. The people, professors and academics are unmatched. Better in all regards other similar colleges in the top 20."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is wonderful, and the environment and people are phenomenal. The residential dorm system really is hard to beat."
Niche User,5,"Notre Dame is an amazing school. From it's stunning campus, to it's one of a kind dorm culture and life lasting traditions, there is no other school quite like it. It is truly one of a kind in the best way possible."
Freshman,5,"The academics at Notre Dame are excellent - rivaling all top selective schools in the country. The best part is the community. You won't find the same spirited, kind, and dedicated community anywhere else."
Alum,5,"As a recent alum, I look back on my 4 years at ND as the best of my life. There are so many amazing things about this university‚Äî the professors who care about their students as learners and humans, the dorms that offer a supportive community that becomes home, the campus that feels too beautiful to be real. The academics were rigorous; the extracurriculars brought so much joy and lifelong friendships. I grew spiritually through campus ministry & socially through engagement with the Center for Social Concerns. The biggest thing I wish were different about ND is the diversity‚Äî they boast about inclusivity but have a long way to go to live up to that. Predominantly white and heteronormative. I encountered people (in the theatre realm, mostly) who are very different from myself & I‚Äôm so grateful for them‚Äî I wish that level of diversity (of race, sexuality, religions, political viewpoints, etc) were representative of the whole campus."
Sophomore,5,The community is unlike any other prestigious institution. You do not find cutthroat competition here like you would find at other top 20 universities. Everyone here wants to see each other succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I'm a current Sophomore at Notre Dame and I'm loving every minute of it. What sets Notre Dame apart from peer institutions is an incredibly strong campus community you feel the minute you step on campus. And it's a community that's rooted in my everyday life as an undergrad, one that completely enhances my academic and personal college experience. Beyond that, I truly do not think any other school represents the complete ""college package"" quite like ND: outside of great community, we have top-notch academics, stellar athletics, world class arts programs, a beautiful campus, one of the best alumni networks in the country, incredible study abroad and research programs, an internationally recognizable brand, strong faith-based opportunities, and above all, people who genuinely care about you and want to see you succeed. I really can't say enough about ND and the impact it's had on me already, and I can't wait for the rest of my undergraduate career at the best school in the country."
Freshman,5,Notre Dame is amazing. I am a freshman here and I absolutely love it. The people here are absolutely stellar. Other students are always willing to help you out. People here are friendly and are open to having new experiences. I always feel safe here and feel like it is a home away from home. The professors are phenomenal and are always willing to help. The dorming situation allows me to get to know that people I reside in and form meaningful relationships with them. The campus food is great especially on game day. They have phenomenal resources to get involved in service such as the Center for Social Concerns. Notre Dame is the place to be!!
Niche User,5,Great School with beautiful history also very beautiful buildings Great athletic program and academics
Graduate Student,5,This school was an amazing opportunity to learn from some of the best professors in the world while sitting next to some of the smartest individuals you will ever meet.
Graduate Student,5,"It was a great experience and is a great opportunity for sports and becoming the best of yourself. Don't panic the food is AMAZING. I played Notre Dame Football there and is now drafted in the NFL. The Professors are great they are really cool. There really funny and I liked to invite them to lunch to get to know them in Freshman year. There is nothing to worry about as long as you work hard, do your homework, don't do inappropriate things, and make friends you will be ok and Notre Dame gets you ready for after college. Just feel confident. If you go to Notre Dame you will have the best experience ever. So thats why I think you should go to Notre Dame.üòÄ"
Freshman,5,"An amazing community, excellent academics, and incredible athletics all combined. With a community centered around tradition and Catholic values, this unique university is home to driven and intelligent students."
Freshman,5,I could not have asked to go to a better institution and I love the atmosphere and community here. You will not find any other school with a family like Notre Dame.
Alum,5,"Notre Dame gave me amazing opportunities to serve those who are less fortunate than I. In addition, it cultivated an environment that allowed me to grow as a student but also as a citizen of the community. I will forever be grateful for all the fond memories, experiences, and lessons I have learned from Notre Dame."
Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame has the academic rigor and challenging discourse of a top U.S. university. What surprised me instead is the kindness and understanding among the students and faculty I encountered during my first year; I wouldn't have expected such a competitive environment to foster such charity in its community.

There is much more to Notre Dame than academics and the promise of an impressive degree; the hefty cost also helps fund significant student amenities and a gorgeous campus. The varsity sports provide entertainment year-round.

Go to Notre Dame if you're looking for more than just a high salary to show for your postsecondary studies‚Äìand if you don't mind a spring semester that feels more like winter. (Seriously, it's cold in northern Indiana.)"
Junior,5,"My experience at Notre Dame thus far has been incredible. As Lou Holtz put it, ""those who know Notre Dame, no explanation's necessary. Those who don't, no explanation will suffice."" What Lou means by this is that Notre Dame truly is unique. From a social scene without greek life to a special dorm culture and Catholic virtues, Notre Dame truly stands out amongst other competitive universities. Additionally, Notre Dame's alumni network is insane, as alumni are always willing to help current students or other alumni. In closing, visit Notre Dame on a football weekend in the fall, and you will be sold."
Freshman,5,I enjoyed my time best time of my life. Enjoyed this year. Made me learn more about myself as well as my peers.  Took the liberties of becoming a adult and I loved every minute of it.
Sophomore,5,"Lou Holtz said, ‚ÄúThose who know Notre Dame, no explanation is necessary. Those who don‚Äôt, no explanation will suffice.‚Äù Great school, great culture, great campus, great community. Very Catholic, but welcomes all faiths. Can‚Äôt beat football season."
Sophomore,5,"One of the best schools in the nation if you value education, community and faith. Area is somewhat boring, but the people are absolutely incredible."
Sophomore,5,"Great school for those interested in challenging academics, great campus life, outstanding athletics, and rich tradition."
Alum,5,I had a great experience overall; I would like to see it be easier for students to study abroad but other than that I did not have many complains about my time at Notre Dame.
Freshman,5,"I will be attending this university in the fall of 2019.  On my visit to Notre Dame, I loved the atmosphere that the student provided and loved the way they cared for each other. Although the rooms were small, students made very wise choices in order to manage their space. The smell, however, is one thing I would change. Overall, my experience with Notre Dame was amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to go back in the fall."
Alum,5,"Great academics, opportunities, and financial assistance! You can receive grants from various organizations and travel the world!"
Sophomore,5,"I‚Äôve made the best friends of my life, and everyone is so driven smart and hardworking that honestly just being a student there has made me a better person. The community is insane, alumni are so supportive, football game weekends are the best, professors really care. You just have to get over being in the middle of IN which is not fun."
Sophomore,5,"I love ND so far. Most of the professors that I have had really care about they're students. I've also heard the alumni network is top notch. Some of the people here are entitled, spoiled rich kids, but you are still able to find your crowd."
Niche User,5,"Notre Dame is a beautiful school with a beautiful campus full of intellectuals  who will one day make the world a better place. The academics here are wonderful and the students are motivated and driven people, allowing the learning environment to truly prosper. The dining rooms have such a wide variety of food and the athletics here are top notch D1 athletics. Notre Dame is the best college ever and is an amazing  experience."
Sophomore,5,"I really love the people at Notre Dame. You are surrounded by a student body consisting of a bunch of like-minded individuals, and professors that are passionate about what they are teaching."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and everyone  is friendly. The professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed and are willing to help out any way they can.
Freshman,5,"I love Notre Dame! It's a beautiful place, inside and out. We've got all sorts of clubs, students and academic interests. Personally, I am very pleased with the Mass and Sacrament availability as well as all the Catholic-related activities. Of course, not everybody is Christian; Notre Dame is a home for all. I've already found some solid friends with whom I enjoy spending these cold (and warm) Indiana days. ND meets 100% of financial need; this assistance extends beyond tuition and has allowed me to get the full Notre Dame Experience. Everyone here is passionate about something, and one passion we all share is a love for Notre Dame, Our Mother. Go Irish!"
Junior,5,"good school. good people. most importantly, good football.
good school. good people. most importantly, good football."
Sophomore,5,Notre Dame is a great school. It has a great mix of people and academics and sports. Notre Dame provides great oppertunities to prepare for the future and has many networking events.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Notre Dame is more than just a school for academics, it is a lifelong community you join the moment you are accepted. Everyone on campus is very supportive of one another and you are encouraged to explore a variety of majors, passions and interests. The students here are very well-rounded and wonderful friends. The experience and education you receive here at Notre Dame is simply incomparable to any other college."
Niche User,5,"Great university in a wonder setting!  Very impressed with their academics!  The facilities are state of the art, the students are smart, respected, and will be future leaders in the world they pursue."
Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame is truly a place like no other. While the weather is like that of any place in the Midwest (horrifying), the community inside the campus is warm and welcoming, it is a place where upperclassmen befriend freshmen and sophomores without hesitation, where everybody is looking to yield a helping hand, and where Saturdays are for college football."
Freshman,5,I love the feeling of family and how everyone is made to feel welcome no matter where they come from or what their story is.
Niche User,5,"The university of  Notre Dame is recognised for its strong sense of community , excellent academics and an amazing sports culture. Their  unique dorm system  leads to strong bonds between their students.resulting in a solid  alumni network . As the ND admission letter states ‚ÄòWelcome home‚Äô , this university is truly a home !   The university of Notre Dame recognises and celebrates the uniqueness of  its student body. It enforces the importance of  values and ethics in your work space which gives rise  to caring and intelligent students  at the end if their four years !  Moreover  at Notre Dame,the football culture is legendary and their games  are  looked forward to and well attended by all - Students , parents & Alumni with equal enthusiasm  ! ‚Äò Go Irish‚Äô !!!"
Junior,5,Notre Dame is a beautiful campus with challenging yet rewarding academics. Football games are a highlight of the fall! Everyone is so welcoming and always willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"Notre Dame is home. When you step on the campus of Notre Dame, there is a feeling of community that embraces you like no other. The academic rigor promises bright futures for all who choose to work hard and go down that road."
Alum,5,"The University of Notre Dame is a place unlike any other. With its competitive academics, its numerous student extracurriculars, and its lively dorm life, there are so many opportunities in which one can make Notre Dame their home."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus with kind, passionate staff and students. Very welcoming to those they feel belong and doesn't usually exclude those who don't."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus environment in terms of the housing system.  At Notre Dame, we only have single sex dorms, and we do not have Greek life.  So, students typically remain in their dorms that they are randomly placed in for all four years.  This dorm becomes a family for every student, and the dorms each have an identity.  For example, my dorm, Howard Hall, is represented by a duck mascot.  We build community through weekly meetings in our ""pond"", intimate weekly masses in our dorm's chapel, and service events unique to our dorm.  In addition to the incredible dorm life at Notre Dame, I have been blessed to be a part of the Band of The Fighting Irish as a saxophone player.  There is no feeling quite like marching through the tunnel to 80,000 cheering fans on every game day Saturday.  The friendships that I have made through band have been life changing for me.  I am truly so proud to be a part of this group, a group that is greater than myself, and I am so thankful."
Senior,5,The University of Notre Dame has become my family and truly home away from home. I have been challenged academically and have developed life lessons and lasting relationships.
Freshman,5,"College experience unable to be found elsewhere. The community is quite literally a family, and there's no other place I'd rather want to be studying than here."
Senior,5,"I love this university. It has a very catholic atmosphere which is a positive or a negative depending on your mindset. It's a great academic school with good athletics, which is hard to find."
Senior,5,"I have loved my four years at Notre Dame. It is academically strong with some of the finest, yet personable professors in their respective fields. The faculty truly wants you to succeed in your studies and in your future career. I also love the dorm life and the sense of community found on campus. It is impossible to truly describe without experiencing it firsthand.

The alumni network at Notre Dame is incredible; nearly everyone who graduates has a job lined up, is entering graduate school, or has other concrete plans laid out for post-graduate years."
Alum,5,"I made my best friends, completed a world-class education, watched an occasionally-good football team...what's not to love?  The football culture far exceeds the size of this midwestern school, but I love the connections I find with my fellow alumni--as if there were many more of us."
Freshman,5,"Great community, professors who care about your well being, awesome academics, good sports to follow, lots of clubs to join."
Sophomore,5,"I think Notre Dame is such a unique school because of its focus on academics, faith, service, and community. I really value the community within the dorms as 
about four in five undergraduates live on campus. The alumni network is also very extensive and extremely valuable in helping student find jobs they love."
Junior,4,My experience so far has been great! The student life is nice and I feel a sense of community within my major. The school could definitely use some improvement in diversifying the student body and staff.
Junior,4,The classes that did live lectures were much easier to stay caught up and learn compared to classes where we we required to learn at our own pace
Alum,4,"A powerful education with a great network of professionals in almost every field. I appreciated particularly the intent on educating the whole person. That being said, in some ways, it has a history of being an ""old boys club,"" which also means white."
Alum,4,Really great number of opportunities and great people. Lifelong friends easily made and bonded. I really enjoyed the sports atmosphere and the dorm life the first couple of years.
Alum,4,"I only took one online class when I was studying abroad, so I do not have much to say about the online learning experience. It was ok, could have been better supported."
Alum,4,"The campus is beautiful and the academics are excellent. People on campus are very friendly and there is a sense of family among students, faculty, and staff."
Sophomore,4,"I love the university, however, it seems like it's not progressing forward noticeably in any particular field or issue. To be honest, I'm a bit worried it'll be left behind. Regardless, I still love Notre Dame. The students are all very kind, professors are more often than not brilliant, and the dorm life makes you feel at home. The career services are fantastic. Study abroad isn't as easy to get into as it appears, and the options are limited. It's becoming more of a bar school, party-wise. Overall, there are some faults, but I've learned a lot here. I've progressed greatly in my faith, friendships, and future career."
Freshman,4,"Love the community aspect of this school! The administration is very inclusive and hosts a wide range of types of events--even those outside of the Catholic religion. The academics are very challenging but provide for skills such as critical thinking, time management, and being able to collaborate with others."
Freshman,4,"The thing that stood out to me about the University of Notre Dame was my professors! They have all been willing to go the extra mile in order to teach, be it holding long office hours and staying later or staying back long after class has ended, especially before exams. Their passion not only for the subject but for our education really helped me through some tough courses. Furthermore, the community is excellent.  Notre Dame is truly a family, and dorm communities are very distinct and strong. Each dorm has its own mascots and colors and become a part of a person's identity. It is similar to Greek life but without the negatives of rushing and hazing. Everybody is very kind and inclusive."
Alum,4,"It's not the most diverse place but the academics is good, people are overall kind, and alums are helpful! professors go out of their way to help you!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Notre Dame is a family before anything. For what it (frankly) lacks in diversity, it easily makes up with its strong sense of community and overall just nice guys and gals. From the most antisocial introvert (me) to the most put-yourself-out-there frat guy, Notre Dame has a home for you. Notre Dame boasts a beautiful campus that is not rivaled by many. The resources here allow students to flourish both in mind and heart. The focus on building human beings rather than just smarty pants is what distinguishes Notre Dame from the rest of the top tier pack colleges. Notre Dame professors and classes provide so much to each student due to the smaller (and therefore much better) faculty to student ratio. There is just so much opportunity waiting at each corner here at Notre Dame. While the first week (or even first year) may be a rush and leave you both mentally and socially spent, it'll easily bear its fruit as you come to see Notre Dame as the second home it is."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors/classes, lots of resources available to students on campus for career discernment/internships, great athletics, overall awesome student environment and experience."
Sophomore,4,"Notre Dame is a great place to find the balance between academic and social life. While plenty of the students intently focus on studies throughout the week, there also are always football or other sporting events going on throughout the weekends, and there are always Friday and Saturday night parties. However, as with many universities, the teaching staff is sometimes hit or miss just depending on who runs the class, but there are definitely some cool teachers. One of the major things that the University definitely lacks though is diversity, and of literally every sort. Whether it be race, political views, socioeconomic status, or religion, Notre Dame does a really poor job of developing a more diverse student body. 
In all though, the University does maintain a great academic record and provides pretty good financial help, while also offering an engaging athletic program that helps enrich the school."
Sophomore,4,"For one I like the academics; I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more challenged before. Secondly there are some really amazing people there who make it feel like home,e especially in the dorms. The people you meet in your dorms really become your friends and second family, and I really love that. In addition to form life, there are many diverse communities on campus that allow any and all people to fit in, which was really helpful my first year. But, if I had to change something about my school, I would definitely change the way they go about changing the diversity of the campus. Yes, they want more diversity but emphasizing the diverse groups and their culture isn‚Äôt very big, and I think if it was then campus would be improved."
Graduate Student,4,"Notre Dame is a family, not just on campus, but across the country. Alumni are everywhere and want to help the next generation of Notre Dame graduates be successful."
Freshman,4,Notre Dame offers a wide variety of opportunities. Study abroad opportunities are numerous and the people are very welcoming. The professor are extremely well educated and devoted to helping their students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"One word: community. If you are looking for a college experience that feels like you are truly home, then Notre Dame is the place for you. It's religion and location make it unique among top-15 universities, but this school is still a classic Work Hard, Play Hard university. No greek life, but the single-sex dorm culture is arguably better -- it holds many of the pros of Frats/Sororities without the pressures of rushing. School pride and interest in athletics is huge. 

But overall, what makes Notre Dame excellent is the people. Notre Dame doesn't accept simply the smartest of the smart. It accepts well-rounded and collaborative people -- it is why the community is so strong. The people who go here are fantastic, supportive, and will become your best friends."
Sophomore,4,"I love being at Notre Dame because of the friendships and connections I have made. Being a minority student, I do not think I would have stayed at the school without any friends just because the academics are very challenging and not being used to the lack of southern hospitality up in the midwest."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love the campus!! I have also met a lot of great people here, and the classes are interesting as well as very intellectually challenging. I have also had a ton of great professors!!"
Freshman,4,"I have attended Notre Dame for a semester and both the academics and the Catholic community have exceeded my expectations so far. The quality of teaching was great last semester, and the resources available, especially for freshman transitioning to college, have been extremely beneficial. The opportunities for growing in the Catholic faith are part of what drew me to Notre Dame, and is one of the unique aspects of the school that is hard to find at any other university."
Sophomore,4,"I am a city person. Notre Dame is not located in the city or near a city, matter of fact. That shows you how amazing this school is ... I left my great city of Boston to come out to the middle-of-nowhere Midwest to come to Notre Dame"
Junior,4,"Notre Dame is a very unique university. The campus is beautiful and there are so many fantastic opportunities for its students, but it takes a certain type to go here. ND does lack diversity; it isn't non-existent, but it is not the school's strongest aspect. While this may seem stifling to some more adventurous types, I've found many genuinely good friends there, of multiple races and genders. You have to remember that this is a Catholic university, so there are certain limitations to that. The dorms aren't co-ed and there isn't Greek life. The dorms almost become sororities and fraternities, which you can choose to involve yourself in to the degree that you want. The guys dorms are a lot more lax on the rules than girls dorms, which is unfair, but we make it work. There are almost always dorm parties or off-campus house parties on the weekends. While ND is a very academic/nerdy school, we still know how to be social. And of course, football is integral to ND life!"
Junior,4,"Notre Dame is a great college. Great atmosphere, with lots of sports to cheer on that are usually competitive and great academics for a good balance. Lacks diversity and cultural experiences but that is expected from a private Catholic school. Huge emphasis on academics and religion. Students are very motivated and determined to get good grades."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Notre Dame. The closeness of the student community is truly something else. I loved that the campus was small enough that you can get to pretty much everything pretty easily. The campus is beautiful. There were so many opportunities to get involved, whether it be through student groups, research, work, volunteering. Many of the students had similar values as me and it was very easy to make friends. The dorms really facilitated this as well. I did not like that there were double standards as far as enforcing rules in women's vs. men's dorms."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love Notre Dame.  The academics are rigorous, which has been a challenge, but I am glad I am expected to work hard and really earn my education.  I am a member of the marching band, which has been the greatest experience of my life.  I have been able to take on multiple leadership roles over my tenure, and I will be one of the primary leaders in the next year. Notre Dame has given me the opportunity to grow in ways I never thought possible.  My only complaint is that the university is so expensive, and they don't do the best job of helping out low-income students like me.  They meet 100% of FAFSA demonstrated need, but aren't very good about understanding that my family can't actually meet the numbers FAFSA says we can."
College Senior,4,"As a grad student, I haven't really walked around on campus at night or partied on campus. For the most part, I've walked with friends and I don't walk around alone much. It might be a different experience for undergrads. I feel relatively safe on campus but I also try to avoid certain areas of South Bend that are more dangerous."
College Senior,4,"The alumni network is great, great to reach out to."
College Sophomore,4,"Notre Dame is renowned for its fantastic alumni network, and from what I have seen it does not disappoint. You can truly call up anyone affiliated with the school, and he/she will be happy to take a chunk out of their day to devote time to you. It is so refreshing to see."
College Sophomore,4,"Academically, I have found myself excelling at Notre Dame. There is such a wide scope of classes to take that I was able to explore my peripheral interests, and take classes I didn't even know existed. My sociology seminar on criminology for example was absolutely fascinating. We discussed many of the theories that push people over the edge and lead them to a life of crime. Class size is good. A few classes are huge (100+ people), but for the most part the classes are relatively small which allows for good student-professor contact."
College Sophomore,4,"As far as I am concerned, campus is a very safe place. Going into South Bend though is a little dodgy though so you have to have your wits about you if you choose to venture off campus for a night out."
College Sophomore,4,"Notre Dame's football team is undoubtedly the focal point of student life - especially in season. Football games every weekend are truly a spectacle to behold, with almost all of the students attending the games. Fan support is unparalleled."
College Sophomore,4,"I have really loved my experience at Notre Dame so far. The people are so kind and welcoming- you could approach anyone and strike up a perfect combination. What is more, there is always something to do. Whether it be studying (which there is a fair bit of), or watching the football/basketball games, to simply playing catch on the quad, you will never find yourself bored."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of alcohol on campus, but pretty much no other drugs. While most people drink some, you can have a great social life even if you don't, and there's no pressure to drink if you don't want to."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone goes out to watch the football games. We are known for our touchdown Jesus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Football, basketball, and hockey are probably the biggest sports, with football being the major one by far. Football game days are awesome! Campus is buzzing with excitement all day and that continues into the stadium during the game. The student section is a ton of fun and almost all undergrads attend the games."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is very valuable, as are the opportunities that open up to graduates."
College Freshman,4,The quality of teaching is very high.
College Freshman,4,People are very loyal to their dorms.
College Freshman,4,The people are kind and quite cultured. Many are friendly and passionate about their specific interests.
College Freshman,4,"I definitely made the right decision. My professors make themselves very accessible, my classes are moderately interesting, football weekends are amazing, and I love going to basketball games. The grotto is one of my favorite places in the world, I have a solid group of friends and an on-campus job I am very happy with, and I've gotten involved with various fun organizations and clubs."
College Student,4,Past students from my program seem to have jobs before or fairly quickly after graduation.
College Student,4,I feel safe walking through campus. It's fairly well-lit at night. I often see police and safety driving around at all hours of the day.
College Student,4,There is a great sense of pride and tradition felt all around campus. Everything comes with a bit of history or its own fun fact.
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe walking around, but I don't go to parties, so I'm not the best to ask about the sexual assault issues"
College Freshman,4,"It's good. They're building new dorms, too"
College Freshman,4,I like going to the football games
College Sophomore,4,"I love the dorm system at Notre Dame.  Our system essentially replaces Greek life because students tend to live in the same dorm for all four years and form a great community within them.  We have interhall sports and other competitions, and we really love them.  My dorm is nice.  It is rather small, but it has recently been renovated, so it is pretty up to date.  However, we do not have elevators, air conditioning, or handicap accessible entries.  It is also one of the farthest dorms from most other buildings on campus, so it can take quite a while to get places.  As much as I love my hall, I would say that we are somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to quality, though I would never switch dorms unless I had to.  Another great thing about the dorms is that we each have a chapel and we can attend Mass in our dorms at least twice a week."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school revolves around football in the fall.  It's truly a wonderful tradition.  Basketball is another big sport for us.  Other than that, most people don't pay much attention to a sport unless they play it, their roommate plays it, or they know someone on the team.  Especially being a science major, I almost never interact with any athletes.  Most of them are in the college of business or the college of arts and letters.  Therefore, the athletics are a big deal for me, but I don't have a personal attachment or connection to any of them really."
College Freshman,4,"Dorm parties and Off Campus parties are both pretty fun. There isn't always stuff to do, but most of the time"
College Freshman,4,"Great school. Forces you to study hard, but in the end it is worth it. Great learning environment."
College Freshman,4,"Not many people do drugs.  A lot of alcohol, but I know of very few who are heavily into drugs."
College Freshman,4,Notre Dame has a lot of connections and like kids who went there. There isn't a lot of internship opportunity because South Bend isn't exactly a bustling metropolis. Career Services is wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,It makes it easy and great to get to classes and comes with a meal plan. It is also a great social environment to be a part of.
College Freshman,4,I've never really felt unsafe on campus (if we are ignoring the weather).
College Freshman,4,"When I visited some other colleges, I was horrified by the size of the dorms; it would be like living in an Altoids tin- with another person! I did not have the ability to visit Notre Dame, so when move-in day came, I was rather nervous- what would it be like?

I was pleasantly surprised.

All of the dorms on campus are quality and have a lot of history- my dorm is probably looked upon as one of the lesser dorms, but it's one of the best in my opinion. There are three windows in my room, a sink, more storage than in my room back home (even splitting it two ways), an acceptable wifi connection, heating that we are able to control, and plenty of leg room. The only thing that my dorm doesn't have is some of the aesthetic value that some of the other dorms have."
College Freshman,4,"At Notre Dame the big guy on campus is football, and it's wonderful. The tradition that is Notre Dame Football is a part of my experience here at Notre Dame that I wouldn't trade for the world.

The other athletics are good and important as well, but do kinda get overshadowed by football."
College Freshman,4,"I made the right choice in coming to Notre Dame. They push you, yes, but it's to make you grow (and yes, I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true). A lot of decisions are left up to you, but they powers that be will not allow you to sink."
College Freshman,4,"The community in the dorms is definitely amazing. The RAs are all great, and there are many events hosted to keep everyone busy. The only problems are that some older dorms do not have drinking water available, and it is the same price for any dorm even though some have air conditioning and some do not."
College Freshman,4,The school is working very hard to increase support for victims of sexual assault and decrease sexual violence on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are generally outstanding with a few who are better suited to research, but were forced to teach."
Alum,2,"I did not take any online courses, all my courses were on campus. There were no online course options until after my first year, which was not helpful for me because they were only intro classes that I had already taken."
Freshman,2,"Notre Dame is a great school, but it's simply NOT an art school. If you are a student looking to major in design, I would advise looking elsewhere. 

I was an ND graphic design student and ended up transferring because I was not being challenged in my art/design classes, and I was missing a creative community. My classmates had little passion for design which affected my motivation and the quality of instruction. The career development resources for design students are limited, and you cannot take a business/marketing unless you are enrolled in the Mendoza College of Business. This is not conducive to the art/design student who must be able to market their services and work. That being said, the instructors and staff are extremely friendly and supportive. However, the price of a Notre Dame education for an art/design student is not worth it."
Junior,2,"You need to be white, rich, and Catholic to fit in. And if you don't like summer camps, tough luck. Have fun being an outcast. There is virtually no diversity, the weather is horrible, and the administration doesn't care what the students have to say. Class sizes are very large, and professors are generally mediocre. I find that I teach myself all the material. My high school did a better job teaching than ND does. The only thing I find redeemable about this school is the study abroad program I went on, which was fantastic. I probably liked it so much because I was finally interacting with diverse people who weren't so fake and cookie cutter."
Freshman,2,"I really got a different vibe when I visited. However, after attending for 2 months, I have found that this school is cliquey and discriminatory. It is very difficult for non-Catholic students to find a place here. Additionally, the female student body is very fake and it makes it so difficult to make friends. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is how isolated the campus is. You have to Uber 5 miles ($10 one way btw) just to get shampoo from the nearest Target. I have found I actually like hanging out in (as students call it) ‚Äúghetto‚Äù South Bend rather than pretentious Notre Dame. The drinking culture is horrendous, it‚Äôs literally the only thing students here know how to do for fun. Everyone is so cookie cutter. HIGHLY considering transferring next year."
Senior,2,"As a senior, I wish I had done more homework in high school before I enrolled. If I could do it over, I would not attend Notre Dame. In academic, social and career points of view, this university miserably falls short.

I am currently attending the university's business school, and it should be nowhere near where it is ranked (#1 or 2 according to some media organizations). Classes are mediocre, professors are a hit or miss and Mendoza over-enrolls. There is very little guidance throughout the four years and the counselors have been generally unhelpful.

Socially, there is absolutely no diversity--and I mean this in more than racial sense. 95% of students here are either loaded foreign students, upper class white or athletes. If you don't fit into any of those categories, you WILL feel out of place. Surrounding areas suck (shitty bars and clubs) and it's bitterly cold in the winter. Overall, very overrated school--academically and in football."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is white, rich, preppy, and stuck up. Not much diversity. Seems like a lot of the diversity comes from athletic teams."
College Freshman,2,"The administration is awful and does not care about the students whatsoever. South Bend is not a great community, and there is not much to do off campus. The classes are okay, but the requirements are ridiculously long and GPA-killers."
College Freshman,2,"Strong sense of community is nice, but we pay an absurd amount of money to have such small rooms without air conditioning. Buildings are old and outdated. They need rennovations"
College Senior,2,"Although living on campus is easy, I don't find much of a community here, except a drinking one. Most people in my dorm, unfortunately, are into the drinking and dating-hookup culture, and I honestly don't belong."
College Freshman,2,"It's very inaccessible if you don't have a car / don't mind walking 15 minutes to Eddy Street in freezing weather. You wouldn't want to go into South Bend anyway, though."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process didn't go too well for me, but I would say get started early so funds don't run out."
College Junior,2,"South Bend is dangerous and there is not much to do further off campus than just one street. There is a nice mall, but I usually never have time to go there. There isn't much reason to leave campus either, because we have a student grocery store called the Huddle and other places to eat besides the dining hall. They also show movies every friday and saturday in the large class room."
College Junior,2,Few places are good but the pickings are slim for the most part.
College Freshman,2,"While South Bend isn't as boring as I would imagine, it still doesn't make for a great college town. Not much activity going on outside of campus and Chicago is a good 2 hour drive on a toll road."
Recent Alumnus,2,South Bend has very little to offer outside of the University. Not much interaction occurs between students and members of the town
College Sophomore,2,"Being a Catholic university, many characteristics seem to be almost homogenous and the student body is not very diverse overall."
College Sophomore,2,"South Bend is a boring city. There is not much for students to do and the nightlife, outside of a few bars, is lacking. Some students go into Chicago for professional sports games, museums, and nightlife, but that takes a fair amount of effort."
College Sophomore,2,"South Bend is not an amazing city, the only thing in the area is campus. Students don't need to leave campus since there is plenty to do, however there are some clubs to go to and parks, with some museums."
College Sophomore,2,"I come from a suburban middle-class family and fall right into the category of ""not receiving aid"" even though I have two sisters in college and a younger brother who will enter college shortly.  I wish ND could have helped my parents more."
College Sophomore,2,"South Bend sucks a bit. There are bars and clubs right off campus that students go to, but overall, students spent very little time in South Bend."
College Sophomore,2,"St Liam's sucks. I think the health services are the worst part of ND. They need to get more doctors working there. The nurses don't know anything. I am generally disappointed with the health services. If you have a big issue though, there is a hospital close by and other health services not affiliated to ND are close to campus. As far as safety goes, campus is relatively safe. DON'T walk in South Bend alone at night. It is dangerous and there is crime in downtown South Bend. ND is very sheltered and there are very few crimes. In fact, people leave their laptops and stuff around and expect that people wouldn't take it, which is generally very true. NDSP are good. They are generally nice and friendly."
College Sophomore,2,Off-Campus housing is very helpful however expensive and difficult to get around.
College Sophomore,2,Typical midwest weather. Cold winters. Early fall and late spring is nice
College Sophomore,2,"Winters here are bad. I repeat bad--lots of snow, long winters, and I'm from Chicago!"
College Junior,2,"Super annoying, everyone is super uptight about drugs"
College Junior,2,"Parietals. And super anti-drug. Caught once, and you're suspended for a semester or yr"
College Junior,2,"white.. catholic.. etc.. etc.. what you see is what you get. You can find diverse groups, but you really have to look to meet those ppl, especially religion-wise"
College Junior,2,South Bend is a thriving metropolis.... not.
College Junior,2,"The Winters are almost exclusively below freezing, sometimes below zero. And since Indiana has very little to show for in terms of hills or elevation difference, it can get very windy and the wind chills will dip below zero semi-regularly. The Falls are very nice and the end of the spring semester can be decent, but overall, weather is probably the worst part of Notre Dame"
College Junior,2,The midwest isn't known for its food for a reason.
College Sophomore,2,There's a really lenient policy with underage drinking--even the RA's permit it.
College Freshman,2,My biology major was terrible. It was so much work and so time consuming. As a college freshman! I don't even know exactly what I want to do with my life yet. 
College Sophomore,2,"South Bend has some troubled areas.  The bus is free to students and you can pick one up at the library that will take you to the mall.  University Park Mall is pretty good, and there are other places nearby in Mishawaka.  Many of the locals don't really like the Notre Dame students, but some still go to the sport events."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather can make things a bit gloomy in January/February, but it is really easy to cut through buildings on the way to class to break up the time spent walking around outside.  Campus buildings are not spaced too far away from each other, so you do not need to walk around outside for too long if you want to avoid it."
College Freshman,2,Very unpredictable and shocking for a southerner
College Sophomore,2,"South Bend is not the greatest place to be. It has a mall with some of your basic offerings (J Crew, Macys) and a minor league baseball team. Besides that, and the local nightclub and student-favorite ""Fever,"" it is rare that students venture off campus. There is not much need nor incentive. "
College Sophomore,2,"Again, being in the Midwest and in a small town there is not much diversity of food in the town. "
College Junior,2,"When it isn't snowing, there are like 3 nice weeks until the mosquitos arrive. Fall is beautiful, but the humidity is oppressive."
College Sophomore,2,"As someone who has lived in NYC, Arizona, and LA, I think I can give a more objective review than most students here. Transportation, in general, sucks. Students get free bus passes, but the buses are never on time, only make a few direct stops, do not have electronic signs to inform you when they are coming or delays (well, what do  you expect?), and run every hour or so. Extremely inefficient and backwards (obviously there are no subways or anything like that). Other than that, there is only Eddy St. within walking distance. You can take the taxis, but obviously it gets expensive for a college student after a while. If you're the type of person who likes to get off-campus sometimes to get away from the bubble, it might be a good idea to befriend someone with a car or bring your own."
College Senior,2,"The spring, summer and fall are beautiful.  However, the winter is brutal and seems to last forever."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing more to say than that the university follows the law.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is pretty bad. If you think you might have SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) which is where you need sunlight regularly to feel well, ND probably isn't the place for you. Campus is absolutely beautiful, but its natural setting is snowy for a vast majority of the school year. August, September, and most of October are okay, but after that, until April or even May, there is very often a lot of snow and precipitation, being so close to Lake Michigan. Students have often referred to campus as having a ""perma-cloud."" The walk to classes is never longer than 15-20 mins, though, and ND is a really awesome place regardless. The changing seasons are beautiful on campus! Plus, when it gets warm, everyone appreciates it that much more!"
College Junior,2,"I have a pretty diverse group of friends, but I have always sought diversity.  Most people here are white, rich, and Catholic so it's also easy to just find that crowd or if you're a minority, you can easily stick with your ethnic group because you are invited to many events sponsored to celebrate diversity."
College Junior,2,"In the fall it's usually very nice out.  Then beginning in November it begins to become really cold and starts to snow around November but doesn't usually stick to the ground until December.  Then all spring there is a lot of snow and can stay until April.  Usually there's one week in March that ""teases"" the students by warming up to the 60s but then drops down 30 degrees the next week creating a lot of wetness and ice with all the melting and re-freezing.  It doesn't really get warm until May and even then it can still be cool but sunny."
College Sophomore,2,Notre Dame is not very diverse especially in regards to race. A majority of students also share common political beliefs and religious backgrounds.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather here is not very great. It‚Äôs usually somewhere between 20 and 60 degrees F most of the year, and snows quite frequently. The summer days are nice and sunny though, and when good weather comes around everyone is seen outside. Even during the bad weather though, students find ways to have fun such as snowball fights. Plus, the campus becomes even more beautiful when covered in snow. The snow doesn't get in the way of classes either, ground keepers do a very good job of clearing sidewalks for use."
Recent Alumnus,2,South Bend is a dump and not much of a city life. There is one club in the city and I think they are closing it down. All the bars are too small and overpacked with students.
College Freshman,2,"Walking around campus, you'll mostly see white, average-looking people who become difficult to distinguish from each other after awhile. Admissions makes sure to bring students from all around the country, however, not just the Midwest. There have been considerable pushes recently to bring in students of different races through specific programs."
College Freshman,2,"It gets cold. Really cold. Plus we have lake-effect snow, which makes winter last that much longer. Not fun, but the fall is *gorgeous* on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Overall, the student body is Caucasian, Conservative and Catholic. We do have a decent number of other ethnicities however, just not as many as you would find at other top 20 schools. It is also easy to become involved with different student body groups. For example we have a very active Hawaiin club that holds weekly meetings and puts on a huge luau at the end of the year. So while our student body is not that ""diverse,"" you can find your niche no matter what ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation you are."
College Senior,2,No buses on campus.  Lots of bicycles and walking.  Public buses on the fringes 100%.
College Sophomore,2,"It really depends on your personality. Dorms buildings here are separated by gender, and parietals (restriction on hours of which the one could be in the opposite gender's dorm) are enforced. Rectors (whom are nuns and priest) live in every dorm. Although this sounds strict, it is only the girls dorms where they strictly enforce all the rules. Guys dorms get to have late and loud parties and hook ups/drinking usually are ""allowed"" (not officially, but everyone knows) here. Being a girl, it is kind of annoying."
College Senior,2,"Notre Dame really encourages students to live on campus all 4 years, but recently there have been a number of housing complexes that have opened up near campus that are pretty nice.  Living in South Bend itself can be dangerous - there are reports of breakins and the like not infrequently.  Public transportation is spotty at best so you pretty much need a car to live off campus, although there are a few complexes that are walkable to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Incredibly Strict in Girls Dorms; Leniant in Boys Dorms ‚Äì Dorms are single sex, and boys and girls dorms are as different as you can possibly imagine.  Both have have certain hours known as parietals when the opposite sex are allowed to visit.  In a boys dorm, one can break parietals, if careful, and the RA's will typically chose to simply ignore it.  In a girls dorm, an RA will check the room, and if she catches you, she will report you to the rector.  A girl may be thrown out of her dorm and have to move to another dorm, or even be kicked off campus.  

Campus is not dry at all, and alcohol can be found anywhere you go.  Again, in a girls dorm, it has to be kept pretty quiet.  In a boys dorm, it is completely ok to have beer in your room as long as it doesnt end up in the hallways.  Drinking games and kegs aren't allowed (doesn't mean they can't be found though).  Hard alcohol is not allowed on campus, but in certain boys dorms, you can get away with having it as long as you don't leave handles sitting out. 

Regarding drug use, if you are caught smoking or in the possession of any drugs, you are automatically expelled from the university.  It does not matter if you test positive or not.  They have an absolute no tolerance policy."
College Sophomore,2,"If you like cold weather and snow, this is the place for you.  If you are from a warm weather climate, you will have a hard time adjusting.  Walking through the quads are like walking through wind tunnels, with the wind always blowing the opposite way that you need to go."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly White, Upper-Class ‚Äì There is a stark lack of diversity on campus, where every male seems to be 6' 0"", white, and of an athletic background, and every female appears  to originate from Degrassi. Hispanics and Asians are the leading minority groups (in that order), though specific groups are over-represented: Chinese, Mexican, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"No Need to Leave Campus ‚Äì The campus is very small, and the South Bend area is lackluster, meaning transportation is neither provided nor thought of. You'll never want to leave the ""Notre Dame Bubble"" anyways."
College Junior,2,Not bad until it gets cold.  The quads become a wind tunnel and walking to class sucks. The temp is 30 and the wind chill is well below zero.  Alcoholism helps.
College Senior,2,"Wayyyy Tooo Expensive ‚Äì Notre Dame is at over $50,000/ year and their financial aid office does not help too much in contributing to the economic diversity of the student population. They treat you like a number and there is virtually no human consideration given to specific situations."
College Freshman,2,Drinking Is Where It's at ‚Äì No one does drugs. People only drink. But half the fun is avoiding those pesky and persistent police officers!
Graduate Student,1,"Took online courses during COVID-19. The ability to switch from in person to online was difficult with only a week to prepare. This is no fault of the faculty and staff of the school, though."
College Freshman,1,"Professors love to hear themselves talk and really don't communicate well or care about individual students (class sizes are HUGE). The courses are good, but the variety is lacking. There are a ton of requirements that really put a damper on class selection. The class sizes are HUGE HUGE HUGE in almost every field. Very difficult to connect with a professor outside of office hours"
College Freshman,1,"The strictness at my school depends on who and where you are. The boys dorms get an extreme amount of leniency while the girls dorms are under extremely strict rule (which are supposed to be applied to all dorms). I'd like the school to re-think co-ed dorms, but do to the religious affiliation that is very unlikely. Also, a very annoying policy is parietals--where guys have to be out of girls dorms and vice versa by 1:00am on weekdays and 2:00am on weekends."
College Junior,1,"South Bend sucks. There are a few places that are cool directly off campus: Between the buns, CJs, Feve. But besides that there is no reason to ever leave campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"The strictness in regards to underage drinking is completely lopsided. Male students are rarely punished for infractions, while female students are humiliated and punished severely. Visitation requires students to leave opposite-sex dorms are certain times, which fosters skewed gender relations."
College Sophomore,1,It's cold and wet 90% of the time.
College Junior,1,"WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE HERE, LET ALONE FOUND A SCHOOL. WHY. Winter is SO long. Fall is nice though."
College Sophomore,1,"Actually, Notre Dame doesn't have any Greek Life."
College Junior,1,"Everyone is white, and mostly religious, and there is acceptance of other life styles to a certain extent, but no one gets judged too harshly for discrimination. Google the notre dame anti-gay comic scandal for a very scary example."
College Freshman,1,freshman must live on campus
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have Greek life on campus. They are replaced by the dorm system, which is incredible."
College Sophomore,1,"Notre Dame has been notorious for its lack of diversity. Although students are generally accepting of those who are different, the lack of diversity among students makes it so many do not even attend the school. The Catholic identity (80% of students) and its Midwest location make for an attractive school for white, Catholics from middle class families. These students make up most of the population. "
College Junior,1,"If you aren't white, religious, heterosexual, slim, and wealthy, you're going to be an outsider here. There is not only very little diversity, but there is rampant elitism, classism, homophobia, and racism. It's pretty sad."
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly Dreary ‚Äì Be prepared for the elements! The first month or so is extremely hot. The winter season is very harsh -lots snow and bitter cold days. There is always an overcast (I got very pale last year). It rains a lot in the spring, so bring rainboots. Take advantage of the beautiful sunny days..."
College Senior,1,"Not Worth It ‚Äì Unless you fall into the need-based financial aid category, don't waste your time."
College Sophomore,1,"Compared to most other schools, yeah, the weather is pretty rotten."
College Sophomore,1,"If we had it, I could tell you.  But I frankly don't even know what that is here."
College Sophomore,1,"Never Been in a More White-Dominated Place ‚Äì The University is trying to increase it's reputation as a whites-only school, but it sure looks like everybody is still white."
College Freshman,1,We Have All Types ‚Äì We have both types! Irish and German Catholics... If you aren't white people assume you're an athlete

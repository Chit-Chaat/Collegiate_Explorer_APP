Junior,5,Neumann is a fantastic university. The staff and professors are fair and very helpful. Everyone is extremely kind and caring here. The campus is beautiful and the students are listened to and cared for.
Junior,5,Due to Covid-19 most classes moved online. It was a seamless transition considering the circumstances. I am currently enrolled on an original online course and it is a great class.
Alum,5,"I am a graduate of the Public Safety Administration program. This course was excellent as were the professors. Every one had real life experience and taught the skills you need to become an excellent administrator.  This degree prepared and provided me all the skills and tools I needed to promote from a supervisory level to a command level.  I have since recommended this program to several of my colleagues who have gone on to obtain their Bachelor's degrees.  It's well worth the time, money and hard work."
Alum,5,"Neumann is a small college with an excellent staff that wants you to succeed.  All the help you could need is right there on campus. Tutors, peer mentors, counselors,  writing lab. If you fail it's your own fault. The classes are generally small so the professors get to know you well and take a personal interest in your success. Financial Aid and scholarships are abundant!  Excellent little school.   My daughter will be attending in the Fall 2020 majoring in nursing.  Since I graduated from Neumann they gave her an extra $1000 Legacy grant!"
Alum,5,I found my online and hybrid courses to have a heavier workload. The professors were still engaging and accessible.

Neumann takes ""Uniquely Personal"" to a whole new level. They are dedicated to making your college education as enjoyable as possible. All of the faculty and staff are super friendly! Since it is a small school in a rural area, Neumann tries to hold a lot of fun activities for the students. The facilities on campus are very nice, including a brand new health sciences building and a new turf field this summer. Also offers a lot of scholarships and financial aid!"
Senior,5,Took classes online for the Coronavirus and enjoyed my experience. The professors are helpful and kind for the most part. Easy to get help or tutoring if you need it.

There are many different clubs for different activities, and the school listens to the students and is always open to to new ideas and clubs future students may want.

I am in my sophomore year in the nursing program, I play basketball for the team and I am currently I interested in being a Resident Assistant  for junior year. The campus life is very peaceful and serene. The teacher ,professor and nuns are great at lending a helping hand and being compassionate towards students. The social life on campus is good for the most part student of all genders age group's and ethnic backgrounds respect and engage with each other. I would refer anyone to apply to Neumann University for the above qualities."
Sophomore,5,It is a nice school for commuters and the housing is clean and up to date. The staff care about your academics and want the best for you. Being that it is close to Philadelphia there are many chances to branch off and get involved in many activities.
Freshman,5,My experience has been going great. I really enjoy this college. Neumann is a very great school and I wish i can enjoy my 4 years of college here. This is one of best schools in the state. Only things that could change about this school is the size of the campus but that's not even a big deal.
Junior,5,"My experience at Neumann University, thus far, has been absolutely perfect.  I would not change a single aspect of the college.  I will always have great memories and amazing connections."

Freshman,5,"Neumann is a great school that I commute to outside of Philadelphia. I love it because it is a small, private, Christian school. I like that it is big enough to feel like I am on a college campus but not overwhelming and loud like some big city campuses. I come form a big city and was looking for a quiet change. The staff are as helpful as they would be if you were still in high school. The cafeteria is beautiful and I love hanging there between class to eat, study, and hang out. The food is unlimited and delicious. We have an indoor track, a gym, and an outdoor basketball court I can play on between classes. I feel very safe and comfortable here. Neumann has made my freshmen year very easy!"
Niche User,5,"The people there are very friendly. And the campus is big. I went there on a field trip back in the 7th grade, along with other colleges. Neumann is the only school that I couldn't get out of my mind. I love it and since then, it's my dream to attend this school."
Freshman,5,Neumann University is an excellent school. The Professors here truly care about you and you feel a personal connection to all of them. The campus is beautiful and has a very welcoming feeling to it.
Junior,5,"I am a third year student at Neumann and  I love it. I initially chose it because of how small the campus is compared to others and its academic reputation. Its really close knit. Almost everyone knows each other, allowing for personal experiences and interactions among students and professors. All my professors know me by name, which I love. I first applied to Neumann for their reputable nursing program but rather I fell in love with Social Work."
Graduate Student,5,"I have had a wonderful experience at Neumann University. Having a full time job, with a family and being enrolled in grad school full time has its challenges but Neumann has made the process of adult education easy. By being able to registering online and  avoid waiting in lines or fighting for classes that are needed to further your degree.
The instructors are personable and truly want to see you succeed. Each instructor has offered to be available both in person and via email. Classes are held on the weekend which is another benefit when working full time through out the week. I feel they make such an effort to cater to the adult learner.  I am so pleased that I chose Neumann University to complete my masters degree."

Freshman,5,"Neumann has helped me out a lot throughout my first semester of college. The ARC has tutoring which helps you with any class you need. Also, the library has several study rooms where you can have quiet time to study"
Freshman,5,"What I liked about Neumann University was the academics and campus. The professors help each student with any issues they might have. The resources at Neumann University are very helpful. The university has so much to offer involving academics and majors. The environment at Neumann University is very calm and peaceful. There isn`t much to do on the campus which makes the campus life great. The diversity is half and half. Neumann is known for there nursing program which makes this major challenging. Nevertheless, the university helps students thrive in their career paths by giving resources and introducing students to different people that can enhance our abilities to excel in careers."
Senior,5,Neumann University is a wonderful college! The campus is beautiful and very clean. The nursing program is extremely highly ranked and the graduate nurses are known to be successful!
Sophomore,5,i like that Neumann is a small university. We as a university are all connected as one mostly and we all help one another out meaning the teachers help the students and the students help the teachers. The classroom environment is also very good and we as a class learn a lot of information. I just like Neumann university as a whole. The basketball games are very fun to watch and majority students always come out for home basketball game and some students go to a lot of away games as well. We as students support each other in many ways.
Sophomore,5,The one thing I like about Neumann is that fact that it more of a home than just a school.  The faculty and staff go above and beyond to make you feel special and to make you feel like you belong here. It is really a great place to be and a great place to learn and grow.  The only thing I would change would have to be the food. It's is good however so more options would be great!

Neumann has a beautiful campus with incredible infrastructure. The staff is all extremely friendly and reply to your emails in a fashionable time period."
Sophomore,5,I started Neumann's Social Work program. I feel apart of a family. My mom moved to Florida and I am here basically taking care of my dad. The professors that I have met have been there for me. They guide me and never fail on me when I want to give up. I have never felt so happy to meet the mentors I have now. I have been given the chance to grow and learn about something I will be happy enough to do till I retire. I love being close to my faith again and knowing that if I run a stray I have amazing people willing to help me come back and finish what I started. I will keep fighting so that when I graduate I can help others like they helped and are still helping me.
Freshman,5,Small knit community.  Classes are low student/teacher ratio.  Teachers really care about their students.  Need to add healthier choices in cafeteria and more variety.
Sophomore,5,"It is founded and sponsor by the sister of St Francis of Philadelphia.  It is a private Catholic CO educational university in the franciscan tradition which emphasized respect for individuals , concern for the environment and social responsibilities.  The campus is very beautiful with some big parking for students vehicles surrounded by dorms and one apartment building for students with  shopping area."
Freshman,5,Nuemann university is awesome the girls are awesome the teachers are awesome and the food is ok not my cup of tea but you get it im sure i didnt know i was coming to neumann til the last second before graduation.

College Freshman,5,My overall experience with Neumann has been excellent. I went from a hard major to an easy major. The professors are nice. The courses are easier now.

Sophomore,4,"I love that at Neumann, you're not just a number to your professors, you're a student. And they do everything that they can to help you succeed in your respective field. The students are genuinely kind and intelligent and want to lead the way. There's plenty of ways to get involved on campus, and many ways to get into student leadership through these campus activities."
Sophomore,4,I transferred over to Neumann during my spring semester of freshman year at college after having a bad experience at another university. Honestly was the best decision I’ve ever made. Teachers here really care about your education and want to see you succeed. Students here are also very welcoming. There’s not really much to do on campus other than play a sport. Most people who stay on campus go home during the weekends since campus is usually dead. The food here isn’t the best either unless you go to the knights cafe. Other than that I would recommend Neumann to anyone!
Senior,4,"Neumann has been a great university that has fit all of my needs. The resources provided are endless, and majority of my professors have always been there for me whenever I needed help. If my professors were not available there were other resources to help me with my problem. The campus is beautiful, and all of the new updates make school enjoyable."
Niche User,4,"I attended a field hockey game for Neumann University and it was a very good experience, I loved the campus and the size and location was perfect. Overall, I really enjoyed my time and being on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Neumann is a great school if you want that small school feeling! I love that i can talk to anyone and they know who I am. I can talk to my professors and actually get the help I need. The people are amazing and so nice. 
The living conditions are great for the school and are very spacious. Freshman have to triple but I loved it. The food is okay and sometimes made me sick due to my IBS but the staff and admission people worked with me to get better food!

The party scene at Neumann isn't really a lively one but there are three party schools within 10 minutes. West chester Widener and UD!

Over all NU was just the place for me."

Freshman,4,"The staffs are very welcoming and super friendly. The students there are involved in many clubs, sports and other activities."
Sophomore,4,2017 was my first year at Neumann and it was probably a year I would never forget.

Freshman,4,I love that it is a smaller school so most people now Each other. People are so friendly and easy to communicate with. The professors care a lot about how. you do.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Neumann University and it is a very good college academically. The Biology program is excellent and the small class sizes make it easier to form a relationships with professors and get more help from them. The campus is also safe and well kept. The drawbacks about the college is that in terms of the party scene and activities that go on, it is more similar to a high school. The food options are also not that good considering that the regular meal plans cost over 2,000 dollars per semester, and the only smaller option is only good for nine meals."
Sophomore,4,I like how the campus is small and it is close to Philadelphia.The professors really care about there students.They take the time to know your name.Also they will go the extra mile to make sure the students understand the materiel. The school is a very close knit community that offers the best advice to students.

College Freshman,4,It's small but not too small and the class sizes are great and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Some of the safest dorm set ups that I had seen, but they are a little small for my liking. Also having a sweet style dorm was a selling point for me!"
College Freshman,4,"the school has offered me everything that I could have asked for, a small school, great academics, and an even better student life. The facilities could stand to be updated but all in all I am happy with what the school has to offer"
College Freshman,4,"Even those who do not participate in athletics, are very supportive of the teams playing. There is a lot of school spirit at different sporting events along with a lot of fan support."

The Career and Personal Development Center is so helpful for resume help, internships and other stuff."

Recent Alumnus,4,"My experience at Neumann University is absolutely phenomenal. I wouldn't choose to be anywhere else and the funny thing is I didn't plan that I would end up there. I had some mishaps at my community college that disqualified me from my program and my focus on school was depleting. Thankfully, I found a second chance at Neumann to take advantage of an amazing education. I've met so many different people and the staff is so helpful and willing. I transferred in with a 2.47 GPA and finished my first transfer year with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 as Biology/Clinical Lab Science Major. I continue to have issues with paying for school and the Sisters and Ministry personnel have done everything they can to help include scholarship opportunities and emergency book funds. However, I am grateful for the help yet I still have an outstanding balance and debt. Not only do they help with financial aid but they've opened the doors to volunteering and service opportunities that I was never interested in before. Now, I volunteer as much as I can as well as working for the school and an off campus job servicing hospital patients. Neumann has also exposed me to an amazing research program that helped me earn a publication.. And to think I'm still pursuing my undergrad degree! I cannot imagine the opportunities I will have after graduation, during continuing education, and as an alumni. I look forward to always being involved with Neumann as they have given me a hand in life, learning, and experience."
Recent Alumnus,4,Neumann is a safe campus. Campus safety frequently patrols the area and there are emergency call buttons around campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"A few things I liked about Neumann were the teachers, location, and class size. Teachers were extremely helpful and approachable. The location was easy to find. The class size is small enough, that teachers know your name. 

       Neumann is unique in the way of their Franciscan tradition. The school is deeply rooted in faith. I would choose to go to Neumann if I had the choice again due to the above reasons."
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletics were well for the most part. Lacrosse and field hockey did well in accordance with these topics. Neumann offered a good amount of intramurals.
College Sophomore,4,We have a sufficient amount of people on our security staff on duty 24 hours long. They are always riding around the campus every hour. They provide escorting services to nearby malls and supermarkets for those who do not have cars. Our security service is dedicated to our students' safety.
College Sophomore,4,"As an athletic training student, I am required to take a lot of anatomy classes, a lot of labs, and complete clinical practice at different schools in the Delaware County area. So far, I believe that I have some of the best teachers in my field of study at my school. They have helped me improve my study habits, and helped me apply my knowledge of the human body to what I am learning."

Sophomore,2,"Neumann Universiy is a good school for Nursing, and other Medical fields. I am a  International Business Major and the Business programs at the school arent so good. They try to get over on you, and they are an expensive school. The only good thing is they offer a lot of financial aid."
Freshman,2,"The school is okay. It is not the best based on the cost. There are so many schools that you could go to that are the same price but are better in every way. Some advisors are not helpful, the administrators are not very helpful ether. Save yourself some money honestly."
College Freshman,2,"I see a lot of people underage drinking and drinking off campus, and smoking, and people returning drunk and it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I believe that Neumann University could improve this aspect of their school. Neumann does not offer much help with finding an internship at this time. While Neumann does offer help with career development, it did not help much with the job search for a general biology major. Neumann's career development helps with resumes, cover letters, and interviews."

College Sophomore,2,Most students that are legal age go to Barnaby's every thursday night but everyone goes home on weekends which can be a bummer.
College Sophomore,2,"With the very high acceptance rate, we get many students from the inner city area. In my opinion, there needs to be a higher acceptance rate. Most people here are catholic."

College Freshman,2,you need your own car
College Freshman,2,i am not too sure
College Freshman,2,"small and quiet, In the middle of nowhere"
College Freshman,2,"Whites seem to be minority, its as if anyone got accepted"
College Sophomore,2,"Basically if students do not have an early class when  commuting to class, then it is very difficult to find a parking spot.  Sometimes students have to park across campus to get to the main building to get to class.  Also, commuting students would eventually start parking near the housing buildings that are reserved for on campus students.  Around noon every space is filled in every parking lots.
About 60% of the student at Neumann are commuters and there should be more parking lot so it can be more convenient for students to find a descent spot and close to the building."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a cafeteria, and a cafe on campus. The hours for the cafeteria are restricted, and the cafe closes fairly earlier on specific days. The ""healthy"" options are minimal, and the staff finds a way to make most food unhealthy. By covering it in salt, butter, or cheese (you can literally taste the ""unhealthiness""). The produce selection is poor, and gets worse as the week progresses. The cafeteria charges way too much for the selection of food they produce. And at least half the staff that work at either the cafeteria or cafe have an attitude problem/mean. Also half the time students have to ask stuff to put the daily items out because they with forgot or were too lazy (things such as; peanut butter, bread or bagels, butter, hot sauce, milk, etc)."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid prosess is not that dificult to do. It's fairly simple and quick. The tips on getting financial aid at my school would to be to make sure one applies for the scholarships that are offered. The only problem that would arise with applying is that one has to be registered for the next year/semester to recieve the email for the link of scholarships. I had a problem with that. So i advise people to keep up on their bill and status as a student. Also, the financial aid office has many loan companies that works with my school to help pay for college tuition."
Junior,1,"Learning online at Neumann since moving virtual has been difficult. I thought the professors would t teach class but now all I get are voiceovers where all I see is the Professor eyeballs. Like seriously, you gotta be kidding me. Oh and lets forget when they do divide to read the PowerPoint verbatim with now examples and pots and pans clinging in the background. They have not made transition by any means easy or the student. Just do me favor and choose another school that cares about their student being great nurses, please 🙏🏾"
Senior,1,"Terrible, unethical, and yes, immoral nursing program. The nursing professors are glorified bullies, and they don’t care about your academic success or personal issues. No test review, they will not divulge class averages on tests, and exams now rumored to be proctored. A handful of students cheated, and they punished the entire program instead of punishing those involved. School is ridiculously expensive, one of the most expensive in the state. 7-point grading average, extremely average NCLEX pass rates, they accept 150+ students and only about 20+ students graduate, the nursing classes are 2 credits, the clinicals are two credits, they created nursing classes that don’t exist: pharm 2 & med surg 3. Parents, please read this and understand full of the unethical practices of Neumann’s nursing program. Parents or students, your student or you deserve better. The world needs nurses now more than ever. Go to their competition."
Senior,1,"No test review, no class averages, exams may or may not be proctored, and this school is ridiculously expensive."
Graduate Student,1,"Nursing Program: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! 
I went to Nuemann after graduating with a 3.5 GPA.  I have now completed 18 classes , over 40,000 in debt and will soon graduate with Liberal Arts Degree. My GPA dropped to a 2.8, which is too low for other nursing programs to even. accept you. The school sounds good when you hear that you don't have to take the TEAs or hear that other students of color attend. In reality, they only allow black people into the program, just to say that they have black students.. Neumann literally torture us by failing us semester after semester by less than 1 point, or making us withdraw because our grades are low after they already took our money. I watched 10 LPNs transition (8 black & 2 whites), only the two whites remaining. The 8 blacks fails out or left after  first semester of taking nursing courses which they wasn't prepared for. Sad to say, the whites all help each other, in which they get help from the professors while blacks stay in dark."
Graduate Student,1,"Nursing Program:
They stopped doing test review. How will we know what we got wrong, how to study for future exams and how to better prepare for next semester if we need to retake the class. The head professor of a course, was only reading the power points. The professor that taught with her, used her days of teaching to discuss case studies instead of teaching the material. The head professor stopped her from even allowing us to review the video for us to follow up on and record for our knowledge of understanding of the material after already being promised access. The Dean seem like she available to help but my friend reached out to her after a death in her family & how about no one, not even the dean or the advisor called or even verified how she was doing academically. My friend had to go to the president of Neumann for direction, better yet even a response to her situation. Do not bother, please I beg you. GO ELSE WHERE to spend / waste your money. God bless you & Your career !"
Alum,1,"Absolute garbage. 

All of the positive reviews you're reading are all fake. The idiot who runs the marketing department at Neumann realized they needed to offset all of the positive reviews so he had unpaid interns sitting at a computer for hours on end making up fake email accounts and profiles on sites like this, and gave Neumann all positive reviews. 

Why is Neumann so bad? Simply no one cares.
Neumann feels like a low income high school. The buildings on campus are all falling apart and maintenance doesn't care. 
All of the higher ups like the VP's don't care about maintaining order, all they care about is playing politics. 
The food service is awful, again because no one cares.
The teachers are all clueless. Most of them are adjunct so Neumann can cheap out and not pay full time professors. 
The equipment is all old and in need of replacement. 
The computers and IT are a joke. 

 Avoid this school at ALL costs."
Junior,1,This is for anyone wanting to go there for nursing: DONT. The program needs to be investigated. They are sabotaging students passing because they want the least amount of students graduating so their Nclex pass rate goes up. I noticed something was fishy when professors wouldn’t answer questions in class any more and the exams were starting to be on information not covered in class or modules. Also- the passing grade rate is going up to an 80. Just another way to make sure less students pass. Go to a different university!
College Freshman,1,Neumann University does not have Greek Life.
College Junior,1,"If your looking for a school with a college atmosphere, DON'T attend this school. Very boring school with nothing to do."
College Junior,1,I wish Neumann University had one.
College Junior,1,"There is one dining hall and two cafes. The dining hall serves some kind of chicken every night. They do serve off the grill cheeseburgers, grilled cheese, hot dogs etc. You have to get there early thought, if you want something off the grill. The lines are long. There is pizza but most of the time it is burnt or old.  The dining hall has fresh sandwiches but the lines can be long as well. There is something always different for desserts. Get them quickly though or you'll miss out. The two cafes are stop and go. The cafes have anything from  burgers and soda to coffee and breakfast sandwiches."
College Junior,1,"I transferred out of Neumann due to the social life. Everyone that lives in the dorms go home on the weekends so it can be very boring. I went home pretty much every weekend unless I had to work a basketball game or a practice, I was the manager.  Campus dining needs more options. Neumann's dining is horrible. The food is either uncooked or left out from the previous night. There are many more options off campus. If anything,while attending Neumann, I loved their academics. The teachers care about you and want you to succeed in life. You can really form a connection with your professors."
College Freshman,1,"I hate it, considering transferring"
College Freshman,1,it is a dry campus
College Freshman,1, no night life. there is nothing around campus so a car is a necessity. very dry campus. must go to another college closeby for a party or something to do on a Saturday night
College Sophomore,1,We have no greek life. I wish we did. but maybe they'll come up with one soon.
College Freshman,1,"The Athletics at Neumann University is mediocre at best. The times for Track and Field are sub-par and even my high school could beat the team in a meet. The basketball team is horrendous and again my high school basketball team could best them in a game. Athletics is not a focal point here at Neumann, which is a good thing considering the teams aren't that great."
College Freshman,1,"There is not a very big nightlife at Neumann University. Clubs and organizations are not allowed to throw parties on campus, so there are many off campus parties, but you can not attend them without a car. Also, your chances of getting into trouble with the Aston police are higher off campus. Neumann ultimately has no nightlife. There is one big local bar that people over 21 attend, called Barnaby's. Beside that, there is no local fun for people under 21, unless you go to Philadelphia, PA."
College Freshman,1,If I were you go somewhere else or transfer out. This whole place is abysmal 
College Freshman,1,Not too much diversity mainly african american and white
College Freshman,1,"They are abysmal, good luck finding a computer with wi-fi or one that isn't out of order."
College Freshman,1,"They say no beer or drugs in the dorm but you can easily get away with it the guards at each station don't care, they rarely check your bags. Some of the night shift fall asleep on the job. They do have a few campus security cars that drive around the campus but they aren't really aware of any crime because its Aston"
College Sophomore,1,"the financial aid at this school, needs to be better! yes they give out Neumann grants, and awards, but that still doesn't help paying our tuition bill! at the end of every semester someone is stuck trying to pay over $2,000. also, the financial aid gives out parent plus loans, once your parent is denied, neumann is supposed to give you about $4,000. sometimes that doesnt even happen! this school financial aid needs to get better, or soon, there will be NO NEUMANN UNIVERSITY, because everyone done left, because the tuition is tooooo high!"
College Freshman,1,"They are stuffing 3 people to a room that is more like someone's bedroom size at home for 1 person. 
Bunkbeds are the worst possible idea especially when you have guys who are 6ft and over in a room. 
The guys we share a suite with are total pigs. Our common areas are always trashed and the bathrooms are disgusting. We should not be subjected to having to clean up after others and no one seems to do anything about it. The dorm monitors should make random checks on this and stay on top of cleanliness in the bathrooms and common areas. No way trash should be thrown in the common area and remain there for a week."
College Freshman,1,"food is horrible, and the people that work there are rude."
College Freshman,1,"Theres two shuttles, one that takes you back and forth from the annex and to campus & the other that takes you up and down the hill. Theres nothing that takes you around aston to places you need to go, or if your at a party and need a ride home. Something I wish Neumann had."
College Freshman,1,Theres nothing to do.. if you want to go to a party you need to know the right people and most sports teams are assholes.
College Freshman,1,THERE IS NO NIGHTLIFE AT NEUMANN UNIVERSITY. nightlife usually consist of me chillin in my room or with some of my friends in the hallway. there is nothing near campus to do and everybody goes home on the weekends.
College Freshman,1,"I NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. at neumann i am considered an ""arts production and performance major"" and honestly my school tries to cater to the things my major needs, like our radio station is pretty good, but they do a horrible job at letting the other students even know we have a student run radio station. My music production class was only a basic intro class and no other class after that. and the school seems to think arts production is not as important as a nurse or business, or education major."
College Sophomore,1,The past year we had many tornado watches and storms that caused power outages. Even though class was canceled there were activities planned for students so that they could still enjoy the campus.
College Sophomore,1,Middle of Nowhere – It's located in what seems to be a farm town with not much local transportation and things are far off with walking distance. There is a small mall close by but the bus is time consuming and expensive.
College Sophomore,1,There is little to no Greek life at Neumann University. I would guess its because i go to a Catholic private school. I would love to see more Greek life within my campus .
College Student,1,"Not Enough Spots! There aren't enough spots as it is for commuters, especially since there aren't assigned spots.  And it's THE WORST when spots get blocked off by campus security for people visiting the school I assume.  Be there about 15 minutes before class starts if it's an 8 am.  Otherwise, parking is a nightmare."
College Freshman,1,"Dry Campus – Because Neumann is a Catholic University, many of our policies hold a higher level of strictness. Students still manage to party and have a good time especially because it is a small school so everyone knows everyone. With that you are bound to hear about a party every weekend. Dorm life from what I have been told sucks because the security is strict with visitors and checking bags."
College Sophomore,1,"Security Is Tight – There is hardly any drug or alcohol activity or anything fun to do on campus because security is so tight. You have to swipe into every building and floor and get all your bags/containers checked when you enter the building. Also you have to sign in all guests and have them approved with age and ID VERIFICATION that it is them, you are not allowed to sign males in or have them in your room for over night visitation."
College Sophomore,1,The parking is ridiculous! There arent enough parking lots and instead of building more the campus is building a baseball field. Also they have a shuttle but its very unreliable and the shuttle to the annex is always late and very crowded.
College Sophomore,1,"The security guards consist of a bunch of retired old men, and few older women.....so pretty much if your doing something wrong, they wont even notice, let alone chase you."
College Sophomore,1,"Network Reliability and Speed – OMG!! The network is terrible! If the network actually isnt down or experiencing glitches, its slowwwwwwwww."
College Freshman,1,There's no enough room for all the students to park!!!!!
College Junior,1,"The dorms are state of the art. However, living in the dorms you feel like a criminal. They're extremely strict, and its a little unnecessary. For examples: Security must check your bag every single time you leave the building and re-enter. I think that is simply ridiculous. Signing in friends over night whether it be same sex or opposite sex is a fiasco in itself and I usually just tell my friends to not even bother coming up. They have to take the visitors I.D.'s, you have to pre-sign them if they're coming before 9pm, it's just ridiculous. No upper classmen stay on campus because you feel like you live in your parents house, but worse because my parents don't check my bags every time I enter and leave the house. I know I will be a senior next year and I am moving off campus. It's been a painful three years living on campus, but I finally said enough is enough. If they changed their rules, the dorms would be a nice place to live; however,until they do that they are not going to have a good ratings. You also have to swipe your ID card at the front door and to your hallway, yet, you can not get on anyone else's floor unless they prop the hallway door, because your ID card will not swipe in their hallway (even if you live in the same building). The dorms are extremely nice and the cost is just like the cost of housing anywhere else on a college campus; however, the rules here are unlike anything I've ever seen, and its sad."

Sophomore,5,"My online experience, at Voorhees College has been a very successful one. I can stay that, before Corona and after I've got my work completed. Before the incident, I only had 3 online courses. But after Corona, I had 6 total online classes. The professors at Voorhees did, well with communication as far as understanding the material. They also allowed, re submission of not only current assignments but also past assignments. The faulty and staff of Voorhees also allowed help, with issuing technology devices for students who didn't have them. Such as giving away laptops, and issuing grants and stimulus. Voorhees College has really out down themselves, they've really opened their arms to help the student body."
Sophomore,5,"I love Voorhees College, I school majority of my family members attended. A historically HBCU, the school is of the best of it's kind. I love the fact, that its not to big to get lost in. Having a family orienated environment, I love my school. Even the history, behind how Mrs. Wright overcamed opposition, to create the school in 1897. Now 123 year later, this woman was the first of color and woman to start a school. I also love the choir, singing with my choir members and director. I also love the small, peaceful, and powerful impact of the school. If they would ask me to comeback, and teach I would. I love my HBCU, Voorhees College where we Begin Believe and Become."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman at VoorheesCollege, about to go into my second semester. Majority of my family, has attended VoorheesCollege. It's a great school, one of the best in South Carolina. VoorheesCollege so far, has really been like another home for me. Everyone knows each other, and it's a religious school. Which that's a good thing, because my major is Theological Studies. I just love the annual Chapel services, that are held every Tuesday. Also singing on the great VoorheesCollege Gospel Choir is a joy in itself. After graduation, I plan to become a Pastor and start my own church. By the grace of God, many people will be touched and saved by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Voorhees has all the necessary tools, that will help me achieve this goal. God has already network me, with many people in the same field I'm achieving to do. It's a homey environment, a small but effective community. VoorheesCollege where we BeginBelieveBecome."
Freshman,5,"Voorhees is a small campus, however it gives you a opportunity to meet everyone and for everyone to get to know each other."
Freshman,5,"""I love my hbcu !"" is what you'll hear at most every pep-rally or all college assembly . This is the place to be if you're looking for a friendly , student engaging environment !

Junior,5,Voorhees College is a very Wonderful school that i would recommend plenty students to enroll in. The college is experience is so wonderful
Freshman,5,"First, my experience in college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft as a result of my time in school, which I am truly thankful for. I had always wanted to know more about psychology since I have found the human mind and how it works and develops very interesting.College is a lot different than high school.The first thing you’ll notice is the workload. In the long-term, I’m looking forward to continued learning. I feel like I have grown and learned a lot recently, but there’s so much I still want to learn and experience. I believe there is a connection between living and learning: if we fail to learn, we aren’t truly living. Therefore, I want to keep learning and challenging myself whenever possible."
Junior,5,"Voorhees is a 4 year college that is actually there to help. It is a small college that makes you feel at home. They are very friendly from the students to the faculty and staff. From education to professional to even personal they are willing to give a helping hand. The only thing I would change at Voorhees is the living. The dorms aren't the most up to date ones, but you can get comfortable!"
Freshman,5,"Voorhees College is a great learning environment, fill with high expectations and inviting atmosphere that makes it a good place to study. It has sufficient resources that can help the students achieve their goals and qualified teachers."

College Senior,5,Greek Life on Voorhees College campus is great. There is a lot of greek unity and love shown by the students. I am a member of Delta Sigma Theta and I enjoy every bit of my experience being greek. You meet so many people and lifetime sisters and friends.
College Freshman,5,Friends Are Reliable – You can always rely on your friends to take you around if you dont have a car.
College Sophomore,5,I truly love Voorhees College and the dorms are great. The other students may keep it horrible but the staff try their best to keep the students comfortable.
College Sophomore,5,"People at My School – the people at my school are very nice. they welcome you with open arms and they show u around the school if youre lost or something. we are from all over , even africa, which means we have different ways of dressing and we get to see a lot of different cultures and different ways of dressing. i like it alot"
College Junior,5,"Unique Things – The major difference is by it being a smaller school, interactions with professors and others is much easier. Also, you are still getting a great education as if you were at an Ivy League School. Employer are always at our school looking for people to hire that have some experience already in their field."
College Junior,5,"Professors and Classroom Ratio – The professor classroom ratio at Voorhees College is 1 to 10. There aren't that many students in each class which helps the students to better understand the professor, he or she can better break things down so that the students have a better understanding.
Being that Voorhees College is a private liberal arts college there aren't that many mojors to choose from, luckily they have mine. The registration process is quick and easy when using online techniques. Registering onlin results in printing out your schedule and going to class, it is quick simple and easy."
College Sophomore,5,"Voorhees has an bus that transports students to walmart evey Wendsday and to the malls on Saturdays. They will come and get you and drop you off at airports, bus stations and ect."
Sophomore,4,Voorhees is a small HBCU which I love the classrooms are smaller meaning each student have undivided attention with the professors. Overall it is a great school. Gooo!!  VOORHEES!
Senior,4,"I like the different ways you can get involved on campus and join programs to get accepted to based on your academic achievements. Our academic achievements never go unnoticed, following being accepted to the honors college, honor society, and student support services programs they’re very rewarding. Also some of the advisors are very helpful which is a great thing we all need as much help and guidance as we can get as student trying to fulfill a spot for our degrees."
Sophomore,4,Voorhees College has many opportunities just like any other school but you have to be willing to apply yourself. Throughout my year at Voorhees College I have learned a great deal of things. I highly recommend that you network and get to know people because you never know who you'll need help from.
Junior,4,"This school has accomodated me as much as they can to make sure that my last year of school is successful
I am in the adult education program and it is very comfortable to learn and understand."
Junior,4,"When I first got to Voorhees , it was not what I expected. I thought it was way more to the school . When you get there you’ll realize that your in a country area with very little variety. For the first couple of weeks , it was hard trying to get use to my new life really . After way I got the hang of things and started going out and doing activities. I started to meet new people although it wasn’t a very huge number of people, which makes it way easier to really get to know People. The classroom is a small number of students, but in my opinion I feel as though tvats a better way to learn and really connect with your professors. The professors actually take their time and get to know their students. After all I realize I love the school that I’m at , probably would’ve been a different story of I left to go to a bigger or so call better school ."
Freshman,4,Voorhees College is very family oriented.  The staff and students all are eager to help one another.  My freshman experience has been awesome.  Voorhees has taught me how to manage my time and my finances.  The small class is what I love.  You are able to get more personable with the professors.  Only thing I would love to see changed is the food in the cafeteria.  We need a more variety and less repetition.
Senior,4,Voorhees College is a very good for you as it is a college that focuses on you the individual student.  It is in a small town but it will help you focus more on your academics.  The staff here will help you out all you have to do is to communicate with them.
Sophomore,4,Voorhees College is a small college but is a great fit for students because of the one on one we receive with teachers. Our teachers have more of a connection with us because we aren’t in 50-60 student classrooms which allows for better teaching. Our campus is full of life and has a great family feel to it.
Alum,4,"One of the best decisions that I've ever made. Coming from Atlanta, ""VC"" was a new experience for me and the best thing for me. Voorhees was and is an institution that not only nurtured their students but also expected greatness from them. As a first generation college student, I was surrounded by a faculty that truly cared about my well being and pushed me  to be a better person. Coming from Atlanta and adjusting to SC was a struggle but it helped me to get involved in and off campus. I took advantage of EVERY opportunity that VC provided and when I graduated I was more than ready for graduate school and the work force. Lifelong friendships and solid foundation in academics and culture you will receive. There is nothing like ""the hees""."
College Senior,4,The campus police are always walking/riding around the campus and hall. If you have a problem they are always available to assist you.
College Senior,4,The admission staff is very helpful. They will go above and beyond to help you get the information need for enrollment.
College Senior,4,What makes my school unique is everyone tries their best to help each other out. The teachers are always available and willing to help you success.
College Sophomore,4,One thing i love about my campus is  no one judge each other on color religion or anything else. everybody accept each other as they are if there are anyone who judge its not noticeable or they don't show it around others
College Sophomore,4,Drugs are a big no no in our schools. They have a strict policy with drugs if your are caught using or selling drugs you are expelled from the school immediately
College Sophomore,4,I love all my professors because whenever i needed help they was there to help me out. when i wanted tutoring they would set an appointment so they will give undivided time to the student to make sure the student is getting the precept. the classroom are very spacious and easy environment to learn
College Sophomore,4,There's never a time on campus when we don't have security we have security any hours and they are willing to help with anything such as bullying assaults fights and problems with others. i feel very safe on campus there is a cop on duty every hour and every night and there always at the gate
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are always clean and we always have a security at any hours so no one has to feel unsafe living in the dorms. Wifi washing clothes and cable is very effective. there are times where the internet is slow but its nothing major. bathrooms are always neat and we have hot and cold water which is the best
College Sophomore,4,Greek life in our school is very great they set the environment right. They have the most school spirit and its easy for others to communicate with them. They have as much campus activities to keep students busy.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is unique because we all are like family. Its a nice community college and professors are willing to help you at any cause. I would attend my school again because i love the environment, experience, and the people that is there."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy some of the Greeks on campus
College Sophomore,4,Highest quality of teaching levels.
College Sophomore,4,The Greeks keep everything cool and fun. They talk to everyone even non Greek. The Greeks here wear the letters and don't let the letters wear them.
College Sophomore,4,My school is quiet and peaceful really gives you enough time to get your work done. The students here are friendly and with the school being small everyone know everyone.
College Freshman,4,what makes Voorhees unique is that there are all types of people and teachers willing to help you
College Freshman,4,They really try and help you  out
College Junior,4,"There is many computers, but more easy access is needed."
College Sophomore,4,"It seems to be a good idea. But the fact of paying your own bills when you are a full time student with no job is difficult. But, I see students make it work."
College Freshman,4,there are plenty of places to park on campus so thats a plus.
College Freshman,4,When they have parties there good if you get yourself in it if not its no fun
College Senior,4,"Overall voorhees has very good and challenging majors. The majors here has various programs and activities that you can join. They give you many opportunities like study aborad, jobs and internships. However they can have more to offer within certain majors."
College Senior,4,"The biology department at Voorhees College has been a blessing to me. I love science and I enjoy learning about various subjects with in the biology field. The chair of this department , also known as Dr. Doris Ward has given me opportunities that I may have never gotten. She has help me get internships to New Mexico State Univeristy for two summers doing various research. She gives out stipends for students that maintain 3.0 gpa and higher. She allows us to go to other school and present research that we have done. This fields requires a lot of work and determination. Some of the curriculms are: General Chemistry 1 and 2, Ogranic Chemistry 1 and 2, Physics 1 and 2, Genetics, Zoology, Botany, Microbiology, Cell Biology, Epidemology, and Ecology."
College Senior,4,"Voorhees has several fields of studies. Voorhees offers a Bachelors of science in Biology, Childhood Education, Criminal Justice, Psychology, Business Adminstration, and Accounting. The biology field is very challenging and constructive. My professor Dr.Ward is a wonderful teacher who pushing me and makes me think critically. This year I have three classes because I took a work load my freshman and sophmore year, but I still have plenty work. The classes I'm registered in are, cell biology, epidemology and senior seminar, which I love very much. Voorhees Science department could be much better if we had more lab eqiupment."
College Senior,4,"Voorhees College is a very small campus with not more than 1000 student. Sercuity stands at the gate entrance where students live and monitor the campus at least 15hours a day. Dorm directors are located in all dorms, but sometimes they are not present in the mornings. Cameras are located on various places on campus but they do not cover the entire campus. The school does host saftey seminars, but not very often.The Campus sercuity on Voorhees College can be more effective and strict."
College Sophomore,4,Lab Is Almost Never Crowded – The computer lab have plenty of computers so there is always an unused computer. The only time the lab seems to be crowded is when  projects are due. The lab can also be a little crowded when powerpoints and presentation outlines need to be typed and printed. There is no limit on printing in the labs nor in the library on the second floor.
College Freshman,4,"Social Life – very respectful, social, Nice, Helpful, encourageing"
College Junior,4,"Pizza, french fries, hot dogs, salad, shrimp, rice, beans, sandwich meat, and mash pototoes"
College Sophomore,4,"Programs at School – well im in a program on campus and its a wonderful program they help you with anything you need help with like getting your grades up, scholarship and also personal problems as well. Its a great thing and something I will do at the next school I go to."
College Sophomore,4,The Library at this school is like the best place on campus the people are very helpful and at the same time caring.
College Junior,4,"It's Raining – Rain is the only weather that affects campus experience, walking to class in the rain is no fun."
College Junior,4,"Denmark and It's Dining – There aren't that many places to eat in Denmark, S.C. it is a small community with only Bamberg, Barnell, and Orangeburg surrounding it. Students may transfer to another school simply because of the food. I feed off of my education and that is what Voorhees College feeds me, it is not the outside food that attracts me."
College Senior,2,The dorms is really old. Yoy have to share room
College Freshman,2,"Most times campus at night is just awfully quiet and the party scene is not good at all

There is no good club around or close to campus and no form of transportation except personal means"
College Freshman,2,The party scene is not much and there is little positive impact on student experience. Quality of parties are poor
College Freshman,2,Athletics Generally is not so good including facilities except the gym and there are not a variety of facilities. Team performance is not very good and fan support and school spirit is not impressive
College Freshman,2,I feel safer with a group of people on campus
College Freshman,2,"Class size is just Ok, that's including the class style.  There are not variety of courses offered.  The quality of course is just on an average level and the professors do their best."
College Freshman,2,there are no places to work
College Senior,2,they need to improve on thefood seriuosly
College Freshman,2,It's very little to choose from.
College Freshman,2,My school needs help in all of those areas.
College Junior,2,"Food isn't the best, it can be better. It serves its purpose."
College Junior,2,"There''s only a few restaurants in the area, anything better is 10-30 min. away."
College Freshman,2,Because their are no activities  in the town to do.
College Sophomore,2,There are no choices for dinning you go the cage that Is it
College Freshman,2,"My school Voorhees College has excellent coaching and support our facilities are just out of date. We need to work on bringing more sports related professional in such as: athletic trainers, assistance coaches, and athletic advisers. This past year our boys won our conference and we hope that it brings more attention to the schools athletic department and future students."
College Freshman,2,The restaurants is near the school. We have fast food places. You don't have a student discount no where . The food is very cheap
College Senior,2,The area is small and not alot of local businesses.
College Freshman,2,"there is no diversity, there are only 2 white students and 1 lationo student at voorhees. the majority is african american. the reason for this grade is because i would like to see some diversity on cmpus to experience different cultures and people."
College Freshman,2,"There are all different types of males and females on this campus. Some know how to dress and some just dont care and wear anything. The females like to just jump into a relationship, instead of taking it slow to see if they maybe the one. The males are the same, they think passing girls around are appropiate."
College Junior,2,The Facilities at  Voorhees College is a C because the school is very old and nothing hasn't been reconstructed everything has been the same and it's a lot of problems with the buildings that need to be fixed.
Niche User,1,"One of the worst schools in america, Would not recommend .. children are forced to only have a microwave in their dorm rooms and can only eat microwaveable food, Most of the foods that are cooked at the cafeteria aren't cooked properly and The school's bathroom facilities are disgusting, I'm never the type of person to write bad reviews but something has to be done about this.."
College Freshman,1,Students get high even on campus and smoke on campus too
College Freshman,1,Basically it's boring and rural. There's actually nothing to do except go for classes and stay in your room all day. It's too small and no student life at all.
College Freshman,1,We get treat like criminals
College Freshman,1,"I thought my financial aid was going to cover up my entire balance while attending Voorhees College but unfortunately it didn't. I owe the school 1,147 for just staying on campus alone that I cannot afford. My tips for the school is for them to find a better way to help students get more work study. Also to have accurate information about our money so we can know when its coming and going out."
College Freshman,1,The teachers are very unorganized you have to constantly stay on them to get the job done. Some teachers cancel their classes regularly and assign large assignments to do when you barely have learn anything from them.  The cleaning is horrible I stay on campus and hate to use the bathroom sometimes because the girls don't clean as good as they do. The girls often in the past have taken  tissue and paper towels out the bathroom leaving the janitors to make a decision to stop supplying them at all. You have to make sure you have your own cleaning supplies at this school if you want things clean the proper way.
College Freshman,1,Their is nothing appealing about the town of denmark south carolina
College Sophomore,1,There are some put not enough for the number of students that are there
College Freshman,1,It rains alots one day and hot the other day. You never know what to wear
College Freshman,1,the weather is very bipolar it changes at the blink of an eye. one day its extremely hot to very cold or foggy or theres non stop showers.
College Freshman,1,"Public transportation is not as good as it could be. We only go to wal-mart on wed's and we should be able to attend mall and many other places. If our tution is high , they can afford better things."
College Junior,1,The thing is there are no off dining off campus we don't even have campus restaurants or stores like other colleges.
College Junior,1,"Houses are in bad shape, Students stay in other towns, The locals try to rob or lynch"
College Freshman,1,"the athletics at voorhees is below average. its below average not due to the students but the facility. the weight room is very old and out dated, our track is worn out beyond belief, and unfit for any home track and feild meets. i beieve that if adequate finances were invested into our facility and equipment that voorhees could do far better in athletics than they are currently doing."
College Freshman,1,The dining and food options on campus are very limited. the meal plan isnt worth the amount of money that students spend because the menu is repetitive and its quality is poor. in comparison to other institutions voorhees has definitely fumbled the ball on dining and food options.Voorhees i expect more bang for my buck.
College Junior,1,The financial aid process was irritating. The workers are slow and take forever to process your information. If someone were to go in the office at nine in the morning they wouldn't be cleared until three or four o'clock in ht afternoon. I suggest always to go in-person to the financial aid office and do it early so you can try to get in and out quicker.
College Freshman,1,Dining Halls – They can do a lot better. They serve the same thing every day for breakfast and lunch and dinner is hardly ever that good. And if you get tired of eating in the dining halls there is nothing you can do unless you have a car because there are no restaurants on campus and you can't even walk off campus to the McDonald's thats a good minute away walking because you might get robbed.
College Freshman,1,"Comments About How Safe I Feel on Campus – Campus security never seems to do their job well. Any and everybody can just walk on our campus and I never feel safe leaving out of my dorm because you will never know what happens. I don't even feel that safe in the dorms because boys from other dorms can climb in the windows in the hallway and mess up the hall with bleach, dish detergent, ammonia and all kinds of crazy stuff and pull the fire alarm and get out of the building way before security gets here. And then we wind up standing outside for about an hour because security takes their time to do everything. If it was a real fire the buildings would all burn down by time security even left their office."
College Junior,1,Campus Is Strict but Not THAT Strict – too many things happen where people get away with it or they keep it hush hush when it should be criminal investigations. BUT they do try sometimes to enforce the rules and policies.
College Sophomore,1,"Weight Room Poor – The weight room at Voorhees College are poor. The only things that is safe to use is the branches, dip bar, and dump bells.
Everything else is broken including cruel, and straight bar. The newest thing in our weight room is the paint on the walls and rubber floors."

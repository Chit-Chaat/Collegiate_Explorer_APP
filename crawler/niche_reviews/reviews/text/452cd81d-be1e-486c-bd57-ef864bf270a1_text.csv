Sophomore,5,My overall experience so far has been very positive.  All the professors have been very helpful getting use to the use of BrightSpace.
Sophomore,5,I am enjoying the process so far.  Using Zoom has made it easier to see what the professors are talking about at the time.  I did do another online school but all I got was audio this is so much better.
Sophomore,5,I am a non-traditional student taking online classes after a thirty some odd year hiatus and everyone at UMA has been very helpful.
Sophomore,5,All of my classes have been online. The professors have always made themselves available to me through email or Zoom meetings. They are always willing to answer any question I may have.
Freshman,5,Professors were very accomodating and quick to reply when I had questions about assignments or had things come up in my life that prompted later due dates.
Niche User,5,The online Computer Infomation Systems program is excellent! Everything is online and it is accredited. The faculty are very knowledgeable and approachable. The certificate programs are particularly excellent.
Sophomore,5,It’s an amazing school. I have learned so much. I truly have. I would only suggest offering a broader variety of classes/majors.
Sophomore,5,It’s great! I learn just as much online as I do in person. Teachers really implement amazing strategies and styles of learning online as well.
Graduate Student,5,"This is my first time studying in United States. I had great experience with this university. Every teacher is very helpful and understanding. I have two active kids. Studying with them was kind of impossible for me. Teachers in this university are very supporting, understanding and motivating. I am doing all my degree online. I never faced any kind of problem."
Sophomore,5,I have had the best experience at UMA! All of the staff are very helpful and educated in what they are teaching the students. All of the information is presented to fit the needs of all students. The schedule fits the needs of every student. Students like me are lucky to have such a suitable and reliable education available to them.
Senior,5,"I loved how involved with the community UMA is. Between every program they offer they seem to have some sort of connection with the community being major specific. The architecture students are building park benches, the culinary students are providing for the soup kitchen along with the gardening club. I love how wholesome everyone is in this fairly small town of Augusta. They really make you feel at home there and its an exceptionally pretty campus."
Sophomore,5,I am at one of the UMA centers and I love it. All of the staff and professors are very friendly and knowledgeable in their subjects.
Senior,5,"Getting my degree through UMA was awesome because the college specializes in distance degrees, which worked perfectly for my life when I was trying to get my degree. The faculty is also really supportive and accessible. I was on a first name basis with most of the teachers in my major's department."
Junior,5,"UMA has given the experience of a college student with the ability to live at home.  It has affordable classes, wonderful staff, and amazing teachers. Had I not taken a biology course through UMA, I wouldn't have found my calling in Biology."
Freshman,5,"I am at one of the remote locations for the UMA campus.  The town in which this is in is a small one in comparison but still provides excellent support to the students.  Since the particular location is small, the staff and professors at the location are extremely helpful and everyone knows everyone by name.  

Even as a number of the classes are video conference or delayed viewing, those including the classes that are on site are thorough and helpful.  The professors definitely appear to love what they are doing and even help their prior students.
Given the cost of the tuition and the level of education received, the university is very cheap to attend and being able to keep loans or out of pocket expenses at a minimum. 
The staff and professors are extremely helpful and willing to work with their students to succeed.  I cannot praise the staff and professors enough for the remote location."
Sophomore,5,It's convenient to have a college close to home so that I can stay near my loved ones while I create a future for myself.
Sophomore,5,"I am an online student and I love the flexibility of being able to go to class as my day allows me. I have had excellent instructors and the level of knowledge that they are teaching us is outstanding. Would not transfer or drop out until I graduate in 2020, an awesome school!"
Senior,5,I have enjoyed being a part of the U.M.A. system.  I have found the courses valuable in my Library position. The professors have been very helpful. The online courses have been very helpful and convenient for me. I would highly recommend this university.
Sophomore,5,"When you start your journey through college, you need a direct path toward your degree. The faculty and staff will be there for you. You have a very tight support system that will get you through the rough times. Define your degree and be the best student that you can be. Do not settle for mediocrity!"
Sophomore,5,I love being a student at UMA st the Bangor campus. We could use a student building that we could buy reall food not from a vending machine. Where there are pool tables and places for students could gather for fun and not bother other students that want to study or classes being held.
Freshman,5,"The University of Maine provides excellent academic support and advising for online students and charges a low online rate for out-of-state students. My experience here has been entirely positive. The professors are helpful, respond quickly to queries, and are supportive of the learning process. The Virtual Access Writing Lab Team (VAWLT) is extremely helpful for proof-reading papers."
Senior,5,The school is great and the basketball coach and program have treated well. Would like to come back and finish my last year of school at UMA and graduate. Could use extra scholarship money to return to school at UMA and finish.
Sophomore,5,This experience could not have been easier!  They transferred most of my past credits and had me well on my way to my degree. The sign up process was facilitated by MEOC and my application fees were waived!  What a great support system.
Sophomore,5,"I love it! I attend the Bangor campus and the students and faculty are great. I love how small the classes are and how involved in the community we, as students, are. There are tons of support systems and you have a bunch of choices on where, when, and how you take your class. Also, there are people of all walks of life, so it keeps it interesting."
Junior,5,"What a beautiful experience this has been for me! Wonder staff, quality education, a real mind expansion. I was very intimidated by the whole college process, but the faculty and staff at UMA has made it so easy!"
College Junior,5,"As a distance education student, I have had exceptional courses and professors / instructors and highly recommend the school to others."
College Junior,5,We have had several business cone in to give speachless and always say they love getting students from our school we come out well trained
College Junior,5,"A review of this review:  Why did you ask about the physical attributes of the Women on campus, but not the Men?  Either is silly and as a women I find it insulting, but if it's important for some reason; than seems to me it should be asked about both Genders...  :/"
College Freshman,5,I am looking at switching to Biology or Nursing. The curriculum isn't too bad. The registration isn't to challenging.
College Freshman,5,It was easy enough to get accepted considering my academic record isn't the best. I cried when I found out though.
College Freshman,5,"I haven't participated in any, but I am hoping to after my ankle has healed enough from the reconstruction."
College Freshman,5,The teachers are more then willing to help students when asked. The school has a tutoring center for those know need a little more help. If you miss a class teachers will work with you to get taught back up
College Junior,5,I love the program because of the course content and the professors. They want you to succeed
College Junior,5,I was accepted to the campus late and the financial aid process was very smooth and quick
College Junior,5,I have had a positive experience with all administration
College Junior,5,"I am in the BS program Behavioral Health and this is my first semester. I am very happy with my courses, Professors and all the administrative staff on campus. I made a very good decision to continue my academics at UMA"
College Senior,5,Really easy to get into
College Student,5,"If anyone does drink or do drugs, you definitely do not notice it."
College Freshman,5,"My financial aid process was smooth. It didn't take me long at all. My high school helped with any questions I had. There are no tips. IF you take the time to do it, it is worth it in the long hall. "
College Freshman,5,"At my college there are no parties going on, no one going to bar scenes. I have never been to any sporting events and I drive my car for transportation to the college. "
Freshman,4,I like how classes don't cost an arm and a leg like they do at other University of Maine schools that offer the same programs. The teachers for my online classes were always very good at getting back to me about assignments.
Niche User,4,I took all of my classes online using the Blackboard platform. All of the courses were easy to access and communication with the professors was seamless.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UMA has been fairly good! They make distance learning as seamless as can be, with many different locations all around Maine."
Sophomore,4,"Good communication with staff.  Online classes and other ways to take classes other than sitting in a classroom make it simple.  Area is close to everything you may need and very safe.  I wish there were more intramural options for students or other activities offered for health improvement.  So far everyone had been very helpful, just beginning school here.   It's a small school so individual help should be available.  Im not staying on campus but taking online courses so no real experience on the campus life in that aspect.  Classes begin for me in two weeks, so far everything has been fairly easy.  Campus was a but confusing but after visiting and walking it, figured it out quickly as it's small."
Sophomore,4,University of Maine at Augusta is a good choice for those who wish to stay close to home and get an affordable education. The campus is small in size which makes it easier to get around. The professors seem to really care about helping their students as well.
Sophomore,4,I have had nothing but good experiences with this university as a college student. I was even able to visit the Holocaust Museum on campus during my senior year in high. I was taking a K-12 class online and need to interview someone and discuss the Holocaust. They were extremely helpful with this.
Junior,4,I have been going here for the last two years and I don't have anything bad to say! The teachers have all left me feeling like i have actually learned a lot and have helped me entirely along the way!
Freshman,4,So far a easy to get help I am a new student graduated high school 30 YRS ago so completely new experience for me great support staff is excellent to deal with
Senior,4,"I believe the college cares about their students. For example, whenever I needed anything I could go there and ask any question I needed to. They also have reasonable book prices and always has something going on on any given day for students to do."
Junior,4,"I like the feel of the campus and it’s diversity along with the very helpful staff. The Trio staff is generous with their time and advice. The campus is well organized and together, not too far apart."
Freshman,4,"University of Maine at Augusta has a 100% acceptance rate, guaranteeing your probability of getting in. University of Maine at Augusta welcomes all Veterans of any branch of the military."
Senior,4,"The University of Maine at Augusta is a good school. I will admit, before I attended I was hesitant. Truthfully because of its location. Depending on where you come from you may need to travel though a part of town that is not maintained very well. However, the facility and staff have been more than helpful. They offer a wide variety of degrees and completely understand the ""working mom/dad"" work schedule. They give more than ample time to finish assignments and while they're strict because they need to ensure you're understanding the material, they're also very reasonable. UMA is a great school overall. I would highly recommend it."
Junior,4,The University of Maine at Augusta has been great! I love the flexible class schedule. I am able to take a full course load and still work at the same time. Most of the professors have been very flexible and understanding when things comes up. My only frustration has been that I am not able to get any credit towards classes from job experience as I am working in the field I am pursuing (Elementary Education).
Senior,4,"UMA Bangor location has a lot of great staff. The one downfall, this occurred recently, is the lack of a financial aid office on campus! And the lack of a dining area... Otherwise, great staff, great learning environment, and great location! There are a lot of resources, the library has a lot to offer and there is cheap printing funds!"
College Sophomore,4,"It is a great small campus, on the days that you have class you recognize and get no know everyone by name and class. There isn't as much of people compared to a regular college that does not  commute. Professors are nice and I can talk to them if I need help."
College Sophomore,4,I've had the best professors here.
College Junior,4,"They are great, will take extra time out to help you. Go above and beyond."
College Junior,4,Never heard of it happenin but I know there are lots of preventing measures and great help if it dose happen
College Junior,4,I would like to see them NOT push their political beliefs on the students!
College Junior,4,I like the One on One attention.
College Junior,4,"Its all there is, unless you use vending machines."
College Sophomore,4,"Again, I did not require this service, but others told me it was great."
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of places of just about every type and cuisine available in the area.
College Sophomore,4,"Very polite and helpful administration, I have never run into any problems with the rules thus far."
College Sophomore,4,"Very helpful financial aid office, I got all the assistance I needed with ease."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not much of a party goer, so I don't have much to say here."
College Sophomore,4,"There are always lots of food options available, and everything I have tried so far is good."
College Junior,4,I am not on campus but notices get sent email a lot regarding safety on campus
College Sophomore,4,I love all the fast food options but there is also many sit down restaurants to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,From what I hear it's great but I have never eaten on campus except what I bring from home.
College Sophomore,4,Everything about the computers on campus are great except the speed wish it could be a little faster.
College Sophomore,4,The Process started smoothly but at the end there were some questions that when I answered made me get no financial aid.
College Senior,4,I shouldn't have a problem getting a job once I have my degree
College Junior,4,There are a lot of things to do in Bangor--the downtown area has many eclectic shops and restaurants. 
College Junior,4,we have a lot of green space on campus. Last year we had our first community garden. The produce was donated to the homeless shelters and food pantries in the Bangor area
College Junior,4,"The IT department is very helpful. The computer lab is always accessible, and there are many PCs in the library for student use as well"
College Junior,4,"I am comfortable with a strict policy. If you follow the rules, there's nothing to worry about"
College Junior,4,"Our campus is small, and it is an open campus, with a methadone clinic and a homeless shelter sharing the property. We have had thefts because students are too stupid to lock their cars or put a lock on the locker at the gym. we did have a student's tires slashed this semester also, but it was an isolated incident."
College Sophomore,4,Sometimes can be tight but everyone seems to find a spot.
College Junior,4,"Talk to Marty Kelley--alot if you have to. She works at the Orono campus, but is very helpful and holds financial aid work shops frequently. She found errors on my FAFSA, and therefore found more aid for me."
College Sophomore,4,I am going for my associates in Business Management and was happy to see all the classes i was looking for were available. I plan to continue onto a masters in this major if I can receive enough money to move forward. I believe there are plenty of jobs that need a good manager out there and that taking these classes will help me move into that position.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many options for getting your course requirements met, with classes that have a larger workload to ones that don't require all that much. There's literally a class for anyone here, the problem is getting into the ones you want in time before they get filled."
College Sophomore,4,"I love all my professors and courses so far, although there was a bit of an issue with one of them using a glitchy program so grades got messed up. I love being in my program and I hope that the classes keep getting better."
College Freshman,4,"classes are intense and demanding. lots of works, long hours and dedication!"
College Junior,4,I feel that campus strictness is average compared to other places
College Junior,4,I am very happy with the mental health program at UMA
College Junior,4,"As a mental health major, I really enjoy that UMA has so many different classes to fill required courses"
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of malls in Augusta, theaters, book stores, usually something going on."
College Freshman,4,I've lived near this town for my whole life so I guess I don't mind it. Maine's weather seems to be bi-polar. I'm sure that Augusta can't change the weather.
College Junior,4,They make it easy for even non traditional older adults not familiar with computers and stuff feel comfortable in class and outside of class
College Junior,4,I love the selection of food..i believe that prices are fair...and its easy to be a vegetarian and still even be able to eat...even from the vending machines
College Student,4,Public Transport – Public transportation goes right through the s hool campus along with taxis nearby.
College Student,4,Fastfood Galore – If you want a burger and fries its within walking distance!
College Freshman,4,Nothing Wrong With Them – Comp lab is usually almost empty so there is no problem with them
College Senior,4,"Not at This College, Zero Tolerance. I have never witnessed the use of drug/alcohol on or near campus. People do smoke cigarettes but it must be off campus grounds."
College Senior,4,UMA Safety Is Visably Obvious. Very safe. Regularly see campus sucurity vehicles on campus. Escort is available during evening classes if not feeling comfortable walking alone to one's car. Strict policies about harrasment of any students by others. Staff always available if problems about safety an issue.
College Senior,4,"Housing Serenity While Attending College. I own my own mobile home which is located approximately five miles from campus, I am very, very fortunate and grateful for my living arrangements. Because I have worked very hard I have now paid off my home which allowed me to attend college. I will be the first to earn a bacholors degree in my family of nine children. My parents are very catholic and were poor but gave me good values in life. I have raised three wonderful children and my dream is to find a career in the Mental Health field."
College Freshman,4,"This university has a very diverse student population.  It is basically a commuter college with no on campus domoritories so there is a very diverse student population in race, age  and other 
groups."
College Freshman,4,"Staff Flexable to Help – It is very hard to give a proper review where I take classes away from the school where I live a distance away. But when talking with the tech people, enrollment services etc over the phone they are always polite and professional."
College Sophomore,4,"Only 15 minutes away from Augusta you have Belgrade, which has a cute charming village and it is the outdoors-man's paradise.  There is lakes for fishing, swimming, boating and snowmobiling on in the winter. Nice area with very nice people."
Recent Alumnus,2,"You get your money's worth. It's a cheap school but it has many drawbacks. Personally, I think that the university's performance is declining every year because it seems like many staff members do not care about the student body. The professors are great and really help the students succeed but the admissions, financial aid, and enrollment offices are downright terrible. 

Make sure you mail every form via certified mail or else it will get lost and the staff in administrative offices will blame it on you. If you have a question or need assistance with something, expect to be tossed around from office to office because it's unclear who knows what. If you e-mail someone, use short sentences because you will otherwise get a response that clearly shows the reader does not understand what you mean."
College Freshman,2,some staff were very rude and not helpful
College Freshman,2,More communication within the financial aid office
College Sophomore,2,"Everytime I apply for financial aid, the school brings something to the table that sets it back longer. For instance, I sent in my fafsa and everything and they put a immunization hold to stop it, I filled that out and they now, just now planted another hold, after telling me i only needed to complete the first hold. They make it stressful and difficult to continue with one's education and living"
College Sophomore,2,I don't really like fraternities nor am I in one nor I care for them.
College Sophomore,2,Well in the winter it's cold and it is hard to get to school sometimes but I manage.
College Senior,2,"The minority rate at UMA isn't strong. I am one of the few African Americans who attend University of Maine at Augusta. I feel as though however this is improving with time. 
Sexual orientation is also evolving through time at UMA. People are beginning to feel more comfortable with being open about their sexuality. I am also one of the many lesbian minorities who attend UMA."
College Freshman,2,"Cold, snowy winter, beautiful fall, muddy and cold spring."
College Sophomore,2,"I am just beginning the scholarship process, but I understand that the financial aid office will provide resources for scholarships. The Financial Aid Office is very helpful with FAFSA too."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't actual dining but the school contracts for food to be brought in a couple of times a week. Occasionally free food is offered during events. There are plenty of fast food restaurants within a mile of campus.
College Sophomore,2,"i live in Maine, so during the winter the weather can get nasty.  Usually if a big snow storm comes, the school will close down.  There are a lot of students who commute from several hours away so mostly it is for the safety of the students."
College Freshman,2,Workload for Online Courses – Some professors require an extensive amount of work that is added to the online class.  A summer online class required two books and over a 1000 pages in articles with extended papers and tests.
College Junior,2,"I would give UMA a C when it comes to grading students overall feeling towards diversity on campus. A lot of minorities stick together, and students of different social classes also do the same. It is a lot like high-school versus college, and I think that occurs because of the fact that the school is strictly commuter."
Alum,1,Small and hard to get stuff done at.  Emails never answered.  Lots of hokey useless GEN EDU requirements.   I transferred away for better opportunities elsewhere.
College Student,1,We don't have greek life.
College Junior,1,We do not have a dining hall on campus.
College Freshman,1,"I basically received nothing at this school than I had at my previous one. From my previous school I got three scholarships, but I got none at this one. I was only offered one loan."
College Sophomore,1,"Not What I Expected – I selected the University of Maine at Augusta because I was lead to believe that ALL of the classes that I needed for my major are available online; they are not.  I work full time and I am a single mother, so that's the only way I can further my education.  There are other schools that do offer these types of programs and their curriculum is more diverse; I would've chosen one of them, even though they are a little more expensive, if I had known. 
Some of the instructors are great, some are all but absent and some are Nazis.  I actually had an instructor over the summer that scolded the entire class every single week on Blackboard for one reason or another.  
Many times I have called admissions to get attitude or incorrect information from the people who work there.
Not impressed."
College Senior,1,"Obviously on a Budget – On the Bangor campus of the University of Maine at Augusta, there's a small, sad workout room and a basketball court, but they have a semi-decent library. The campus in a little spread out, but is bland in terms of gardening and architecture."
College Sophomore,1,"Can Not Wait to Leave. Finally I am transferring next semester, my only regret is why didn't I do it sooner. I'm sick of UMA and I just want to get up to UMO as fast as I can. I want a traditional college experience!"
College Sophomore,1,No Spirit – At the University of Maine at Augusta I feel there is no school spirit. The reason for this is because people do not go there for anything besides an education. This school is very non-traditional.
College Junior,1,"Okay, so the people who work at the Financial Aid office are awesome! They are very very nice people, but they have to follow ridiculous rules. I feel that the financial aid system is in need of a complete overhaul. I gave the school a D+ because the staff feel the same way the students do but do not try and institute change. Instead while you are trying to work through a problem the staff complain with you. That is frustrating."
College Junior,1,"Not Insane Like UMAINE – I would give UMA a D with the drug and alcohol visibility, which is a good thing. When I went to UMAINE Orono the average underage student had close to unlimited access to alcohol. Since UMA is a commuter school, there is little underage contact with alcohol."

Graduate Student,5,"Online classes were amazing for me, especially with working full time as well. I highly recommend any person with a busy schedule to pursue online classes."
Sophomore,5,Online experiences can be difficult for some but I think SLCC has a very organized system and a lot of resources if there are issues! Definitely recommend!
Sophomore,5,I have absolutely loved SLCC and my education here. I am in my first semester of nursing school and I have full trust that I will be more prepared to start my nursing career with this program! All of the professors are very helpful and awesome!
Freshman,5,"Its been amazing at SLCC for the last few months, super flexible and great professors, definitely a great affordable place to start tertiary education, wouldn't want to be anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,"Super affordable, professors are kind and understanding, when youre online it usually means you work full time or are occupied most of the school day. They allow you to be able to provide for yourself and take care of your family whilst pursuing an education."
Freshman,5,"Even though online classes are difficult, the professors are so helpful and considerate. The school has taken many precautions to help protect you against the coronavirus."
Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing! They are always willing to help and will spend time outside of class helping you with any of the material you may not understand! 

My advisor contacts me weekly to see if I need anything!"
Freshman,5,"So far I am loving my college experience here at SLCC. This is my very first semester in college and it is very different, with Covid-19 changes happening. All of my classes are online, which is kind of a bummer but Salt Lake Community College is making is very easy to communicate and learn efficiently. With the use of Zoom and WebEx online meetings, I am able to learn more than reading articles all day. I love Salt Lake Community College and I am excited to spend the next 2 years here!"
Sophomore,5,The teachers were so understanding especially for the fact that the world went topsy-turvy what with COVID-19
Freshman,5,"I like the precautions they are taking as a school. They have this online coaching help for students. On my second day of school they called me asking how my first day of school was, and she answered all of the questions I had. And also sent me an email with all the answers to my questions again. I love this school. They are helping me in more ways than they know."
Freshman,5,"It has been very different, but I think that is why I have enjoyed it so much. All of the professors seem like they have been doing this forever. I haven't had any complications."
Sophomore,5,"The online experience has been good, given the circumstances. Definitely use RateMyProfessor to check who you're taking a class with, though, because some teachers really don't transition well to online classes."
Sophomore,5,SLCC has been a great place for me to get my associate's degree. Almost every professor I've had has been excellent! The South City and Library Square campuses are pretty nice considering the location.
Sophomore,5,I loved my online learning experience with this school. It was a really good transition during Corona Virus.
Sophomore,5,Salt Lake Community College is a great school! All the professors take the time to know each individual student and their name.
Niche User,5,The advisors are always willing to help and are always understanding especially when I have a lot on my plate. They help ease the burden.
Niche User,5,I liked everything about the school I only attended online classes for all my courses. The website had no issues and the teachers were very helpful and patient with me.
Niche User,5,I took all my classes online and the teachers were all great. The courses were easy to access. The students life program was excellent and easy to enroll in.
Sophomore,5,"I had online classes only because campus shut down as a result of COVID. Online was a fairly smooth transition, any issues that came about was on my end and the professors did their best to work with me. I do prefer in-person lectures but if our safety is at risk, online did the job. There is nothing to really rave about, it works for some people and it does not for others."
Sophomore,5,"The teachers are easy to communicate with and the courses are very specialized and easy to follow, so long as you do the work."
Junior,5,I've taken about half of my classes online and have had positive experiences each time.  The online platform is pretty intuitive and I love the calendar feature that has all of the assignment due dates.
Junior,5,The school was affordable and the classes and teachers are excellent!  I truly believe that this school is one of the best budget options for people out there.
Freshman,5,I took two semesters online at Salt Lake Community College and it was great! The professors are very understanding and are willing to help at any time. It was a great experience.
Freshman,5,Salt Lake Community College is a great stepping stone to move to a university. I had amazing professors that were always willing to help and answer questions. There were always scholarship and opportunities to work on campus. My favorite part was how cheap the text books were the professors chose. It really showed how much they cared for their students.
Junior,5,I have taken hybrid classes and lots of professors use canvas. A lot of the professors are organized and are open to any questions you have! They are very funny and supportive.
Junior,5,I love that slcc has smaller classroom sizes. I have met some of the coolest students and professors. The professors are very inspiring and share many stories and knowledge that they have. They are very caring and interpersonal. I have loved all my classes!
Freshman,5,My professors really cared for my well being and really pushed me to be the best student I could be. They taught so we could use the material in our everyday lives.
Freshman,5,"SLCC was an amazing school and a great way to ease back into school. The professors were amazing, campus was always clean, and everyone was so professional when transferring to online. I was very pleased with my experience there."
Freshman,5,Never took an online class. I’ve only heard good things though so I’m not opposed to ever enrolling in one.
Freshman,5,I took a concurrent course here that is going to transfer to my next college! I’m so excited that I got a head start on my college career through SLCC!!
Freshman,5,I took my classes online when they switched to online learning due to the covid-19 pandemic. The change was rough but the teachers and the schools offered a lot of support and help. The online learning system they used called Canvas is very user friendly.
Freshman,5,I like going to this college because they have multiple campuses so it's easy to access and really close by. They offer tons of degrees and programs. They also will help me get into the four year university that I want to attend. I love going to this school.
Junior,5,I have completed my last 3 semesters online and I have loved it. My professors keep the content organized and they are easy to reach as well. I like that I'm able to do my homework when I have time.
Junior,5,"Online courses that are organized, professors that love what they do, great resources, affordable tuition."
Sophomore,5,I have really loved my time here at Salt Lake Community College.  I have studied here to earn my associated degree.  The tuition is very affordable and the campus is up to date and well kept.  Class sizes are very good and the learning environment is great!
Sophomore,5,"It has been my experience that Salt Lake Community College is a high quality establishment that beckons to anyone seeking to further their education. Whether looking for single classes for elders to pass the time or start a new hobby, or if aiming to get an associates degree, Salt Lake Community College is an affordable college with amazing Instructors. The instructors make your education worth the money you pay to attend their classes. I would recommend Salt Lake Community College to anyone. Once a Bruin, always a Bruin."
Freshman,5,"I really like SLCC because I feel like I'm getting a good education with fewer spending on tuition. I am thankful I get to do half of my Bachelor's degree here with fewer the costs than I would than just going to the U straight on. I love how nice everyone is and the professors are willing to help you. I feel like there is a good mix of diversity and I think that if you focus on your academics, you will thrive here and not worry about what you're missing out on a University."
Freshman,5,"At Salt Lake Community College they provide an extraordinary opportunity to receive a degree, without paying a ton of money. They provide the same educational opportunities as other colleges but at a quarter of the cost."
Freshman,5,"Salt Lake Community College is such a welcoming environment, they make me feel as if I have known everyone that I come across. It is a very positive and motivational environment."
Graduate Student,5,SLCC has been a great experience for me. It is affordable and easily accessible. I have never had a bad experience with going to school here. I would prefer to take classes from SLCC rather than at a university. I have always liked it.
Freshman,5,"I love SLCC. I went as a STEM major and it was incredible. Online classes were straightforward and due on Sunday (giving you basically the whole weekend to finish). The professors were friendly and responsive. I went to the West Jordan campus, which was nice but there were few options for food within walking distance."
Niche User,5,When I did my tour it was great. A lot of diversity. People/ the teachers-professors were great. They were all nice and could tell they liked being their.
Sophomore,5,"I think for the amount you pay it is well worth the education. They also make an effort to make sure your needs are met. However, I would like to see more class options and a campus more focused on the classes rather than the look."
Freshman,5,I really like a lot of the teachers at SLCC because they all care about you getting good grades in their classes and they also treat you like an adult by treating you with respect. I also like that the students at SLCC are very involved in everything and there is always some sort of activity going on aim towards the development of students socially and educationally. The one thing I would change about SLCC is that they need to make their sports more well-known by talking about them more.
Senior,5,"Loved the school, teachers and small classes. Great community! Not a lot of safety protocols though."
Freshman,5,"Salt Lake community college is a great school, I love going there. There are so many resources available to students. I just discovered the food pantry and really love it. The Lifetime Activities Center is awesome as well, so much to do to stay healthy. The selection of classes is great, however due to my work schedule, I sometimes have difficulty making it work. I arrive in the morning where there is lots of parking, and a parking pass is only 25 dollars. Compared to other schools that is a steal. Going there full time is also really cheap, only 2500 or less each semester."
Niche User,5,"I enjoy the community feeling here, and I benefit from how invested my professor is. I love how easy it was to apply and how straightforward it is to enroll. I'm enjoying using the Canvas application and I really love the free transit pass!"
Junior,5,"I’ve reapplied to the college recently and everyone I’ve interacted with in person, over the phone and through email has been very kind and helpful ful"
Senior,5,Really good school to start off with instead of paying double the amount if you went to a university. Very affordable and worth going to if you don’t have the money.
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far has been really good. There are some things I would like to see change, I believe all students who pay tuition should not have to buy a parking pass."
Sophomore,5,"Honestly I was a little bummed out that I started at a community college. I really thought I lost a little bit of the ""college experience"". Turns out, the lessons I learned and the opportunities that were afforded to me thanks to SLCC are priceless. I am so grateful for my time here at SLCC and I'm even more grateful to the faculty that made this experience so much better than I thought it would be. My advice? Get to know your instructors and ask them questions. It'll help you out more than you know."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved going here. They are easy to work with, have great quality classes, and have amazing professors!"
Sophomore,5,I've had a really good time at SLCC so far. Instructors are very knowledgeable and care about their students. Have also met a lot of good people and made new friends. Tuition is also affordable
Sophomore,5,"Salt Lake Community College is very affordable and provides you with the right tools to become a successful person. The classes are very small and personal, which makes it easier to get to know your teacher better. I have attended SLCC for two years now and I have had countless positive experiences. I have learned a lot during my time here. This school has prepared me to transfer to a university. The school is very diverse, as well."
Freshman,5,I love it here! I can really tell that the professors want to help. You just have to put in your effort to ask for it. Lots of resources to help you succeed as well
Freshman,5,Super good environment! I highly recommend the Taylorsville location. The teachers here are well taught and have helped me ut incredibly. I plan on attending the spring of 2020 and hope others can too!
Junior,5,They offer a wide variety of classes and class times. The classes are small and the teacher really focus on helping you. Overall have enjoyed the experience here. I wish more of the college activities happened on different campuses rather than all at the main campus that I am never actually able to attend.
Freshman,5,The classes are good and the professors are very willing to work with you. It also has many locations which helps a lot if you live farther away from the main campus. It's also easy to register for classes.
Freshman,5,"Great school! The professors (at least the ones I have had) have been great. Being a high school student and a college student, it is very stressful, and they are very accommodating and my first semester was a great start to my college experience."
Junior,4,"Online learning has been an adjustment but they are great with communication. There are always technical issues with any institution but I feel that SLCC is doing a great job, especially during the pandemic."
Junior,4,"This is a great, affordable educational institution. I have had incredible professors that really care about my success in the nursing program and they are always approachable and easy to talk to."
Freshman,4,"Again all of this online learning is new to me, as well as some of my professors. We are all learning this new normal together which makes it easier, knowing we are all in the same boat. Learning is not the same online as it would be in a classroom setting, but Salt Lake Community College has made it easy to communicate with professors and other students easily. All of our assignments are online and we have designated times to log in to broadcasted meetings each week. SLCC is very good at keeping everyone on the same page as well as keeping everything organized. At first, I was a little nervous to start college with everything being online, but I have found that my school is very considerate and makes resources easier for students to access."
Junior,4,"Class sizes are great for learning. Professors are hit or miss, you get some great ones and some not so great."
Junior,4,"Online Learning at SLCC is pretty good they have a good number, if not at least 95% of the courses are online, which is great for some students."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school for affordability. However, if you are wanting that college campus feel, this school is not for you."
Sophomore,4,Great faculty and teachers. I have loved all of my teachers while attending this school. The administration and counselors are also great.
Junior,4,I feel like the teachers are really engaged with their students and it feels more personalized with smaller class sizes so the teaching style can be tailored for every student to succeed.
Freshman,4,"As a current nursing student at SLCC, my experience has been good in light of the Covid pandemic.  The teachers have been very helpful and are trying their best to get us all through this pandemic as well as the stresses of nursing school"
Freshman,4,Everybody at Salt Lake Community is kind and very outgoing. Would very much recommend but if your going for business don't take economics from Hector Saez he is very hard to work with. But other than that all the professors and students are so nice and very helpful.
Freshman,4,The experience is great!!! The online shift is hardly noticeable because of the wonderful teachers that work here
Sophomore,4,It was a little challenging at first considering when I did take online classes it was during COVID. A lot of professors had to transfer over to online and a lot of them have never done it before. Each professor was understanding and caring.
Niche User,4,I will be starting online classes this coming semester. MY advisors have been making sure I am prepared and ready for it.
Sophomore,4,"The online course I took was pretty straight forward. The first one I took was hard, but the second one was easier. The professors did their best to ensure that students were engaged and learning through the virtual setting."
Sophomore,4,I really liked how cheap it was and how close by each locations were so i didn’t have to drive super far. I would like to see some changes in the staffing departments since i always had troubles there.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I've had a good experience. College is what you make of it and I'm satisfied so far. As it is with many schools, you'll get your fair share of good teachers and the teachers that make you think you're wasting your time. Admittedly I am not very involved in school activities, especially with the pandemic putting a halt on everything on campus but that reflects more on myself then on the school. Speaking of the pandemic, switching to online was a smooth process and I'll give the teachers and staff props for that, they did a great job with transitioning. However, it would have been nice if we were refunded tuition, or if they at least lowered it considering half of the resources we pay for on campus was no longer available. They gave us money to cover expenses that may have arisen while transiting to online, but it was after the fact. It would have been nice to have that money from the beginning to cover internet expenses as well as buying myself a laptop."
Sophomore,4,I love how personal SLCC is and I feel I'm getting a better education due to the smaller class sizes
Sophomore,4,I enjoy how all of the teachers are very understanding and are passionate about the topics they are teaching. The environment is clean and friendly. I do wish that they had more club options and scholarship opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all courses at Salt Lake Community College have been converted to online study. The teachers have done very well in keeping their students engaged and all of the classes are easy to navigate online. Some teachers are using Zoom to keep in contact with the students. Overall Salt Lake Community College has a great online study program and I would recommend it to any students looking to take online courses."
Freshman,4,Salt Lake Community is a very good starting place. They offer majority of the same courses as the bigger neighboring universities. There are multiple campuses which makes it an easy commute & there are a variety of classes which means you’ll rarely ever deal with waiting lists even if it’s for a gen ed class. There’s a lot of local stores which makes access to food nice & on campus they have resources for literally EVERY life emergency. I like SLCC. I’ve felt included & cared for by academic advisors & my professors. Each take the time to learn your name & a little bit about your life to see how they can help you. It’s an awesome experience overall & I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is looking for an affordable route to success!
Freshman,4,"Online school is always so much harder in general, but my teacher helped me get through it during covid!"
Freshman,4,"My experience has been great so far, the teachers and staff have been super helpful in answering my questions. Each person that I know that have attended here, they have had an amazing experience and are proud of showing off what college the have attended. Another thing is the different cultures that are brought to campus, you just have everyone around with their different foods and learning about different things about where people are from."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience with online learning has been great so far, although it is my first semester and it was better than I thought it would be. I thought that I was not going to have the same learning experience as in the classroom, but the professors have helped me through it and they have made it easier for me to where it feels like the in classroom experience."
Alum,4,"SLCC is great for value, ease, class availability and experience. I did my pre-requisites and the nursing program here and absolutely loved it. the classes weren't huge and felt very intimate. I made a lot of friends while attending here."
Alum,4,very engaging. had a great overall experience. I wish I had taken more online classes. online learning was very easy and very do-able. a lot of my generals were done online and it was very simple and easy to stay on track.
Sophomore,4,The online classes offered at SLCC are diverse and of a high quality. The professors who teach the online courses have a great grasp on their knowledge and they are generally caring and good at communication.
Freshman,4,"This community college is one of the easiest in the country where just about anyone if they put in the minim work and effort, can pass and transfer to a university of your choice. Thankfully, most teachers are willing to help when help is needed, but only a few are not so great. In my opinion, if you use rate my professor, you will find the right teacher for you. There are so many campuses so you will most likely find a campus near your house, therefore, the commute time is usually shorter. Also, that means you do not need to live in dorms since it is so close to home. It is not the most secure place in the world, but I can assure you that if you take morning classes, you will most likely be safe. The online classes are super easy and most people end up passing if they do the homework which is great. From my point of view, considering the tuition, the classes, the straightforward programs, the years in school, and the diversity, I believe it is a good fit for an associate degree."
Freshman,4,"I personally did not take online classes, but this year I considered taking the risk since so many people recommend I take them. Also, considering the current crisis, it is obligatory and not a choice. According to people who have taken the classes and evidently passed, the courses are durable as long as you do the homework and follow the teacher's instructions. Obviously, you will need some time and effort but I guarantee it will be less compared to a university. There are many options provided to the students and it is noticeable the school want the student to pass and move on to the next stage in their life. Just like any online class, you need motivation and commitment. Some teachers may be tougher graders than others, but in general, professors tend to be easygoing with the students when grading assignments. Most of the people I know have graduated or are on track to graduation in this school. Many people may not know this, but the graduation rate in this college needs to go up."
Alum,4,I had mostly great experiences with online. I had a couple professors who just showed up in the first day of school and then the last. But many of my professors were very involved in each class and wanted to see us succeed. They were great at answering question when needed and giving great feedback on assignments. The only thing that was difficult about the online experience was when the teachers were not present in the course.
Alum,4,"I thought Salt Lake Community College was a great experience. The class size was smaller and so it was a great way to connect more with classmates and professors. I loved having multiple campus options and such a diversity in classes. I have really enjoyed my time here. In places for room for improvement, is in academic advising. They seemed to just to want you to take more classes then needed, and many times had wrong information. Other than that it was a great experience."
Sophomore,4,I took a few online classes at this school.  I was able to learn quite a bit from my online classes.  In my personal opinion I do not learn as well online and prefer face to face classes.  Online classes are well scheduled and a motivated student cal learn a lot.
Junior,4,"Salt lake community college is a great, affordable school to help me get started with my degree. They have many free resources for students and care about their students. I would recommend this school to anyone considering an affordable education."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Salt Lake Community college has been great so far. I just finished my first year. It is a good place to get your generals finished. They work well with all kinds of lifestyles and schedules.
Niche User,4,I like the diversity and that the classes can be taken in both a college atmosphere and a high school atmosphere.
Sophomore,4,"Salt Lake Community College is a very great school. They have really great programs and courses that are just as vigorous as other universities. The professors really want you to learn and they care about you. They try to give you advice for each class and for your future transfer colleges. Salt Lake Community College is very close to my home, so I don't have to spend more money on dorms. Overall, this school helps me breath and not be overwhelmed by the cost of tuition."
Freshman,4,"Salt Lake Community College is the most affordable community college in the state and contains a vast amount of trades, degrees and programs. You can easily transfer credits to nearby universities. The administration cares about student safety and wants to carefully but easily phase back into normal classes and labs that had to be temporarily moved online due to the coronavirus. The campus and work-study jobs are paid a living wage to be able to feel financially secure and the staff did everything to make sure all staff was kept during the coronavirus as well. Lastly, even before federal funding had been passed for educational institutions, the college had already prepared and started a student crisis fund to help students desperately in need due to unexpected job losses and other needs."
Junior,4,SLCC is dedicated to the financial and academic success of students. There are multiple satellite campuses across the Salt Lake valley and is bolstered by a large academic advising team and financial success policy. It is the most affordable 2-year schooling option in Utah and all academics are fully transferrable to all other Utah College/Universities.
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed the flexibility and cost effectiveness that SLCC has presented. They offer competitive classes and have an amazing staff.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy Salt Lake Community College. It is my first year and college and SLCC has made it an easy transition from high school. Classes are small and I have liked all my professors.
Freshman,4,"All of my professors have been really kind to me at my campus. I like how everyone at the campus has different opinions on issues. The cost for school is not bad and the campus is pretty nice. However, I wish the area around the campus was safer. There are a lot of poor people walking around and one of my professors had his bike stolen from in front of the school."
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending Salt lake community college. They are a very affordable school with a great focus for getting students the education they're looking for.
Freshman,4,"There is a deep sense of community here. The students, the professors, the advisers, and everyone else wants you to be successful. The school does it's best to create opportunities for the students, from clubs to forums to service projects."
Alum,4,I liked that the school was very affordable and the classes are very flexible for a working class schedule. I do feel that some of the teachers still use a very elementary school method of teaching. You still learn but often times you feel like a grade school kid. Diversity on campus is high. You can meet people that are from very interesting backgrounds here. I don't feel that the school staff does enough to help students plan for their future after graduation. I visited an adviser once during my time here and they did not let me know of any opportunities I could take advantage of to advance in my education.
Sophomore,4,I love SLCC. definitely recommend... small classes are fun and a lot easier to interact w professors.
Freshman,4,"There is a lot of information that the student needs to choice to take in. The staff is well informed and are understanding of every student. It is important to do your research on which teacher you want to take. If you chose the wrong teacher at the beginning of the semester then you have to deal with it, it would help if students did research on what teacher they want and what teacher has the best teaching style for them. The opportunities at SLCC are vast for a two-year college, it would be good to take advantage of the low tuition price and take what you can at SLCC."
Freshman,4,Salt Lake Community College is a good place to being school for people who are new to college. The professors are friendly and allow for their students to learn. The campuses are well kept and there are many diverse groups of students that fill the campus!
Graduate Student,4,"Salt Lake Community College was an excellent place for me to pursue my education during a difficult time in my life. The tuition is affordable, financial aid is easy to work through, and there are various student support services which do a great job. The instructors tend to be very good, with many often teaching similar classes at 4-year universities. While SLCC lacks the variety of extracurricular activities of a larger university, the more affordable tuition and convenience make it a place I highly recommend if you are starting out at college. It does have sports and other activities available to those who want to round out their college experience as well."
Freshman,4,I have not been going to school here for a very long time but I have had a great experience! Love this place.
Freshman,4,I came to SLCC because I was given a pell grant and couldn't afford university. I was worried about attending SLCC then transferring however the Community College has helped give me the ability to understand college life and greatly prepared me for the transfer from the college to university.
Freshman,4,"My teachers were all very engaging and well learned, as well as understanding and friendly. However, there was little to no social life, which I would have enjoyed. I felt like the college genuinely cared about my education."
Alum,4,"Salt lake community college is not bad at all, for the price it's very good as far as the credits you receive and many credits are transferable"
Freshman,4,The college is smaller and the class sizes are smaller.  The teachers are able to spend more time with the student.  All of the staff has been very helpful.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy SLCC! The teachers are great and attentive. The class sizes are comfortable and you really get the best education for a less expensive cost!
Freshman,4,"Its a very nice community collage that offers lots of opportunity. they could use a little help with how smooth everything runs, but overall it is a great school."
Niche User,4,"professors were nice but not super experienced. pretty good, campus is too spread out. facilities are way old, I don't like salt lake, eh, I think I belong somewhere else."
Sophomore,4,I like how affordable the community college is. I would like to see free parking for the community but I know that wont happen.
Freshman,4,"I love the quality of education you receive at SLCC. Smaller class sizes, with amazing Professors who take the time and go out of there way to help you as a Student understand and succeed."
Sophomore,4,SLCC is a great school with a lot of awesome classes and opportunities. Highly recommend for your intro into a college and a university.
Freshman,4,i am currently a freshman here. They offer a ton a resources to help students who may be struggling. The professors are well educated and are very invested in your success and it makes it apparent with the smaller class sizes. So if you want to go to a college where the professors are a lot more available to help you i would recommend attending here.
Freshman,4,"Took an beginners Asl class, teacher was deaf as expected.  He was a good teacher, but he expected us to know a lot of signs at the entry level.  Now taking math and teachers method is a bit bad."
Freshman,2,"First off, not a fan of campuses: dirty carpets,unkempt areas and computers, and sketchy surroundings made for a very uncomfortable environment. Made me feel like I was in high school in more grungy conditions. In fall seems there is always a cold or flu going around and you're likely to get it...makes me excited for COVID-19, not.Pros: microwaves, spacious ceilings, SLCC entry way displays flowers and waterfall, outdoor area w/seating, ample parking slots avail($45 parking pass year), gyms, and low cost tuition. Other cons: basically anyone can get in,like the homeless often found on the streets, not ideal for safety (professor had bike stolen from inside building). Also 3 campuses not ideal, especially if classes are in different spots. Registering, a nightmare too. Academically hard classes: writing essays lots of papers/projects w/quizzes and reading just for 1010. Or super easy depending on your professor. U of U classes easier. Surprisingly though, the info was college level."
Sophomore,2,They closed my program without notifying me. I had only a few classes to go. And had to come up with a way to transfer to a more expensive school. The first year academic advisor told me that I looked too much like a ballerina to consider the academic and career goals I had set in place.
Sophomore,2,Most of the advisors I saw were really poor and signed me up for classes that I didn't want or need. The professors are nothing special. Its a community college. I'd say its below average.
Freshman,2,"At my school a lot of the professors don't actually teach. I know that sounds crazy, but in two of my classes I have taken just this year I haven't learned much. My one class the teacher always left super early, gave out a study guide that was the exact same as the test. In my other class the teacher rushes through things, doesn't teach well, lets us use notes on the test that barely help because the test is different. This is sad to me because it is college and we are paying them are money and they could care less to be there or to help us."
College Junior,2,"Most of the classes I have taken online have been difficult. The professors did not seem to be as involved with the students and many of the assignments were difficult to access, requiring a complicated mesh of programs to access There is not much, if any, interaction with other peers at all."
College Senior,2,Not very helpful in helping students know where to go and what to do once they are done.
Recent Alumnus,2,not much help for par-time work while in college and kind of help to find a good when you graduate.
Recent Alumnus,2,Just a college to get them lower division generals out of the way to transfer. other then that not much her except health programs that are all most impossible to get in with huge waiting list. also not much of a career center ether becuse they don't know what they are doing and job fairs with mostly full time jobs that don't fit you school schedule.
Recent Alumnus,2,On the main campus they have so old and new building but they world rather pack most students in the the old building that are falling apart.  To much hybrid and online class also to many profressors rely on web programs to teach students . Also the math is all done on the my math lab wear your not taught much in class with no book. Must of the class test you on 4 to 5 chapter at time to a lot of memorizing for clases with no books with 50 question test. Also you not much help for thoese with disabilities her ether. Also almost impossible to get finical aid to much red tape you got thye grades and every thing but still can't get financial aid. to bad this the only community college in Utah because hurry and transfer some wear better or if you have the money go out of state to a much better community college.
College Junior,2,"I do not see many of these around the school, it seems like they aren't interested in giving you job opportunities, just making sure you get a degree there."
College Senior,2,There isn't an alumni  network or career center hwre
College Junior,2,A lot of courses I won't be able to complete because they only offer them at certain times of the day that I can not attend.
College Junior,2,I wouldn't say that a degree from here is prestigious or well respected. It is great for employers to see any kind of degree from prospective employees and some fields require it but the school you go to doesn't really matter. I haven't been aware of career recruiters on campus nor any alumni work that has been going on.
College Senior,2,"No help, counselors really messed me and I had the wrong classes.  No job prospects, no alumni."
College Senior,2,It is not about the major.  It is about getting the general requirements out of the way.
College Sophomore,2,The things we're learning is great
Recent Alumnus,2,"the students are really rude at SLCC the parking sucks and the most students can't drive and like to cut you of and take up to parking stalls. I know its a community college but wear do they get some of there processor they half not even qualified to teach high school. Also the math department and math professor expect you to know it all on the first day of class if you did you would not be that level of math one higher or done with your math requirements. Also worst school for students with disabilities off any kind not much help. Also it a social desert her if your not on sports team the clubs don't do much and are a waste of time I look at them like I said waste if time. the school does not have much to offer outside generals either they pay any thing but the help programs and they always have a 3 years wait list and require a 4.0 to get in even 3.5 or 3,6  gpa students can't get in.."
Recent Alumnus,2,the college needs help with the amount of class going online now not all student do well with online class or are quick leaners. If you have disabilities like me online class don't work not enough lectures. Also the class that have lectures are waste of time because most of the class is online and the professors don't care and speed threw class and you basically you teach your self at the college.  Also this college has the worst DRC department for students with disabilities and the rudest students professor ever. Also this college is not very disability friendly at all. Also the Wi-Fi is very poor at the redwood campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,This college is not that great and SLCC needs some help with the amount of class not all students do well with the teach your self online class not providing enough in class lectures because not all student are quick learners ether. Also or you go to class and the professor does not teach much or care because their class is mostly online line. It's especially hurt student like me with learning disabilities. SLCC needs to give students both option.  Also what is up with all online math class you go to class the professor rushes right trough and they want you to teach your self online and do all of the home work online. Call me old fashion but I lick doing the home work from the book and being taught more in class that is another problem. Also the hole math department suck with the worst instructors ever and needs to be over hauled. Also if have physical or none physical disabilities your are screwed it SLCC. It the worst DRC department ever. Also the student are not very friendly at SLCC especially if you have disabilities.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I want to do physical therapy and i cant do that well from SLCC, I need to get into a school that i can get a bachelors at before i can really take off towards PT. its a community college technical school, not a university."
College Junior,2,"I live at home, but that does not necessarily mean that my parents are paying for college, so I do not qualify for any of their scholarships.  Recently they also took away my residency status, and the school is not being very helpful in getting that resolved.  For a community college, it is becoming far too expensive."
College Senior,2,I did enroll in an online class my sophomore year and it was a complete fail. I got a lot of things done but than I stopped going online and than I never finished that course.
College Junior,2,The diversity is good in both age and ethnicity but the student are very to themselves when not in class. Not very sociable
College Junior,2,Everything about it was terrible.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I takes a long time to get repsonses VIA email, and if you go into the actual office, you will be there for 4 hours. They are also not very undertanding."
College Sophomore,2,"I wa able to apply for financial aid and receive tuition but than my mom got a job. I have always paid for my own schooling, books, rent, food, car, and I no longer live with my parents but my award is based off of them. College is already expensive as it is and with the tuition rates rising it is almost impossible to make a living."
College Student,2,Sometimes the wireless access is great however during the afternoon that when it turns bad.
College Junior,2,I don't really know what this is
College Junior,2,There isn't much of a social scene. 
College Junior,2,"Not very helpful, i get different answers and suggestions every time I go in there. I wish i could see the same people every time but they don't let you."
College Senior,2,I feel that the network response time is really slow. The computer aids are helpful at times.
College Sophomore,2,The main reason the grade is so low is becuase the clases are not flexible at all for students who are employeed full time and need specific times to go to school! I also feel like they offer no online classes for specific areas. Or even to get your degree online.
College Senior,2,"For me personally, it is close to impossible to get financial aid through the school. I am living at home and my parents make good money, so I'm not eligible for financial aid, even though I pay for my own schooling. I applied for a tuition waiver from SLCC, which asked for my basic information and a good GPA, (I have an associates degree from UVU and a 3.8 GPA), and I was denied."
College Junior,2,"The education is worth paying for, but the problem is that you have to wait a long time to even see the awards that you can get. There is a lot of paperwork that you have to turn it just to get everything situated. Another big pain is that the main fin aid office is now closed on Friday."
College Junior,2,"I have not yet graduated from Salt Lake Community College but have met many people who have. In my opinion Salt Lake Community College has taken the ""Wal-Mart"" approach, they focus on quantity not quality. There are so many students who come and go each year that they don't have the resources to focus on Career Services to graduating students."
College Student,2,The kids were not social or outgoing. I never talked to a single kid in class or out. Everyone pretty much kept to themselves.
College Junior,2,"Not really responsive or informative, but the tools are easily accessible on line."
College Freshman,2,"I'm sure the Student Body are wonderful people, however, I haven't met any of them or heard anything about them. This is the first time the Student Body has been mentioned to me. I feel as though the Student body could make themselves known better. They should be getting students involved with extra curricular activities, and getting to know everyone on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"OK, this is the ONE area where I feel like SLCC does not deserve an A+ rating.  The class availability in the Interior Design Department has been awful!  All of the professors in the ID department are adjunct faculty, meaning that most of them have other full-time jobs.  As such, they are only able to teach at night after their regular jobs.  I dislike driving at night -- especially in snowy weather and would rather do ALMOST ANYTHING than drive half an hour in the dark in the snow.  Still, that is exactly what I am doing next semester.  It seems that six months into the program, I have taken ALL of the classes offered during the day.  It was my intention to go only during the day and only one day a week.  Nope.  I will be going twice a week until 9:50 at night, because those are the times the classes I need to take are offered.  UGH.  "
College Senior,2,"I really don't know much about how to see what happens with the school. I remember voting and everything, but I honestly don't know what is being done by those that won."
College Senior,2,"There is a career center at SLCC, but the jobs posted tend to be old,they need more education thatn SLCC provies, or they're sales positions.  I've not had success with service."
College Senior,2,"I took Math 1010 in a normal lecture class, and my teacher was not the best so I basically had to learn everything on my own or at the math lab. So when registering for 1050 I figured online would be a breeze. I was wrong. I have an assignment or two due every single day, and the lessons are sent out in the form of powerpoints. The professor assigns group projects, which never end up being that because people took the course online for a reason and they do it themselves. I will not take an online math course again."
College Senior,2,The facilites are properly equiped. I just wish they would be open later. The hours are limited and should be extended for students who work later hours.
College Freshman,2,Many people are very focused on getting in and getting out. The majority of people are working class and do not focus on socializing. There is a wide variety in age so I am struggling to make friends.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not many computer labs, and not much access to the labs either. Most computer use is required at home."
College Senior,2,"The career senter at SLCC is nice, but honestly I haven't used it much. I can't recall seeing anything about post-grad services, except for fliers about other schools to transfer to."
College Junior,2,Good School. Overall salt lake community college is a good school. One of the main complaints that I have is that they don't offer enough classes for the classes that are in high demand. For example for college algebra they filled up the 15 classes that they offered and still had over 40 people on a waiting list trying to get a spot in one of the classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Hassle Free – It has taken me several trips and acts of congress to get what I needed done.
College Sophomore,2,Network Issues – The network always has some kind of problem it's either down or not accurate and it gets frustrating especially when you need to pay tuition or check your schedule to make sure you got a class
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes i feel as if things could be more organized and the staff should know more than they do. I had to know everything ahead of time because they made it so hard to do something as easy as tell me what classes i needed to take
College Senior,2,"Do It at Redwood Campus – Almost all of the financial aid facilities at the other campuses are completely overtaxed, leading to hour long waits. I'll normally come over the break to submit stuff to avoid the lines, but if you hit lines most of the other campuses only have one or two staff members on hand to help with lines of 25+ people. At redwood they at least have 7-10 people at the desks."
College Senior,2,"Redwood Campus Is Awesome, Rest Suck. Some campuses (like the South Salt Lake Campus and the building across from the library) have virtually no resources but the Redwood campus has many facilities including a library, gym, theater, 6+ computer labs and cafeteria."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is very difficult to work with. They didn't let us know how much we would be getting in award money until like a week before school starting. They are also very rude and aren't helpful at all. They don't like to help you unless they really have to. I've learned that the school has problem's with forms, if you dont have a form in on time don't expect to get helped!"
College Junior,2,"Lesser of Evils – I pay way too much money for classes here and if you support yourself, there is almost no help out there for you.  If you're a good student there are opportunities to help offset costs.  Financial aid staff is usually very helpful, but it's hard to get assistance if you work full time and go to school.  SLCC is the cheapest option out there, so I give them that.  Tuition was hiked this semester, but it's still better than paying University tuition.  My tip for students is to save your pennies, live with your parents as long as you can, work part time, buy books on KSL and work hard at keeping grades."
College Sophomore,2,Tutors Not Available. Trying to get the school to provide a tutor is a nightmare.
College Junior,2,"Dependent on Student's Connections and Time Involvement – The alumni network seems to be nonexistant unless it's for fundraising or the school asking for money from them. Job prospects depends on the connections that students make. The career center I cannot comment on, as I have not dealt with it. I know if you can find time to match his schedule, there is a good, but slightly-pushy, resume builder on campus in the career center at South City. So, how much time do you want to invest to hunt down the resources?"
College Junior,2,"Research First and Come Prepared – The class instruction is a hit or miss for the value. The best thing is to check the Professor out online to see the reviews. If students state the class is ""fluff"" it will not be worth your time. The Finiancial aid office is usually helpful, if you are nice and pleasant. The minute that they can tell you might be agaitated, even if it was from waiting in line for an hour, some of the attendants get terse. It's best to arrive early and with all the forms that you need. The finiancial aid office used to like to bounce one back and forth before releasing your funds. It was up to you to call and find out the reason. Sometimes, there were complications to get SLCC to believe that it was on their side and not the lenders. o_0"
College Freshman,2,Some Under Qualified Professors – About half of the teachers I've had at SLCC have been totally incompetent. Half were excellent and the other half of the classes just feel like a drag and a waste of time.
College Sophomore,2,"Professors Lack of Response – My professors were really good at teaching and getting their point across. But when it came to my final grades, not one of them responded to my e-mails! I asked all of them to explain my grade so I can better understand why I got what I got (as they had all offered to do if asked) to no avail. It's like the second the final was taken, I was just another number on their list."
Recent Alumnus,2,My Major Is Not Even a Question! I not yet recieved the proper guidence advice in order to graduate next spring I will have to figure it out on my own! The way I have had to figure everything else out their is so much lack of information for a transfer student they think that because you have been in college else where you should know it all. Well many things are diffrent here emportant differences that I should have been informed about but was'nt that missing information has me in deep financial problems now.
Freshman,1,"Some of the professors cared about their jobs and their students. Most didn't and their motto was sort of 
""i'll see you next semester"" they don't care if you pass or fail."
Alum,1,"The counselors are very unhelpful. Instead of helping me pursue my dreams they told me that if I was starting at a community college I would need to lower my aspirations. The professors don't want to be there, just like the students. Horrible experience all around. It's worth it to pay the extra money and just go to a four year institution."
Senior,1,"I was told that if I went to SLCC I would be saving money, especially if I switched from Weber State. The internet is complete crap. It kicks you off every 8 min or less. They require parking passes the full 24 hours. So spent $20 on a pass. My other classmates have never purchased a pass and have never received a ticket. I went to the library to get tutored and get help for my Math. After spending hours in the library and getting nowhere he finally decides to tell me that he don't know how to do Trig.  I was also told when I first registered that this one class would be $600 but has ended costing close to $1,600! They charge you $30 fee for making a payment plan on top of the interest they charge. The cashier gave me the wrong information about how much my payments were and because of that I received a late fee. I just paid the balance in full! I am not playing the games anymore. I am not returning!"
College Sophomore,1,I haven't seen or noticed any of these things. It could be because I am only there for one thing and one thing only that is to learn. I have my tunnel vision on and just go straight to class. I don't bother to look around to see what it going on.
College Freshman,1,financial aid guys won't work with anything
College Freshman,1,"The Financial Aid office genuinely tends to loose paperwork. The Financial Aid technicians themselves depending on the time of day, the location of the financial aid office to which you are calling give mis information, can have you filling and submitting appeals that are not appropriate, due to your specific issue or issues. The Financial Aid advisors are do not explain how financial aid works very well, they use terms that only those who are exceptional at math can understand, they do not always give the same answers either depends upon the advisor, time of day and which location you are speaking with them at!! They tend to send letters saying you are denied aid before appeals have been reviewed by the appropriate committees, to even know if there is a reason to send such a letter, and they often do not pay attention to what they are sending students who are financial aid!!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Not much in the area of careers for my major.
Recent Alumnus,1,You need to take almost all the classes at the campus. I work full-time so it is very hard for me to do that. They should have more online options.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't needed to transfer credits.  I do have trouble every semester trying to register for classes...I could never find a class avalible at the time I needed.  The first day I could register I would-at like 7am and the 3 classes that would fit in my schedule would all be full!!! Then they would offer one or two really early or late classes to choose from that I had to register for and then try to find someone to watch my daughter cause daycare isn't open at night.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't have any helpful tips on how to improve financial aid at my school, but I have to say the people working there are really rude.  They act like it's an inconvenience that you're there and they act like they don't know anything so you have to come back like 5-10 times and wait in a two hour line for them to tell you that you're missing another piece of paperwork.  I guess my only thought would be that they need a more user friendly program online for people to use so you don't have to keep coming back with missing paperwork that they won't provide for you...they just tell you where to find it online and to fill it out and come back."
College Senior,1,"It suck and the teacher suck to her is one of the reasons why I could give more buck I would take t days to read. I have Terry Kidd for math 920 at the south city campus at 8:30a.m.  till 9:30 a.m. I cam to class today and we were having a review for  the test before we took the test to day and I wanted to listen in on it but Terry told me that I the DRC has my test and that I should just go down there and take it know.  I told Terry I want to listen in on want you have to say and bon up for the test. If you do not know it by know you owe well well can't help you know and he to the girl next to me the same thing because she has disabilities to and made fun of us in front of the hole class which was not vey nice. Terry also told us two that he is tired of making special accommodations for student with disabilities so go know and take you test you will not be abele to take it aging. The class laughed  at us this Moring.  So student told us to just go take the test and to get down restarted ass out you hold up the class. Terry did nothing. I talked to a Kathie Campbell bout this and she told my not to worry just do the best you can the rest of the semester like she did not care. This hurt my filling a prided I have tried real hard this semester to pass per algebra that I have had a hard time in and have a 76% before the test I took to day. That just made me worth less for taking the test and made me fill like crape. This school has the rudest students I have ever met in my life and teachers as well especially if you have a disabilities. something need to be do about teachers understand students with disabilities and about students behave your if the school gives a dam.  I almost felt like  tell him off in front  of the class but that would not get me any were and I would just be as big of a loser as terry and the students in class.

"
College Senior,1,this school has the rudest student body. I fill like I am in high school all over aging the students need to grow up and act their age and act like adults not like children. 
College Senior,1,some other teachers are oak and some don't care and are their to just to collect a pay check. Also this Scholl has the rudest student body. Also it you have Disabilities and need some extra you can for get about it this schools DRC department is worthless and the teacher do like it if you have learning disabilities or other disabilities because they don't what to deal with you and think that you will slow up their class.
College Senior,1,I hate the students at the Slat Lake Community college because their are the rudest and most immature people I have ever met in my life.  This college is like going back in time to middle school or high school. The students at slick need to grow up and learn some manners. I have only run into a hand full of students that have some manners and acct like an adult.
College Senior,1, The concern I have is at the south city campus the library it is really nice but they have more computer then places the study. I live in Sandy and work in west valley and after class I have 2 1/2 hours to study and it is to far and a waste of time to go home to study before work and sometimes I am to try late  a night to do it but I am to tired after work . I can get most of my studying don before work in the library like I used to but at the south city campus there is more computers then their are tables to study at like there used to be. They have a lot of wasted space up stars but not much places to study. Also the redwood campus has to many computers and not enough places in the library to study at ether and the student center is always to nose and all of the tables are full most of the time when I go out there before work. Me and my math tutor are having a hard time finding place to met at the redwood campus or at the south city campus because all the table are full and there is no place for her to tutor me at redwood or at south city and for me to do my school work before I go to work because of the lack of study places . We are now have to go over to the noise coffee shop accost form the south city campus to study and on Monday the 26th of August we couldn't find a place in there to study at ether because it was full of students studding in the coffee shop. This is a crime for a college of your size not to have  the proper places for students to study at. This really hurts the students that pay good money to go her and can't find a good place to study at study before work or have a place to met tutors one at what a shame.  The school needs get more tables at these campus to study at. I pay good money to this school and I see a lot of wasted space at both of the campuses that could be use better.
College Sophomore,1,I received more money last semester but something went wrong and now im getting half that.
College Senior,1,the student body needs to be more friendly at slick especialy if you have disabilities like me.
College Senior,1,Very Hard to Regester for the class that you need because there are– very littel class offered for a college of there size. Also not may programs offered that when you done with pay a living wage. Also if you need help form the tutoring department you are sol they are not much help.
College Senior,1,The School Resources at Slick. The school resources are okay when you can find some one to help you that cares.
College Senior,1,My Academic  Experience. My academic Experience is just okay but the academic adivisor though at Slcc suck and are not very helpful.
College Junior,1,Instructors at the Salt Lake Community College are continually a disappointment. For the majority of Learning Centers and Tutor staff English was their second language and were hard to understand do to a have foreign accent and if you have hearing loss and learning disabilities like me they are very hard to under stand in the learning center because of their foreign accent. also the teachers slick have been pathetic. I have had a few good ones though. The interesting part is that the female teachers are by far better than the male teachers.  Also if you have disability's like me the disability center is not very helpful with only minimal help and when you ask them for help they all come up with different answers to the same questions and don't seem like they what to help you much. Also the disability centers at Slick are very under funded for a community college of it size.  Also the staff in the disability offices at slick are not very knowledgeable and don't now what they are doing. Also the student body at this college is very unfriendly especially if you have disabilities like me. Also if you have intellectual and learning disabilities like me the teacher they are not very understanding and don't want you in their class because they think that you will be to big of a problem for them and will slow up the class. The Deans and division chairs show poor leadership at this school as well. 
College Junior,1,If your like me and have disabilities at slick the student body is not very friendly to students with disabilities. I should know I have disabilities and the student body at slick is not very nice and accepting of students with disabilities. 
College Junior,1,"I been at the Salt Lake Community college for 3 semesters  now and If your like me and have disabilities that are not  physical this this is the worst school for students with not physical disabilities.  They give great help and support to  students that have physical disabilities but if your a student like me that has hearing loss, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and a Learning disabilities the people in the drc office are not very well trained and helpful to students like me. Like am saying If you have other disabilities other than physical disabilities you out of luck other then getting help with a not taker and private testing. Also the professors are not much help and are not very  under standing of students that have disabilities other then physical ones because they think that you will slow up there class and become a problem.  Getting help and support for students with none physical disabilities is very hard at this school and they make it so you get frustrated an give up on the drc center. so if you have a disability other then a physical one your out of luck at get much help at Slick. "
College Junior,1,If you need a tutor form math at Slcc you better pay for one on your own outside of school. The tuors at Slcc Suck all they whant to do is give you the answers to the problem and no help you learn how to solve the math problem that your having trouble with. Also it take an acct of god to get a one tutor from the school even if you singed up the week be for school like I have. I have sent them three emails and left them two messages and no one in Slcc tutoring department will get back to you. The just suck.
College Junior,1,Nothing there is nothing unique about this school.
College Sophomore,1,"I took an online math class, It definitely needed email alerts for assignments and quizzes. I got a bad grade because we we're assigned groups for a project and mine excluded me."
College Junior,1,buy the way my math teacher for the collge prep math is Jhon Close. I would avise aginst takiung him. He is not a very help teach and just gives you the answer and whant you to figuer out how he got the answer. I don't whant him to do the work for me but whant his help and i don't get it he sucks.
College Junior,1,I am in a college prep math class and thought that it would be better then the regular math classes because you go at your own pace. I thought that would be great since I really have a hard time at math. But the program suck on the comupter and the teacher is not very helpful and the aid dose not show up half of the time and the math lab at school sucks because all they want to do is give you the answer quickly not help slove the prom. I don't expect them to dop all of the work for me but to help me more then they do. This class has been a total waste of my time and did not help me at all. I told the school my problems and they do career what a school that does not career about it students.
College Junior,1,I am in a math class called college prep math and all of my work is done through the schools web site on thier my page to into the math lab. Half of the time at home or at school the schools internet is down or schools maypage is down and I can n't get on to do my work for this class this is a shame. Why can the school have better internet and a better web page. 
College Junior,1,I would like to worn every body that I have Jhon Close as a teacher for my college preatiory math at Slcc. He is worthless l and not very helpful to his students all he wants to do is give you the answers to the math problems your working on and not help walk you threw the steps on how to get the answers. Also he plays around on th e internet to much and talks to a nother teacher that teacher in the class that theaches the class before and after his to much and does not care about helping out his students when they have qwestions very much that is bad.
College Junior,1,I have dis abilities and have had a hard time a the community college in school with my school work. i know it has not been always the school or the teachers fall but the the school is notvery help full with students with disabilitys. Also the the theacher are not very understanding of students with disabilites. Her is and artichale I found on how students with disabilitys are treated in school and in college and life and slcc and the sate of utah fit right into this catagory  of how the treat people with disabilities.
College Junior,1,I am in a all turntitive math class that is called college prep math. It is all done on the computer at you pase but you need to go through four mouals each semester with in three semseters. then you end up in math 1010 that is great. Butthe teacher I have is not very helpful to me in this class ihave to go Monday through thursday one hour each day.  I am have trouble with inagers and the schools toutors are all bookted up this simester. the math lab is okay but not much more help then my teacher. All the teacher and scholl cares about is bodys in the class not if you pass or not. They don't care egought to help me when i as they don't whant to heelp me much. they tell me to just keep pluging away that not the way i whant help or should get help. just another bad part of my experience atr the salt Llake Community College. 
College Junior,1,I have a math class that you have to go on the schools my page to accees the cours that you need to done on the computer. But half of the time it does not work and on Tusedays and Thursdays this math class is my only class.  Two class onTuseday and one class on Thursday the schools my page has not been working. So it his been a wast of time for me to drive out to school. I could stay home and work on other school work before work. Also Half of the time the einternet has been down as well at the school. Also the first three day of my math class was a waste of time because of the schools internet and my page was down. This starting to get anoying because I am having trouble with my math and need to work on it but can't today bacuse the system is not work to get on the my page. This is just one of many problems at Slcc I could tell you about but don't have the time or the internt space to telll about them all. I have let people in on some on this site. Hope it has help you.
College Junior,1,I know some stundent are mothers and have children and have a hard time balencing school and rassing children I am fine with that. The proplem I have is that to many mothers are bring that children to school and getting away with it aspcialy in the libaray when your trying to work on your school work. That is why the school has a daycare center. the Libaray has turned in to one big day care center with screeming kids and kids runing all over. Also I have seen twice this semester alreay two mothers  in the main hall way at the south city campus and one in the libaray brest feding can't they do that at home in privet or store up some milke to have on hand the is disscusting and dusruptive. This school is really going down hill fast.
College Junior,1,"Can't get on to the school web site – Hi every one 60% of the time you can't get on the schools web page bacause it is alway over loaded. I have a math class that requires my to log on to the schools my page and sign in and go to my labs to do my work but in class it always takes me ten minutes to logon and if if log on after class in the library be for work to work on my home work I can't get loged on 60% of the time or get any internet. My computer works fine at home,work and other places but works really slow at school and even the school computer are slow. This is just one of the hundreds of problems the Slcc has."
College Junior,1,"To many problems at this school. I have been a student at salt lake community college for a year now and next summster Iam thinking about changing career plans because this has the only program in the state for occupantunal theripy assistents. The resone is that Ican't affored to go to school out of state and Iam really tired of all the problems at slcc. That school has the worst college resources for a school of it's size. Also slcc is has the most unfriendly student body that I have ever seen aspshilleay if you have disabilites like me. I know you get some of that at every school but the student body is the rudest and most unfriend that I have every seen in my 34 years of life. Also half of the teachers are really nice and the other half cold give a crap aspeshelly if you have disabilites like me that think that your going hold the calss back and cause trouble. Also no one can park in the yellow lines at the school.  Also how long are they going to work on the campsese at the school your trying to listen to the teacher and you have to hear drilling, banging and sawing going on up above or in the next room.  Also know one cares at the school and can give the right info and wants to help you and the school  because all they whant's is your money other than that they could care lasses about the students at the school."
College Junior,1,"My teacher want's us to get the New York Times. Hi my reading 990 teacher wants us to do papers from the New York Times which is fine with my no problem. But the problem is that she said they are suppost to be on every floor of the south city campus of the school next to the school paper every day but after several day of looking and asking they have not been their. I am on a very tight buget and if I have to by the New York Times every day before class that suck when she told us the school has them for free but that is a lie. I ask and some students said that they got them at the school but when one showed my they weren't  there.  I have been looking and looking but have had no luck just a nother thing that the school is lacking on in  resorses. I am taped out and can by a paper for awhile and can;t go on line to get it I have to have the actual paper what a joke. This school can't do any thing right and teachers expect stundents to buy more and more extra things for class. That huts when I only work part time and only make $8.50 an hour. what do they think we are all made of money. My disabilites, school and life cost me engough not to have extra's add on to my school spending that are suppost to be free but aren't."
College Junior,1,How one Teacher has now screwed me over allready. I am taking three class at SLCC and it has not gone good from the start. I will not bore you to death with all of the problems. I am taking reading 990 my frist class and is great and I like the teacher. My secound class is devlopmental math 001 wich when you done you end up in math 1010 and has not gone vey good. The first two days we could get on the computer to do the work. The third day every won got on but me I will tell yopu why. My thrird class is essential college studys that I have to take as rquired for my math class. But I have showed up on time and done the work so far but my teacher for my college essential studys has dropted me from the class by mustake. She was deleting some one else below me on her list and axidently deleted me and beacuse of that I might get drop from my math class and can't log on the computer to do my work she said she is going to get it fixed but has not yet. Also this has screwed up my funding from a state program for people with disabilites in pay for my school and with all of the other problem that I have had this year at Slcc this one really bits and huts. If not fix this week I may lose out on my math classes and the class I was axidenialy dropted from and my vr. funding for this year. I can get a hold of any won at the school to help me with this and the teacher will not get back with me. What a school I am starting to really hate SLCC. If that was n't the only school in this state with my program to be an occupational theripey assistent I would go some were else beacuse I am feed up with every thing at SLCC.
College Junior,1,The parking at the south city talorysville campses suck and at south city they ran out of parking pass and will not have them till next week some time and the second week of school with out a parking pass you will get a ticket. Also if you have a disablity or disibilites like me you are screwed not much help from the drc or the teacher or from other students and the studentbody is very unfriendly to students with disabilites. Also if you have fisical disabilits they stare at you and talk about you with outher students like when I am in class. Also the theachers are not very a comadating to stuidents with disabilites.

Freshman,5,It is easy to get help from teachers and Weber state offers many tutoring opportunities. The small class sizing make it so much easier to interact and focus during class.

Senior,5,"I am an online student. Due to COVID, Weber State made necessary accommodations for online, in-person, virtual, and hybrid classes. I have heard how other campuses have handled the situation, and I genuinely feel that Weber State University attempted to accommodate every student and situation that could arise. Safety was the number one concern, but they also advocated and made it possible for all students to still be able to achieve their educational goals amidst a pandemic. I really enjoy the online classes, as well as Weber States virtual formatting they have for students."
Freshman,5,Weber State University has been extremely helpful for me in structuring my schedule in order to provide the best and quickest way to receive my associates and bachelors degree. The staff has been excellent. All of my classes have been online but my teachers have been amazing and I have learned so much.

Senior,5,"I have taken quite a few online classes with Weber State and most of the time they make it easy to learn and just as good as face-to-face classes. I would highly recommend taking classes online, especially lower-division and generals!"

Junior,5,"Weber State is a great place for the college experience, they offer a significant amount of online courses which have made it possible and easy for me to attend while working towards my desired degree. They offer a lot of opportunity to participate in job fairs."
Sophomore,5,It was hard to adjust to but the online program has gotten so much better over the summer. Professors communicate more and if you have any tech issues the tech workers know how to fix anything.
Sophomore,5,They are really diverse and offer tons of clubs and orgs so everyone can feel at home. The admin and student workers know how to fix any situation.
Junior,5,"What I liked about Weber State was the teachers, at least most of them are very involved in wanting to see you succeed. A lot of my teachers were very good at getting back to me about concerns and stuff in a short period of time."
Freshman,5,the class sizes are manageable most of the teachers are really easy to work with and tuition isn't crazy expensive.
Freshman,5,the teachers have been very understanding and will help you work through any problems you may have. most will post helpful videos that better explain class work.
Alum,5,"By taking online courses, I was able to be home as a single parent with my child. The courses were clear and easy to get through using Canvas. I did have to go to campus to take tests though."
Junior,5,I loved the flexibility of online learning. The professors were responsive and it allowed me to do classes on my schedule.
Freshman,5,"My professors easily transitioned to online classes, so it felt like I was back into my classes.  The presentations and flow of each class were very presentable!"
Freshman,5,"I loved my experience at Weber State University!  The people here are so kind and generous, and I never felt left out!  The classes here are very educational and inspirational!"
Senior,5,Online classes are kind of a gamble. Some are amazing and others can be a nightmare. It really depends on the teacher.
Senior,5,Overall it a good school mainly because it affordable. It actually a great deal for the price compared to alot of other Universities.
Alum,5,"I was lucky enough to be in an excellent program with world - class professors which shaped my experience and learning opportunities. Before centering on my major, however, the general educational professors were average or less than mostly due to the fact that they followed mormon culture and rarely if ever left the state to gain experiences and any form of diversity or adversity."
Senior,5,"If you can motivate yourself to keep up to date and turn in assignments and exams on time the online portion is amazing. Pure academics with a realistic atmosphere. The material is there and the professors are very willing to answer questions, especially if you’re on track to turn things in early. They will work with you until you receive the grade you desire. Online is the way to go. Avoid the parking and tardy scene by taking classes online. Not necessarily at your pace though, remember that. There are due dates. Pay strict attention to the due dates and set alarms."
Sophomore,5,"Weber State University is a diverse and welcoming campus, with a warm staff and a wonderful student body. Weber has excellent professors who excel in their field of work, creating a productive, hands-on experience for their students. This university offers a top of the line education, where each staff member cares about their students individually and takes a personal interest in their success. They also have excellent leadership as well, with an administrative staff who reaches out to students and educates them of the latest updates to keep them safe and informed. They never fail to prioritize the well-being of each individual, no matter what part they play on campus. Overall, Weber State University is a superb example of a top-tier university, which has an outstanding academic program with a talented staff and student body."
Sophomore,5,Weber State University is a fantastic school! It offers a large variety of courses and the teachers are personable and friendly. This school and its administrators do all they can to help students succeed.
Junior,5,Online/distant education friendly school. Campus is gorgeous and I recommend going even if you can take online classes. Very affordable. Great location.
Junior,5,"Have taken all of my classes online, but have gone to campus for resources, advising, events. Love the online portal and class setup. So easy to use. Teachers have been great about communication and support for those online. Especially helpful during the Covid time."
Freshman,5,"I really like how the college is by itself, and also the teachers. The teachers helped me through a lot of my homework whenever I needed a hand. I was very open to my teachers because I knew I would get help from them."
Freshman,5,Weber state is a wondering college and one the colleges with great opportunities and professional teachers who really help and take time to help their students.
Sophomore,5,My online experience was what any college student would expect. I wouldn't say it was easy but it was doable. The professors pushed me to do my best and I learned all the material I needed in those courses that I took. The professors are very good at getting back to their students and helping them succeed.
Sophomore,5,I love attending Weber State University because it has given me easy access to receive the education I have always wanted. Weber State is excellent at communicating and gives me the assistance I need to be successful in reaching my goals. All the professors I have had the privilege of having have been nothing short of amazing. They helped me to receive the grades I wanted by pushing me to be my best and go out of my comfort zone. To me an excellent university is Weber.
Senior,5,"I did my classes online. The format was easy to follow. The professors were ready to help, gave timely feedback and extra pointers to be successful in fulfilling the assignments. So far, a very good experience."
Senior,5,Really like the format of the online classes.  The university really handled the virus situation well in moving all classes online timely and regarding everyone's safety. Taking the tests at the test center was convenient and easily accessible. Teachers have been great in providing extra material with the online course for better understanding.
Freshman,5,super good! i mean the professors all have their own way of teaching but the main way of how the inline classes worked was good
Senior,5,"I give Weber State University 5 stars simply because I feel like they’ve done everything they could during this pandemic and the transition to online classes. That being said, I always try to avoid online classes."
Sophomore,5,I didn't take any classes online. But I know many people who did and they loved their experience. They said the teachers were super easy to contact and get the help if they needed it.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman it is hard to give a full rating of a school I'm going to be at for 4 years, however, after a full semester I have learned enough to know how amazing Weber State is! You feel welcomed from your very first day and there is no sense of ""cliques"" between classes (i.e. freshman and junior). All of the students are there to learn and get their degree, not mess around. All of the teachers are there to teach the students and help them not further their research. The professors are amazing and are always willing to help you. The staff is always very helpful as well. The curriculum is interesting and no-nonsense. The events are fun and the Weber State Spirit is high! Go Wildcats!"
Senior,5,My time here with Weber State University start from 2013. There have been up and down when I first start here but the professors here did not give up on me and so does the advisors who help me through the hard time I have in this university. They also provide the best education for my field and focus on my academic more. I would recommend future students to come here to be a part of this university life.
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful. The admissions office is so great and helpful. Everyone is so nice. One thing I would like to see at Weber State is a beach volleyball program.
Sophomore,5,This school has been easy to work with. I love their campus. Their teachers and staff are kind and caring. I felt like my voice was heard.
Freshman,5,Weber State is an all around great school.  It has an atmosphere that is warm and welcoming.  It is easy to navigate and find your way around.  The academics are diverse and are easy to come by.   The area around Weber State has a lot to offer for extracurricular activities.
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my time at Weber State. The professors are genuine and work really hard to help their students succeed!
Alum,5,"Phenomenal science programs and professors, beautiful campus, minimal commute time, and great affordability."
Niche User,5,The class sizes are small so the professors are very interactive with their students. The counselors are very helpful in choosing classes and helping you get to your intended degree. The campus is beautiful and the students are all very friendly and welcoming.
Alum,5,"I graduated from an online program at Weber State.  The degree was very well organized and supported.  I highly recommend Weber State online curriculum, whether to complete a degree, take some prerequisite courses or class refreshers.  Professors are very willing to work with you and truly want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,"I went to Weber State to get my Associates Degree and it was an excellent choice in terms of finances because it is a cheaper college. It was definitely not the ""college experience"" as I lived with my parents so I could get my degree as cheap as possible and I was a current enrollment student. It was an excellent choice for my degree though because it was easy to get and the courses were varied on how I could get the degree that I did. I would definitely recommend it for a two year college if your looking for something that can be a good stepping stone or if you are wanting to experience college."
Sophomore,5,Weber state is a great school that offers a variety of majors and helpful counselors to help you achieve chosen major. Great campus full of friendly people. Weber state is passionate for your success and the tuition is affordable!
Sophomore,5,"Weber State is a fantastic stepping-stone school for propelling forward, whether that be starting a trade job or moving on to graduate school. The professors are wonderful, but pack good walking shoes; the campus is sprawling on a hill! :)"
Niche User,5,"as an early college student on the Davis campus, i really enjoy Weber state. i know there are much more resources on the main campus in Ogden but Davis still has quite a bit of resources"
Senior,5,Weber is a great school and they offer many great programs. I love weber due to the fact that they are so diverse and do work in online applications.
Alum,5,"Weber State University is a great College to attend. They have several campuses, all of which are good places to attend classes. The majority of the teachers are wonderful and do what they can to help you succeed in their class. Weber is a fairly easy school to get into and they have a ton of great programs."
Niche User,5,Very helpful staff and an amazing amount of resources! I feel like I matter here! Definitely a great beginning university
Junior,5,"I love Weber! It has been an amazing school for me. It can get a bad reputation for being a 'commuter' school, meaning that very few students live on campus. However, I have not had this negatively impact me. I would consider it one of the most quality schools in Utah after comparing to others experiences. Their early college program helped me get a head start in life and academics."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes have been online this semester. Many professors have handled the situations phenomenally and are still making their best efforts to bring students the educations they deserve. However, some professors make it difficult to learn because not enough information is included in their online, no video ""lectures""."
Junior,4,"Most of my professors are on top of making online learning more achievable, however there is still some curves that I have faced with online learning."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed how proactive they are with recent events, most of my professors work with their students."
Sophomore,4,"My instructors are all working hard to give us information on learning online. I think it is good all around, there is always room for improvement though."
Freshman,4,I love WSU! The student body is welcoming and I've been able to meet so many amazing people! Class sizes are not too large and professors want me succeed!
Senior,4,"I have been with Weber State in their since 2017 through their early college programs. There have been ups and downs with various professors, but overall I feel that I am being well educated for my career path once I found the staff that I loved."
Senior,4,"My overall experience has been pretty dang good at Weber State. The Professors ( from my personal experience ) all genuinely care about their students. For areas of improvement, I wish the college would expand its counseling services to students, as well as diversify its faculty and staff."
Senior,4,Weber State has interesting classes and people. The duck pond is especially nice to view and the hiking trail above campus is also great if you want a break. The school has a lot of resources for learning and if you struggle with math they have the perfect building for you to get help.
Sophomore,4,I have been taking online courses for a couple years and overall teachers are readily available and eager to help.
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my learning experience at Weber State. An relatively affordable 4 year college. It is located close to the mountains with plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy.
Freshman,4,I only have a few courses online. The teachers respond in a timely manner when I email them with questions. Overall a good experience.
Sophomore,4,"Weber is inexpensive compared to the rest in Utah. Most professors are nice and willing to work with you. They have many amazing resources here and they want to help you succeed. I wish there were more parking spaces though. It's a struggle to find parking in the mornings unless it is at the Dee Event Center. Not many food options, which is a little annoying"
Senior,4,"I loved how easy the registration process was, but I do not like how their scolarships are ran. The scolarships were not always handed out fairly and the fafsa office was very slow to respond. They often did not how to answer my questions."
Senior,4,I have had some good and some bad experiences with online classes. It is very important to put in the effort and make time for the class since online classes are easy to push off. Teachers are great help though.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that the class sizes are small and that the teachers are willing to talk to students. They also have lots of activities, however, they do not do the best at advertising most of the activities."
Sophomore,4,"The switch from face-to-face learning to online learning was weird, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to me on that. Despite that, the professors were very flexible and open to help make this transition as smooth as possible, and they were very open to constructive criticism as to how we could make the most out of the class content, and still being able to get a good grade in class. They were very flexible on the way you could turn things in and deadlines, and although now that we're all getting more used to this whole situation, maybe things will solidify a little bit, but I don't things will change much from that. The one thing, is that in my experience there can be a couple of professors that can seem hard headed, and aren't as willing to flex around the students, but that's only every now and then."
Sophomore,4,"I love attending Weber State! It has an amazingly friendly environment and the programs and people are great! The campus isn't huge so getting from class to class isn't as hard as it can be in other bigger campuses, yet still providing the same level of opportunity of learning. Also, the professors are very friendly and many times flexible. In addition, class sizes are small most of the times, and the professors are very open for office hours. The advantage that tutoring has is also great, that way I always get the help I need. Athletics and clubs are awesome, but the only thing I would say is that I wish there was more public events in which you can go out and hang out with friends. Other than that, Weber State is the way to go!"
Junior,4,Weber is the third college I have attended in my college career and it has many pro's and cons to it. The first pro is that the college is very friendly and provides a wonderful student life program. This creates a more inclusive and welcoming student body which is really nice to have when your away from home. The con is that the general administrations is not very organized and have made multiple mistakes with my roommates and myself.
Junior,4,I have not need to attend the online experience for Weber State University . I assume it is similar to any other college online school. I do know though that video is a huge part of online courses at weber which can be really helpful.
Alum,4,The campus was close to home and I didn’t have to pay to live away from home. I was able to enjoy activities in campus and get to my classes with ease without the added expense.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy being at Weber State. The campus is nicely kept, the buildings are relatively new and contain helpful resources for students. Faculty and staff are dedicated to helping students get the most out of their experience at the school. There are many activities and clubs to join. There isn't a ton of diversity in students though."
Junior,4,"It's a good school. It can be difficult to find the advisors or information about programs that you need, but once you do they are amazing to work with. Many professors truly care about your success and try to make the concepts accessible."
Alum,4,"An excellent price with a surprisingly large amount of excellent professors. Speaks being inclusive and diversity, however, being in a state like Utah it is difficult to achieve this. There are professors with numerous complaints of sexual harassment and racism that aren't dealt with."
Junior,4,I like Weber State because the classes have been very flexible in light of the recent disturbances in our society. Instructors and administration have been very transparent and helpful during this time.
Junior,4,"All of my classes have been moved to online only but despite this instructors have been very helpful with students, getting them the help they need."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes through Weber State University are of high quality. Oftentimes, online classes are thought to be less informative than the face-to-face experience, but Weber’s online classes offer a very hands-on approach. The quality of the curriculum is not decreased behind the screen. In recent events of the COVID-19 pandemic, Weber State has handled the challenge quite well, but most admirably, the transition of classes from the physical to the virtual format. Although difficult, classes were carried out through the remainder of the year in such a way that the material was distributed and received by each student, still allowing them to learn and reach academic success. Weber State University is most definitely a great choice to achieve a fulfilling online experience."
Senior,4,"Online professors are so easy to work with. They do not hesitate to message you back or give feedback when asked. The curriculum is designed to be very easy to follow, and it is."
Senior,4,"I love the change of pace that I experienced here. I came from a large city, but Weber State, despite still being a fairly large university, is much calmer and down to earth. Despite the population, it is still very diverse. They care deeply about the students."
Junior,4,All of my classes were moved to online during COVID and the teachers were great at working with each student to make sure we were succeeding in the class. I haven’t taken any online courses start to finish.
Junior,4,It is a good school that is affordable and allows me to live at home while attending school. I have had mostly amazing professors accept for one who was brand new. My professors have been great for working with me during their office hours and helping me really grasp the subjects and perform well in their classes. The campus is a decent size but small enough that I’m not walking miles on end to get to class. Parking is kind of horrible though
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have enjoyed my online learning experience at Weber. Most teachers go above and beyond and make sure they are always available to help students with any questions or concerns they have with the online courses."
Freshman,4,It was so good. Not the most party school but then again if you going to college to party then why are you there
Senior,4,The only thing that truly diminishes my experience at Weber State University is parking. The solution is to just go a bit earlier!
Sophomore,4,I love Weber. Everyone is super nice and willing to help. They make is easy to ask for help and get the help that you need.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere and staff members. The student body is filled with student wanting to learn, explore outdoor adventures, and grow together as a community."
Freshman,4,"No one enjoyed making the switch to remote learning, however all of my professors did so with a positive and enthusiastic attitude. All of my professors were more than happy to help students in anyway they could even if it were with something personal like needing a ride to a store."
Freshman,4,"I took two of my 5 classes online this semester. Both classes were structured very differently. One was structured with powerpoints, lots of book reading, unlimited retakes on quizzes, and then two movie reviews and an exam per each section of the class. This class was very easy but I didn't feel like I learned a whole lot since the quizzes could be retaken multiple times. 

The other class was based on video lectures, quizzes, papers, and an exam at the end of each section. I personally liked the way this class was set up. The only thing I disliked was how long the video lectures were. They were always under an hour per segment but the teacher seemed to go over the same ideas in excess and you could not skip through the lectures. 

However I did very well in both classes and both teachers were very nice and responsive."
Sophomore,4,"Weber State is a great school in an otherwise rather poor area. Housing in Ogden is incredibly expensive for low-quality places, and Ogden itself is rather unappealing. Weber State is definitely the highlight of the town. While some of my classes have been hit and miss, the quality of education you'll get here is one of the best deals in the western United States."
Senior,4,Very good University! Class sizes are fantastic! Staff is very helpful and set you up to succeed. Student life is fun and there are lots of opportunities to join various clubs. Parking is an issue.
Sophomore,4,Weber State is a really great college that is smaller and more affordable than most colleges that still gives great opportunities and chances to learn and get the best education. It’s also a great community where everyone is welcome and can be very social if you get involved and there’s a ton of opportunities to join clubs and groups.
Junior,4,It is a very diverse school with lots of learning opportunities. I feel like the faculty cared about me and my education. I am glad I decided to attend this university.
Sophomore,4,"Easy access, lots of student activities to be involved in, open campus, great mountain views and invested faculty and staff."
Junior,4,"My Experience at Weber was a wonderful one. The school grew an atmosphere that one who would be nervous about school would not have to worry. My Teachers were always willing to help me, with whatever work I had. The campus clubs and programs were greatly encouraged for the school. I was able to run and be apart of most of these clubs."
Senior,4,"The atmosphere totally is good, some building need to remodel because they are super old, they should have a better process to hire professors, they have not many great teachers there, parking lot sucks the need to build multi-story car parking to help students because it causes anxiety and it has been there forever, not very diverse majority are white. I haven't seen any bad behavior to remember, the food is not really good"
Junior,4,"Weber State University is very underrated. It has up-to-date facilities and great professors. It has a wide variety of degrees at affordable prices.  It has a convenient location between Salt Lake City and Logan, Utah.  If you are looking for social life, you might want to keep looking. It has lots of social events, it's just that most of the students that go there commute from home. I think it is a great school."
Senior,4,I love the professors and how they work with you ( biased towards Lindquist Hall). What I absolutely dislike is the lack of parking and having a beautiful campus but unable to fully enjoy it due to geese poop being EVERYWHERE. We'd hang around on campus if it wasn't full of literal crap.
Niche User,4,I have not attended that school but when I go to events they are all well organized and they are very fun. When people are outside they are always so positive. People are very welcoming.
Sophomore,4,"I love Weber State University! They have great academics but I think the student life is lacking. This has to due with WSU being a commuter school but for the students who live on campus, there isn't much to do."
Niche User,4,I like the availability of college courses to high school students and I would love to see even more classes open up for the high schools.
Freshman,4,Weber State has a lot of very welcoming people. Which was what made the transition from being a high school student to being a college student a lot easier. The professors and even the students helped make sure that I was all set to start my first semester there. I think that I wouldn't change anything about the school! I am a out of state student. I am from California but I decided to go to Utah.
Freshman,4,"I like that I can go to any Weber State campus for libraries or testing centers. I can also take classes at multiple locations. The weather can be extreme due to the proximity of the mountains, but the view is amazing. So far, I've loved every one of my professors."
Freshman,4,This school has a lost cost along with great teachers and lots of resources to help you along the way. They look for your best interests.
Freshman,4,"A great school with fantastic faculty, facilities, and student services. My only complaint is that living on campus requires you to purchase a meal plan, which is going to cause me to stay off campus next year."
Freshman,4,"I love Weber State University. Because they want students to succeed they offer a large variety resources to help students reach their potential. Academic advisors are so encouraging, knowledgeable and willing to help any time. The professors that I have had are very easy to work with and also have a genuine interest in student success."
Niche User,4,Attended Weber from 1997 - 1999.  I studying Public Relations Communications Degree.  Also involved with  Student Activities .  Great college experience overall during my time at the University. The Professors are top notched in the Communications Department.
Junior,4,I have like everything about my experience at Weber State so far. The students and faculty are amazing. I love all of the activities they have available for both education and socializing. The only thing I would change is offering more class times. There are very few options when creating a schedule each semester and it makes having a job very difficult since there are very few choices.
Sophomore,4,"I really loved just about everything at Weber. I did not live on campus, but from what I heard, the dorms were, for the most part, awesome. I absolutely love the campus itself. It's not the biggest campus in the world, so walking around is kept to a minimum. It is in a beautiful location on the mountain and the scenery is amazing. Weber is continuously building new buildings and taking good care of the old ones as well. The on-campus food is incredible. It blows my mind how good it is actually. The only thing I would like to change, some of the professors are mean and unfair, which is terrible for a college student. Of course, not every professor is this way, but so far, every semester I have attended I have had a teacher that rubbed me the wrong way. Other than that, I really love Weber State University."
Freshman,4,"One thing that I love about Weber is the flexibility of courses that will work with your schedule. I have been able to take online and in person classes with ease and the staff is so willing to work with you. The one thing I wish Weber had was more events and activities to unify the commuter school. That being said, it is a commuter school so I understand the difficulty in uniting the school and creating university pride."
Alum,4,"I like that Weber State offers quite a few concurrent enrollment options for high school students.  They can save a lot of money in tuition by earning college credit in high school.  It is also a nice campus, good sized but not overwhelming, with a fair amount of recent upgrades to the facilities.  I wish they had an actual baseball team with at least partial scholarship opportunities rather than a pay-to-play baseball-career-ending program they have now.  Even community colleges offer real baseball programs that are legitimate stepping stones to moving on in the sport and I feel a four year university should be able to at least match that."
Freshman,4,Weber State University is an awesome institution. The class sizes are reasonable and the education for price is awesome. The main campus is up by the mountains and is gorgeous all year round.
Sophomore,2,"All their classes are due on Fridays, which means you have to rush all your homework in at the last minute. (I worked so I didn't have time during the week)
Also, professors were impossible to reach.
I recommend taking an online class if it is easy for you. If you want to learn anything or be able to ask questions, just do in-person."
Sophomore,2,"I go to WSU for STEM and all I can say is: DON'T. Their math department sucks (I cannot stress that enough. If you do go here, go to local OWTC or DTC for your math!) and gets worse every year.

WSU also doesn't offer very many night classes for those who work during the day. They just expect you to pay for tuition with student loans or off your parents' dime (in this economy???)"
Freshman,2,"I spent my freshman year at WSU.  The overall culture was mainly LDS church involvement.  Athletics were difficult to break in to because the coaches didn't want ""outsiders"".  Most students went home on the weekends so it was difficult to build an out-of state community.  The professors were ok, but didn't really seem to connect with the students.  I transferred after freshman year."
Sophomore,2,"I am an Early College Student with Weber State University and Northern Utah Academy for Math, Engineering, and Science.  I take about 12 credits per semester trying to complete my General Studies Associate's Degree.  I am not the biggest fan of Weber State's classes, because the majority of the professors are pretty good, but treat you as more of a number than a student.  The parking is absolutely terrible with probably 80% of students commuting to the Weber, you would think there would be enough parking.  I have to show up 2 hours early to get a parking spot that isn't even that close to the campus.  I will not be continuing my education at Weber because I don't feel like my education really matters."
Freshman,2,"Weber State is a great school for the college student living at home. It is relatively cheap and a degree from a college is worth a lot. However, the student involvement, growth opportunities, and quality of education are very poor."
College Junior,2,People don't go to Weber state for their sports nor does the school revolve around it and frankly I'm quite glad about that. Schools revolving around sports is for high schools and often distracts from proper funds going to benefitting learning.
College Sophomore,2,No social environment. Very small Campus Housing section. Mostly only for foreigns or out of state residents.
College Sophomore,2,Sororitys wasn't really big thing at weber. I only heard of one and it only had about 15-20 females and as far as I'm aware of Weber did not have any frats. I've always been interested in joining a sorority though. Seems like it would be a good way to make friends and to be involved
College Freshman,2,Athletic facilities are not that great we also have a major lack of school spirit.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Life here at Weber State is not big at all compared to other schools. There are no national frats, so it is just with the school, which doesn't really build the connection that most people join frats for."
College Sophomore,2,i really dont know how to answer this one
College Senior,2,When our football team won one game it was a surprise
College Junior,2,If you want a party school Weber State is not for you. Weber State is a dry campus and off campus partying happens but rarely.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like Weber State has some school spirit, but not a whole lot compared to other schools in Utah. I rarely hear of students going to the football and basketball games to support our school"
College Freshman,2,This college is more like an extension of high school. It definitely doesn't have the typical college atmosphere.
College Junior,2,"There are some phenomenal professors, which I'm sure is true for any school. Weber State DOES have a great Honors program that offers around 8 honors courses each semester, designed and taught by Weber State professors on very narrow subjects. The courses (and therefore the professors) change each semester. There are several professors that usually teach every semester. These have been by far my favorite classes, and are always taught by the ""Cream of the Crop"" at Weber State. 

However, for those students seeking a challenge, small class sizes, the dorm experience, Greek life, or the ""college experience"" most high-achieving school seniors are craving and ready to have, there could be fewer WORSE places than Weber State. I lived in the dorms my first year, and an apartment my second year. I am going into my third year. There is only one set of dorms on campus. They were not near full capacity, with many empty rooms, mostly athletes who were there because of scholarship money. Not very many mainstream kids. There is NO Greek life, or fraternity/sorority life whatsoever. The part of Ogden that Weber is in is pretty run-down, with pretty terrible roads (aside from Harrison and Washington), large portions of Ogden are neighborhoods where the majority of people live well below the poverty line. Often ESL factory workers. Harrison Blvd is not a pretty street to drive. Many old businesses. By far the nicest grocery store nearby is 5-miles via a 45mph road, and is a 24-hour Walmart Neighborhood Market. All the rest look like, on both the inside and outside, they were built in the 80s. Notwithstanding, the worst thing by far, about Weber State University, is that it is largely a commuter school, with a 100% acceptance rate, and where over 50% of the student population are non-traditional students (over age 25, married, employed, parents, etc.). Campus is a ghost town after 1pm every day, and is dead on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."
College Freshman,2,"Weber does not give out enough academic scholarships. I have a 4.0 as a full-time student in difficult classes, but still only receive $750 a semester. There is very little motivation to achieve excellence at this school as a result."
College Junior,2,"I went over credit hours and made me get a course schedule and gave me a run around and ended up with no more financial aide to finish my Bachelors degree. There are people on campus that are going to get their 2 nd bachelors, and now cannot get my first one."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid/scholarship office is difficult to work with and they take their time responding to questions.  If you want something answered, it is better to go their in person."
College Senior,2,"No one talks about campus crime, so we all pretend that it's not there. The campus police are only seen in the parking lot handing out parking tickets."
College Freshman,2,"The did not give me one time than I needed to get that figured out. I wanted one on on time wiith a counselor , but get never fit it his busy schedule."
College Freshman,2,I rarely if ever heard about Greek life on campus
College Junior,2,"Because it's not a huge school, most of the students lilve off campus so nobody cares about sports"
College Senior,2,"I have never personally seen or heard of Greek Life on campus in any way, but I have a friend who is supposedly in one of the Fraternities and talks about his ""brothers"" often."
College Senior,2,"There really isn't a party scene unless you have friends that enjoy partying (and even that usually takes place off campus). Because it is a commuter school, the party scene is nearly nonexistent."
College Senior,2,"I'm pretty sure Greek life is nonexistent,  which is sad. Would have been fun!"
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't think there is a reasonable part scene at our school. All the party people terrible to hangout or be around and the rest of the people wouldn't party if it paid them.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Everyone is married, and therefore, for some reason, don't care for being outgoing or having an extensive social life with other students."
College Freshman,2,The nursing program is one of the top rated in the nation. Super competitive.
College Student,2,I don't know if we even have Greek students. I haven't heard anything about them.
College Student,2,There isn't much to do in Ogden. It's pretty boring. If you want to have fun you have to be creative and do it yourself.
College Student,2,"The parking is horrible and expensive. There is no shuttle and sometime you have to park far away. I think the only public transportation that is offered in the area is the bus. Utah has some great public transportation options but they do not run up by the campus. IE tracks and front runner but they only travel north and south not east and west, and the campus is located on the east side."
College Freshman,2,They should consider having more parking spots around campus if they are going to continue charging for parking.
College Freshman,2,It is hard to find a parking spot around the entire school not just certain places.
College Student,2,Too expensive and exceedingly sh***y. Everything breaks and it takes a battle to get it fixed.
College Student,2,"Permits are expensive, especially since it's so difficult to find decent parking after 9am."
College Student,2,I don't like when classmates smell of cigarettes and the smokers tend to gather in large groups in main areas of congestion for going to classes.
College Student,2,"My parents make too much money for me to be able to get and grants or help from FAFSA. You must be a fulltime student and they don't give out very many. I would like there to be a generational scholarship as I'm the 4th generation to attend Weber. My great grandfather paid for part of his school by carrying a cattle on his back, and my grandpa was part of the student body."
College Student,2,"I wish it was easier to get in, or that they were able to accept more students at a time."
College Freshman,2,If it is snowing or raining because it makes you late for class.
College Freshman,2,"No one really talks to each other, if you try to make friends most will ignore you."
College Freshman,2,"Lot's of labs, the WiFi is awful."
College Freshman,2,Weber State's sports teams are awful.
College Freshman,2,"I don't live in the dorms and I don't know anything about the meal plans or how late/how much the food in the dorms are; but the dining actually on campus is not the best. There is a little variety, and it is pretty good food, but there isn't much and it is very overpriced for the quality of food that it is. There aren't many different dining places and they have quite small menus."
College Junior,2,"WSU financial aid is one of the most disorganized things I've ever had to deal with. They take away financial aid without giving notice--and I have nearly straight A's, with a 3.8 gpa. It seems like they try whatever they can to deny financial aid, they don't post scholarship/financial aid application deadlines anywhere easily accessible, and if you're trying to get residency it's an absolute nightmare. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little variety, all chains, very few open late. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few places that stay open past midnight, not many clubs or bars."
College Junior,2,It was way to expensive never parking and way to far from classes.
College Freshman,2,"I was bullied a lot since the beginning of the semester, and I've only been here for one semester. I had so much trouble meeting people here; I only really know people in my seminar-based classes. Other than that, the classes are good, and I love how the professors show a lot of interest in their fields of study. That's pretty much it, though."
College Senior,2,hardly any greek life at all
College Senior,2,The wifi sucks! It takes me anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes to connect to the weak wifi. The 'secure' or faster speed takes even longer and doesn't remember my computer. I have to log in every time I close my computer. It really sucks. 
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, I have no idea if they even have any Greek life there..."
College Sophomore,2,I don't think very many people go to the games...
College Sophomore,2,"There are only a few buildings of on-campus housing, because WSU is such a commuter school. From what I've heard, people like living there in University Villa."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much going on. I don't know much, though, because that isn't really my scene."
College Sophomore,2,"Weber State is  commuter school, so there really isn't much going on, and most of the students don't live very near campus."
College Freshman,2,It's Utah. There is no nightlife.
College Sophomore,2,Little or no activities are presented by the school. Those who seek a social night life have to leave campus area and search the city.
College Sophomore,2,"There are many small useless classes required to take, delaying from achieving their majors faster. "
College Sophomore,2,There is little or no options for fast food. They center their foods in local and school guided meals. 
Niche User,1,"My only knowledge about Weber State is of Scott Senjo, who went viral for his bigoted comments in which he said ""If I was the cop, you wouldn't be able to tweet"". He said this in response to a member of the press who was attacked by police officers during the recent George Floyd protests. His membership on the faculty of Weber State speaks volumes about the institution I would have not otherwise heard of. The association of this institution and such a violent, educator is shameful."
Niche User,1,"AWLFUL! I took two classes I needed to transfer into a program I have been waiting FOREVER to finally get into. Weber wrote me off as a NON RESIDENT! They are sending mail to my house, yet keep changing the charges. Now I can't afford to pay for the out of state tuition and the new transfer program. Thanks alot assholes. AVOID!"
College Sophomore,1,"We don't really have a ""greek life""."
College Freshman,1,They really don't do a lot. I don't hear anything from them.
College Freshman,1,"I lived in the dorms, but I have heard that good housing is difficult to find off campus."
College Freshman,1,The food is crazy expensive and often unhealthy.
College Sophomore,1,"Weber State doesn't have a party scene. It's not a huge deal to me because I'm not really into that, but it'd be nice every now and then. It'd help to create a more social environment on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"The food on campus is awful. It's greasy, cold, and extremely unhealthy. Even when they try to be healthy, it's way too expensive and not good. Something with a better selection of fruit, vegetables, protein bars, REAL sandwiches, and good salads would be a better option. I usually just leave campus and go to the Great Harvest nearby."
College Junior,1,"Its not a Party college, its a Mormon College, Mormons don't know what partying means. But they know about making babies."
College Senior,1,"If you want to party, you have to look extremely hard to find it. It's a commuter school and most of the students are parents with young kids or even grandparents. There's no parties."
College Junior,1,"The Greek Life here is not even nationally affiliated.  They're local organizations that are not Pan-Hellenic.  If you're looking to be a true Greek, then Weber State is not the place for you."
College Freshman,1,I was not born here financial aid and FABSA are not things i could apply to.
College Sophomore,1,"Housing is terrible. It costs at least twice as much as an apartment and no one is helpful. In my experience, I ended up going through some situations that made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe. Housing did nothing to help me and hurt my credibility when I attempted to leave."
College Freshman,1,"Weber State is a commuter school, but has nowhere near enough parking to accommodate this fact."
College Sophomore,1,"It is impossible to be vegan on campus, all the food is over priced and terrible. "
College Freshman,1,North Ogden is one of the worst places to live.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am unable to receive financial aid because of my parent's income. This is upsetting because although they earn a great deal of money, I have to pay for school by myself."
College Junior,1,Lets be quite frank this is Utah and it is a very religious culture and so the nightlife is really all in salt lake city. 
College Freshman,1,There really is no nightlife for Weber State. I do believe it's primarily because it's a church (LDS) driven town it's located in and I'm sure a good chunk of the student's attending Weber are most likely LDS and aren't really big on the party/bar/club type scenes.
College Senior,1,"WSU cut their bussing system. It was good 3 years ago, but now it is more difficult because they pick up at stop and at top of hill, that's it."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Weber is an absolute nightmare. Permits cost much more than surrounding universities and they sell more permits than they have parking spaces for. If you want a cheap permit, you have to buy one for a building over 2 miles away from the campus and take the shuttle which often has lines wrapped around the parking lot causing many late students. This could all be fixed by building a parking structure on a couple of their campus lots. If possible, take transit."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek life at Weber State University, but that is ok with me  because that was never something I looked for in a school."
College Junior,1,"When going to school your mind should be set on academics not parking, but that is the battle everyone goes through in the morning."
College Freshman,1,I wish there was more to offer in the nightlife area in Weber or around campus in general. There are hardly any places to go and have a good night out.
College Senior,1,They have one shuttle root that isn't efficient and only stops at one place at campus. If you want to park and ride it you have to have a pass.
College Freshman,1,"Permit costs aren't bad. If you live on campus or right across the street from campus, a car isn't really needed, unless you have a job or other responsibilities. The availability for parking spaces is a joke. Unless it is during the holidays, the parking lot is ALWAYS full. Campus police sure do love to ticket people. I myself have never gotten a ticket, but I've heard it's a lot of money."
College Freshman,1,"DON""T GET CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING!! Just saying. No alcohol on campus they will bust you! They mean it when they say it's a dry campus. "
College Freshman,1,Dry campus sucks. Even if you are 21 you can't have alcohol on campus. But other than that it's fine.
College Sophomore,1,"The food on campus is expensive or unhealthy. But the biggest problem is that its not run well. The hours are really bad, like this week, most of the food court is closed, only one store is open at all, and it closes at 2pm."
College Junior,1,"Come Early – Weber state struggles to find room for more parking, so what they've done is you can pay more for a special parking area. However if you just pay for regular parking, you will want to make sure you miss the rush or you'll be waiting for hrs before you'll find any parking let alone any good."
College Senior,1,"The diversity is better than the surrounding area, but still not good. The majority of the students are LDS and in state or from a neighboring state. The  campus talks about diversity a lot and supports the diverse groups, but in traditional classes strong diversity is rare."
College Freshman,1,"Just bad – Ive lived in campus housing.  Last year I was in pt and every time it was windy outside I could watch  my room sway back and forward.  Students were constantly stuck in the elevators for hours and the staff. well lets just say they always wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  The new dorms cost more and are much smaller then the old.  Its barely enough room for one person.  There are many apartments around the school and its actually cheaper to do the apartments.  My fiance and I got a 2 bedroom apartment.  The apartment actually ended up saving us over 7400.  Had we of dormed.  We wouldnt have had enough financial aid to even pay for our books.  That is just plain sad. Sure the new ones are nice, but you pay to live there and at the end of the year they kick you out during finals. Good luck trying to study and take tests while your trying to move out as well. "
College Sophomore,1,Very Little Activity – Weber State does have some small greek life scenes. They appear only to recruit and have few parties.
College Sophomore,1,Really Not Good. Don't be conned into buying housing with the meal plan. You'll most probably regret it
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Say – theres Taco  Bell; the only place open 24/7 but is really far, like Burger King which closes at 11 and is entirely to far to walk to and since public transportation is a practically penance it makes it one less option if you're car-less just like any other place one can imagine."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Good – ...to say the least. I don't even know where to start from the Administration to the actual Dorm situations. Its like one bad joke after another, its so absurd."
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly Mormon – There's not much diversity in Utah much less for Weber State University however its hard to downplay how blatant this observation is, and one may find it even more difficult as the state is predominantly Mormon... Far too often it seems as though locals cross the line in their attempts to convert unsuspecting newcomers, and not to over exaggerate but they literally scour the campus attempting to convert anyone and don't take no for an answer which is can make for a pretty unwelcoming atmosphere regardless of how pleasant some people are around here."
College Junior,1,There is hardly no where to park and you pay through the roof for parking passes.
College Junior,1,Low Strictness Except for Parking – Campus police only worry about parking. Could care less about alcohol or drugs on campus.
College Freshman,1,YOU HAVE TO PAY 70.00 FOR A W PARKING PASS AND THERE ARE NEVER ANY AVAILABLE PARKING SPOTS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I HAVE HAD TO MISS 6 CLASSES THIS SEMESTER JUST BASTED ON PARKING. THE SCHOOL COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE PARKING ISSUE. IF YOU WANT A SPACE ARRIVE AT LEAST AND HOUR EARLY.

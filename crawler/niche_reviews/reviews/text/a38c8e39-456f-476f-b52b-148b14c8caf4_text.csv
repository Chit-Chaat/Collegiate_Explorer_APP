Junior,5,Learning online is so fun and easy with the professors at HLGU! They make every effort to help you learn!
Junior,5,I love earning a christian education while also getting my nursing degree. Amazing place and amazing people!
Freshman,5,This past semester due to COVID-19 classes were moving to online format so I had the opportunity to see how the school utilized their online classes. Classes had a smooth transition and professors were very flexible and helpful during this time. It was fun and easy.
Sophomore,5,I am currently in the LPN program and am taking classes for my RN. This i'd say is a mixture of online and on-campus learning. Their clinicals provide for multiple facilities.
Sophomore,5,I love HLGU! They are friendly and enjoy teaching as well as having faith in all of their students. I feel as though everyone is accepted here and has an oppotunity to succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I am a massive fan og Hannibal LaGrange! The campus is positively beautiful, the professors and administration care deeply about the student, and financial aid is readily available to all students."
Sophomore,5,"After only being here for a year so far, Hannibal-LaGrange has opened many doors for me and everyone that attends. They are very good as preparing you to step out into the real world."
Recent Alumnus,5,Our director of public safety is the former police chief in town and has a firm grasp on safety.
College Sophomore,5,The university is very strict when it comes to rules. They set the rules and they expect the students to follow them.
College Freshman,5,"Safety on campus is extremely important to the school. They make sure everyone is safe and knows where to go or who to call when they need help. On registration day, they give each student a student ID and let them know of safety precautions to take while living on campus. They have not had much campus crime in a long time. The students are usually respective of others belongings and there are rare cases of thievery occurring on campus. To me, I feel very safe this area and even more so on campus. They made me feel very at home and very comfortable knowing that they care about the students and are constantly looking out for them."
College Sophomore,5,We are expected to hold to the school's hand book on and off campus. We all knew the rules coming in so there is no excuse to violate any of them. They are all for our own safety.
College Sophomore,5,"We have cameras practically everywhere, so nothing is missed by the public safety department. Theft and violence aren't issues at our school. If someone gets hurt, its because they did something stupid on their own."
College Sophomore,5,No one does anything like that on our campus. Our campus is dry campus and a smoke free campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Our public safety is always ready to go if you need them, and are easy to reach through the texting system that has been set up, which also lets us know whenever school is canceled due to bad weather."
College Junior,5,"I am extremely happy with my program and given the opportunity to do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing. HLGU does a great job of connecting with the students. My professors really care about the success of their students. They are helpful and I know that I can always go to them for help if I need it. I know that this degree program will give my the necessary skills to be successful in a job after college. The only concern I have with finding a job after college would be that my school is small so it is not well known at all."
College Sophomore,5,The Christian environment of HLG is the greatest thing about it!
College Freshman,5,"I have not started the clinical part of my program but have taken all but one of the prerequisites and support courses required for the ASN program. I have had the chance to work with several professors involved with the program and have learned a lot of applicable information for my future. The professors do not accept sub-par work, and hold us to the same standards the health care facilities and nursing professors will when in the program."
College Freshman,5,I have not yet had an internship but plan to start one at the Harry S. Truman Veteran's Hospital using my mother as a connection.  I would like to get phlebotomy and lab experience before becoming a nurse. My mother works as a Medical Technologist in the lab at the V.A. and has had many struggles with nurses not understanding sample and culture collecting protocol and has advised that I know how other parts of a hospital work as it makes things run smoother for everyone and improves cooperation between coworkers..
College Sophomore,5,"Excellent security on campus. There are video cameras everywhere, and security guards that regularly patrol the whole campus. If you are coming in late, they will escort you if you desire, and their phone number is printed on the back of every student ID."
College Sophomore,5,"The Nursing Program at Hannibal LaGrange University is tough, but fair. You have access to some very knowledgable staff, most of whom have worked as Nurses and have real world experience in this field. The NCLEX pass rate for last years graduates was 100%. The teachers expect a lot out of you so that you will be competent and qualified when you graduate and are working."
Graduate Student,4,My classes haven't started yet but so far every person I have talked to in every department has been very helpful and very understanding
Graduate Student,4,My classes haven't started yet but all my classes will be online.  The process seems pretty easy to navigate
Freshman,4,One of the best things about Hannibal-LaGrange is the extremely welcoming atmosphere. The people are always kind and you car easily find friends if you are a new student. The professors work well with each student especially student athletes to make sure they are not over whelmed and stay on track with their school work. I would recommend Hannibal-LaGrange University to anyone interested in attending.
Freshman,4,If you are looking for a place to meet tons of super nice and interesting people while earning a degree then Hannibal-LaGrange University is it. The professor really works with you hands-on and the class sizes are way below 40. If you have struggles there is always tutoring in the library for free. This college has an amazing atmosphere that I don't think you would wanna miss out on.
Alum,4,"If you are ready to deal with professors and faculty who can be a bit over pushing of the Baptist religion then this school would be fine for you. The rules here are strict, but are told upfront but some still seem surprised when they get in trouble. Sports are average, but the people who play them can become lifelong friends!"
Sophomore,4,"I was under the impression that this school was a great Christian/Baptist school. There are many great aspects of this school, but as a whole this school isn’t predominantly Christian. I don’t know of ways to change this or to make it better. I was just disappointed after having high expectations. It is still a great school and I really enjoy all of my classes!"
Freshman,4,"HLG has strong academic programs.  The professors are professionals in their areas of study.  They have high expectations of their students, yet they are willing to go the extra mile to assists their students.  If I were to choose an area of improvement, I would like to see the athletic programs improved since 70%+ of the student body is made up of athletes."
Sophomore,4,"Hannibal-LaGrange University provides an outstanding education to all students. The professors not only value the student's academics, but also their personal well being.  Campus life provides excellent connections with other students, activities, and an all around feeling of home. Because HLG is smaller in size, students become acquainted quickly and form close-knit bonds that will likely last throughout life. There's always a variety of ways to get involved on campus that provide rewarding experiences. The distinctly Christian atmosphere has given me the chance to grow and strengthen my walk with Christ. HLG will forever be a place I call home and the memories I have made will stay with me always."
Sophomore,4,"Hannibal-LaGrange University has been a very good experience. I have met really interesting people, from different cultures and has open my world. However, the life on campus is not quite the best compared to other schools. If you are looking to party this is not the place. You will make great friends and may have really good times, but is very rare to party in here."
Graduate Student,4,This campus is filled with many different people from many different backgrounds. There is always someone to talk to and many professors who care about your well being and future. The campus is small but full of nice people and fun things to do.
Sophomore,4,Hannibal LaGrange is a great school for athletes as the student body is 90% athletes so the teachers are super cool working with you in regards to making up any work you miss due to being away for games and tournaments and the overall environment is just really nice.
College Sophomore,4,While some of the teams may not be the best they are still able to always draw a crowd of cheering fans. Coaches are nice and open to students who want to play.
College Freshman,4,The best thing at the college is the friendly atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"There are many positive factors including the flexibility of a tremendous godly staff.  The connections made on campus even for commuting students is very beneficial to studying and networking.  In addition, the job opportunities they start to line up even this close to starting school is wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the dorms, they are nice and clean. I have my own space and I feel connected with things that are going on at the campus."
College Senior,4,"It has been a rough few years, and also expensive, but the professors are very caring."
College Senior,4,The campus accomidations include a membership to the local YMCA/
College Senior,4,"Hannibal has a lot of charm, but feels like a small town. If you are used to city living, it is not the place for you"
College Senior,4,Our campus has a great sense of community and we are like a big family.
College Senior,4,My school tries it's hardest to uphold Christian standards. An honor code is signed before admission is granted.
College Senior,4,"The off campus dining options are mostly fast food, but are always clean and convenient."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is usually fantastic if you live in the newer buildings. We have one building that needs to be redone, but is otherwise very nice."
College Freshman,4,"The University is very accepting of anyone no matter who it is and what they believe or what race they are. They are all about just helping students with their future and their future careers. They have many foreign exchange students all over campus. Diversity is very encouraged.  The religion at this college is not specified to one kind of denomination. It is a christian, God- fearing college. The campus seems pretty conservative, it is hard to tell since I have not taking all of the classes yet. But every is very loving and cares about everyone no matter what race, sex, beliefs, or past life."
College Freshman,4,"Hannibal La- Grange University in located on a hill in Hannibal, Missouri. Hannibal is known for its beautiful scenery and historical places to visit. The Mark Twain Caves are located right outside of this town and many different schools and high schools travel from all over the region to visit these beautiful caves. There are other tourist attractions as well like the candy shop, the state's largest firework store, and the Mark Twain Dinner cruise. This whole area is family friendly and the stores are convenient and easy to find. Living or visiting here are both two really great options for anyone."
College Freshman,4,"Hannibal La-Grange has some wonderful athletes and athletic programs on campus. They do not have as many sport options as other larger campuses but for what sports they do have, the programs are great and the teams do well in competition. The fans are very supportive and the teammates and coaches are very supportive of not only the players or participants but also of other students that may have interest in a particular sport. It is very wonderful to see coaches excited about new players and who are so willing to work with them, despite the lack of skill and experience that comes with freshman or new players. Hannibal La-Grange is a truly friendly environment but nevertheless, they all work hard and get things done. That's why they are winners."
College Sophomore,4,Hardly anyone does drugs. The only way to pick out the people who have is to ask someone you've become close to who did. No one really does anything steadily. They just try things and then are done. Alcohol on campus is rarely an issue. We have room checks every week for cleanliness so if any contraband is on campus it's quickly found and disposed of. Drinking that happens off-campus is quickly heard about by administration and put a stop to.
College Sophomore,4,"Pullium and Fletcher are the newest and roomiest, but the other dorms have more logical storage options."
College Sophomore,4,Practically everyone goes to every game on-campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Hannibal is a tourist area for historians and bibliophiles. However, there are plenty of things to keep others entertained. There's mini golf and museums and parks and caves to explore. There's always some festival or other happening downtown and all that information can be accessed in a Hannibal Magazine found in virtually every building in town.  Quincy, Illinois is only twenty minutes away, and there's even more to do there with less tourists in your way."
College Sophomore,4,"After waiting a minute or two for school computers to log on, everything is smooth. Each student uses his or her ID number to access the school's wifi, and it is usually reliable. If you can't access internet, it means no one else on campus can, professors included. This happened once during a large snow storm. Otherwise wifi is reliable."
College Sophomore,4,"We all try and get along with the internationals and they are friendly to us as well and it makes it really easy and the ones who can speak English pretty well are the ones who speak the most, and try to help the ones who can't as well learn how to more."
College Sophomore,4,The athletes try their best to excel at their sport and the support from the school is phenomenal. Most of the students try to come out and support their fellow friends in their sport.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a few problems, but not too many to overlook the good things about the dorms. Some of the dorms are really old and in need of some renovations, but not huge ones."
College Sophomore,4,There is a nature trail that most people don't know about and it's really pretty during the seasons and fun to go on if you want a relaxing walk or a relaxing place to study outside when the weather permits it.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a lot of fun, and exciting to learn."
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school. I will admit I don't like some of the rules, but I have to deal with them and that's okay."
College Sophomore,4,It is very hard to notice any drug activity on campus. it is usually done off campus on the weekends
College Sophomore,4,"Our school, has a very good international program, and i am friends with many students from overseas, and play baseball with 6-10 international students
"
College Junior,4,"I enjoy being an Accounting Major at HLGU. I have been happy with the quality of my education and I love the small class sizes at my school, because the professors really get to know you and they are willing to help you succeed in any way that they can."
College Junior,4,"As an accounting major, I will have an internship either over the summer or during the school year. Hannibal LaGrange will help me find an internship around or near the city of Hannibal if I need help finding a place to intern, but I will more than likely find my own internship and complete it over the summer to fulfill my requirements. The internship will take up some time, but it will not be too much time in my opinion. It will be good experience for me."
Senior,2,I took some classes online and that really made a difference since I had more free time and i learned a lot out of them.
Senior,2,"I was in the nursing program at this college, and whenever you went in for help all that they would tell you is that it was all your fault. There were countless times when one of the teachers there would tell me that I needed to go on medication. I just wish that I knew that all that this nursing program cared about was their percentage on how many people passed the NCLEX exam the first time."
Freshman,2,It has a good Christian environment if that's what a person wants. However the program for my degree was to new and the teachers were not experienced enough to teach it yet.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some of the coaches are not good at their jobs, but they remain."
College Sophomore,2,"all one price, I can count on both hands the number of times I've been able to eat on campus this semester because of work and classes so it's really unfair and overpriced."
College Sophomore,2,"The classes would be great, except that the woman who runs the program and teaches most of the classes is horribly disorganized and so ruins schedules and sets graduation dates back for everyone."
College Sophomore,2,"You are basically on your own when it comes to transportation on and off campus
"
College Sophomore,2,"housing overall, is fairly decent. they have dorm style housing and apartment both on campus."
College Sophomore,2,we don't really have anything like that at our school
College Freshman,2,"Like any small town there arent many options. you have a few fast food places, and then a couple local joints. but other than that there is nothing really special"
College Freshman,2,"The school is located in Hannibal, Mo. In its hay day there was a lot to do, because it was a large tourist spot, and all the Mark Twain exhibits. but now, many of the stores are out of business, there aren't many attractions, and the town is very quiet. If you wanted something to do, you go would to Quiny, Ill or St. Louis."
College Freshman,2,"The rules and policies they have created, are strict. but they are strict for a reason, to prevent any of the students from destroying the school's or someone else's property, from harmful activities, from drinking and doing drugs, and just the all around protection of the student."
College Freshman,2,"There are only two options for eating on campus. The meals aren't horrible, but tend to be the same type of food over and over again."
College Freshman,2,Not many hot guys. Wouldn't rate this college in that department.
College Senior,2,"HLG represents 34 different countries so the style is very dynamic. Most if not 90% of campus are athletic students so athletic attire is expected. blue jeans and t-shirts are the average dress. No one dresses up ever. Im from central Indiana and dressing classy is the norm, casual is the norm there. Guys for the most part are gentleman. School is tiny so information gets around really quickly, can be a good thing, can be a bad thing."
College Senior,2,"Location, Location, Location – All dormitories are very close to facilties which is very convenient. There is also a coffee shop in the basement of one of the female dorms. Older dorms have serious renovations issues because they are from either the early 1900s or 1960s. School takes away scholarships if students decide to live off campus. Sometimes the campus is too small and actual apartments would be nice option. ""apartment style housing"" are actually little houses about 400-500 sq ft. very tiny for four people, not real apartments. New men's dormitories are awesome. full bath tub and nice leather couches in open lobbies. Private housing is $400 more a semester, not great but best option on campus and closest to sports complex, carroll mission center, and cafeteria. Housing process is easy and released in a timely manner."
Junior,1,Currently in the LPN Program at hannibal lagrange ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IT MONEY. Clinical Requirements is a JOKE..They revised it and claim that every student needs a 70% or above in certain classes to begin the clinical portion of the program YET there is a student that has a 65% in one of her required classes of 70% and she's in clinicals now??? So unfair!
Junior,1,"Not taking any online classes at hannibal lagrange, only in class courses. Currently enrolled full time."
Senior,1,"AWFUL SCHOOL. I hated my time here. Very few good teachers Outrageously expensive. hidden fees. Music and bible major get Special treatment and basketball players. ALL hypocrites. I am a Christian, this school pushed me further from God. Chapel is stupid, I learn nothing but that the director is full of himself. Food is disgusting, Not treated as an adult. Faculty gossips about the students. Public safety is a joke. all they do is give out tickets. All this school cares about is its image and money. Only thing I gained from this school is DEBT."
Alum,1,"This is a review from someone that did welland was an RA at this school.  The staff is a revolving door, most of the quality professors leave within a year or two of working there. The academics here are not good, there is no accountability for the professors and the bad ones do not change practices and the good ones leave.Student life is atrocious, there is rarely anything that the school puts on that has had any student input leading to very little student participation and interest. The discipline is arbitrary you may get a slap on the wrist for drug or alcohol related offences, but another student may get kicked out of the school immediately.  I would not recommend to anyone due to the high cost and array of other issues. They will not work with you in scheduling classes  whether that be because you were a transfer student or if they do not offer the specific courses you need for that school year. There is so much more I want to say but there is a 1000 character limit."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is only one ""Greek"" organization on campus, but it is a men's service organization."
College Sophomore,1,"half of the time they care more about their 'reputation' as hypocritical christains than the education that they are providing. this isn't church, it is a school."
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties on this campus.
College Sophomore,1,The food on campus is horrible and the times the cafe opens and closes is so inconvenient for athletes. I am poor because I have to buy food plus pay for a meal plan that I can't even use.
College Freshman,1,"Our cafeteria is awful. They serve lousy food, with low quality products. no creativity in the meal plans. It seems like we rotate on a 2 week schedule of the same things. Sometimes their meat is not cooked properly, causing sickness. And last year, it was even worse. but the only good thing about this cafeteria, is the people are a little bit nicer."
College Senior,1,It started out great but eventually I ended up running into pitfalls.  The advisor is rather rude and made me feel like I was of no importance to the school. But overall I guess that's the university experience.
College Sophomore,1,"Living off-campus is the best choice if you wanna take a break from school, but they do not like people living off-campus and all the internationals have to live on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"No fan support, no school spirit, athletics here are just made to have a sport. The only good stuff here are the soccer teams that goes to the nationals almost every year."
College Freshman,1,"No Public Transport – There are no buses and although some of the main fast food restaurants are close as well as walmart, you really do need a car to get places. It would be good if there was a bus to nearby Quincy or St Louis."
College Freshman,1,There is virtually no nightlife in this place. The campus is like a ghost town. Very little to do.

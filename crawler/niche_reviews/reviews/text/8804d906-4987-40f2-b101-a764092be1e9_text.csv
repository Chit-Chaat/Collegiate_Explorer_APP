Junior,5,Staff and professors are timely in their communications and interested in the students progress.  Online classes are structured well and the syllabus is easy to understand and follow.
Sophomore,5,"I am here as an ASL Interpreting major, and this program of study will train you the best way possible. The bible classes and professors are amazing! I'm thankful for the opportunity to attend here."
Junior,5,"I have loved being a student at Piedmont. One thing that is great is hoe the professors really care about the students. They are most always available to talk to or to get help. I also love the student life. I have made great friendship and living in the dorms is always fun! Altogether, I just enjoy the atmosphere."
College Junior,5,"I love Piedmont International University, because all of the professors that I've had so far are working towards the same goal no matter the subject. That goal is to train Christians to serve God in whatever field they enter."
College Sophomore,5,I had a great adviser who walked me through the process.  No problems.
College Senior,5,The financial aid has been great! They are very helpful and wiling to help you in any way possible. Amazing people. They have great scholarship awards available. I am very thankful for everything that they have done. I am thankful for all the financial aid that I have received.
College Sophomore,5,"No one uses drugs or alcohol it is a part of school policy, and no one wants to fry their brain cells. Now if there is one that does use drugs no one knows about it"
College Freshman,5,"The rules have their reasons.  For a Christian college, it is very relaxed."
College Freshman,5,"This school truly gives ""bang for the buck.""  My professors are absolute geniuses!"
College Freshman,5,Is it a lot of work?  OF COURSE!! But every college is!
College Senior,5,"My fellow students for the most part love and serve Jesus.  They are there to prepare themselves for their future and to grow as individuals.
They have purpose but still have a heart for fun and we have alot of fun.  Sports, games and family like activities.  If God is leading you there it is the only place to be."
Freshman,4,"It was good for the most part, some teachers weren’t compassionate enough to understand that not all technical stuff works all the time."
Sophomore,4,Piedmont has some great teachers and the cost of education is reasonably low compared to some other.  You don't lose quality of education because of the low cost and that is very important.  I researched for a month comparing and I am very happy with my choice.
Sophomore,4,"I personally love the closeness of the school because everyone knows everyone. My teachers are great and they actually care about our well-being in and outside of the classroom. The food is not great, but they are working on it because they have been listening to the student's comments. Overall, I love it and plan on staying all four years of my degree."
Sophomore,4,"PIU strives to cultivate a unified campus focused on Christ. They allow one to strive to reach their best qualities and to grow in both knowledge and in their relationship with Christ. While they are still working on ways to grow and make their campus and facilities better, it is a God-honoring school, bringing young adults up in a way that is honoring to God."
Freshman,4,Piedmont International University is a smaller school but they try hard to provide a quality and affordable education for their students. I personally enjoy many of the classes and the Christ centered education.
Sophomore,4,Everyone who works with this school care deeply for their students to succeed! The Professors are well educated and really care about their students. You can see the love for Christ the people here have.
Graduate Student,4,Piedmont International University is a great small Christian university.  It has low cost and a good number of online options to make learning flexible for the student.  Most faculty are adjunct professors who teach at several different colleges or have other fulltime jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"Students have been told multiple times of people being straight of the college as it has reputation for producing people who are willing to work hard in their careers and have integrity. The college prepares the student as well as it is able for the career field he or she will enter. As the college is small, it has limited options available; however, with what is offered, it is offered with quality."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors truly do try to help each and every student with individualized attention if needed. They are not strict to the point of being overly harsh, and they are there for the purpose of seeing us succeed. Quality information is given to us in the courses, and we learn critical thinking skills as well as material on the subjects we love."
College Sophomore,4,"This college is less expensive than others; however, the rooms provided within the dormitories are spacious and enough to accomodate two people in a room. Overall, I do not feel cramped or crowded when I enter into the place whether that is to study, sleep, or simply to rest."
College Sophomore,4,"At times I feel as though I am not pushed as I should be in particular classes while I get incredibly interesting material in others. The money is well spent, but I wish at times professors could go more in depth or find a way to make the lectures engaging. However, I am glad I am attending Piedmont International University as I am continuing to learn and improve myself through their courses."
College Freshman,4,"Piedmont International University was not my first choice school, but I was really being lead to go here. I was going to go to the medical field, but God redirected my path. I am now pursuing a Christian Ministry degree with double minors in counseling and missions. My dream would to either own my own counseling firm or work with a church! Piedmont has really helped me see what I want from my degree, and what I really want from life.I would absolutely choose this school again!"
College Senior,4,The classes are routine Bible courses. They are all dispensational .
College Senior,4,People seem close since it's a small campus. I like it
College Junior,4,"Their is diversity at Tennessee Temple University. Many people are different ethnic and race, economic background. There are many students that are from other countries. Such as Nigeria, Romania, and Costa Rica. It's amazing to see all the different countries represented."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus takes great care of us and we enjoy spending time together
College Sophomore,4,We are very positive and try to install an adult like attitude in the students.
College Sophomore,4,All of our beliefs are similar and there is a very small diversity
College Sophomore,4,We want to know our subject better than anybody
College Sophomore,4,We have great spirit on campus and love learning
College Senior,4,"The curriculum at my current institution is outstanding. Teachers design lesson plans that equip me, as well as my peers, for upcoming standardized testing (i.e. ACT, SAT, AP Exams, etc.). As a result, this gives us better preparation for our future careers that we intend to pursue in life proceeding college. "
College Freshman,4,You will find the same options in Winston that you would find in any city.
College Freshman,4,Piedmont is very affordable if you do your job and look for scholarships.
College Freshman,4,"It's NC...hot, cold, rainy, dry.  You never know what will happen, but I love it!"
College Freshman,4,PIU is a great school full of great people!  I love both the education I am receiving and the people I have met.
College Freshman,4,"Parking has not been a problem for me so far, and I don't even live on campus (yet)!"
College Junior,4,Nice athletic facilities at PIU and the players are treated with respect and the sports never overtake the place of the education. Sportsmanship is superb and the basketball team at PIU is also apart of the NCAA and some students were accepted by the NCAA while I was on campus a few months ago.
College Junior,4,You are allowed and encouraged to have your own vehicle on campus however if you are not able to bring your own there are public buses and taxis that are easily accessible and there are also students and school faculty that will gladly take you where you need to go!
College Junior,4,"we are a small school, so we do not have as many sports as a large school but our teams are good and a great opportunity to learn ""team"" and compete.  We have women's Volleyball and Basketball and mens Basketball."
College Sophomore,4,This school has some religous beliefs but no one will beat you over the head with a Bible. The morals and values are encouraged and there is great diversity among the students.
College Sophomore,4,I really like the library because you do not necessarily have to go to the library in order to utilize the books from there. I think it is great to have when you are in a busy world.
College Student,4,"Piedmont cares about their students, and girls are required to have a police scort to walk outside after dark."
College Sophomore,4,There are alot of off-campus options. Anywhere from fast food to a five star restaurant within 10 miles of the school.
College Sophomore,4,The dining hall it very bright and comfortable and the school provides a great variety of options at every meal.
College Sophomore,4,They worked with me very well. They made sure that I could apply for every possible scholarship that applied to my major and my position.
College Sophomore,4,The security is handled very well on campus. It is very convenient and efficient and the security guards are very nice and make you feel very safe.
College Senior,4,Degrees are limited. The major focus is Bible and all of the degrees focus on ministry.
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus is very strict about moral codes and curfews but is not as strict as other Christian schools (those schools took it to the point of being oppressive).
College Junior,4,"Student Center – We have a student center that is available for all the students to use for homework, hanging out, or watcing tv. I usually come here to work on my homework."
College Junior,4,I came to TTU for an Associates Degree in early Childhood Education. I love the teachers that are here. y favorite thing is the religious background here.
Junior,2,"The academics and professors here are AMAZING!  The food is hit and miss.  The athletic program has brought the school down drastically since being added.  Its not a ""Party school"", but has a huge party scene within it.  The size of the campus is nice, but not a great location (Not as promoted).  The Dorms are old and mold infested.  Student life is non-existent.  Safety on campus is very under what it should be for the area it is in.  And if you want a true Christian university Piedmont is not the place for you."
College Senior,2,You can't be accepted if you aren't a Christian.
College Senior,2,Very few majors to choose from. Mainly pastoral.
College Senior,2,These dorms are very old and full of bugs and mildew. The bathrooms are the pits with poor ventilation.
College Student,2,Extremely strict...I am an online student and they mandate things like what kind of movies I am allowed to watch.
College Senior,2,"Not the Greatest – The computers on campus work for basic purposes like typing papers and printing. However, the computer programs are out-dated and sometimes they move very slow. There is only one printer in the computer lab and when it runs out of paper there ususally isn't any one around to refill the paper until the next day. Wireless access is descent, however there are times when it moves very slowly and other times when it doesn't work at all."
Senior,1,"Freshman year was the best and recommended PIU to everyone. PIU was a family. Today however, I would never recommend PIU. When PJ was brought in as the new dean of men (after he pushed to get Dean S. fired) so the decline began. PJ is a cancer that has stripped PIU as a place conducive for educational or spiritual growth.  With his lack of leadership abilities came alcohol and drug use that was virtually non-existant under previous deans.  PIU is no longer a place safe for students. The focus is not on how to get more students in so they can receive more government money.  No longer a place to build up bold men and women to take the gospel into the world.  In less than 2 years PIU has successfully traded Christ for the world.  Founder and alumni would be disgusted to see what PIU has become."
College Senior,1,I would not want to make anyone come to PIU.
College Senior,1,I feel like the past 4 years have been a waste.
College Senior,1,It's very outdated and old.
College Senior,1,We have a poor selection- starches and fatty foods
College Senior,1,"In my opinion, the college does not care at all."
College Senior,1,"To be honest, we have the dumbest rules that make no sense in the real world. We cannot have alcohol, can't even hug our significant other, can't have visitors in our dorms unless parents, no tattoos or piercings, no sex, have to wear modest clothing, have a curfew (if you miss it by a minute you get 5 points), have to tell the dean and RA where we are at all times if we're going off campus for a night, can't listen to secular music, and basically can't have fun and act normal."
College Freshman,1,It's the worst...in a good way.  There are way better things to do than drink and party.
College Sophomore,1,there's nothing to do on campus it feel like a min prison a lot of rules and regulations

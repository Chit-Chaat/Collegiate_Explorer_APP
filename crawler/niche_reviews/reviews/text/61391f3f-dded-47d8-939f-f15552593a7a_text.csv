There are also world mission trips every summer, chapel twice a week, clubs, community service, active campus life, an excellent demographic, safe, a new city with lots to do.  A brand new plaza with 3300 jobs, movie theater, restaurants, etc is opening right next to campus.  We are growing with a new 25,870 square foot Residence Hall for those who live on campus.  Day, night, online courses for AA, Bachelor, or Certificate studies.  Check it out www.trinitycollege.edu."
Freshman,5,"I'm a Quest student, attending college at age 70.  I did not have the blessing or opportunity to attend college in my younger years and am enjoying this privilege now. The professors are helpful and personable.  The students bring a lot of insight to my thinking."
Senior,5,Trinity changed my life and my relationship with God. Before attending I only looked at Christianity as a religion but being around the students and professors at the college they helped shape and mode me into the person I am today.
Junior,5,"Exceptional private college with inspirational PhD professors shaping a solid Biblical worldview and providing the tools to a successful career in many fields.  This is an exceptional school for Ministerial Education.  Billy Graham graduated here!!!  It attracts ministers, business, athletics, psychology, counseling and education students.  I can't speak highly enough about the quality."
College Junior,5,"The school has a ZERO tolerance policy towards drugs, therefore the drug scene at Trinity College does not exist."
College Junior,5,So far since I've been on campus everything seems pretty safe. Everyone is nice and knows each other since it's a pretty small campus. I really couldn't imagine anything too wild happening on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of diversity!!! I love it
And in religion wise , even though is a Christian College there're many different denominations and it's really cool."
College Junior,5,I am greatly enjoying the Christian Ministry program and feel like i'm getting prepared for real-life ministry.
College Junior,5,"Weather is great, it's in Florida. Warm most of the year, spring/summer brings daily afternoon thunderstorms."
College Junior,5,Best in the Biz – Trinity is rated as the Best Deal for your buck. It has the greatest number of on staff Doctorates per student and for the college size and price.
College Sophomore,5,The library at Trinity College of Florida is pretty excellent. The library is full of books that help with research papers and homework assignments as well as extra fun reading. There are plenty of tables to sit down and study as well as a few computers to do assignments and what not. Many students spend quite a bit of their studying/homework time in the library.
College Junior,5,"I Love This School – I love Trinity College! This is definitely the school for me. The small campus allows students to get to know everyone on campus personally, including professors! It is like one big family."
College Freshman,5,Wireless Access – The only access available to the school is the wireless access. This is a country school with no cable or dial up systems available. I'm not complaining because wireless is the way to go and the connection speed is very good all the time. Making getting your work completed a breeze.
College Sophomore,5,"Spirited School – Very special school, the Spirit is very high, so to speak. You get a wonderful feeling while attending this school."
College Sophomore,5,on campus parking and transportation is at the door
College Sophomore,5,"I don't live on campus, but hear from the students that do. They find it very nice."
College Junior,4,"Housing is great but expensive, off campus is a better choice if you want to pay less."
College Sophomore,4,Awesome school great programs offered. Very friendly and helpful staff.
College Freshman,4,Live at home with my parents
College Senior,4,The teachers are all really great( at least the ones I've had so far) and are really good with working with you to help you understand and get the most out of the class.
College Senior,4,"It's definitely better choosing the off campus housing option from. The off campus apartments are way cleaner, there's a gym and pool area. Plus you don't have to pay to use a washer/dryer since they're located in the apartment already."
College Junior,4,"The majority of the majors here are Bible or Theology majors, although the school appears to be broadening it's availability or new majors, such as sports management, to meet the desires and needs of the students demands."
College Junior,4,The school appears to be undergoing a reshaping of the entire sports atmosphere and the image of the athletic programs. Additionally the school is making great strides in expanding it's sports programs.
College Junior,4,"Excellent instructors, coursework can be a bit heavy at times, but it is challenging and mind-expanding work."
College Junior,4,"Weather is fantastic, but there are certain times of the year where it becomes dangerous to drive to school because of very thick fog. Also, if it rains for long enough, it will flood."
College Junior,4,"Very Safe – There has only been one time that a crime was committed on campus, some off student teens decided to break into a car and steal a radio. What they didn't know is that we have security. The police were called after the security stopped the teens from breaking into the car. The campus has been quiet and safe ever since."
College Junior,4,"Discipline Is Measured by How Horrendous the Crime – Usually the discipline on campus is not too extreme. It depends on what you do, the disciplinarians are very understanding and are gracious in most cases, so long as it doesn't hurt other students."
College Junior,4,Great Place to Stay – The dorms on the school's campus are a great place to live. Everything from the atmosphere to the students themselves makes this place the perfect home away from home.
College Junior,4,You Know. I love most things about it. But it's a crazy far drive from my house.
College Junior,4,"Gourmet Variety – The lunch is fresh made by actual chefs and they use high-quality ingredients, and offer additional menu items such as fresh-made sandwiches."
College Sophomore,4,"Trinity Offers Sports Such as Basketball and Volleyball. Trinity College of Florida offers sports such as basketball and volleyball. We have our own coaches and trainers and such. I believe there are tryouts, but they try to give everyone interested a chance."
College Freshman,4,"It's Hot – It's Florida, so it's typically hot and humid. Classes are never cancelled. It's pretty just full of bugs in the summer months. You can be outside any time of the year."
College Freshman,4,"At Trinity College we have a lot of diversity ethnically. However despite the diversity everyone seems to get along with each other. The differences don't separate us. We all hang out with one another all the time. It's amazing to see such a small school come together and have so many different types of students. We have all different colors of skin. African Americans, whites, Asians, and Hispanics are all the different types of ethnicity that we currently have. In the cafeteria we have flags of all the different countries that foreign students have come from and there are many. It is an amazing school."
College Junior,4,"Warm and Sunny – Trinity College has the typical warm and sunny Florida weather. Every now and then we get some rain and cold, but never any snow and rarely frost. The weather is ideal for sports and other outdoor activities."
College Junior,4,"Very Diverse – At Trinity College of Florida we have a very diverse student body. Students have a unique opportunity to communicate with others of varying ethnicity, backgrounds, and religious and political opinions. Trinity is a very small school so students are able to get to know everyone on campus."
College Senior,2,The school is cool but its inTrinity/ New Port Richey with very little to do in the immediate area. However if you go 20 min. or so up the road to Clearwater or Tampa you can find more fun things to do.
College Senior,1,"If you're looking to go out somewhere you're going to have to go to Tampa, or Clearwater/St.Pete"
College Sophomore,1,"Could Be a Lot Better – The dorms are not great at all. There is mold all over the bathroom, and the cost is a little too much for how the dorms are! The dorms do include a refridgerator, but no cable. The beds are pretty comfortable though."
College Junior,1,New Port Richey is super lame! Even the Chick-fil-a next to the school sucks!
College Freshman,1,If your looking for the parties or the bar scene this the wrong school. You are forbidden to do these things while a student at this school. This a Christian house that follows moral decision making.
College Freshman,1,Dining Off Campus – This is a country school about a mile or two to town where there are only 2-3 options fast food style to eat. If you do not own a car your in trouble.

Alum,5,"Excellent programs - I did not have an online experience, but did spend time in the classrooms and found it to be a wonderful education."
Alum,5,Just a perfect experience - if you are interested in education this is the place to attend. I enjoyed all four years and I am thankful for the opportunity to have attended the College of Idaho. I felt at home the moment I arrived.
Junior,5,"Up until the time of the pandemic, everything was done in person. One week before we were forced to move to online, teachers had barely been taught how the online classes were supposed to work. Although everything changed so quickly, I believe all my professors did a fairly great job. The first week was a little of a struggle, but we all got it down eventually.  It was everyone's first time on that platform and I'm glad we were all able to get it down and get through it."
Freshman,5,"I am concluding my freshman year at the College of Idaho, and thus far it has been a very rewarding experience. I'm very thankful I chose a small college because I am given such individual attention and I feel like faculty and other student peers know my name. Another perk of attending a small college is the fact that there are more opportunities open to my specific skill set. I love the way that the whole campus is very supportive of every activity and really comes together to support each other. I have really loved attending the College of Idaho."
Freshman,5,"The professors seem to care for the students and I feel like the small class sizes will help me soar. The town of Caldwell doesn't seem great, but Boise is a short drive away so it's not a big deal. All of the students seem to be very happy and engaged in campus life."
Alum,5,"It was an excellent choice for a private, smaller school in the Northwestern part of the country. I had excellent professors, the work study program was perfect for me, the courses, intramural and student life were excellent as well."
Freshman,5,The college of Idaho provides a family atmosphere that is an automatic welcome. There is no one here that isn't apart of the family. C of I involves everyone that wants to be involves. There is always something for someone to do or feel apart of.

Junior,5,"The College of Idaho is a great place that makes you feel important. All of their staff do their best to encourage you to take ownership of your college experience and allow you to personalize your education. If you want to do it all, they help you do it all. ""No"" is a word rarely used at C of I."
Freshman,5,"The student life is amazing!!! The staff are super friendly and almost all of the professors will take time to work with you if you're going through a rough patch!  The food service is through Bon Apétite and it's absolutely amazing! you can work with the chefs to cater to any diet or allergy concerns and there's already a huge diversity of foods offered every day. The campus safety team is awesome and good at what they do, so no worries about safety even at night! I'm not into the party scene, but if ya look for them you can find one almost every other weekend."

Junior,5,"I love this campus and it’s Atmosphere! It’s a beautiful campus with a small student population where you are able to build strong connections with, not only other students, but the professors and other administrative staff there. I’m glad I ended up going here because it is a wonderful campus with very friend individuals, major diversity, and the academic scene is very interesting and unique in its own manner!"
Niche User,5,"The College of Idaho is a very prestigious, academic-driven and welcoming school. When I toured every area of their campus, academics, student-life and ect. were explained in detail. The College of Idaho seems to prepare students for a good future in whatever area of study they choose."
Sophomore,5,"College of Idaho is a very diverse, welcoming and friendly college that has excellent teachers, classes and a range of great activities on campus!"
Freshman,5,If you want to explore yourself and study in a small classrooms. The College of Idaho is the one for you. Good environments and brilliant teaching faculty. Sure you will have  a great time
Alum,5,"Great education. Like anything, you will out what you put in. I was able to get a great job after graduating from the college."
Sophomore,5,"I really love the College of Idaho, it has become a second home for me, and really allowed me to grow as an individual. The professors here are amazing and I could never imagine going to a lecture hall with over 200 student. We have approximately a professor-student ratio of 1-12 which is amazing. The only thing I would like to see change is the avalability of different food options."
Sophomore,5,I feel valued as a student. My professors give their best to help me and will always go out of their way to assist me. The coaches want what is best for me not just for the team but they also teach me so much in my respective sport.
Freshman,5,"I love The College of Idaho! Dorm life is amazing. Because of the real family feel of the people I live with, I wasn't scared at all when I moved in. The quality of my classes is just as beneficial; I've learned so much just in my first semester and the number of opportunities I have in the years to come is limitless."
Niche User,5,The people on campus were very welcoming and very nice. The academics are amazing and the sports are too. It is such a spirited school.
Freshman,5,"It is one of the best colleges you can find. Everyone is so supportive. Apart from lack of interest in recycling and reusing things, every other things of C of I is best."
Freshman,5,Very friendly and nice campus. Everyone I talked on campus was so nice and friendly. There is a lot of scholarships out there for the college so affordability is not much of problem.
Sophomore,5,"I like how everyone on the campus is really nice and care about one another. It's really easy to learn classmates who are in the same class as you are and if you need to find someone, a friend can help out. There is always an event going on on campus for the week and students get really involved with  the activities."
College Sophomore,5,"As soon as a school day starts at the college, there is always something to do. Either it be sports or clubs, there is always something or an event occurring on campus."
College Sophomore,5,The small class sizes make it easier for professors to bond with their students and notice when a student isn't doing as well and will reach out to the student.
College Sophomore,5,There are services on campus that will help students find internships suitable for them while they are attending the college and jobs for when they are to graduate.
College Freshman,5,My professors are the best and I really feel like I'm learning a lot.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful - tall trees, cute squirrels, nice buildings. The people are so nice, and the classes really educational."
College Freshman,5,Alumni are always a huge help and are always so dedicated
College Freshman,5,"I am very blessed, and very lucky to be able to be a part of this school."

College Freshman,5,"I have learned something in every course I have taken so far, and they have been very effective. My professors are always willing to help."
College Freshman,5,The classes are challenging and enlightening.  The professors are approachable and helpful.  The curriculum is challenging and interesting.  The registration process is quick and easy.  There is a heavy workload and high expectations.
College Freshman,5,"There is a very low crime rate on campus.  There are rarely any sexual assaults, people frequently leave their belongings unattended with no theft problems.  Campus safety is easily available if needed and if a student feels uncomfortable walking alone, a security officer will come escort students around campus.  I always feel safe.  The campus is relatively small and when there are safety concerns an email alert goes out school-wide, immediately."
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes tend to be rather small.  I have been in a few classes with more than 20 kids but rarely.  The professors are friendly, helpful, available, and passionate about their material.  There is easy access to help when a student is struggling."
College Sophomore,5,I was definitely treated like a real person. I am never a number. Everyone here is here to help me. The students really are the main focus.
College Freshman,5,Whenever there's a basketball or football game the entire school attends and the student section is the best.
College Junior,5,It has a very individualized education that makes students competitive when applying for graduate programs.
College Freshman,5,"This school is fantastic.  They value you as an individual while still making you part of their community.  If you are struggling socially, emotionally, scholastically, or wellness, they are there for you, they notice, and they care.  The classes are small, the professors know your name.  Your advisors are available and eager to help.  I highly recommend it.  The diverse curriculum allows you to individualize your education and become knowledgeable and competent in a huge variety of subjects and allows a broad spectrum of interests to flourish."
Recent Alumnus,5,"These past years at The College of Idaho have been some of the best of my entire life. The top-quality liberal arts curriculum gives you the opportunity to become a well-rounded person thus leading to not only academic growth but also extraordinary personal growth. The reason the curriculum is well executed is the one on one relationships we have the opportunity to establish with our high-caliber professors. On top of an incredible academic community, The College of Idaho also has a close-knit campus community that serves as a support system from which we can gain lifetime friendships."
College Sophomore,5,Everything is within reason and most of it is left to the students because of the honor code students have established that is to be upheld by students.
College Freshman,5,"It's a wonderful campus to dorm in - classes are just outside of your door, more or less, and the rooms are very comfortable!"
College Sophomore,5,"Bon Apetit does an amazing job on campus. They always provide a large variety for us, and generally take into consideration our personal requests."
College Junior,5,"The school's strictness is very lenient when it comes to a majority of social exploration. While students aren't encourage to partake in underage drinking, they are not punished unless the drinking poses a risk to the person drinking or others."
College Freshman,5,"they are always serving new dishes, from around the globe at the cafeteria. Fountain drinks and fresh fruits the place is like buffet and you can even take food back to your dorm to eat while you do your homework."
College Freshman,5,"There is always something going on at the campus. everyone not only parties together, but we also study and work hard together. we're alll socialbe and have time in our day to help other if they are in need, or just a bit lost."
College Freshman,5,"The Campus Safety department is awesome. They're there for you 24/7 whether you're locked out of a building, or you don't feel safe at a party, you need a ride back from a party cause you've been drinking, need an escort at night, etc. They're there to help."
College Freshman,5,I would not want to eat anywhere else. It is exquisite
College Freshman,5,"Almost anything you need or want to learn is available. Whatever you're thinking, there is time and a place for it here."
College Senior,5,"We have many diverse pupils on campus, it's really interesting to get to know people from different ethnic backgrounds or national origin."
College Senior,5,If you act responsibly you shouldn't have any problems.
College Senior,5,There was no hassle in getting into my program.
College Senior,5,"The professors are awesome, they challenge you and really care about your education."
College Junior,5,We have a great Health Sciences and Biology program
College Junior,5,Professors really care and have a lot of office hours to spend with students. They are required to have a certain amount of office hours.
Junior,4,"When I think of The College of Idaho, I think ""tight knit"". The college has a little over 1000 enrolled students. Living on campus, or just attending the school, it's very easy to come by other students you already met or know. Therefore it makes it easy to find your group of friends. The college is also very inclusive. They do events to try to get students to come out and meet new people. Aside from building friendships, its also important to have a good bond with the professors. Being the number one college in Idaho, there is some pressure on the students. Having great professors who take pride in teaching and being able to reach out to them makes it worth it."
Junior,4,The College of Idaho is great for students that want to have relationships with their professors. It is a small campus atmosphere and everyone knows each other. Everyone is nice and easy to get along with.
Niche User,4,"I have not yet attended the college of Idaho,  but the registrars I've met have all been very helpful and patient."
Sophomore,4,"Almost exactly as advertised. Almost every student is on scholarship, and even though it's expensive to live on campus, it's definitely worth it! High quality staff and faculty who have a passion for their work and students. High community involvement and opportunities to work/volunteer in the area. Excellent accomodations for disabled and neurodivergent students. Could use more LGBT+ support."
Freshman,4,"The College of Idaho has been a great challenge for me.  The school is relatively small but big enough to provide opportunities to help me grow academically.  The professors are driven to help their students as much as they can.  The management of the campus is well carried out.  The main thing I would like to see changed is the attention put into the campus residence halls.  Many of them are in a poor state and need renovation, and I would like to see them repaired so that the students have a better living environment."
Sophomore,4,The College of Idaho is an amazing school with great professors who care about their students. The dorm life is not the best that it could be but a couple dorms have been renovated. Caldwell is not the safest place in Idaho but the campus safety office lets the students know of anything going on in the area to keep us safe.
Freshman,4,"C of I is a very good school.  It is small and offers diversity in studies as well as athletics.  It has a very good reputation as an excellent school.

I have had one experience with one professor that was less than what i hoped for.  She was very discriminatory and her teaching methods were very narrow.

Over all, however, The College of Idaho has been a good experience."
Junior,4,"The class sizes are small enough so that teachers can really help each student. The campus is beautiful and you can get anywhere in as few as 5 minutes. The new library has a cafe that is spectacular. All teachers want you to succeed. The food is so-so and you don't have a choice in whether or not you pay for a meal plan. However, Pasta Thursdays are awesome. Classes are challenging but manageable with help from peers and professors."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been very good with the fact that my professors are personable and ready to help whenever asked. The students here are very kind and given that it is a small, private campus, everyone knows mostly everyone! The food here is really good as a catering service prepares the food, and they always have options. My only issue is with the dorms and the price of the dorms as I feel that I am paying more for what I am getting. Overall College of Idaho would be a great fit for anyone looking for a small school that offers multiple opportunities for their students."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at the College of Idaho and I have enjoyed my time there although it is challenging. Going to such a small college has been beneficial because professors are willing to help you one on one and make sure all their students succeed. The only thingss I would like to see the college improve on would to have a wider variety of majors and minors.
Freshman,4,"The College of Idaho provides students with a great education and makes them feel like an actual person instead of just a number. Professors focus on each and every student to make sure they are able to succeed. Overall, The College of Idaho is a great college, but it is expensive also."
Niche User,4,"Great community based college with a warm and welcoming feeling. 
Small campus, and class sizes with a large emphasis on student involvement."
Freshman,4,"The tuition is very high, but the rigorous course work and curriculum make it worth it.The one thing that you will graduate with, if you learn nothing else, is the ability to write papers at a high proficiency level.  The college has a unique program that lets each student have one major and three minors, two majors and two minors, or for the highly motivated, three majors and one minor, all while graduating in 4 years. The school is like a large family, we look out for each other. Campus safety is always willing to help, whether it is to dig out your car from under a snow pile to taking you to pick up food. The food on campus is absolutely amazing! The party scene is amazing for everyone interested, but no one is ever pressured to participate in it. There are many clubs that you can join, or if you can't find one to join you can make one and receive school funding for it.  If you're religious then there is plenty of religion based actives to attend."
College Sophomore,4,"Safety and health is a big deal on the campus. In case something happens on campus, the officer working on duty at Campus safety will do what he can before calling the local police."
College Sophomore,4,"At any game that the college has, they'll always be cheered on by the students and those who live and love the college of our town."
College Junior,4,I can't wait to try out the pool!
College Junior,4,"I am truly excited to start school in the fall. From my experience so far, orientation and interaction with other students, I love it."
College Sophomore,4,"At freshmen welcome week, we are required to attend a small-group talk and lecture about sexual assault, hosted by the student body."
College Sophomore,4,"When I was a freshman during orientation, all students were expected to go to the football game. I went with my new friends and the stadium was PACKED. We all crowded in together to cheer on the team and the school spirit was unlike anything I'd seen before. I'm not a fan of sports at all, but I always enjoy rooting on my team at the games."
College Sophomore,4,"You get a major & 3 minors, picked from 4 fields."
College Freshman,4,"I don't know what the student career prospects look like and it terrifies me. I mean, there's nothing to suggest that it isn't great, it's a great school, but I am terrified of the future"
College Freshman,4,"The school cares a lot about safety and it's probably a pretty safe place to be, but I am a very paranoid person, especially away from home, so very little can satisfy me."
College Freshman,4,"The people in the Anderson dorms are amazing. Everyone is so nice. We're like a big family. That being said, the fire alarms are too sensitive for us to have toasters, the rooms are small, and there are occasionally odd smells. It is a dorm after all."
College Sophomore,4,We have campus safety hence we feel somewhat safe.
College Sophomore,4,The classes are small so its pretty easy to get individual attention.
College Sophomore,4,The CEL Center is a great resource for information about internships.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are in good shape. The cost is a little bit high though.
College Sophomore,4,"This is a very individualized school. It is all about the students, and so grades are determined based on the student's performance. The professors are very approachable, flexible, and understanding. They will literally do anything to help you out to get the best grade you can and so that you don't just get a good grade but so that you can learn the material and be able to use it in your life. I've had professors email me with genuine concern about late assignments to see if everything was okay."
College Sophomore,4,"It completely depends on who you're around. I haven't noticed any activity like that, and only know it happens because other people talk about it."
College Freshman,4,"If someone gets very ill on campus. They will offer free visits to the nurse. Warn everyone to be careful, and how to prevent our self from getting sick."
College Freshman,4,This school itself is fairly diverse but it is located in an area that is not particularly diverse.  There are many international students from all over the world and there are a wide variety of religious backgrounds.  The students and faculty are very accepting and welcoming.
College Freshman,4,Everyone there is happy to help.  There are people whose job it is to assist with finding internships.  The alumni system is strong and they are frequently on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I've only been here a semester, but I can already tell that the alumni is really strong. Once you've gone to school here, you have a great reputation."
College Sophomore,4,The education is great! Teachers are friendly! Fantastic atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,Campus security is always available
College Freshman,4,Professors are very kind and willing to help.
College Freshman,4,Career counseling will help you a lot
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of forms to choose from.  Hayman is the best option for freshman because you get to know a lot of people.  Anderson is for the smart quiet ones.  Simplot and Finney are for upperclassmen and they are both a good option. Vorhees is just a no.
College Freshman,4,The College of Idaho is a perfect fit for me.  The classes are small and I get excited to learn.  Everyone is so friendly and it's super easy to make friends.
College Freshman,4,Snyder is an awesome history teacher and you learn a ton! This is coming from someone who hates history.
College Freshman,4,I play on the softball team and we have to walk with a buddy at all times. But I do feel safe walking around campus alone. Everyone is very nice.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy coming to this school. The professors are great and really take the time to know you not just as a student but also as a person.  The College of Idaho is fairly small so you really get to know almost everyone. It's also easier to stablish life long friendships.
College Sophomore,4,My favorite experience is that C of I has all freshmen move in a week early to get the whole campus to ourselves and get to know all fellow freshmen quickly. It built an extreme sense of community and gave us all confidence to make friends.
College Senior,4,The student body is terrific. The teachers are great and easy to get in contact with. You can tell everyone really wants you to achieve and is really there to help you reach your goals and do the best you can!
College Senior,4,There are a lot of parties at my school because it is a very isolated and small college so there is not much more to do. Most sports teams have parties at their houses or the frat houses throw a party.
College Freshman,4,"Since its a tight community, when one hears that the college has a game coming up, many locals go to the game and cheer on for the college team. Even one who doesn't go to this college can notice that the college has a lot of spirit from both the college students and the towns people."
College Freshman,4,Usually students that live relatively close to the campus ask for off campus housing and end up living with their family.
College Freshman,4,The main dining hall is the Simplot dining hall. The food is prepared right in front of the person who orders it and everything is organic. I like the grill line a lot and I usually get a hamburger with fries and then I get ice cream that is made by the students on campus. I enjoy eating at the Simplot dining hall.
College Freshman,4,There is an excellent amount of scholarship opportunities available at this school!
College Freshman,4,"I don't party all that much, but when I do, this is the environment to do it."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know too much about the administration, but from what I can tell, they genuinely care about the students."
College Sophomore,4,"People are pretty cool, and for the most part respect each other."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms offer many varieties of housing options. Personally, I feel that the more expensive dorms receive the most privilege with excess funds and time for activities. Having been a resident housing administrator, I can attest to that. For example, some of the laundry facilities are excellent; with whole rooms devoted to washers and dryers, whereas the dorms that aren't as flashy only have three, and so on."
College Junior,4,"Every weekend there is something for everyone. Whether you'd rather spend your time drinking or just laying low with some friends in the dorms you can always find something fun to do. Everyone is really friendly and none of the frat houses require partygoers to be a part of the greek life. Some frats require a small fee to enter the parties but the majority do not, which is always a plus."
College Junior,4,"Living here on campus is an easy way for students to get to know each other. The cost is very reasonable for what amenities are offered in each dorm. The lowest cost dorm does not have the most luxurious amenities but it does have features such as large open areas, large televisions and more. The most expensive dorms have amenities such as a full kitchen with a stovetop, oven and newer appliances and furnature."
College Freshman,4,Security on campus is good. I feel totally safe on campus
College Freshman,4,The school spirit and fan support is awesome. The bleachers are packed and students get really pumped up.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not in a sorority, but I know people that are that love it. It adds another level of community on the campus. I know the initiation process for sororities is complicated, but not necessarily difficult to get into. Lots of guys are in frats and I heard that process is simpler."
College Freshman,4,"We have the most expensive housing in the state of Idaho, but that's because most of our housing is really nice. The more expensive options (Hayman, The Village, etc) are worth it in my opinion. They're newer and clean and very spacious."
College Freshman,4,"The biology faculty are all really passionate and helpful. There are lots of biology majors, but not too much difficulty getting into classes."
College Freshman,2,"I did my research and thought this college would be a great place to further my education and be an awesome place for my home away from home for the next 4 years, especially since I am not from Idaho. Boy was I wrong. The education is good, but I have yet to get the classes that I want within my major. They tend to fill up fast since the class sizes are small and freshman are the last to chose. The social environment is not good. If you don't want to be a part of the party scene then your stuck in your room. You pay a lot of $ for partying. I'm not staying. I can get just as good of an education and have non pressured fun for a less expensive cost somewhere else and not be afraid to leave my room."
College Senior,2,"There are many options for off campus housing, however some neighborhoods feel very unsafe and some are completely unreasonable."
College Sophomore,2,"When a landlord threatens to kick out a student because they can't afford to pay the last (small) chunk of rent, (considering they've already paid $1800 and owe $200), there's a problem."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some options, but if you don't have a car you're just stuck with finding something you pray you don't have to cook at the grocery store."
College Junior,2,We are surrounded by a moderate selection of fast food chain restaurants. McDonalds are Dairy Queen are very close. While we do have a few locally owned small businesses close by the cost makes the chain restaurants the easiest option.
College Student,2,mostly fast food. not a safe community so dont ever eat off campus
College Student,2,It's pretty obvious what everyone does on their friday or saturday nights. Little pressure but mostly people just do what they want to do.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't a lot of anything within walking distance except for a few cafes and fast food. Everything is in the next town over.
College Sophomore,2,There are few dorms/houses that have been restored. Most of the dorm rooms are a bit too small.
College Senior,2,I have never lived in snow before.  It's cold and miserable.
College Senior,2,"Because Caldwell has its own beautiful wine country, I expected most of Caldwell to reflect that same level of beauty.  It didn't.  If you did not grow up on farm land, it can be a bit of a culture shock.  The professors are amazing and really get to know you so academically, it is a great investment.  But socially, people are different than those you would find in a big city.  Some friendly, some stuck up, and all mostly from Idaho.  If you are transferring, I would look somewhere else. "
College Freshman,2,"I feel like there are so many hoops to jump through they don't want you to get it.
"
College Freshman,2,"There are some good restaurants in town, but there are really not very many near the campus."
College Freshman,2,"Caldwell seems a little run-down. The campus is excellent, however."
College Senior,2,Its a small campus and parking is mostly available to those who reside in the dorms
College Sophomore,2,They don't have transportation if you need to go somewhere at anytime but they do have transportation when it is the holidays. They have different times to take you to the airport.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't very much transportation available if you don't have your own car. However, the College of Idaho does provide shuttles to the airport at the end of the semesters, as well as during breaks."
College Freshman,2,"The frats/soroities are not a huge thing. a lot of people are involved, however, it isn't seen as a must. there is only a few soroties and frats there anyways"
College Sophomore,2,"Caldwell Isn't an Attraction – The town does not have anything to offer. There are so many events on campus, however, that it does not matter. We are our own little secluded community. There is more to do in Boise, which is about  half-hour drive. And of course, Idaho is amazing and beautiful when you get out of town."
Freshman,1,"Would give it 0 stars if possible. I hate it here. The students are of very low caliber, Caldwell has nothing to offer, and basically has no attractions for someone who is academically inclined. I'm transferring as soon as possible. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF GOING HERE!"
College Junior,1,"There is really no transportation, at least not that I'm aware of"
College Senior,1,There is nothing here! There is a rodeo across the street that is active for one week in August and that's about it.  Going out requires a bit of a drive.

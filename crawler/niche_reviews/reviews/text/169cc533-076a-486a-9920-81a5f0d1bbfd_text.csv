Sophomore,5,"I took online classes this semester and yes it was difficult to adjust to, but my professors did an awesome job allowing us to adjust to this drastic change. They have done an amazing job in making the classes as comfortable and easy passing as they can. I was very skeptical at first but now I absolutely love taking my courses online. I can balance work and school perfectly."
Senior,5,"It is a very small campus, making it relatively easy to get to class fast. There is a lot of support form the faculty in making sure you have the right amount of help with whatever you need. Huge computer labs available."
Sophomore,5,"Worcester State University is conveniently located in a busy, local-business area part of Worcester. It has a strong academic foundation, while simultaneously allowing for a safe environment to meet friends and explore the culture."
Senior,5,Worcester State allowed me the opportunity to receive an education and still work at night for a reasonable price. My professors were insightful and compassionate for their subjects. The atmosphere of the school is uplifting and the facilities are clean.
Freshman,5,i love worcester state. the campus is small enough to be able to walk around and there are so many oppurtunities to get involved the athletics are great and the students are very nice. the food is ok but not that bad. i would like to see more parking spaces.
Alum,5,"I received a great education and was supported by great professors. I never had a bad class, issues with financial aid, registrar, or any other office. Worcester State is affordable and a great value."
Niche User,5,"I have not started here yet, but when I visited for a week it was a great time and experience. I am excited to start here in the fall and see what everything else is like on campus. Hoping for the best when I go there in the fall."
Niche User,5,Worcester State is in the best location. Worcester is an up and coming place to be with 9 universities there is always something going on. The university and the City are what you make of them. Meaning if you look for something to do you will find an activity but if you choose to just sit back the opportunities will not jump in front of you. I was able to get an internship while I was in school because there is so much around the university. Most of the professors are great  but of course you always have a couple that you dont love. My suggestion do your research on classes/professors and plan accordingly.
Niche User,5,They have a beautiful campus with a wide variety of activities for the students to part take in. They are a very welcoming school that will help out as many people as they can. They put their students first.
Junior,5,"Worcester State University is an overall fantastic state school in which my family and I highly recommend! I chose Worcester State for numerous reasons; however, my older brothers attended WSU and I was the last one of the family to  attend college. Worcester State was very persistent for me to attend and the location, the diversity, the professors, education, the price, and much more ultimately aided in my decision to choose Worcester State University. Currently, I am a Junior at WSU, a Biology major, and on the Pre-Med track. In my opinion and one of my first college professors told me is that, college is all about trying new things and getting out of your comfort zone. Therefore, try new things, such as playing a sport for WSU or an intramural sport, get involved leadership opportunities, on campus jobs, and so much more there's endless opportunities!I love Worcester State University and give it my highest recommendation possible!"
Freshman,5,"It is a really good school. I feel challenged in the nursing program and feel that I am getting my moneys worth. The campus is beautiful and small, but has a large community feeling. The nursing program is very close-knit and it is nice to feel a part of it."
Junior,5,"I really love the environment at Worcester State University. I am a commuter because I wanted to be close to home ( I live in Worcester) and though the campus is in Worcester, the environment of it makes me feel like I am in a different state. It is amazing and filled with so many great opportunities."
Sophomore,5,not much partying goes on here which is great for studying. the school is affordable and teaches the same stuff Ivy schools teach you.
Niche User,5,Overall a great school. Worcester State has a beautiful campus with some of the newest technology. Professors are wonderful. They are very helpful and you can tell they enjoy their job. Very friendly atmosphere to be in. Always felt welcomed no matter where I was on campus. Safe environment also. Campus police on duty 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 100% would recommend.
Freshman,5,"I started college feelings very nervous, but the students and faculty at Worcester State University have made me feel welcome and appreciated."
Alum,5,Big enough to do great things and small enough for everyone to be involved. Terrific athletic teams on which to play and for which to root. First class student government learning how to implement solutions-based action and involvement of all sectors. Great to see all the recent improvements to the campus facilities and the connection and celebration of the history of the university representing the Heart of the Commonwealth and all New England!
Alum,5,The past 4 years at WSU have been amazing.  The community is like a family and it is easy to make friends.  The professors and employees at the school are also amazing as well.
Junior,5,"The school is good and the professors are here to help you. If you ever have any issues or problems the professors are approchable, and the campus is pretty diverse."
Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I am a proud student of Worcester State. I always recommend students to apply to Worcester State because of its strength in academics and relationships with professors. In addition it is an affordable school in a local town that is getting more and more renovated. Its a great school to definitely put on your  ""apply to"" list."
Senior,5,I was a transfer student to Worcester state half way through my sophomore year. This was the third school I have attended and I didn't have a good academic record going into my first semester. The classes and professors changed my attitude completely. I have finished each semester now with impressive grades and I worked really hard to get where I am at. I am so happy with my decision to give Worcester state a chance because the experience I have had there is life changing.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Worcester State. I transferred to the school in fall of 2014, and it was the best decision I could've made. The faculty and staff at WSU are incredibly friendly and helpful, and the school seems to be run much better than my previous experience. The campus is very secure - it feels like its own community separate from the surrounding city. I feel safe walking through campus by myself. My experience living on campus has also been great. The dorms are more than suitable for college living."
Freshman,5,They provide quality education for a fair rate. Faculty is involved and invested in education of their students. Athletics are poor but clubs are plentiful and diverse.
Junior,5,"WSU is among the best selections of all state-wide colleges in Worcester county and commonwealth. In participating so, WSU provides separate buildings for different subjects across majors, such as the Ghosh and Science Tech Building for labs, the Sullivan Building for lectures, and the LRC for Criminal Justice. What I would like to see is have the WRTA bus run routes to the college on weekends and have the Worcester Consortium back running, if both are possible due to limited gasoline cost and resource. Other than transportation amends, teaching and learning coincide with one another greatly on this campus! "
College Freshman,5,"For my program, nursing, I'm confident in my ability to get a job with my degree from this school"
College Freshman,5,"Our new wellness center offers workout space for anyone (athlete or not), and awesome fitness classes too!"
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus and I have never had issues with any of this
College Junior,5,I love how small the school is making it feel like our own community. It is in a city but is very secluded and in a very good area. I love the small class sizes where professors really learn to know your names and your strengths.
College Freshman,5,It is so beautiful and the teachers are so nice and kind.
College Senior,5,"The campus is feels very safe, even for being so close to the city."
College Student,5,"Worcester State is the perfect place for me and many others. Great professors, facilities, organizations, and there is plenty to do on and around campus. Worcester State offers top-tier education at an affordable price that will make you competitive in your career field. The campus is about half commuters/half residents so the residential life has a tight community feel like a small college."
College Junior,5,Security comes to dorms at 7 every night to watch who goes in and out. You need a onecard to get in and out of dorms
College Junior,5,Every time I tell someone I go to Worcester State they comment on how much they've changed in a good way
College Junior,5,"They just built my housing building and I love it, it's very modern and clean"
College Junior,5,I like the fact that there're small class sizes and the campus is small too so it has a home-like feel to it
College Sophomore,5,"I have little to no critiques about my school. The professors are helpful, knowledgeable, and incredibly inspirational. I have made an incredible group of friends here, and the LGBT community on campus is amazing. The campus is small enough to get around easily but big enough that I don't get bored. There are a lot of events and programs to get involved with."
College Freshman,5,"The dining hall at WSU overlooks the football field and is a beautiful and comfortable place to eat meals with your friends. The dinning hall is very home. There are several options for food all the time. The meal plan is not to expensive and they allow you to pick the plan that is best fit for your own personal eating schedule and likes. I personally love the variety of food WSU offers , especially the huge salad bar and ice cream 24/7."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus at Worcester State University allows for students to meet life long friends and grow as an individual. The dorms at WSU are very comfortable and spacious enough for yourself and a roommate or two if necessary. The housing building are very modern, allowing for a perfect environment for living. Living on campus definitely beats living at home."
College Freshman,5,"-many large parks 

-bustling downtown

-varied food"
College Senior,5,"To date, I have not known of any safety or security threats on campus.  In my perspective, campus police is always on duty and ready to assist anyone."
College Sophomore,5,"Sincerely, the school campus was very welcoming the first time I set foot there."
College Junior,5,There are many places close by.
College Sophomore,5,The police have a station in one of the resident halls and are great in assisting people. They will even come to your room if you get locked out and will help you get back in. There are call boxes all over campus if you are in danger and need to call for help. There are always a police cruiser patrolling the campus.
College Sophomore,5,I love Worcester State University. I am so glad I chose this school. 
College Sophomore,5,The resident halls are new and very clean. I highly recommend that any student wanting to live on campus gets housing asap. Apply for housing the second you can or you will be put on the wait list and might not get housing. Having a place on campus is very important and is a factor in making life long friends and building social skills. 
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are great. They really care about the students. They make great office hours for you to meet with them. The care about you and ask what your major is. They also tell you about classes that will help you graduate. 
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are great and so is the curriculum. Go to ratemyprofessor.com to see the ratings of the professors here. The registration process is easy. The DSO can help you register if you need help. The workload is not bad as long as you do things on time. There are tutors easily available to anyone at anytime for free.  The libary is a great place to study, the study rooms in Dowden hall and Wasylean hall are great places to study. "
College Senior,5,There are a ton of places to eat. Worcester is the second largest city in New England meaning endless amounts of places to eat. All near by and both local and chain. Selectivity will never become repetitive. Must try is road runner off Hamilton. 
College Senior,5,There are a large amount of computers on campus. At times the library computer lab may be packed during finals but even then you got options all over campus. The wireless is amazing and so is the software. The science and tech building has done pretty awesome software if your going to be a chemistry major.
College Senior,5,I love the community health program because the professors are extremely helpful and really care how you are doing.
College Freshman,5,"I feel safe walking around campus, even at night. Campus police are visible all throughout campus and are willing to help."
College Freshman,5,"I really like the athletics programs, I am currently a cheerleader at Worcester State University."
College Freshman,5,there are so many off campus dining options ! some you can even walk to as some accept your money from you ID at school
College Junior,5,"Worcester State is in a safe area but also very close to malls, coffee shops and other attractions."
College Freshman,5,sports is well established atleast there are state of the art facilities but i will say it not that much vibrant because most students are commuters
College Freshman,5,well there are alots of malls and otlets around and students are not actually seen as student or a different part of the community they are seen as one. there are also lot of intrersting musuem in and out of town which is just a few minutes drive
College Sophomore,5,"Everything about the athletic department is great.  Most teams do well, and there are many participants in the intramural sports.  There are several work study jobs that allow you to earn money and help out the program too.  Homecoming weekend is the best time of the year.  The football game is so much fun, sporting the school colors yellow and blue."
College Senior,5,"I enrolled at Worcester State University because of the structured BSN program. I am a learner that needs the support of others students. I am able to do projects and assignments online, however I do much better with on campus class rather than online classes."
College Senior,5,I am enrolled in the RN-BSN at Worcester State University. It is challenging to work and go to school. However the professors make the time invested a growing experiencing. I am becoming a better nurse due to their expertise and knowledge. I am also more effective. Because what matters most to me is making a difference in the life of others. That is why I chose this profession.
College Freshman,5,Sports Are on Top! Students and faculty are definitely dedicated to their sport(s). They work really hard and put on a great show during home games. Definitely representing Worcester State in a good way and makes us all proud to be Lancers!
College Junior,5,"In one of my courses, we had the officers on campus come into class and describe what efforts they are partaking in to better the safety of the campus."
Alum,4,"Small and manageable class sizes, campus size was great for walking to classes. Plenty resources for on and off campus jobs."
Sophomore,4,"I love Worcester State, its an amazing college with so many different clubs. I love how there is always something to do on campus."
Senior,4,"The class environment varied , some professors were great and some weren’t . Many taught well,  some didn’t . I like the student life but there are some figureheads in place . Not doing much just the title holder ."
Senior,4,"Worcester State University was a great college. From the first day I transferred, they were very helpful and assist with everything. The campus is clean and a pleasant to be at while studying. The professors always had a time put away for students who needed extra help. I will be finishing up courses in May and Worcester State University has prepared me for Grad school."
Junior,4,Professors care and amazing major science majors to choose. I love being on campus and doing my homework at the library the library is very comfortable to study and relax. The campus has many great options to choose to eat especially on cool buffet.
Sophomore,4,I chose to attend Worcester State because I love the atmosphere and the small campus feel. Everyone here is very kind and helpful. I recommend that everyone looking to attend college at least consider Worcester State.
Freshman,4,"The faculty at Worcester State are helpful and genuinely invested in your learning and success. The student body is diverse and active, the campus is clean and the food available is great."
Sophomore,4,Worcester State is a great school that has many opportunities to build your resume and receive jobs after college. The teachers are very nice but sometimes I feel like they are just trying to make schooling difficult by putting questions on tests that we didn't cover. I think that they should only test us on what they teach and what is important because otherwise we do not receive the grades  that we deserve or learn as much.
Sophomore,4,"I love it here, the atmosphere is nice. It has an allergy free station which is very nice for gluten free students as myself. I love the activities (they sponsor bingos many times in the semester) and the classes are generally good though professors are another thing."
Freshman,4,"Quality of professors is not consistent, for example for one class you could have an A+ professor, then you go to your next class and you ask yourself how this person even managed to get a degree let alone a job. There are not many parties around, though there is a club down the street. Food is very good. New dorm building are very nice, though freshman dorms get very hot in the summer and freezing in the winter, and is not the cleanest. There are always campus police around, which makes the campus feel very safe, especially at nighttime being in the center of Worcester."
Freshman,4,"Worcester State is mainly surrounded by trees, which makes it very scenic. You can take about a twenty minute walk to Tatnuck square where there are a couple shops, or you can go to Main street and Park ave which is a little bit farther away in the other direction. The diversity here is pretty good, and as a minority I feel comfort being surrounded by people who look like me. This institution also has fairly good professors and academics. The food here is pretty good, and the dining hall has massive windows which brings in large amounts of light and provides a scenic view of the campus. Also, as an environmental science major I value the fact that Worcester State is a leader in efficient energy and environmental design. A fairly good institution, especially considering the fact that I pay essentially nothing for attending this college, due to their low cost and good financial aid."
Sophomore,4,I like the small class size and access to professors.  I would like to see the food quality to be improved.
Freshman,4,"From my time in Worcester state so far, I can definitely say that it is worth your time and money to come here. They are putting a lot of money into improving their campus in order to foster a great campus life and many different opportunities for students to study for their degree of choice. They are constantly adding new degree options and the school is quickly expanding with new facilities."
Niche User,4,"My experience with Worcester State University was great, I took a dual enrollment class and I really loved the class I took. Worcester State University has the major I want and see myself pursuing in the future. One thing I would want to change about Worcester State University is  for them to use common app to reach out for students who apply through common app."
Niche User,4,"I took a dual-enrollment class on Sociology and it was my first class at a college. My teacher was very laid back and he introduced us into the world of the statistics and real world experiences that was taught at Worcester State. It was very mind opening as the class progressed through the year. The most important lesson that I received through this class is that life and the real world is actually very cruel. What I mean by  that is that it is absurd, ranging from two headed frogs that mutated from polluted waters to kids being forced to mine for gold in order for their family to survive. I am very grateful for the experience that I received and now I am even more blessed to know that such things around the world are going on that I can choose to continue my path of pre-health or pre-occupational therapy because I wish to contribute to this world and be a part of making it a better place."
Junior,4,Worcester state has excellent programs. The professors and faculty at this school make the school. What I love about this school is the student to teacher ratio. The class sizes are smaller so you are able to get more one on one time with the professors.
Sophomore,4,"WSU community is really friendly and good for the students and other faculty member. Above all, the fee is really affordable here."
Senior,4,Being a student of multiple majors it is clear some departments are better staffed and are more student involved. One department I am involved in pushes students towards a career with no education experience to back it. the other department i am involved in is heavy on the educational experience and makes myself feel more confident about entering my career field.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have no complaints about Worcester State University.  I am not an overly involved student, so I do not have as much knowledge about the campus as others, but I have really enjoyed my first year here. All of my professors so far have been really excellent, two of them in particular, and I really feel solid on the path I am taking. My advisors are also extremely helpful and have brought clarity to the college experience. The work - load this year was quite manageable and effective. There is also a great atmosphere on the campus and the campus offers a variety of ways to get involved for the students who wish to. Lastly, the campus is easy to navigate and enjoyable.  There are many great locations to spend time with friends and classmates and they take pride in how they involve commuter students as well as residents."
Junior,4,"The psychology professors, especially Professor Soysa, were amazing and really invested in their students. I commute so I cannot speak to the living experience, but the students are all nice and friendly."
Senior,4,Worcester State has been great! I am graduating a semester earlier than expected. The campus environment is such a tight-knit community and you are guaranteed to meet life long friends here. One thing I would want to change about the campus is the lack of residence life event on the weekends.
Freshman,4,"What I like most about Worcester State University is how good their occupational program is. The classes that you take are very relevant. In order insure that you have a good experience, you must do research on potential teachers you could have. In addition, you should try to branch towards different. It is good to talk to as many people as you can to find who your friends are. As long as you find your friends, you will have the best experience of your life! Worcester State is also surrounded by many types of restaurants. It is great for trying new foods! While some say the dining hall at Worcester State isn't great, I think that if take a full look around you should be able to find good food (as long as you are not vegan or vegetarian). Overall, my experience at Worcester State is going great!"
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed it tremendously so far. As a sophomore, I've hardly seen everything, but what I have seen has been enjoyable and a real learning experience. All of the buildings are great (the gym is certainly a high point), and there's always a wide selection of food available. There are some professors I've become close with and have been great mentors to me, but pretty much all of them are willing to reach out and work with you if you need help."
Freshman,4,I like Worcester state because it is close to home and I don't have to live on campus. Worcester state is not that expansive and it is a nice school.  It offers lots of different majors and it is in a nice neighborhood.
Alum,4,"Pros: Great science teachers and programs, you get out of this what you put in. It will help you to be a hard worker. 
Cons: Not a big budget for extra circular activities, events are often cancelled if not enough people participate. 
I had a terrible time getting assistance from career services, they have no idea how to help people find jobs and were unable to guide me towards a career. This type of school does not help set you up with a job, therefore, I spent many years being confused and thinking that I was unable to get a job."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors are awesome for the most part. Political climate was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars, some professors very radical in political views and it shows a little to much in classroom setting. Students do not need to know political orientation of professor to get a good education."
Junior,4,"I currently attend Worcester State in pursue of a degree in Early Childhood Education and Psychology. This is one of the best school one can attend for an education degree. The campus is very nice and the food is better than I expected. I have loved most of my professors and have found the Worcester State staff to be very helpful. Overall, I am happy that I attend this school and already know that I would like to attend graduate school here as well."
Freshman,4,I like the sense of community there is and how there’s so many clubs and there’s always something to do in the city.
Sophomore,4,"It's a good school overall. I would personally like to see more student activities offered, better food selection, and more opportunities for students. Some professors are great, some are only average. I've enjoyed mine time at Worcester state so far"
Freshman,4,"I really like the campus size at WSU and the updated buildings. There are many activities and opportunities offered here. Also, there are several ways to get involved on campus. I'm very happy at my new home, WSU"
Freshman,4,"Worcester State has been great so far. The various departments and professors are super helpful and I've always gotten prompt repsonses from them when there's an issue. They really want to see young adults going to school and are super helpful about keeping you on track. The campus is easy to navigate and the classes are pretty cool. I would definitely recommend to someone who wanted a cheap, well-rounded school!"
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming community, with professors that care about what their teaching.  Not the best funded school, but considering how much less it costs than other schools, it's pretty nice.   Good academic support and tutoring, they are very invested in making sure you graduate in 4 years."
Freshman,4,I really like WSU! It’s a great school to attend! The only thing I would change is offering french as a major. Currently  french is only offered as a minor.
Junior,4,Many of the professors are great but there is not enough parking for all of the commuters that go here.
Senior,4,"What I like most about Worcester state university was the staff are very eager to help.  They are there in person  or via email, they want to see you succeed and do their best to help and to be hand on.  The college is a  very diverse campus I  would say that there are equal opportunity for all who really want it. . I would recommend this college to any one weather young , or older going back to college. Most of all it is public transportation assessable."
Junior,4,"After moving to Worcester, I was nervous to about start my college life in a new state. I first began with a 2.9 GPA but ended the semester with a 3.6 GPA. And it's all thanks to the amazing professors at the University. They know what they are teaching and are very helpful to students who need a bit more of help."
Freshman,4,"Teachers care about student success, small campus means you'll always run into a familiar face, #1 nursing school in the state of Massachusetts, incredibly affordable for a great education"
Junior,4,"Worcester State University offers a diverse community in a residential area of Worcester Massachusetts. They have recently upgraded and built many new facilities. The latest being the Health and Wellness Center. It is a state of the art facility used by all students not just student athletes. Two new residence halls have been constructed within the last 7 years. Dowden Hall, the freshmen dormitory has been renovated in the last three years. Athletics are incorporated well into the student body. It's nice to go to a game and cheer on our Lancers with your friends. WSU offers many different majors and minors. Faculty to student ratio is low enough so that you're not just a number sitting in big lecture halls. Most faculty have worked professionally in their chosen field and are eager to share their professional experiences with students. Faculty are very approachable, for whatever reason. It's not uncommon to see faculty members eating lunch with students."
Junior,4,"This school is a hidden gem among expensive colleges nowadays, with a low cost, great education, wonderful resources, and excellent staff what more could you ask for?!"
Freshman,4,"Worcester State is a hidden gem in central Mass.  They've updated the facilities in so many ways!  New dorms, new classroom buildings, and a brand new student fitness center make this school a great place to go to school."
Sophomore,4,"My personal experience at Worcester State have been a positive one. The campus is small in size making it simple to walk to and from residence halls to class. A majority of he professors are easy to talk to and understanding, though the difficulty level of each course varies. It is a heavy commuter school so there is only a handful of residents. This causes activities to be little to none on the weekend, including finding a place to eat. Overall the food is average. The buildings are able to accommodate for the number of students though some are much newer than others such as Sheehan Hall and the Wellness Center. It is always challenging to find enough parking which is frustrating."
College Freshman,4,"If you get caught you're in deep trouble, but so many things go unseen"
College Freshman,4,Relatively small classes sizes aside from GenEd but even they are not huge
College Freshman,4,"All dorms except Dowden (tradition al freshman hall) are fairly new and well kept, plus air conditioned!!!"
College Freshman,4,"I've only been here a month at it already feels like home, wouldn't can it for the world!"
College Junior,4,Love the small class sizes. Professors really tend to be able to learn names of they want to.
College Junior,4,"I have yet to try myself, but I have heard from people within my major that they have had very good luck with WSU's name on their degree."
College Junior,4,"Dowden (freshmen hall) is absolutely awful and 80°+ year round. Wasylean is awesome though, full apartments with kitchens and living rooms!"
College Junior,4,We have a brand new wellness center after 2 years of construction!
College Senior,4,Campus crime is very low. Worcester State is very strict when it come to punishing people who commit crime or intend to commit crime on campus.
College Senior,4,"The local companies in New England give priority to local students, career wise. The alumni is involved and is helpful with student internships and prospective careers."
College Senior,4,The athletic facilities are new. A lot of students attend the campus activites in support of school spirit.
College Senior,4,"So far school is great, the staff has been helpful. The school is easy to get around, since I am a commuter. There are many activities for commuters. The teachers are understanding and are willing to stay after class, if needed. The atmosphere is positive, as well as the learning environment."
College Junior,4,"There is fair amount of classes offered, it isn't the greatest variety depending on your major, but the ones that are offered are taught well. The instructors provide you with a great deal of resource information and background to help you succeed. Like any school, registration for classes can be a hassle, but with the internet now open for registration the process has been dramatically reduced in complications."
College Junior,4,There are many people from all walks of life here.
College Junior,4,The campus police take it pretty seriously and I generally don't see much of it ever
College Junior,4,The quality of my classes thus far has been great and the professors are both knowledgeable in their topics and passionate about the courses
College Junior,4,I have not encountered an issue with an safety concerns in my time at Worcester State University
College Junior,4,"This is my second time attending Worcester State University. I previously went here in 2002, and enjoyed my time, and once I returned last year I found the school to be just as wonderful as I remembered. They have up to date technology and the teaching staff have all been very passionate and well educated in their disciplines. I truly am glad I returned here!"
College Freshman,4,I will recieve the best education
Junior,2,I have taken many classes online and I have to say they were not the best. Many of my online classes the were just reading and then writing a reflection or answering questions for assignments. I think I would have benefited more f there was more elaborate assignments for the online classes.
Junior,2,Worcester State is very big and had a lot of diversity. There is just major communication issues between departments and also they are not well organized.
Niche User,2,"Bad experience. I tried getting simple accommodations and I was told that my problems weren't ""severe"" enough for accommodations despite 2 letters from licensed professionals. Shuttle service and resident parking situations are horrible. Also, not enough dining options for allergies, gluten-free and vegans."
Niche User,2,"Horrible School! I transferred out after a year and a half. The only good academic programs are nursing and natural sciences, the rest have very limited resources and are practically ignored by the school. Very few clubs, the most present ones are either exclusive or awkward/racist. Food will make you sick. Living on campus was boring, parties were few and far between and VERY cliquey. I cannot stress enough how cliquey WSU is, good luck making friends with people of a different race/sexual orientation/general hobbies as people will be plain out rude to you if you're different from their clique."
Sophomore,2,"I am currently a Biology major, and saying this including my two other sister who've taken the same major, it is very compact with information and stressful. The instructions in the laboratory are often unclear, and the professors skim through the information. The university has potential, but they really need to fix the curriculum for bio classes."
Sophomore,2,"You will get a good education for the price, and that is it. The campus life here is dead whether you are a commuter or resident. Many commuters have the ""Go to class, go home"" attitude and residents mostly lock themselves in their rooms rather than get involved. The college does its best to get students involved, but the student's priorities lie elsewhere."
College Senior,2,Worcester State University is currently building a new athletic building.
College Freshman,2,I think campus housing is honestly torture. Getting a roommate easy and I loved my roommate but we both hated campus housing.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The woman I met with, Jill, was extremely friendly and helpful. However the school didn't allocate enough resources for career services to be effective."
College Freshman,2,Unsafe. No fun. Constantly smells like weed. Way too loud at night
College Sophomore,2,There;s not much school sport spirit. Probably because they constantly lose and are devision three. Most student do not put attention the teams
College Sophomore,2,"We have a no substance policy on campus, so there are rarely parties on campus. No alcohol, even if you're 21. It is far more common to leave and go to another campus."
College Student,2,"The school is mostly women. Overall, the students tend to be pretty average in appearance. Attractive students definitely tend to stand out, and there are very few of them. Most of the students wear PJ's/athletic gear to class."
College Student,2,Your options are either going off-campus to a party at another school or drinking alone in your dorm. Not great.
College Student,2,"I've never really had anything great at WSU. The options are extremely limited, and the healthier foods in the commuter cafe are pretty over priced and hard to find. The fries are excellent, though. Everybody loves the fries."
College Freshman,2,"There are apartments next to the school, but houses are far away, mostly over ten minutes driving distance.  I would not recommend living off campus, especially since there are new dorms being built."
College Senior,2,There really isn't one sport that receives much fan support. Sports are really not a factor nor is school spirit. This may be due to the fact that we are a state school. The gym facilities though are being re-done and will be amazing by this upcoming 2014 fall semester. As of right now they are both athletic friendly and student friendly. Team performance are mediocre. They football field and baseball field were recently done over as of 2007 2012 respectively.
College Freshman,2,It is pretty strict here. Definitely no parties.
College Freshman,2,We need a new gym. They are supposed to tear it down...eventually.
College Sophomore,2,There are no Organic food options on campus. The food in the main dining hall is bad. The commuter cafe is better in the first floor of the student center. The food options are weird and poor. 
Senior,1,Worst experience ever i transferred form QCC and advised everyone do not waist your money at WSU. Horrible advising staff professors dont even speak English half the time and than give you bad grades because they suck at their jobs
Freshman,1,"I was here for one semester before I transferred out. Campus life is completely dead, especially on the weekends. I had many issues with teachers. I had to switch out of 3 of my 5 courses because the teachers just did not know how to teach. Also, don't expect to be close to anything. The closest Target is like 20 minutes away. Off-campus lot always fills up with people who park there without a permit, so good luck with parking. Also, the shuttle drivers are crazy sometimes."
Junior,1,"Transfer here from local community college after getting my associates, literally stayed one semester and left to another institution. Financial Aid and all other staff are nothing short of useless and not transparent on anything. Financial office thieves stole money from me. Most professors don't understand that mom and dad aren't paying for everything. Do yourself a favor and just look elsewhere, the cost is not worth the treatment you get. Throughout the whole semester I was there the only experience I recall that was enjoyable was filling out the paperwork stating I was transfering."
Junior,1,"If your degree is Biology, you will have one of the worst experiences of your life at Worcester State University. The curriculum is extremely a poor set up, and you will not learn or remember much of anything after the semester is over.  It is literal regurgitation of information you hardly understand yourself. Some of the professors have even refused helping me on example problems I've provided, and tutors are not reliable because they're either not available or they cannot teach you properly. I am extremely disappointed because I was expecting this time of my life to expand my knowledge of the science I've grown fascinated by, but all I was left was bitter disappointment. Two of my sisters graduated with a biology degree at this university, and they've also said they've had a poor experience. I only came here due to cost sake, but even then they'll shake you out in expenses. If you want to learn biology, do NOT attend here. I regret every breath, step, and bull I've taken."
Niche User,1,"Do not go here. There's nothing to do there. They try to bill you extra money saying you owe them more, and they don't put all the billing in one bill and then you try to correct them and they don't answer their phones and are out of the office. Would rather spend $50,000 at a school in Boston "
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life at Worcester state university
College Senior,1,"We do not have Greek life, and I am very okay with that."
College Student,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek's at this school.
College Freshman,1,Haven't seen any effort in alumni support
College Freshman,1,"Unsafe, horrible teachers, horrible for residents, all there is to do is take an uber to another school or club and get drunk. Since I don't do that I have nothing fun to do. Campus life is dead."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not enjoy living at my school, along with awful food and housing options, it is not the place for me.  Administration and professors take forever to get back to you for emails and questions, and they don't seem as if they want to be here.  There has also been sexual assaults which makes the campus feel unsafe, and even with  the presence of campus police, it doesn't feel safe."
College Student,1,"I really, really hate this school. It's VERY small, doesn't have great physics or art programs, and the students are very cliquey. It feels like high school. The students are disrespectful to the teachers. A lot of people skip. The radio station and the GSA were my saving graces. Seriously, go check out the radio station. They're so friendly!"
College Freshman,1,It sucks. Unless you take a cab to another college around here.
College Freshman,1,The food is bad and there isn't much variety either.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is horrible on campus. The built a new dorm building where a parking lot was and now it is harder to get a spot. A resident can find one but usually in the garage only. Commuters also have horrible parking and may need to park off campus. 
College Sophomore,1,"You have to pay $50 to get a parking pass. However, in order to get a spot you must arrive before 7:30 even though classes don't begin for another hour. If you have a class at 12:00 there is no way you will find a spot. They have off campus parking with a shuttle however, the shuttle only holds 6-8 people and runs every half hour, never in sync with class times. Parking at this school in general is horrible."
College Junior,1,"If I could give the parking negative starts I would.  Parking is terrible for commuter students. Faculty and staff park wherever they can find an open spot regardless is they are taking a commuter spot or not.  Campus police never enforce parking rules or regulations unless it is a commuter breaking a rule. I have to arrive on campus 2 hours before my classes start simply to find a spot on campus.  the off campus parking the school provides is not logical to me because i go straight from class to work and cannot afford to wait the half hour the shuttle requires. The way commuters are treated is one of the reasons i wish i never attended Worcester State. if it was in my financial ability, i would transfer to a different school in a heartbeat."
College Junior,1,"I would not chose to attend Worcester State again because they have treated me, as a commuter student horribly.  The administration has made me feel like I do not matter to them and all they want me for is my money even though it is a state school and ""not for profit"".  I do not feel like my tuition is reflected in the education in am receiving.  The school is undertaking multiple construction projects at once and this makes parking on campus horrendous.  The more construction that happens, the less area commuter students have to park.  One would think that a commuter student NEEDS their car to attend class while a resident simply WANTS their car on campus, but the resident students get priority on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a mess. Even if you arrive half an hour before your class you spend most of it looking for a spot. There just doesn't seem to be enough parking to go around. They recently added an option for students to park at the near by airport and take a shuttle back and forth. Airport parking is a huge inconvenience because it is a 30 minute ride back and forth.

Freshman,5,"Any time I need to contact someone higher up about financial aid or any other needs, I always receive quality answers and genuine responses. I'm never made to feel like I'm asking silly questions."
Freshman,5,"Drury is filled with employees that strive to help you achieve your goals. Most, if not all, of the teachers, are very open and available if you need some extra help. You're given multiple opportunities throughout your classes to get more help, and/or extra credit. I'd highly recommend their online programs."
Freshman,5,Drury is an awesome small school that takes excellent care of their students! They work hard to insure small class rooms and personal interaction as well as close bonds between all students and faculty.
Freshman,5,Drury University has been an amazing educational experience for my first year In College. I am majoring in Music Therapy and the field and this schools program for it are fantastic. All of the teachers I have had so far far extremely and are always engaging in their teaching. The campus is beautiful with trees and fountains that are calming and relaxing. One thing that does sometimes come up that I don’t like is how little the music programs funding is especially for equipment but everything else about my experience has been great!
Senior,5,Drury is a beautiful campus that provides an atmosphere that is completely separate from the surrounding hustle and bustle of the surrounding city of springfield its like its own little world. Its full of friendly faces and its small enough to walk to anywhere on campus if you're staying in student housing.  The classes average to less than 30 students per classroom providing a very productive learning environment and a lot of personal attention in which the professors take a great interest in your success and will go to great lengths to work with you.
Freshman,5,All around great experience! I am extremely happy to have chosen such a great college to go too!  The online classes are amazing for condensed learning styles and give you as much knowledge as possible in that short amount of time.
Freshman,5,"What I like about Drury University is that because it is so small, the class sizes are small and inviting and the professors will know you on a first name basis and are more than willing to schedule out of class time to meet with you and help you improve on whatever you need help with."
Sophomore,5,"Drury has been an awesome school so far. Every professor I have knows my name outside of class/when I just pass them on the sidewalk. The class sizes are small and the work is very relevant, not just busy work. My advisor has been a tremendous help to me in so many ways and I have only been at Drury for less than a month."
Freshman,5,"They have an amazing online program with a huge variety of classes. All of the professors are amazing and understanding. They work really hard with you to get where you need to be, so you can be as successful as you expect yourself to be."
Sophomore,5,"Drury University in Springfield, Missouri has provided me with an excellent beginning to my academic and athletic collegiate career. Drury is a smaller school in a bigger town of about 200,000. What I like best about Drury is the sense of community and feeling of family that is established by the students and professors alike. Everyone at Drury is in it together and this provides a very healthy environment that allows you to learn and do your work in the most efficient way. I hope to see Drury continue to grow in size and still keep its community feeling."
Niche User,5,I am enrolled in Drury's online classes for Dual Credit in my high school. The teachers are great and always willing to help if you put in the effort.
Alum,5,Drury provides a top notch education while making it easy for a person like me to work full time and be a full time student.  They prepare you well for your career after graduation.
Sophomore,5,I've only been here for a year and I've fallen in love with the school!!! Drury University is a place to call home for anybody!!
Senior,5,The Professors constantly encourage you to excel and keep working hard. It is a positive learning experience. The university employees are all friendly and helpful.
Niche User,5,I love that Drury offers small classes both online and in a class room. You definitely get that one on one attention that you don't get at most colleges!
Freshman,5,The law enforcement academy at Drury university is one the best programs I have had the pleasure of attending. The instructors are knowledgeable on the subject matter and put time and effort into helping each  student understand the subject matter and to excell as future law enforcement officers.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere just walking the campus is one of the best I've seen. Since its a relatively small private school, most everyone knows each other. Not to mention their academics are absolutely stellar, and when it comes to architecture, they're one of the top schools in the country if that says anything at all. The diversity here is amazing, with about a fifth of the population being international students. Overall, it's just amazing."
Sophomore,5,"Drury University feels like a home away from home! You can easily get from one building to another, and you can meet almost everyone on campus. You can easily go to Wal-Mart and to the mall. There are plenty of food places."
Freshman,5,"I love it at Drury! I just finished my first semester, The only problem I have had at Drury is the food is not very good. The professors are great, the environment is great!"
Sophomore,5,I truly love attending Drury through the online program. I live in California and the professors work very well with students. I’ve had the flu and missed a week of assignments and the professors worked with me to make up my assignments. They are always available for questions and open to suggestions. It makes online learning fun and easy. At first I was nervous because I am a visual hands on learner but through the many resources and class discussions it helped my learn another way to learn. I truly recommend Drury!
Senior,5,Drury University was the best place for me to get my education. The people are friendly and I made best friends for life. They are also creating a master plan that will set the university for years to come.
Niche User,5,I loved my experience at Drury. They want you to feel involved and the campus is beautiful. No matter where you go there is a smiling face!
Junior,5,"The thing that I like most about Drury University is the class size.  Because the class sizes are small, you are able to have a better connection with the professor.  While many professors at big universities can't with a face to a name, the professors at Drury can.  The classes are tough, but just about any college classes are going to be.  You know that you are getting a good education by attending this school."
Freshman,5,I love that Drury is really a community inside the campus. Since class sizes are pretty small it's easy to make an appointment with a professor and get one on one help.
Junior,5,I like Drury because of its small and close knit community. It's in Springfield which is in a big enough town to get away from campus when needed. Drury's faculty is amazing. They really care about the students and that absolutely makes a difference.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school and would recommend it to nearly everybody. The entire student body is an amazing community with lots of great people and amazing friends. And the professors are absolutely amazing and hands-on. They are also very concerned for the students and their personal lives due to the low student to teacher ratio. Overall, it is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"From the moment of enrollment, my personal advisor has been fantastic. I have been able to add or drop classes, and generally do everything I need through email with my advisor. The class sizes are small and the professor gives great individualized feedback throughout the course. I am  very happy with Drury and would recommend them anyone."
Niche User,5,Drury is a very well put together school with a beautiful campus. I would definitely recommend going there.
Sophomore,5,Drury is awesome!!  The faculty and staff  genuinely care about the students and want nothing except success for us.   I am so glad I choose Drury!!
Niche User,5,"I toured around the college, and I had a great experience. My tour guide was extremely kind, and she knew all of the information that needed to be given to us. The campus was beautiful. It was well kept. The admissions counselor was very helpful with all of my questions. Drury offers my major that is dueled with another major. I absolutely love the campus, students, and people there. "
College Freshman,5,The security is very important on campus. There is a cop on patrol at all hours.
College Freshman,5,I chose to live in Smith Hall and I love how the room is laid out!
Recent Alumnus,5,Class sizes are amazing and the professors really care about you.
College Junior,5,"I came from a community college that knew very little about who I was and/or who I wanted to be, but Drury University not only knows who I am they are constantly encouraging, and guiding me to become who I aspire to be."
College Senior,5,I am so excited to pursue another degree from Drury.  I felt very successful in biology and am now looking forward to adding to my knowledge about psychology.
College Senior,5,Housing is not that bad.  It could be better. I was great to live in close proximity to campus and very close to friends.  It felt like a family there and I loved being so close.
College Senior,5,"Athletics has been such an important part of my life.  I have swam here at Drury for 16 years.  I've seen the pool facility get a much needed remodel and it increased student body attendance, which was great.  I loved every experience here at Drury and that is why I want to come back to continue my education here!"
College Senior,5,Drury University has the atmosphere of a small university but also has the professors of a highly competitive university.  The amount of knowledge I have learned here at Drury is amazing.  It has led me to want to continue to learn to feed my wealth of knowledge. I want to continue my education in order to make the best career decision.
College Freshman,5,I love all of my professors and classes!
College Freshman,5,Drury University is incredible. I have very personal and educated professors who care about me and want to help me succeed. I have small class sizes so I am never left confused after lectures. I have found a field I love and I am learning more and more each day! Learning is fun at Drury.
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe and supported when on campus
College Freshman,5,The professors really take an interest in each student
College Freshman,5,"I cheerlead for basketball, so I really like going to games and getting involved in school spirit"
College Junior,5,A degree from Drury opens lots of doors
College Student,5,I always feel very safe on campus especially when I see security driving around all the time
College Student,5,I love Sunderland it's perfect in every way
College Freshman,5,I didn't have to be ranked with the rest of the applicants. It was a fair process!
College Freshman,5,Drury Is one of the bigger state schools. they are well know and Drury sports are the best
College Senior,5,Haven't really seen a drug problem.
College Senior,5,Don't really see a lot of partying.
College Senior,5,I love Drury. Wouldn't change my choice.
College Student,5,"My school has only about 2,500 students a 14:1 student teacher ratio and the teachers actually care. They invite us to their houses, meet outside of class time with us to do activities, and sometimes take class time and turn it into a learning environment doing field trips or just going outside. They allow us to call or email them constantly even when we are panicking and need help. And all of which they do willingly. And if we need time outside of class and their office hours they will put time aside for us. The professors truly care about students, their opinions and how they are feeling. Which is something that should be important at any academic university."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Drury University and the way it prepares me with a liberal arts education. I feel very diversified in my education, with a variety of backgrounds in politics, math, language, ethics, social sciences, etc. My professors have a network of internship companies for architecture firms that they can connect students with to get that required engaged learning experience. There are some on-campus jobs, and they usually work pretty well with students and their schedules. The career center/services and tutoring on campus are helpful. We have counselors who you can talk to. Choosing a good academic advisor is important. They can really help you with your classes once you know your major."
College Freshman,5,I am happy with my choice of school
College Freshman,5,"Drury has small classes, which I love. The teachers are very attentive to each student, and the small class size makes the classroom very intimate."
College Sophomore,5,"Drury is my dream school! I never would have imagined myself getting my Bachelors' out of state, but here I am! They came to my school in the middle of Arkansas in a town no one's heard of, and somehow they managed to stand out among all the colleges represented at our fair. I requested more information but had intended on going somewhere in-state like Henderson or Tech, so I didn't think too much about Drury. Until I came across a pendant right outside one of my teacher's doors that reminded me of how friendly the recruiters were, how honest they were about their experience and stories, and how small the student-faculty ratio was, so I scheduled a campus visit just for kicks. The second I set foot on campus I feel in love, and continued to fall deeper in love as the visit progressed. After seeing the gorgeous campus, meeting the incredible faculty who accepted me as if I were already part of the Drury family, and sat in on a Drury Singers rehearsal (which for a choir nerd like myself was heavenly), I pretty much had my heart set on campus. Coming from a low-income household, and with Drury being a private school, I knew there would be struggles; however, my counselor did everything in her power to get me every penny of financial aid she could find. She'd even call me outside of her office hours to  excitedly tell me she'd found something or that she managed to extend the deadlines of certain applications for me! Now having been here over a year, I can honestly say I love it even more each day, and I could never see myself going anywhere else. Yes, it would be simpler, more convenient, and more financially feasible to go to an instate school, but no school in Arkansas can offer the same warmth around the campus (even though it's colder here) or the efficiency of the education or anything else on my long list of things that I love about Drury. This school has become a part of me."
College Senior,5,I love everything about my school! I have had an absolutely amazing experience so far!
College Sophomore,5,I love my school. It has a great liberal arts mindset and an awesome teaching staff in the architecture program. I love campus life and Greek life. The opportunities provided at Drury are endless and varied. Being part of clubs and interest groups definitely help to make the experience more enriching. There are many volunteer and leadership opportunities too. The campus is also beautiful
College Freshman,5,Everyone that I have had the pleasure of meeting on campus have been fantastic. They are all so different and make everyday a new experience.
College Freshman,5,The Greek Life that I have experienced at Drury has been amazing. The chapters dont judge people on their appearances during recruiting but what is on the inside. It is really amazing to be apart of an organization that allows students to be themselves and be unique and add to the chapter
Alum,4,I loved the small school feel with big school opportunities.  I made some great lifelong friends when I was there.
Senior,4,I like the small classes and ability to move about the campus easily without a 20 minute commute across the campus.
Alum,4,"I love the people of Drury University! The students, faculty and staff have all made my experience there amazing. There are some problems that come with the school being small, such as some understaffing and limited course availability, but it is still a great school to attend."
Alum,4,"All of the online courses I took at Drury were very professional and planned out. My professors were very easy to communicate with, and the assignments were more than just busy work. I learned some important information from every class I took online."
Freshman,4,I have not taken any online classes with Drury but some of my friends have and I have heard good things about the staff! Technology is a hard this to master!
Senior,4,Drury University is the embodiment of a liberal arts education. Small class sizes and teacher involvement create a casual but academically rigorous environment. Recreation sports and collegiate basketball are big on campus. If you have any passion you'll be able to find a club for it on Drury's campus!
Senior,4,Private school which gives opportunity to all types of students to get education. It affordable and the staff are always helpful in insuring the students needs are met.
Sophomore,4,"Drury is proving t be a wonderful university to attend. My biggest issue is just the price tag, but that is understandable seeing as it is a private school."
Niche User,4,"Public and private. Big and small. Four-year, community, and technical schools. With more than a dozen local colleges and universities, Springfield, Missouri, is very much a thriving city with a focus on higher education."
Junior,4,"Overall, my experience at Drury has been great! It is a beautiful, small campus with a family-like atmosphere. While it's not in the safest part of Springfield, campus security has a big presence and there is an SPD substation on campus. We have great athletic programs and awesome student life activities."
Junior,4,I like how the teachers are fair and the courses aren't too difficult; allowing me to have work/school/life balance. I like how the teachers give responses on the homework submitted so I can have an idea on what to improve and what I am doing well on. I appreciate the online CCPS program because it is the most convenient. I don't like how the counselors are only available during certain hours as that doesn't typically work with my work schedule. But I will add that the faculty and staff do try to find more convenient ways to get in touch with me to answer my questions and tend to my needs.
Junior,4,"I transferred in from a local community college, so I can't speak for the full four-year Drury University experience or living on campus, however in the year that I have been here I can definitely agree that ""The Drury Difference"" is something. Class sizes are at the max about 20-25 people, but often times its fewer.  There's only six of us in my upper level media class and only eight in my Chinese History class (12-15 in some other communication classes about around 20 in Spanish). The professors, hence, have a real relationship with EVERY student. They have been a great help to me and I've seen the same with others."
Senior,4,"I have liked my experience at Drury. The classes I’ve taken were excellent, and the professors are always willing to provide individual feedback for students. I wish Drury had a better reputation, because it truly is a good school. I also wish it was in a more diverse area- Springfield, MO is not very diverse at all."
Junior,4,"I really love the Drury campus as it is really beautiful and makes walking to classes really peaceful. There are also a lot of interesting people from all over and this diversity opens people up to new ideas and points of view. I would like for there to be more foreign language classes taught on campus- such as Korean. While there is the opportunity to study foreign languages at MSU, not everyone can fit it into their schedules or get to MSU for their class."
Junior,4,"Though the academics and professors are all very helpful and caring the athletics at this school are poorly monitored when it comes to the issues of hazing. They have had many incidents in the past and are sure to have many more if they do not change the way that they treat those that see it and let it happen, whether it be faculty or athletes."
Sophomore,4,I love Drury University and I am very happy i chose to attend this college. It is a friendly environment and very easy to navigate your way around. Almost all classes have a max of 30 students there-for  allowing more one on one time with  teachers.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending Drury University. The classes are small, and it is easy to know other students around campus. The professors are very helpful and easily accessible, whether it be after class with questions about that days lecture, or by email or office hours."
Freshman,4,This school is supportive of it's students and allows them to thrive in their own individual ways. The diversity on this campus is great and all the students are confident and supportive of their friends and peers. Drury University is a great school and over all I am excited to be a part of this family
Niche User,4,"Most gorgeous campus in Missouri, and by far the best school in Springfield! The only flaw with this school is it's price of tuition. If you can afford $33,000 a semester this is the school for you."
Freshman,4,"Drury is an awesome school! Everybody is friendly and helpful, even if you do not know them. The classes are super informative and the teachers actually know what they are talking about. The campus is beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"Drury is a great small liberal arts school where you really get to know most of the students and professors. However, the small size also means that there are limited classes you can take."
Freshman,4,"Drury's campus is beautiful; it feels like a miniature town inside of Springfield. The teachers are wonderful and really throw themselves into serving the students. I love Drury's opportunities, but I would love to see an increase in scholarships. As an art student, my major is in fine arts. I went above and beyond for an art scholarship, only to receive 1,000 dollars. I feel like a lot was required for me to receive and maintain this scholarship. Because I am devoted to Drury's art program, I wish this scholarship was between 5,000 and 10,000 dollars."
Freshman,4,"I have nearly completed my first semester at Drury and I couldn't be happier! Since I'm from California, it's obvious that Missouri is quite a ways from home. Despite the near 1,800 mile difference, I feel much at home here in Springfield. The professors and advisors are wonderful, real genuine people that want nothing more than to help you succeed in life. "
College Freshman,4,I love the size of classes. Smaller classes make me feel more open and able to connect with everyone better. The Professors are able to get to know their students on a personal level.
College Freshman,4,Many students leave Drury with a job already lined up.
College Freshman,4,Drury is such a personal experience. The Professors and staff really care about the student's needs. I would definitely choose Drury again and again. The only downside is the cost. I am struggling to find ways to pay for it.
College Junior,4,"Again, I am not a traditional college student so I have never lived in a dorm; however, some of my friends use college housing and the quality of the rooms are great. I find that the dorms are kept updated and clean. It's a great social environment as well."
College Junior,4,"I have a lot of friends who on in the Greek Community and although I have not chosen to join one myself, I can say that I have donated to some of their great causes and charities."
College Junior,4,"Because I take only online courses and hardly ever go on campus let alone to an athletic event, all I can say is that the pictures, videos, and students I know who participate are enough to show that Drury thrives not only in academics, but also in sports."
College Sophomore,4,I love the class sizes.  They make the learning experience with the professors very personal.  It also makes it easier to get extra assistance when needed.
College Sophomore,4,"Most students who graduate already have a job or they have been accepted to graduate school, because of Drury's reputation."
College Sophomore,4,"I have a service animal, so I have been in a two bedroom campus apartment.  It's been nice, but I have had multiple problems with plumbing and electrical outlet and light problems."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not an athletic person.  Drury doesn't have a football team and I'm not that interested in softball, baseball or basketball, so I don't attend sporting events that often."
College Sophomore,4,Drury has a lot to over their students.  It is too expensive and they need to restructure their refund system to a prorated system.
College Senior,4,I actually took a self-defense class given by police officers and I thought it was great.  I feel better just walking into bars and on campus from night classes. I don't really think many people take it very seriously so it would be cool if more people would take the classes that are offered so more classes will be held in the future.
College Freshman,4,Students and faculty work hard to keep campus safe.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is great. You are close to any and all resources you might need. It is great for people who are extroverted and enjoy socializing.
College Freshman,4,"It is great for those who are interested! Some people love Greek life, some people prefer not to join. It is a personal decision."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic teams are supported by faculty and students, but so is the rest of the student body."
College Sophomore,4,Works great with work schedule
College Sophomore,4,Works great with work schedule
College Sophomore,4,Very easy to work with
College Sophomore,4,Drury provides the best opportunity for me.
College Freshman,4,Everything about the academics is great.  The only issue I have is the cost of attendance.
College Freshman,4,There are all kinds of races in fraternities and sororities as well as LGBT students.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life alumni provide a great network.  There are opportunities for students to participate in internships and work during the summer as camp counselors.
College Freshman,4,I love the class sizes.  The music professors make learning a lot of fun.
College Freshman,4,I have a service animal and they accommodate me with a two bedroom apartment.  It works very well.
College Freshman,4,"I wasn't interested in joining Greek life, but I did and I'm glad I did."
College Freshman,4,The women's softball team and the men's basketball team are great.
College Freshman,4,Drury University is a great college for people who do not want a large campus but have the social life of a large campus.  The student teach ratio is great for students who need a little extra help.
College Freshman,4,Drury is a prestigious school
College Freshman,4,"Although there are not many different fraternities and sororities, the people in them are very passionate about the organizations"
College Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my time here so far, and really like how much the professors care"
College Student,4,Professors at drury are great. They are very nice and accommodating to students with needs.
College Junior,4,I don't live on campus
College Junior,4,I really don't know anything about the greek life
College Student,4,Greek life looks like a ton of fun.
College Student,4,Our sports teams are all good at what they do and it reflects well in the university
College Student,4,I really enjoy it here. The teachers are great in every way
Niche User,2,I went to Drury for two years. It was very overpriced for what it was. The campus looked old and run down and the area of Springfield it is in is not a good area. It is walking distance to where people get shot practically daily. The people that go there are all either on full rides or have donated so much money to the school that they only got accepted for their money.  Therefore there are only rich snobs or super smart loners to hangout with.
College Sophomore,2,Several date rape drugs have been used and there have been alleged rapes where drugs and alcohol have been involved.
College Junior,2,They never knew when you would get your money and it could take months before  you received your cash.
College Junior,2,"Small town life, very little to rent from."
College Junior,2,The restaurants in the area don't really have much diversity outside of downtown. Even there your options are pretty limited after going down a couple times. Either you want fast food or bar food.
College Junior,2,There reaslly isn't a lot to do in Springfield aside from going downtown and drinking. There is always first friday artwalk but it's mostly 15 year old kids. The city has been rated as the most dangerous city to live in per capita. That says a lot.
College Junior,2,It seems to be mostly rich kids or exchange students.
College Sophomore,2,"The RA's and other housing faculty are wonderful and cheerful, and there are some pretty good community events sometimes. The buildings are lovely to look at, but awful to live in, and no room on campus is worth half of what they charge."
College Freshman,2,A good portion of the students don't have to worry about financial aid so when you do it is a hassle.
College Freshman,2,The dining options are not very varied but the school tries to offer healthy options throughout the day.
College Sophomore,2,My school prefers to have students live on campus. If we do not want to live on campus we have to write the Dean to get approval. 
College Senior,2,"It is ok, the school was suppose to be the tops but the more I here business people talk, the less they like the direction it is taking."
College Senior,2,This area has a lot of apartments but most are now school property. There are six college or higher systems in Springfield and students pouring in so housing very difficult to secure.
College Senior,2,"The registration process is always to me a hassle, you have to talk with an advisor for each time to reenter so you have to go in. with a busy schedule that is hard to do. And the Financial Aid office is very difficult with processing things especially the VA stuff."
College Student,2,The process for applying for financial aid is very time consuming and difficult.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I think it would be nice if upon showing your student ID, a small discount could be given."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you are a non-traditional student and leaving off campus, this means you have housing expenses. You are working and going to school. And i found Drury was rated very poor in trying to help me find scholarships and pointing me in the direction to have additional assistance beyond the pell to help with housing costs."
College Junior,2,It was always hard to talk to someone who could answer my questions. Some times it would take a few weeks for a call back.
College Sophomore,2,Doesn't snow a whole lot but is very icy sometimes and as long as the campus is ok they have school making a difficult decision for off campus students whether to go to class or not.
College Sophomore,2,The ticketing is stupid there. All I feel like the security guards do is just go around and try to write tickets all day. Also there is very little parking available for off campus students.
Graduate Student,1,"I went to Drury university a few years ago and it was alright, not the best experience, but I got my degree. And a lot of the teachers (especially online ones) where lack luster in actually teaching. Usually not giving any teaching, using a book program to teach you while they sit on their ass and do nothing to help. And what they did to my brother when he went this semester is horrid. They have gone down hill. They are closed minded and don't give a shit about their students. They do nothing to help anyone who is struggling. And if you are seeking help of any kind, they don't give it. They refuse to refund money after 2 weeks of school. WTF. I do not recommend going there. I am so disappointed in them. I feel even worse that I recommended this p.o.s. school. I'm making sure that no one I know will go there."
Graduate Student,1,Online sucks. The teachers don't put any effort in the learning process and can't even keep up with their own schedules. Had a teacher give us a 20pg report that was due two weeks before school ended and you had a final. I had other classes! This is something that should have been given a month or two in advance. And you pay more for less! Wouldn't suggest it if you actually want a learning experience.
College Sophomore,1,They literally don't let you live off-campus unless you have an exemption and they're impossible to get.
Recent Alumnus,1,I am a non-traditional students and we are not allowed to join clubs/organizations/sorority's and do not get into games for free like the traditional students. We are not allowed to get a job either--it's only for day students.
College Senior,1,it is mostly fast-food places with very little imagination
College Senior,1,"Think of the most average American person you know.  Politically conservative, but liberal enough to talk about it. Caucasion, middle class, parents can afford to help or completely fund a private university education. Everybody is comfortable only being friends with people like them and differences are verbally and socially noted.  Welcome to Drury."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Give It a Minute. The humidity is very high in the Ozarks. Winters haven't been to severe as of late but usually get ice instead of snow. One thing is for sure, if you don't like the weather outside, wait 10 minutes and it will change."

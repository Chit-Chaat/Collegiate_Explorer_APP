Sophomore,5,"So far classes have been great. At the beginning of the semester, classes were held online and I did not enjoy that as much. I felt as though I wasn't really retaining any of the information I was being taught. The professors understood that and did everything they could to help each and every single one of us does our best."
Sophomore,5,Chaminade is a great school to which the faculty and staff are dedicated to your learning skills. The class sizes are small which make it easier for teachers to help the students one on one. Every teacher makes sure that every single student understands the material. Everyone is always checking up on each other and just making sure everyone is okay.
Junior,5,All of my professors have been extremely kind as we adapt to online learning. It's much less stressful of an experience than that of other schools according to my friends.
Alum,5,I do not prefer taking classes online but the professors I had have proved me otherwise. They were very accommodating. Some classes were challenging but not too difficult.
Alum,5,I loved everything about this school. I was a transfer student but I wished that I had started off here in the first place. Everyone is so welcoming.
Sophomore,5,Online classes at Chaminade are amazing with flexible teachers that allow to work around your schedule.
Sophomore,5,Chaminade university of Honolulu is a small college with teachers and students that actually care about your well being.
Alum,5,I like that Chaminade has a choice between the quarter system and semester system when going to school online. It allows students to work at their own pace. The professor were super helpful and it made my online experience awesome.

Junior,5,"I love the sense of family spirit at this school. Being that it is such a small school,  it easy to get to know everyone very well and you'll always have someone to say hello to while walking through campus. The small class sizes help me to be able to get to know my professors better and get the help that I really need in order to succeed. My only wish for this school is to see the price go down as it is very expensive."
Sophomore,5,"Throughout my experience at Chaminade University, I have enjoyed the small classes. This allows, the student to have one-on-one attention with professors about important projects or new class topics. In additions, the professors are fair and organized throughout the entire course to ensure the best educational needs. What s most important, is how knowledgeable each professor is in their department. I have learned way more then any other education throughout my college careers. 
The only thing I would change abut Chaminade is the portal to register for classes. It is outdated and somewhat confusing"
Junior,5,"Overall, Chaminade has helped me improve in my learning experience in Early Childhood Education. All my teachers I have had has always helped me at whatever time to better understand what I am learning."
Sophomore,5,"Chaminade has a variety of scholarships they offer students which can be really helpful. There's academic, religious, athletic, and many more scholarship opportunities that the school offers. I love that it's a small school so the students can have better relationships with professors, unlike big public universities where you can often get lost in the crowd. It's easier to get help or clarification when the professor knows you by name and has less students to think about. The small campus allows you to meet lots of new people and it helps when trying to make friends. I have been at Chaminade for two years now and I love it. The education is great quality, the professors are very helpful and make themselves available as much as possible to help students, and the environment is really friendly. I definitely recommend incoming college students to apply at Chaminade because you'll learn so much from great professors while making life long friends."
Freshman,5,"There are a few colleges in Hawaii, and this is the best one by far. The diversity, professors, and all around atmosphere make it second to none."
Sophomore,5,Chaminade is a small private university. The people and staff are very caring toward your education and assist to help you succeed.
Senior,5,"I enjoy the opportunities here at Chaminade University. With the small class sizes, I am engaged and able to contact the teachers easily when needed help. They are always willing to be there and have open offices. I also like how all the majors are separated so that the classes are not so far apart to walk up and down the hill."
Alum,5,I loved attending Chaminade. Smaller classrooms and no lecture halls. The professors know you by name and are always encouraging to help in any way they can. Admin staff are also very nice and welcoming. Campus is beautiful and very safe! A very friendly environment.
Junior,5,I am currently a junior at Chaminade University and have loved the experience so far. It is a real world experience especially due to the different students who join the school. I like that my idea of putting a coffee kiosk was given to the higher ups and became a boba stand! They really care about you and make sure your time is spent doing something meaningful. The things you are taught mean something to your future and to the community you serve.
Junior,5,"This school is a home away from home. I came to Chaminade as a transfer student and because of that I understand just how lucky I am to be attending. The campus is hands down the most beautiful campus in the country. I can see the city and ocean from my dorm room, I'm less than 10 minutes from Waikiki beach, and the faculty and staff are kind, passionate, and genuinely want you to thrive."
Senior,5,The BSN program really helps you prepare for the diverse workforce in the nursing field to better prepare you for real life experiences. Classes are small so you get more one on one time with your professors which also help you to better grasp the concepts and skills need to become an excellent nurse!
Sophomore,5,"Love being a student at Chaminade University! I'll be a sophomore this coming 2018 Fall semester so I am very excited to go back. Every single staff and/or worker that I have encountered were all friendly and very approachable. I feel so welcome on campus. The professors all seems like they know what they're doing and I can easily approach them when I want to, which is great. There are also amazing events on campus that all the students can enjoy!"
Sophomore,5,"Chaminade University of Honolulu is a safe, nurturing environment and the staff members are great. You will be surrounded by students who are also very helpful. I  love that it is a small campus and the classes are easy to find. I also love the size of our classes, which allows for student and teacher interactions. Chaminade is a great institution that provides a lot of support for its students. I am in the science program, and it is very exceptional. They provide a lot of opportunities and are very encouraging with your goals and ambitions. However, I do wish it would be more affordable."
Graduate Student,5,I received my Bachelor's Degree from Chaminade University in 2018.  The teachers and staff always were helpful and easy to work with.  I recommend this school.
Freshman,5,"The school is awesome and the professors work well with educating their students. The staff is very informative and are their for everyone at Chaminade. All the classes are well kept up and the school is very clean. They provide everything you need to make sure you are educated in whatever field you choose. 
They believe in their students and go above and beyond to make sure they have everything they need and get the best education possible. They also offer buses for transportation to be able to go anywhere on the island at one cost and they offer scholarships to all their students."
Sophomore,5,"Chaminade University of Honolulu has small class, so you can get your questions answered. All faculty and staff is easily accessible, no waiting for an appointment to talk to a professor! Professors all come from unique backgrounds, and the students are there because they want to learn which makes any group projects actually fun."
Junior,5,"I have just transferred to Chaminade from University of Hawaii at West Oahu and I love it! The teachers are very helpful, I have more class availability, and my program is almost all online! If I could change anything about the school it would probably just to have it be more affordable, it is the only thing rough about my school."
Freshman,5,"I love that it is a small campus, beautiful and clean. The student to teacher ratio is low and the teachers are actual practitioners and very good instructors! The support from faculty and administration is awesome!"
Junior,5,The teachers are understanding and most make time to talk if you cannot visit during their office hours.  The classes are on the smaller side so the teachers and students get to know each other better
Junior,5,I love the diverse and positive energy on campus! Professors are really helpful and our campus is sorrounded by good places to eat!
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at Chaminade University has been quite eventful and most interesting.  I have met so many new people, I live in a different environment,  I am learning new things from different professors.  Being surrounded by those who support me as well makes college all the better"
Sophomore,5,The tuition may be high but its all worth it because Chaminade is where students find that they're more than just a number and the community that Chaminade creates for its faculty and students makes the experience at the school even better.
Senior,5,Chaminade University is a great college with a large diversity of student bodies and professors. The campus is a very safe place to be with a variety of resources being offered to the students at Chaminade.
Sophomore,5,"I love my school. There's many activities available for the students, and the people there are simply wonderful. The staff is great, and i enjoy meeting students from all over the world."
Graduate Student,5,Chaminade University has definitely been my stability during a trying time.  I'm active duty Army so a lot of times I get called on random missions and I need to leave Hawaii at a moments notice.  Chaminade has been there to adhere my concerns and have worked with me every time and have afforded me the ability to make up the work.
Freshman,5,"Going to Chaminade University has been amazing so far. The diversity of students that attend this university makes the experience much more better. You get to know different ethnicities, other people's story(s), and how they got to where they are now. The thing about Chaminade that is amazing, is that you get that one-on-one opportunity with the professor; when you are struggling with a context, you can ask for help without disrupting the entire lecture. The Campus is such an amazing scenery, beside going up the hill, the campus captures such an landscape environment which displays not only nature, but also the urban parts of Honolulu. The area around Chaminade is perfect, it the right size; you have Subway, L&L, McDonalds, Taste Tea, Teaspresso, and many more places to go an eat. Also, you can catch a bus that goes to the famous hiking trail in Honolulu, Diamond Head. Since Chaminade is such a diverse school, the food that they serve must be diverse as well."
Niche User,5,Well i did not start yet but I do work with a few chaminade graduates they are well educated and passionate to their patients. This is the kind of nurse I want to be!
Freshman,5,I love the small school environment and how we are able to form connections with almost everyone on campus.
Senior,5,"Chaminade University provides a warm and friendly environment with professors and staff who are supportive of and responsive to their students. In terms of academics, my experience has been positive with good professors and curricula that educates and prepares students for their future careers."
College Sophomore,5,It's small class sizes and helpful professors help
College Student,5,You can find everything online and if you can you can always call them and they are more than happy to help.
College Student,5,"I lived in Hawaii and it I loved the school. Then I moved and wasn't in school for a year and I would still receive emails from my consular seeing if I wanted to go back to school. When I decided to come back they helped me with classes, and what I needed to do. Staff is amazing and I am able to complete all my classes online."
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe and secure on campus. The small student body and small campus makes it easy to navigate and feel more secure.
College Sophomore,5,"I do not live in the dorms at my school, but I have friends who have and they say that the dorms are very."
College Sophomore,5,"My university is located on the island of Oahu, so the students that attend range from Polynesian background, Filipino, Caucasian, Asian, and so forth. This diversity has allowed me to meet new people from all types of cultures and experiences that I might never find back in Pennsylvania, where I am from. The staff is also very welcoming and the school feels almost like home to me."
College Freshman,5,Very great academics and professors teaching it.
College Freshman,5,"My school, Chaminade University of Honolulu turned out to be greater than I expected. It's easy to find your way around campus, the classes are small in number which is something that caught my attention since I've applied, it's a very friendly campus and the professors are easy to communicate with and good at their jobs."
College Freshman,5,The academics are great. i have already learned so much. the peers are great and the professors are very helpful.
College Freshman,5,There is always security on duty. all of the students have their number
College Freshman,5,I love the campus housing. i love that it is secure and you need a key to get in. i like the environment. it is very friendly.
College Freshman,5,"I honestly love Chaminade. The dorms are fun and hold alot of activities so that everyone living there will have a chance to talk and become friends. The school itself also holds a lot of activities. Another thing i like is that the school is small so you get to know a lot of people. There are lots of clubs so you can join whatever interests you. Another thing i love is that everyone is so friendly, from the students to faculty everyone is nice and willing to help."
College Sophomore,5,Amazing! Highly recommended. The professors are very supportive.
College Freshman,5,Love the four year guarantee plan that shows you where to go with your major.
College Freshman,5,Get good grades in high school so you receive a good merit scholarship.
College Junior,5,"Here on our campus, safety for the students is one of the university's priority. our gate for the school closes and 12 midnight. after that certain time all who came in late will have to present student ID in order to pass the security check point. Aside from that there are camera surveillance over the campus. the securities monitor the campus 24/7. if a visitors car come into our campus the security will have to follow up on the car if the car comes out late. since our school is one of the catholic schools here in Honolulu, the students safety is one of the most important priority."
College Junior,5,"There is a dining place near our campus, it is called st. louise drive inn. I chose this dining place because it is near my school and very convenient for us the students to dine there. the price of the food are acceptable and the food there are well cooked and served. another good thing about this place is that it opens until midnight, which we find it very convenient. after our late studies at night we would usually go down and eat."
College Junior,5,The school is locate in a great spot
College Junior,5,There is security everywhere when you need them
College Junior,5,The professor ls make learning very interesting and are very helpful
College Junior,5,I love everything they school has to offer their students
College Junior,5,Hopefully this helps with paying for school. A lot of students such as myself who also do tons of scholarships with essays can find time to do a survey real quick and hope for some extra money to help even more pay for college
Junior,4,All of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. It's a moderately small school but you'll find activities all around if you pay attention to bulletin boards and the like. Talk to your advisors early on though so you don't get confused later in your degree plan.
Junior,4,"I didn't take any online classes but due to the pandemic, we were all transitioned to distance learning classes. I'd say my professors adapted very well and were very understanding of any mishaps that happened along the way. Overall I'd say my online class experience was pretty good."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school. I wish the tuition fee and other school related fees are lower especially for nursing students. Also, there aren't much scholarships offered by financial aid office to transfer students who aren't Hawaiian residents. Housing is ok. Wish they put AC since it gets really really humid inside the building. Since the school is on top/side of the mountain, you're basically hiking your way up/down to your classes. The meal plan is A-ok. There are some days when it's good and some are junk. Professors really make their way to help you out. They are really nice and approachable. The classroom itself is like high school size with not so much students so you can have one on one discussion with your prof."
Sophomore,4,"Great environment, the library is a great place to be. Parking is usually available! I haven't had any issues getting my courses with my academic advisers - they are always so helpful. The class selection is great, and most of the professors are always around to help - as well as getting along with you on an interpersonal level."
Junior,4,My experience at Chaminade is somewhat a blessing. 2019 was my first year and I have met many of my friends and other family there. The classes population are low so its easy to interact with the professors and grab their attention. The campus is beautiful and is safe.
Graduate Student,4,"I loved my time at Chaminade University because it is a smaller university with strong religious beliefs. It is mainly a Catholic school but all of the school events welcomed all students of various religions to join and participate. I also loved that the student to professor ratio is fair. There were no more than 25 students to one professor in a class. For me, I was in the Elementary Education division and our classes were really small because we were one of the smaller majors, so there were no more than 13 students in our elementary classes. I also loved that there were always people, professors and business office people, available to help me with any questions I had (financial reasons, registration for classes, how to participate in school events, etc.)"
Senior,4,I like the small classes.  I am also glad for all the resources offered. Chaminade allows you to strive to accomplish your goals. The one thing I would like to see change is the constant changing of curriculum.  When you start a program it should be valid until you complete it.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at CUH. All of my classes were challenging and thought-provoking. My academic advisors were always really responsive and helped me as much as they were able to. My high school experience was in a large, public school environment. Chaminade is much smaller, but I definitely appreciated the one-to-one. Chaminade is extremely close to UH Manoa, so it never felt like we were missing out on the whole ""college experience"". I appreciated having the ""option"" to do that."
Niche User,4,I recently visited Chaminade I really enjoyed my time their.  Everyone was very helpful and nice.  Its a beautiful place and the education is great.  I wasn't crazy about it being in a city and its very far away from home but other than that I loved it.
Junior,4,"The professors in my  major are extremely knowledgeable of their particular topics. I really like how the class sizes makes for an intimate class, allowing students to create a relationship amongst each other and with the professor. The campus is very diverse and so welcoming. Although the campus is small, I enjoy the friendly atmosphere because even though people don't necessarily know each other closely, they still smile and say hi."
Junior,4,Chaminade University of Honolulu is very involved in their student's lives. The small class sizes make it easy to get 1 on 1 learning with the professors. The only think that could change is the strict rules that the University promotes.
Junior,4,"My experience so far has been very well. I've come across some very nice people and very knowledgable professors. However, I must admit it has been a journey transferring to this school. I highly do not recommend transferring to Chaminade if you are planning on graduating in exactly four years simply because not all of your credits are transferrable. But it is a very good school to attend from the beginning. Great academics, always have activities."
Freshman,4,"Chaminade University is a close knit community with diverse groups of people. The small college environment is helpful when communicating with staff and teachers. The campus is very small with not too much room to roam around, but it is beautiful."
Alum,4,"Chaminade is a great small college. If you're looking for a university with low student-to-teach ratios and hands-on learning, this is a university for you."
Senior,4,"I really like how small Chaminade is. You can have a class with 12 people in it or 30 at the most. With small classes you can get to know everyone and will definitely be able to have one-on-ones with the professor if you need it. It is very diverse and has many cultural events to learn about the different cultures enrolled at the school. I did struggle with finances because it is an expensive school and an academic adviser informed me that I was on track to graduate early, but i went to another adviser and found out I was behind. Also had many problems with residential life so eventually I moved off-campus."
Freshman,4,I love Chaminade! The teachers are amazing and always willing to work with the students. I love that the classrooms are kept small. I wish the tuition was more affordable.
Freshman,4,"Chaminade is an amazing school. It's pretty small but because of that you get to meet a lot of people and you even get to know your professors really well. Only thing I don't like at chaminade is our tuition, coming from a family of six and having no money to spare for school makes it hard to pay for school even with scholarships. I would change it and make it more affordable for students who live on the island maybe have a instate tuition where it's free if you lived on the island for longer than five years. Over all chaminade is an amazing school and I had a great first year and I met a lot of people from around the states."
Freshman,4,"The class sizes are small, so it makes communicating with the professors a little easier. The campus has a beautiful view. Dorms are decent, could use a little upgrading. The campus is on a hill so its a workout going from the classrooms to the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"Chaminade is a very reserved Univesity. The classes and professors are great. Some changes would be nice, such as more student involvement and activities on campus."
Sophomore,4,Amazing community and faculty. It's a calm campus that can be relaxing. The only downside is the limited courses students can choose from.
College Freshman,4,"Because I haven't started classes yet, I can't give an accurate, honest perspective on the professors. However, my counselor is very helpful in aiding my online college journey. He responds to my emails in a timely manner, and answers my questions thoroughly and comprehensively."
College Sophomore,4,We have good options for student jobs on campus
College Sophomore,4,I love the school I chose. Everything is great
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe at night especially
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy living on campus. Good community
College Student,4,"All staff and student get emails when something is happening in the school so everyone knows what is happen. I think it's safe, but not everywhere is to safe. Just keep watch and know your surroundings."
College Student,4,I haven't really attended or participated but it's good because it keeps the students active and a way for us to keep grades up because you need to have grade to play. I think soccer is the top sport at Chaminade.
College Junior,4,Education is really the main focus for students going to Chaminade University.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy my campus courses.
College Junior,4,The campus is a safe enviroment.
College Junior,4,i love the campus life and being around and meeting new people everyday.
College Junior,4,I love the sports at my school
College Junior,4,Chaminade University is a very good school.
College Freshman,4,"To date, I am very pleased with my school."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very secure where I am.  I also do not put myself out there to experience negative experiences.  As stated, I am very serious in my studies.  I try to be very pro active on personal safety."
College Freshman,4,My first impression as I moved into the dorm was comfortable.  This school is a strongly close knit community and I immediately felt welcomed!
College Freshman,4,"I was pleasantly surprised at how welcome I was on the first day of school.  I understand it is very new in the semester, however I am finding it very comforting that the teachers are very welcoming and approachable."
College Sophomore,4,Most of my professors have been great. I will stumble upon a professor or two who I don't particularly like but the class sizes and courses available are great.
College Sophomore,4,I was able to get in contact with the head of my major professor quite easily and I was also offered a job for the summer that pertains to my field of study.
College Sophomore,4,The school always does a good job in promoting the our sports teams by holding fun events and sending out regular announcements.
College Junior,4,Safety is our number one priority.  The staff and faculty constantly announces these types of issues people may face and they often provide a place or phone number to contact these people about certain issues.
College Junior,4,"From my experience from my first year, I had a blast residing in the resident halls on campus. It was a good way to get to know the campus  and the people you are bound to see around. Activities and events hosted by many RAs are enjoyable and could potentially make more connections with others with the same interests."
College Sophomore,4,Amazing professor always there when I need them and very understanding
College Junior,4,"I just started this term, but so far I like the environment and the teachers. They cover a lot of material in the small amount of time that they have and they make it easy to understand what is expected of us."
College Junior,4,The Chaminade athletics are fairly good. The volleyball team has done very well this past season and I look forward to watching the basketball team succeed as well.
College Student,4,The career prospects allow an individual to most likely obtain a job position once graduated with a degree from Chaminade University.
College Student,4,"I've only gone through the application process and my experience has been great overall. I attended a Nursing information this past November; the faculty and staff were very welcoming and willing to answer any questions or concerns we had. 1 of the Admissions counselors, Kaylee Razo, helped me with the admissions process. She was there to guide me, to sit and discuss any questions I had, and always willing to help. It was amazing how comfortable I felt and the environment was very family-like."
College Freshman,4,"I feel secure on campus, haven't seen anything on campus that would make me feel otherwise."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes and classroom environments is something I love most about my school. There's a variety of course options to choose from but very limited amount of space because of class sizes. The professors are very friendly and easy to communicate with.
College Freshman,4,"Unfortunately, I do not dorm but from the dorms I've seen it seems like a great experience to dorm."
College Freshman,4,School and sports come hand in hand around campus. Mostly everyone around campus knows when it's game day and goes to support if it's on campus or somewhere nearby. When athletes are away for games it is usually streamed online and even shown in our student center where students can go and lounge while watching the game.
College Freshman,4,Everyone pretty much just finds their own way to the event and back
College Freshman,4,Most people just go off campus for parties
College Freshman,4,We are a very diverse campus
College Freshman,4,We have security on campus at all times which adds to the amount of safety provided.
College Freshman,4,"We've had a decent amount of career fairs, which is great."
College Freshman,4,the quality of the courses are great.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus due to the fact that I got to meet so many new and different people, many which have become my friends now."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy going to class and learning the many different things that the instructors teach us about. I also enjoy meeting new people everyday and making new friends on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I feel that the academics offered here are comprable to other schools and I feel that I am getting my monies worth from the professors and curriculum.
Sophomore,2,"Going to a small school has its benefits but also has its curses. The benefit is, you'll get to know your classmates and professors pretty easily. When you're having a rough day, a lot of professors will notice and sometimes will reach out to you. The downside is that gossip spreads like wildfire and sometimes I feel like my classmates don't realize they aren't in high school anymore. There's absolutely no party scene here and if you don't live in any of the dorms, sometimes it's a little hard to socialize. The residential department (AKA ResLife) is insanely strict and if you aren't prepared for monthly roomchecks or security and/or RAs searching your rooms if they suspect something, don't dorm here. They will find any reason to charge you and fine your student billing account. The people here are nice depending on who you find yourself hanging out with. Overall, I would say my experience at Chaminade has been a 5.5/10."
College Senior,2,"Elementary Education Major.

This program by far had more bad points than good. It was unorganized and disconnected. There were only 2 truly good teachers and one left by choice because the class (inlacing math and science) were beginning to be transferred to online. In one semester (Fall) the dean, advisor, student teaching coordinator and assistant coordinator all left. Maybe they will improve after the feedback given by the seniors, but it was by far the worst year I ever had at a college. I double majored in English and Elementary Education, yet had no issues with the English department and major. Overall I gained close colleagues, but not a sense of feeling ready to teach."
College Freshman,2,LOL Greek life in Hawaii.
College Freshman,2,"Chaminade has no party scene what so ever. You have to either go to UH or a friends house that lives off campus to party. But then again it kind of is a nice thing, because you can leave campus to party but come back to the quite dorms and just chill."
College Freshman,2,"Due to heavy dorm regulations, there's no party scene that occurs on campus. Most people head to the club or house parties (off-campus) for the party scene. This is sort of a downfall, but at the same time a good thing."
College Junior,2,"There are not much off-campus dining options near school. There is McDonalds, Zippy, Sub-Way, L&L, & Fat Greek. They don't offer student discounts, the coast is reasonable, but would not be satisfying or fulfilling."
College Junior,2,The financial aid office does not provide much help. If you don't qualify for FAFSA there is not much they can or will do.
College Freshman,2,GOOD LUCK finding good parking. Come early!
College Freshman,2,"Some days they make really great food. Other days, BLEH. You'll probably get sick of the food after the first week or two. Look online on the Chaminade dining site to see what's cooking before you go. Don't waste a meal!"
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people take part in drugs and alcohol. If that's not your scene, find a good group of friends who are in the same boat as you and hang out with them for the night. Don't give in to peer pressure. I know many people who have been busted."
College Freshman,2,The teams aren't GREAT (except for basketball). I've only been to two games. The fan support is okay. School spirit is lacking in some parts.
College Freshman,2,"There is not much of a night life at the campus itself, however most students leave the campus for house parties, clubs, and UH Manoa Parties."
College Senior,2,"Everything that has to deal with computers are okay. They have the latest mac desktops available in the library and in a whole lab, wireless access would be average, and everything else is pretty good fro a small school."
College Sophomore,2,"Chaminade is a ""dry"" campus.  Meaning no alcohol is allowed on campus at all.  If you are caught with alcohol in the dorms, you may get a fine for the first time offense, and next offense you could be kicked out of the dorms.  "
College Sophomore,2,We only have two places on campus to eat. One is the dining hall that is only open for three hours for lunch and then three hours for dinner. Between those hours we are stuck with a mini store selling little snacks and some food to buy. The eating choices are very limited but people will have to deal I guess or head out of campus and grab some L&L's or subway. Our meal plans are VERY expenisve and should be reduced.
College Sophomore,2,I recieved a good amount of financial aid this year. I went to go see if there were any scholarships I could fill out and they only gave me one. I couldn't even apply because my GPA wasn't over a 3.5. I suggest they get more scholarships and a more helpful staff.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are no school parties. Campus securities at the dorms are pretty strict. Hardly any fun times at the dorms. Nightlife for an under 21 student would be pretty boring unless he/she decides to go out with friends at an 18+ club.
College Sophomore,2,I usually take the bus to school.  It's a hassle that the bus stop is so far from my house and only comes so many times in an hour.  There's always a need to rush. Cost wise it's $5 round trip.  I take the bus because gas prices are ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,Even though drugs are not aloud but they should enforce the residential life to do a daily check in the dorms.
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus is very limited so you might want to get here early. It honestly does not matter what grade you are parking is first come first serve.
College Junior,1,"Don't take this the wrong way, the only reason why this section got a one is because there is no fraternity or Greek life  at this institution."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek Life at Chaminade.
Recent Alumnus,1,Housing is very expensive and hard to find.
College Freshman,1,"Not Very Good. The dining hall in Chaminade University is not very good. I don't recommend people to eat there. I have no choice because I don't have a car right now. But the rice is dry and vegetables aren't fresh. The part I hate is, when there's a guest to inspect the school, cafeteria turn into a restaurant. The interior changes, and food gets 100 times better. In reality, students have to eat crap."

Freshman,5,I did not take any online classes so I don’t know how they were but I do know that faculty wants to make sure that everyone succeeds whether it be online or in person.
Graduate Student,5,I was in the middle of student teaching when COVID-19 happened. The transition to online instruction was seamless. There was thorough and consistent communication from the School of Education and it made the process of finishing student teaching very manageable and worthwhile.
Graduate Student,5,"I have just completed my MA in Education/Teaching Credential at the University of Redlands. I highly recommend this program for anyone who is serious about becoming a teacher. I have had so much support along the way from professors, advisors, and my peers. Overall, I have truly enjoyed and benefitted from this experience and would do it all over again."
Freshman,5,"The campus is super welcoming and ASUR (Associated Students of the University of Redlands), along with other organizations and clubs, provide great opportunities for students to get involved."
Niche User,5,I plan to attend the University of Redlands next semester and have only good thing to say about it. I have taken multiple tours and was greeted with encouragement and kindness. The campus is beautiful and the teachers seem extremely comforting and understanding. I cannot wait to attend the University this following school year.
Sophomore,5,"As an upcoming sophomore,  this university has changed my life. With the opportunities to work on and off campus,  the classes I get to take, and the other groups I've been able to join."
Sophomore,5,I loved University of Redlands! The background story behind this collage and the architecture  is beautiful! The food was amazing and I would love seeing myself here!
Freshman,5,I love the school. The personal connections with professors are amazing. The campus is wonderful. There are so many clubs you can be a part of. There are so many cute spots on campus to take photos. The school is excellent at providing financial assistance. The dorms are amazing because you get live with people who are going through the same thing as you. It is also very easy to change your major.
Sophomore,5,"I love the community environment on campus. Due to it being a private school there is a smaller amount of students who attend, and it feels like a small town. There are many programs that help students with most things that they need. The school has many ways to help students succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I love Redlands and the atmosphere that Redlands creates. The campus is awesome and beautiful! The professors are also amazing and the academics are top notch. The food isn't great, but that's okay. The pretty campus makes up for it."
Freshman,5,The classrooms are small so the professors learn your name and it’s easier to talk to them when you’re struggling. Some courses are difficult but they provide amazing resources to help students out.
Sophomore,5,"UoR is about the size of an average high school, so the transition is incredibly easy. The campus is not too far spread, there is no need to run to your next class. There are some incredibly passionate teachers (and some who shouldn't be teaching). The food is better than fast food, but nothing to write home about. There are always events to go to, sometimes even concerts."
Niche User,5,"Redlands is set in a perfect location with the beach, mountains and desert always in sight. The small town feeling is something that excites me as I have always been surrounded by close friends and family. Not only does the University have beautiful buildings but when visiting the campus I felt a sense of community being built around me, a community I would love to be apart of."
Alum,5,"Great school with smaller class sizes, located in a small cute town.  I loved that the school was small enough to recognize most students, and enabled close relationships with professors. Great place to go to school."
Niche User,5,I haven't been to the University Of Redlands because I am too young. But I am hoping I can work hard to get in.
Freshman,5,"What I am appreciating the most about my first year at Redlands is the commitment the faculty and staff have towards the success of the students.  Resources, support, accessibility, and academics are all geared towards everyone achieving their goals while they are enrolled here.  I love the small student population and the campus is just beautiful.  This is my first extended time to be away from home and to be such a great distance away, too.  I have found my courses to be challenging enough to keep me engaged but not so strenuous that I am overwhelmed.  Their first-year seminars are the perfect stepping stone into your college life and really help freshmen become acclimated to young adulthood and ""doing school"" on your own.  I am so happy that I have made Redlands my home for the next 4 years."
Junior,5,"I am enrolled in the University of Redlands Bachelors of Business in Science program at Fullerton College. They gave many students an opportunity to join their school and not have to drive far; in addition, they made it more convenient for students who work full time. Many students work full-time which is why we attend class once a week for four hours. I am really happy that I did not miss this wonderful opportunity."
Alum,5,The University of Redlands offered me a great degree and experience. I highly recommend this university to anyone looking to pursue their bachelors in business administration.
Junior,5,"Ability and encouragement to learn in an interdisciplinary manner, all while accumulating a diverse skill to apply in major-related courses and building up as an overall a academician and person."
Niche User,5,"I can't answer a lot of the questions as I haven't attended the school yet.  I am very excited to go there next year!  I didn't see the inside of the dorms, and I can't yet give a good response on the Return on Investment (ROI).  But I hope both are excellent."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus it was very welcoming and everyone was very nice. The university is very quiet and peaceful. when touring the classrooms they are small but that allows for a more interactive classroom.
Niche User,5,"I really liked how Redlands provides the true definition of a college atmosphere. For being a relatively small school, it still has the feeling of a big college experience. I absolutely loved it there and I recommend for other people to go too."
Freshman,5,"It a very diverse community which makes the campus more friendly and much more enjoyable. Since it is a small school you pretty much get to know a lot of your peers, professors, and other staffers. No matter what year you are, everyone on campus is willing to help you on almost everything including locations, advice or just someone to talk to."
Junior,5,"I am proud to call University of Redlands my second home. I have had an unparalleled educational experience with the small class sizes, personable professors, and Johnston Center for Integrative Studies. Johnston allowed me to create my own major and pursue exactly the field of study that I wanted to go into. It allows students to create a personalized course of study for themselves, which I found incredibly unique and rewarding. Beyond academics, the campus is gorgeous, the students are diverse, driven, and some of the friendliest people that I have met."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed attending all of the University's multicultural events and music festivals. The environment is friendly and open.
Junior,5,I love that they offer satellite campuses to students who cannot commute to the main campus. I'm able to go through my program easily while having my job and feeling confident with the education that I am receiving.
Senior,5,The San Diego campus is amazing!  I am so glad to be a part of a great University with quality education!
Sophomore,5,"In all honesty my experience at the University of Redlands has been a physical and mental strain. Although all of the hardships, I did gain a lot from my experiences as a college student. I experienced that balancing a sport with academics isn’t easy and also on top of that came the 2 jobs had to help my parents with bills. In the end I do intend to tell an amazing story of my college experience. Despite the hardships, the University of Redlands provides excellent support in making sure I push on and see my dreams of being the first one to graduate come to fruition. So, I’m excited to push on forward knowing my University has my back"
Graduate Student,5,I have really enjoyed my time at the University of Redlands.  The best part about the school is having your scheduled set for your entire program once you are accepted.  There is no need to fight for classes or wonder if you will graduate on time.
Freshman,5,"University of Redlands is a relatively small college. I appreciate the small class sizes that result in a better relationship with your professor. the university is also extremely welcoming to first generation students like myself, and they are very helpful with helping us adjust with the transition"
Sophomore,5,"I am originally from Austin, TX. I was worried about moving from a massive city to a very small community, but the transition was very smooth. The university does a very good job of taking care of freshman and transfer students in their first year to make them aware of all the resources available to them and to help them settle in."
Sophomore,5,The UofR has a really nice campus. Most of the professors are really nice. It is located in a nice city. They do lack diversity in the overall campus.
Sophomore,5,University of Redlands is a fantastic experience every time I step out onto the campus. The staff and students are friendly and inclusive. The many clubs and student unions make for a far above average student experience.
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Redlands is a great school!  I am currently in the Graduate program and find that it is very interesting.  The professors and staff are very helpful.  I recommend the University of Redlands and encourage all to visit the campus in Redlands, Ca."
Freshman,5,"The University of Redlands is a great school with inspiring teachers and very interesting classes. There are many clubs that are dedicated to so many different groups of people and interests, you will definitely find something for you. The students here are amazing and welcoming, no one will have issues making friends."
Freshman,5,"My time at the University of Redlands has been an exciting time for me. Everyone here, from the students to the faculty, are friendly and more than willing to lend a helping hand. The class sizes are small and the professors here are second to none."
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed my experience at Redlands thus far. I will say that if you're any older than the average college student that comes fresh out of high school (18-22), you'll probably feel a little out of place. As an older transfer student living off-campus, I've found the school isn't really set up to accommodate anyone like me; you'll have a hard time condensing your classes to any less than four days a week, and when you don't live in the dorms it can be hard to find much of a campus social life. But the professors are excellent, my classes have been great, and I definitely feel like I'm getting a quality education. "
Sophomore,5,"The overall experience has been pretty decent so far at least for me. The workload isn't too bad and I've been advancing pretty fast toward my degree. The commons food is often complained about, but it's actually pretty darn good compared to other colleges. The main reason why I'm here though, is because of the amazing music professors here, namely my piano professor. She's not just my professor, but is also my mentor, friend, and guidance counselor. "
College Sophomore,5,"I am a part of the Johnston program, so I take some of my courses for evaluation, although I usually stick pretty close to the syllabus.  I've loved most of my professors so far.  Some of them I have been able to maintain good academic relationships with.  I believe my career has a better outlook due to the connections I've made with these faculty members."
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome professors

Small class sizes

Great weather

Beautiful buildings on campus

I don't have many complaints about this school"
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome professors

Small class sizes

Beautiful buildings on campus

I don't have many complaints about this school"
College Sophomore,5,"Personally, I do not know much about all of the Greek life on campus, and the fraternity that I recently joined is a little different from the other fraternities on campus. I am in Phi Mu Alpha which is a national music fraternity. It's really cool when I am at music events wearing my PMA shirt and brothers will come up and talk to me. I have gained a lot out of this fraternity for the short time that I have been in it so far, and I look forward to supporting this fraternity in the future."
College Sophomore,5,"This school was the best choice for me because:

1.) It is in a convenient location. It is pretty much only 1 hour away from everything. 1 hour away from my house, the beach, Disneyland, etc. The surrounding area is mostly nice and the downtown area is a cool place to walk around.

2.) The student population is small. I feel very connected to the campus and am able to be more noticed with my small class sizes. You get to know professors very well.

3.) I am able to graduate in 4 years with my BM in Music Education as well as my single subject teaching credential. The 8th semester can be used for student teaching.

4.) Although the price of going to this school seems expensive, I actually received more aid here than other UC and CSU schools that I applied to."
College Sophomore,5,My current professors are very helpful willing to help whenever you need them and they always respond to their emails in a timely matter.
College Sophomore,5,It is highly likely that one will leave this school with a job after four years. That is the whole truth about it. There is more than enough programs that allow you to access the working field and find the job of your dreams.
College Sophomore,5,"The academics at this school are state of the art, each and every one of the professors cares about their students and the small class sizes makes it easier for one on one to learn the curriculum. The variety of the courses is always interesting and sometimes someone can take a science class without having any experience in science whatsoever and still enjoy it and pass it."
College Sophomore,5,"We have the some of the best athletics facilities in our division as a whole. We have the abiltiy to have everyone of our teams train, practice, and compete comfortably. Our school is only a D3 school, but D1 coaches have commented on our facilities being the best they've ever seen. We have many NCAA nation championships for almost all of our teams and our sports teams have been around since the early 1900's. The student sections at the games are always very enthusiastic during the competition. There is never a dull moment during an athletic event."
College Sophomore,5,"All of the professors I have had thus far have been incredible.  A real working lawyer teaching Business Ethics and Law.  The Marketing Director of CBU teaching Integrated Marketing.  This insight to what is really happening in the world, and not just in the book has opened my eyes."
College Sophomore,5,"UofR has been a great experience thus far.  They are there to answer all your questions in a timely matter. Even when I felt like I was bugging them, the assured me im not.  They made me feel like I was part of the school even before I officially said yes.  The programs here are Grade A."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The small class sizes allow students to develop great relationships with faculty and classmates.  When you consider all of the ""extras"" you have to pay for at other colleges, the price at UofR is very reasonable.  For working students, the School of Business allows you to complete your degree in a live classroom setting without compromising your work-life balance. 

 Och Tamale!"
College Sophomore,5,"Redlands has given me the opportunity to strive in a smaller campus with teachers who care, students who are friendly, and a beautiful campus to top it off. I spend my time studying out in the quad or the poolside rather than in the library because of the perfect weather. The school feels small but everyday when I walk to class there are so many people that I still do not know and even have never seen before. The party scene is awesome IF you know people who throw the parties, otherwise the frat houses are the best bet. Food is good and helps to illuminate the dreaded ""freshman 15"" (for me it was the freshman 8) and you have better chances of being involved in the campus activities because of the size which is one of my favorite things about Redlands. I walk or bike into town frequently to Trader Joes, or the cute shops on State Street....but I wouldn't recommend doing so alone. Redlands is known as the oasis in the bigger and badder part of the city ... San Bernadino also the worst county in all of California. With that being said, f you keep your wits about you and carry pepper spray just in case....I KNOW you will be fine just as I was. Campus itself is very open which can be frightening at night in some cases, but our campus police (PSAFE) is circling 24/7 and there are many blue button  emergency lights throughout the campus. (fun fact: wherever you are standing on campus you will be able to see at LEAST 1 blue light). On a happier note, dorms are fun and sociable, campus events are awesome, if getting involved is something you want to do you CAN, and if you want a big city feel you only have to drive 45 minutes! Come to Redlands and I promise you will have the best 4 years of your life!"
College Senior,5,I really appreciate the small classes and in the graduate program the cohort style classes.
College Sophomore,5,"My soul mate school! My favorite experiences include intramural beach volleyball, getting to hear people such as Nayar Kunal (a.k.a. Raj form the Big Bang Theory) and Mario Lopez speak at the school, Valentines day baking class in our school cafeteria, the list goes on! My school is unique because it is a small liberal arts school but still has a beautiful big campus and provides its students with so many amazing opportunities that I would even be able to get at a big well known school."
College Sophomore,5,there are tons of yummy resaurants near campus!!!!
College Sophomore,5,The University of Redlands has a wide variety of housing options from suite style to hall bathrooms and from singles to quadruples.
College Junior,5,"The administration does what it can! Bureaucracy is hard sometimes, but it feels necessary."
College Senior,5,Financial services at school is fine.
College Senior,5,"The local atmosphere in the city is just the best.  Lots of attraction, that are affordable by students and the cultural events happen throughout the year. A big mall very close to school and the atmosphere there is open and friendly to outsiders."
College Senior,5,"Administration at my school is convenience, professional and reliable."
College Senior,5,The Greek life at my school would be describe as the same for the other ethnic backgrounds.  There is no difference that I can relate to between Greeks and non-Greeks.  All are treated equally.
Junior,4,"My professors really were very caring and helpful throughout the process.  Some GIS classes were difficult to translate into an online platform. Class discussions were tricky and hard to facilitate, but we made it through and everyone got to say what they wanted to say. Some projects had to be altered to accommodate distance learning. My professors handled it well but I know some peers who had some difficulty with time zone issues and professors who just stopped teaching and gave them the grade they had when we had to leave school. So some people had it rough but my experience was decent given the circumstances."
Senior,4,"The online experience was pretty sound when transitioning from in-person to online learning in light of the pandemic. Although there are still some kinks to work out, I found the transition and experience good as it could be."
Senior,4,"The University of Redlands allowed a variety of academic opportunities, especially for first-generation students who need guidance in what navigating university is like. I definitely took advantage of the various resources and opportunities provided through the university to succeed in honors societies, Greek Life, and strong academic scenary."
Sophomore,4,"Good college and excellent professors and staff. There are plenty of clubs and student life options, and downtown Redlands is only a 5 minutes walk away. Dining options aren't great though."
Sophomore,4,"During spring semester of freshman year, classes moved online due to COVID-19 for the final two weeks. It was a sudden shift, and professors had little time to prepare, so it wasn't always clean. Half of my classes translated very well into an online format; environmental science classes and photography. Language learning classes and GIS classes didn't translate well, and my language class was almost nonexistent online. GIS wasn't able to translate well because we couldn't do our final project off or work with the class's software off campus.
I'm sure that teachers will have a revised curriculum and be prepared come Fall of 2020, so many of these issues hopefully won't be present."
Alum,4,"The university is a great place. It truly cares about its students, hearing there voices, and embracing a diverse student body. It tries hard to balance academic rigor and student life. The university supports its students through free tutoring and study groups. The university also offers diverse student life opportunities. The Greek life is extremely welcoming, and even if that's not your scene they have social justice siblinghoods, community service organizations, etc. A few frustrations though, that the university focuses on getting more students but not on improving housing first or hiring more professors first."
Junior,4,Some of my classes were converted to an online format during the pandemic and the classes were generally well organized.
Freshman,4,Redlands is an amazing school that is especially nice if you like small campuses. The faculty truly care about your success and you will meet so many great people.
Junior,4,"The small size of the campus is great which means the small class sizes are even better. My smallest class was six people, biggest was 30. If you just don’t eat in the commons then everything will be alright."
Junior,4,"The University of Redlands has what a student needs if they are looking for a small college experience. Redlands has an amazing campus life and never empty. Although the school is small, you get to know a lot more people and repeatedly see them around the school."
Sophomore,4,Its an ok school to go to very expensive however so be prepared to spend a lot of money on going here
Freshman,4,"I love the small learning environment. Most of the professor are always available for help. Most people are very nice and the campus is fairly diverse. 
But the campus food is not so good and there are not much things to do around."
Sophomore,4,"I like University of Redlands because it gives me a chance to create. It is a small school where I'm able to get to know the teachers and build those relationships, and it is also a small enough school where if there's something you want to do, and you need is a go-getter attitude."
Senior,4,"The University of Redlands has given me the room to grow in a personalized environment. The most wonderful thing about this campus, besides its gorgeous campus, is the faculty and staff. During my undergrad, I felt like there was no goal that wasn't accessible because of the advocation for me from my professors."
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful.  It is in the foothills of the San Bernardino mountains, just 30 minutes drive from skingi and 45 minutes drive to the Pacific ocean.  THe class size is small and the instructors are interested in your success."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year student here at the University of Redlands and I have had a great time here thus far. I really enjoy the small community here and the welcoming atmosphere. As a first generation student, the University of Redlands has many outlets for me and students alike to succeed. My transition has been smooth due to all the help that is available to me."
Freshman,4,"Redlands have so far has been a really good school for me as my first year as a college experience. With the orientation week being a five-day-long orientation being filled with constant activities. The orientation was able to give an opportunity to the students to make new friends and the college students who led the group were always energetic and made you feel comfortable enough to talk to them. The orientation not only had fun events, but we also had speakers who were able to give us the motivation to go and take chances and helped us relieve some of our fears of beginning colleges.   To add on, I also really enjoy the class sizes which makes you feel actually valued by the professor who will take the time to know you and invest some of their times in you. I feel like the University of Redlands actually is valuing us as students and making sure that we have the foundations so we can really succeed in our goals."
Freshman,4,"I liked the ambiance that was present and the close knit community for students attending. I also liked the help that was offered to first generation students with the book lending program. For dorms and housing, it is a huge improvement compared to other colleges and universities since it has a lot space and are not small."
Niche User,4,The environment is welcoming and there are so many places to study. The University of Redlands is a campus where you can be free and develop many ways to complete your majors. There is a lost to choose from in regards to majors and what you want to do .
Alum,4,Great school! The faculty is really there to encourage and support you through your journey. The campus is small and beautiful. The classes are small so you get personalized help when needed.
Junior,4,The University of Redlands has an amazing community with endless extracurricular activities and an awesome learning environment. All of the professors are hands-on in their teaching and driven to help each student. I would have given my experience as 5 stars but the actual admissions and finance staff is a little difficult to work with.
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the school and the city. The school has offered me many opportunities to explore myself as a person and extracurricular activities to expand my general knowledge. For example, being a first-generation student learning about college life and as a female latinx student beating out stereotypes. However, some things I would change at the UoR is the diversity in administration and the attention given to the cultural diversity center to make it as important as it should be."
Niche User,4,What I liked most about Redlands was the environment. I also like that it is a small private university. I have been told that I look like the person who would gain more from being at a small liberal arts school.
Sophomore,4,"I've found an incredible group of people at Redlands who really care about what they're learning and how they're planning to change the world with it. The professors and instructors like teaching here and it really shows through their attitude in class. They take in interest in my college career and future success. The campus is in need of several upgrades such as making the academic halls accessible, sidewalk repair, replacing old equipment in dorm buildings' plumbing and ventilation, and general accessibility to off-campus township. We do live in a food desert in a 15-minute walk radius, and this makes it difficult for those who do not have cars to experience the surrounding area with efficiency."
Sophomore,4,Redlands offers very good finical-aide. Teachers are very accessible and are always open to office hours and answering questions. Some of the best classes arnt offerd often and the diversty on campus is very lackluster.
Sophomore,4,"I've always valued the University of Redlands for their classroom environments and their teachers. So far, my classes have been small; the average class size is about 20-30 students. My teachers have always been supportive of my studies, and were always within reach, both academically and emotionally, whenever I needed the help."
Freshman,4,"Personally, the University of Redlands has helped me with its great amount of resources available to its students. I can honestly say that I made the right decision in coming to this university as the staff truly cares for its students. I enjoy being in a small class setting where my professor and I have a closer relationship. Most importantly, being a first generation student, I have found the support and resources needed for me to succeed. Also, I know that everyone is always willing to help and feels like home."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus which was big but the student to faculty ratio is perfect. Some classes only have 13 students.
Junior,4,It is a very small university which makes it so that students feel welcomed. The teachers really care about the students. Their housing and meal plans need improvement for what the price they have.
Freshman,4,"Great community and even though it's pretty small, it allows you to get in touch with people. Also I personally love the small class sizes as it allows me to actually engage with my professors."
Graduate Student,4,The faculty is quick to answer questions and process your paperwork. You are able to get a hold of staff.
Junior,4,"I am currently a transfer Junior at the UoR. The food in the Commons is not the greatest, but it is better than some colleges. The campus is beautiful, but the weather is always really warm (that's to be expected in SoCal, though...). My professors always make themselves available to students and while their classes are tough, the workload is manageable. There's enough time in the week to get involved in campus activities even if you are a science major. 

The UoR is in SoCal, 20 minutes from the local train, which will take you into LA for the day for $10. There are also Zipcars on campus to rent and run pretty cheap if you fill the car with people. There is not much to do in Redlands itself, but its surrounding cities offer a variety of activities. I would say having a car is a must. Yes, there is a shuttle that can take you into downtown Redlands and Target, but outside of that, you have to provide your own transportation."
Freshman,4,The academics are challenging and the teachers make sure you are prepared and taken care of.  There's always tons to do on campus and 100s of ways to get involved.
Alum,4,I went to University of Redlands right after high school and it was a very rewarding experience. The teachers are all very intelligent and know their areas of study very well.
Senior,4,"If you experience a problem with grading issues, feel that a professor is not teaching you correctly please go to the dean. Do your best and you go to class. Redlands has some very good professors and I only experienced one bad teacher throughout my time there. It is a beautiful campus and the food is pretty good.  Plenty of resources for learning including tutoring, labs, and awesome staff at the university."
Freshman,4,"I'm just starting out as a freshman and so far I'm really pleased with the school. For starters its so pretty and green! There's so many clubs to get involved in (I joined social affairs and I'm loving it). There's a lot of things to apply to become like an orientation leader or a tour guide or a CA, I plan on doing them all. I was unsatisfied with the on-campus job options because I didn't get the one I applied for and they didn't have very many left at that point. Im currently doing note-taking for 2 classes but the pay is low. Other than that very nice people and great school!"
Niche User,4,It was very pretty and centrally located. I loved the friendly environment and the bulldog. I am excited to be going there soon. I hope fingers crossed.
Niche User,4,Everyone here is extremely friendly and welcoming. The campus is beautiful and the academic courses are rigorous. Great Location
Niche User,4,I like the overall campus of the school. I really found staff and students real friendly with newcomers. The ambiance around the school was very nice.
Graduate Student,4,The University of Redlands is a beautiful campus where the teachers are very supportive of student needs. I appreciate how caring the professors are about the wellbeing of their students. This is especially important in the graduate program since many of us are also working full time.  The campus feels safe. I only wish that the university was a bit more affordable and had greater diversity.
Freshman,4,"My experience here so far has been amazing. I have made great friends and have enjoyed my time here so far. Everyone is so friendly and easy to talk to, and the teachers are nice to talk to as well and very helpful. The weather and campus are beautiful."
Alum,4,"Very good professors. Academics are what you make it, you can find very challenging classes or you can do it the easy way."
Graduate Student,4,"My four years went by really fast. The professors are amazing, and you can really have an one-on-one relationship with them. Most of the professors are there because they love teaching/what they do. My experience here was so nice, that i am going to grad school there right now."
College Sophomore,4,"I chose Redlands because it was the only school in Southern California that was flexible, attainable, and diverse enough to accommodate my unique career goals.  I truly feel that I am learning here and all of my professors (so far) seem to support me.  I believe that part of the reason I have received exceptional assistance and encouragement from faculty is due to my enthusiasm for the work, which is sometimes lacking in other students.  Generally, though, most people work hard here.  I am not too active on the social scene but there are plenty of people here who are, so if you are looking for community then Redlands is a good place to be.  I just wish it was less expensive.  Depending on your aid/scholarships, certain amenities can be a good value.  Others are outright outrageous.  Redlands could charge $5,000-$10,000 less per student and still be a great school, in my opinion."
College Senior,4,I really like it here. It's quite and clean.
College Sophomore,4,"Public Safety does a great job at keeping our campus safe and they have a number that all students can call if they see something suspicious. Also, there are emergency buttons with blue lights that are all around campus. You can see one from any point you are standing on campus.

My only issue is that our school was not on lockdown during the San Bernardino shootings right away. In fact, we did not receive an official alert to stay in our buildings until that night after the event seemed to be mostly over."
College Senior,4,I haven't seen any usage.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are perfect to allow the students to learn.
College Freshman,4,"The times i have been on campus, I have always felt extremely safe."
College Freshman,4,The cost is very expensive but my initial impression of the housing is very good.
College Freshman,4,Many fraternities and sororities on campus and many opportunities to join them.
College Freshman,4,There athletic facilities for many sports and are easily accessible.
College Freshman,4,"So far, this college is really awesome, fun, and small enough to learn."
College Sophomore,4,Coaches are always aware of academics first
Recent Alumnus,4,"This school is known for the duration and teacher preparation program locally, so I feel it will help when looking for a jab."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is a small private school, I feel like I will not go unrecognized."
College Student,4,Incredible teachers and great curricular standards.
College Sophomore,4,My main concern has been getting my degree I am one of the other students on campus so I really pay attention to any of the party animals and or younger students that seem to be just there to have fun.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of the students on campus are a lot younger than me. So our focus is are a lot different from each other but however everyone on the campus is pretty much friendly and helpful when asked questions.
College Sophomore,4,I'm at the age where the Greek life isn't really something that I'm interested in at the time. I'm more concerned with receiving my degree improving the way I run my business as well as becoming a better individual overall.
Sophomore,2,I'm real salty that they converted LITERALLY ALL of my classes online as soon as tuition came through. I hate it here.
Alum,2,"Never did online. I graduated before COVID but I have heard from students that the professors were not prepared, of course"
Junior,2,"The University of Redlands had one of the worst and most unorganized responses to COVID-19 out of several CA universities. The University was extremely hesitant on both closing down the campus and refunding students once we did close. Their format for the Fall2020 semester is just as scattered and it seems like money goes above everything else.
On top of this, the University has many racist faculty and students and uses Black and students of color as diversity tokens. Most classes are predominantly white and the discussions are centered around the White American experience. 
Financial aid is constantly being lowered for students meanwhile the tuition fees increase on a regular basis.
If you’re looking for an inclusive student environment, assurance in your financial aid, and safety - look elsewhere."
Freshman,2,I have not enjoyed my time here. I have experienced several mishandled situations regarding student safety. The dining hall is insufficient. There are limited opportunities for work in your field barring a few specific majors.
Niche User,2,"It was a boring school. Very small and uninviting, full of liberals who shove their beliefs in your face, but the school has a very good program where you are able to make your own major so thats a plus"
Junior,2,"While the Professors are very committed and come from various backgrounds, the school itself does not have much to offer. 

Prominent lack of clubs and other activities on campus. Not a diverse campus. The location of the campus is far from the downtown area, meaning one needs a car to get around the city. Not much to do at school."
College Sophomore,2,The cost of dorms are very expensive considering your sharing a room  and one bathroom for 15 girls
College Sophomore,2,"As such a  small school students fall dependent on defining themselves as part of a group and with only a couple of, non-nationally recognized, Greek chapters there exists a tense rivalry.  But with limited space, many people are denied a bid to join, the fact that freshman standings cannot rush, and the selective social life of greek makes Redlands campus a very socially unaccepting environment."
College Sophomore,2,"As a division III school there is no financial incentive to play sports; furthermore there are no added benefits such as priority class scheduling, dorm selection or dining vouchers.  So unless you absolutely love your sport, the mediocre athletic facilities are not enough to keep you involved and enthusiastic."
College Freshman,2,small and feels like a commuter school
College Freshman,2,I got financial aid but what good does it do when they raise the tuition every year.. ACCOMODATE
College Freshman,2,"Due to the new party policy many options have been secluded to those selectively in sororities/fraternities/groups, but still available to others every once in a while."
College Freshman,2,They recently closed down frat row which has had a big impact on the greek life. Before that greek life was much more popular on campus.
College Junior,2,"its tough always being a Physics major, the workload is. The teachers are outstanding."
College Freshman,2,"All just salty, not authentic tasting whatsoever. Not many fresh, organic, or vegetarian options."
College Freshman,2,"The free shuttle our university provides to the students is nice because it's free of charge, however the hours are quite limited and it never arrives in a timely fashion."
College Freshman,2,"I strongly believe that on any college campus, there is not nearly as much diversity as their should be--and not just for statistics' sake."
College Freshman,2,"I do my best to give it my all and make the best of it, but there truly is not enough opportunity."
College Freshman,2,There are small house parties.  The occasional big frat party.  Big as in 100 people
College Junior,2,"All the food places on this campus are overpriced, barely ever open (the main dining hall closes at 7pm), and aren't very diverse. "
College Junior,2,"It's not culturally diverse. There may be a ton of ""minority"" students but they're all the same just as the 'majority' students are all the same."
College Junior,2,"Most of the people here are shallow, vapid, and attractive if you find oompa loompas and Jersey Shore-wannabes attractive. "
College Junior,2,"There are no options! No political science major, no art history major, no computer science major– so now I'm doing history."
College Junior,2,"Redlands is comprised of disgusting slums and a few ridiculously expensive apartment complexes. They do require you to live on campus unless you're 23, married, or living with close family within 30mi of campus."
College Junior,2,I just wish the school was bigger in order to have more good teachers and classes.
College Junior,2,They didn't have a political science major so now I think I'll study history. I'm really bummed about polisci though.
College Junior,2,They do a pretty okay job of getting students into town and to the airport for breaks. From class to class is shoddy though.
College Junior,2,"It's way too hot in the fall. It's hard to even sleep without air conditioning, which my dorm didn't have."
College Junior,2,I've seen so much illegal drug/alcohol usage on school property.
College Junior,2,"Ethnically, there is very little diversity. There seems to be more political and religious diversity, but it doesn't come up very often. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus dining is very limited.  There is only one dining hall on campus, so lines can be an issue.  You get used to it though."
College Junior,2,"The beginning and end of the year are the worst as they are the hottest parts of the summer. Some dorms don't have a/c which doesn't help those residents.  Rains in winter and early spring, but there are several beautiful days inbetween.  Most days are too hot or too rainy though"
College Sophomore,2,care more about catching people drinking than safety
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the nearby apartments are not a very safe environment for a college student. I wouldn't want to walk around at night
College Freshman,2,They are not too strict as long as you do not break any laws
College Freshman,2,"There is only one dining hall on campus, but there is also the plaza where one can get food fast. I have gotten sick from the food, so I'm definitely more conscience of what I eat. I also try to eat healthier because there are unhealthy options. Salads, and fruit are always pretty good here."
College Freshman,2,There is an off campus and on campus shuttle available to students. Sometimes it is really busy so you would have to wait for it for 15+. Bus routes unfortunately don't run at the campus.
College Freshman,2,The Greek life is not anything amazing.  Greek students act snobby and standoffish toward non-Greeks.  We tend to just use the Greeks for the parties.
College Sophomore,2,Not the Best – Redlands is a small town and the housing around the college is scarce. The apartments owned by the school are expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"University of Redlands states that since it's a private school you will be able to get the classes you want with ease. This how ever is false, throughout the year I managed to get 2 classes I wanted and ended up paying for credits that didn't matter. The classes I was in had below average teachers who didn't make the environment exciting to learn in or promote discussion in the class room. "
Alum,1,"I graduated from Redlands in April 2020, as a black alumni I strongly recommend to any prospective BIPOC students to consider attending another institution. This school will not go to bat for you, only put out a statement and make up phony solutions that don't address the underlying problems. If you succeed as a student of color in spite of the lack of resources to get you there after gutting their diversity and inclusion programs you will be tokenized and shown off as an example of how ""good"" Redlands is. As someone who has been plastered on their website multiple times, I can tell you for a fact that the only thing that makes this school worth it are the faculty (who are leaving en masse for different institutions due to the inhospitable work environment administration has created/retiring). It's not a place my kids will even bother researching come their time to apply for colleges and will be a place I actively steer people from."
Alum,1,"I personally would not recommend it to students especially POCS as I cannot speak for BIPOCS. Many people I know have been unable to afford to continue to go to the school/especially at critical points in their education with no increase in support from the school. The majority of the population is white,  CDI (the Center for Diversity and Inclusion) is extremely underfunded. Most of the sports teams are primarily white and can create stress and other problems for POC athletes. In regards to recent events with BLM and the safety and well-being of BIPOC students; the administration has been found to be sorely lacking. The administration does not ultimately care for you and the environment created by not addressing misogynoir and misogyny or racism and that can take a devastating toll on your mental and physical well-being. I urge you to look towards schools that are actively taking a stand with students on issues such as BLM, mental health, and other social issues."
Alum,1,Everyone will be forced to take online classes and alot of people are not going to be back at school in the fall
Sophomore,1,"I would like to preface this review with the fact that I'm white and that I have not experienced racial discrimination on campus. Nevertheless, the university administration does not care about its Black students, nor Black life.
In regards to the police brutality epidemic in this country, president Ralph Kuncl sent a mass email of performative allyship 2 weeks after George Floyd died with vague, empty promises for alleged institutional commitment to anti-racism.
White words mean nothing compared to white action/inaction. Kuncl has yet to respond to the demands or experiences of Redlands Alumni for BLM. What he has done however is reinstate Head Football Coach Mike Maynard after Maynard asked on Twitter where he could find a bomb to blow up BLM protestors.
This university is an embarrassment of an academic institution. There is no accountability for racism on campus."
Alum,1,Does not hear of any type of feedback from alumni or current students in any way. Overpriced for sure.
Alum,1,"I would not say that I completely regretted my time at the University of Redlands because I met some amazing people who made the journey worthwhile. That being said the University is an outrageously expensive, non-accommodating institution that promotes diversity and inclusion, but does not actually make an effort to create an environment that promotes retention among BIPOC. Additionally, being a science major with plans on going into healthcare, the curriculum is subpar at best. How can you promote diversity and inclusion, but not incorporate curriculum that explores racial disparities, equity and discrimination within healthcare?

I graduated in 2017 with a BS in biology, and after thousands of dollars spent I realized everything I've learned I've (for the most part) taught myself. 

For prospective students, especially BIPOC students.. Please save your money and look elsewhere!"

Senior,1,They are not prepared during COVID and I am being forced to take online classes if I want to graduate on time.
Senior,1,"They are really good at selling themselves as supportive of all students, but not delivering on their false promises. The majority of my professors have been great and truly went above and beyond for me, but as a high achieving student at a school with a 75% acceptance, academically it was a mistake. Don't be fooled by ""challenging classes"" in the comments if you are an A student; curriculum is dumbed down most of the time, with some exception. In terms of diversity and anti-racism, UoR gets an F. Their allyship is performative and they do not truly support BIPOC students/faculty, but rather tokenize them and force them to do the real work, then take credit. As a white student they have done nothing to educate me, and instead have given me every advantage at the expense of my peers. I promise all the comments saying this school is diverse, supportive, amazing, etc, is only coming from white students who chose to remain ignorant of the racial and financial realties of UoR."
Senior,1,"It’s hard to explain how I feel about my decision to come here. I would say I regret it, but I value the amazing peers and professors I’ve met. However, in terms of quality, it was a bad decision.

The academics are generally subpar and not varied in offerings despite many good professors, who are just not provided enough resources. Also, a lot of the curriculum is dumbed down for the less academically minded students. 

The cost is outrageous for the mediocre experience in a very isolated and boring area. My financial aid stagnates as tuition rises so it keeps getting more expensive. All my friends transferred due to price and hating it here. 

However, one of the most insidious problems of this university is their false claims of diversity and care for their students. Their response to covid and ongoing response to the BLM movement disgusts me. They do not educate white students like myself, and belittle BIPOC students, and refuse real structural change. I am deeply ashamed."
Senior,1,"The university is not prepared for online learning in the covid era. They should be reducing prices for the reduced quality, but instead they increase the prices. Most of the professor put forth a great deal of effort and are what makes online learning at least passable. It is not their fault the school doesn’t care about their students, specifically BIPOC who are disproportionately affected but the fallout of online learning and Covid."
Graduate Student,1,"Upon my arrival on campus, I felt othered for being non-white. All reviews of students claiming to feel not safe or supported as a BIPOC student, are unfortunately true. The University's concerns for addressing racism and student's experiences have been lukewarm attempts. At best, the University has listened to students' testimonials and pleas. But whiteness becomes pervasive in many of these conversations. And it looks like students of color, Black students especially being violated and threatened. These lukewarm attempts (essentially) look like the University and current President, releasing memorandums agreeing to eradicate institutional racism... without making any structural changes to protect how students, especially Black students experience prejudice and violence when attending.

These are educators, participating in a process that continuously hurts, undermines, and breaks students who want to make meaningful change. Spend your college years at another institution."
Graduate Student,1,I did not take online courses. I did not take online courses. I did not take online courses. I did not take online courses. I did not take online courses. I did not take online courses.
Alum,1,"Never took any, but with the cost of this university no courses should be online unless due to emergency/pandemic. If the school is doing online courses they should be at a significantly reduced price. I've heard poor things about the current online courses during the pandemic, and seeing as when I was there half the professors didn't know how to use blackboard, I don't trust it."
Senior,1,"Absolutely terrible. The professors did their absolute best and it is at no fault of their own. The administration waited until the last minute to move classes online because they were waiting for the last installment of tuition payment plans. The announcement that classes were going to go online but the dorms would stay open was very sudden with little prep for teacher or students. Once the school got the last tuition money and it had ""passed the deadline for housing refunds"" the students received an email letting us know that we had 4 days to pack up our dorms and be off campus for good. The admin was still expecting us to be attending classes while trying to find a way home as well."
Senior,1,"The University of Redlands does a great job of putting a show. In reality they are frauds. They charge Ivy league prices for just average education and financial aid doesn't cover what they promise it will. The school is running out of money so they are creating bigger freshman classes every year all while not increasing housing, professors or classes. The school is not accommodating by any means and you constantly have to fight with admin for everything. The biggest fraud is the school pretending to care about diversity, their students of color, when in reality they do the bare minimum to get by saying they do the most for their diverse student population."
Alum,1,"My experience at the University of Redlands, as a white student, was a stark contrast to those of my BIPOC peers. As seen from the third post on @RedlandsAlumniforBLM on Instagram, hundreds, if not thousands, of instances of racist acts have been committed at the University of Redlands. As a white student, I have never been the target of one of these acts and never would be. 
	While the University seems to focus on the few BIPOC students they have by highlighting them on their website and in their advertisements, this is simply a facade. The university has long ignored acts of racial transgressions committed on their campus. They must ignore this no longer.
	If you are considering attending this university or sending a family member there, please read all reviews and comments collected on this Instagram post that I mentioned earlier. Then decide if this is really a university you would feel proud of attending."
Alum,1,Online classes are not offered to traditional students and the University hasn't yet decided their online/in person experience for the Fall
Alum,1,"The University of Redlands has had multiple opportunities to improve their space for students of color, and particularly Black students, and it has failed. It continues to choose its own institutional pride over concrete experiences.

There is a lack of good faith shown on the part of the University’s leadership that worries me for any incoming student. The risk-averse and overwhelmingly white institution wields power as a weapon and not as a tool. For an educational space, this does not breed an inclusive learning environment. 

In particular, I’d like to call out the abhorred treatment of women of color at the University. I have watched some of the strongest advocates and actors of change be belittled, threatened, ignored, mocked, and targeted. 

Until change comes, this is not an institution worth attending. It does not bring me pleasure writing these messages. But it is important for students to know multiple perspectives before making such a huge life-changing decision."

Alum,1,"None of my classes were online so I can't speak to this personally, but I do know that the university has not announced any plans for whether fall 2020 will be online or not."
Alum,1,"As a Black queer woman who graduated from this university, it is not a space that uplifts and empowers people like me. The university’s administration constantly gives students lip service, promising that they hear and stand with their Black students but makes no real attempt to uplift or strengthen Black student, staff or faculty needs. In fact, at a Student of Color Forum in 2015, the university’s current president (a cis white man) looked me in the face while trying to convince the audience he wasn’t racist based on how many Black people he knew and has “helped”. 

If you believe Black Lives Matter and want to be at institution that truly believes this as well... save your coin, go elsewhere."
Alum,1,Online classes not offered to traditional students. No information on whether fall 2020 will be online.
Alum,1,"UofR was a culture shock. Getting situated on campus was uncomfortable and required assimilation and whitewashing of myself to suit my white peers. I had multiple professors publicly claim that my appearance (tattoos) didn't reflect my academic ability. In attempts to create a safe space for women of color, we created the first sorority for women of color. In that process, we were asked to validate why that was important. In other efforts to vocalize our concern, the Race Forum was created. Over 300 students of color spoke vulnerably about our experiences, white students continued to discredit and devalue our truths. The administration of this institution heard, FIRST HAND, the pleas of the students of color for safety, protection, and support, yet 5 years later they choose to ignore the needs of their students.

I ADVISE ANY POC PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS THAT ARE BEING SOLD ON A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE UNIVERSITY TO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAPS OF A UNIVERSITY THAT IS INSTITUTIONALLY OPPRESSIVE."
Alum,1,No online classes offered to traditional students. University has not yet announced what to expect with COVID.
Alum,1,"If you're someone who cares about diversity, racial equity and empowerment for marginalized groups, this is not the university for you. If you want to get a real taste of what Redlands is like for BIPOC, look at @RedlandsAlumniforBLM on IG. The school's Black community is tiny and anti-Black rhetoric on-campus is common. The school's racist scandals routinely land them in local news (& recently, USA Today). 

Although the University likes to advertise palm trees, you will be isolated from any major city or beach and there isn't much to do off-campus. Some parts of Redlands & neighboring cities such as Yucaipa have serious KKK presence/history. There are definitely sundown towns around so be mindful of that. 

The University is operating on a $13 million (and counting) deficit and anticipates doing so for several years. I would NOT recommend racking up student loans while they are under such serious financial stress. I would not be surprised if they filed for bankruptcy sometime soon."
Freshman,1,"Redlands is the worst choice available. The professors are garbage who can't learn your name in a class of 20 people. there is nothing to do on or off campus, and the classes are pointless and have little relevance to the real world. Their title 9 department is a joke, and they like to sweep things under the rug and treat the victims like trash. this university is very over priced and way too small for comfort. There is little diversity and the facilities are less than average."
Alum,1,"Redlands is for the B minus children of the wealthy and upper middle class who could not get into a prestigious school. Redlands will accept just about anyone. There is no name recognition beyond Riverside, it will not open any doors for you, there is no ""Old Boys"" club to speak of.
Its current faculty are probably no better or worse than the hundreds of other small liberal arts colleges in the US. 
Don't go into debt to attend Redlands. You can get an education just as good or better at nearly every UC or State University.
The average earnings of a UR graduate after 6 years is more or less the same as E-5 in the military. 
It does have a pretty campus"
Freshman,1,"There is very little school spirit. The location is in an unsafe area and it is crucial to have a car, you can't go anywhere without one. A large majority of people leave on the weekends and it there is nothing ever going on on campus. The only time you'll actually see people is around lunch time in the dining hall. Other than that people hide in their rooms. The classes are too easy and you'll probably not learn anything your first semester. The food is awful and you'll most likely get food poisoning at least once. The parties are boring and very sketchy. The majority of people I've talked to are transferring. Can you even say you've gone to Redlands if you haven't thought of transferring?? If you are looking for a campus with large student involvement and something always going on this is NOT the school for you. Touring the school is very deceiving."
College Sophomore,1,"Probably the worst part of our school.  The selection process is difficult and frustrating; but worst of all it is VERY difficult to get approved for off-campus, even as a junior and senior.  The cost of room and board is around $14,000 to eat the same poor quality food and share a small unmaintained room with another student.  One week a student threw-up in the stairwell, and services didn't clean it for a week; best of all the whole got charged a fine for the cleaning of biohazard."
College Senior,1,"The best place to shop off campus is a little restaurant that is located on the first floor of my building.  the food is fair but the price of the food if within my budget.  It is convenience to purchase food at that restaurant because it is just near my school and classroom.  I suggest the place to those that want a variety of American food.  highly recommended.  thanks.  

Other than that, the off campus dining options could be many but too far from my school and class room."
College Freshman,1,So far this year has sucked. Frat row is closed so instead of kids being safe and finding parties near campus they just get drunk and walk around the streets of Redlands looking for something to do. The school is really screwing up this year and many of my peers are so unsatisfied with the social life that they want to leave the school. i am very disappointed.
College Junior,1,"The weather here is very inconsistent. It can be windy one day, sunny the next, and then raining by the end of the week. The weather in this region used to be consistent when I was growing up, but lately you never know what the weather will be."
College Freshman,1,"There is no such thing as living off campus!!!
You have to petition in order to live off and the application only has the financial options of a deceased parent, divorced parents, etc. The apartments that are available are still owned by the university which means they cost as much as on campus housing."
College Freshman,1,The parking is very sparse and difficult to find at some times.
College Junior,1,"Mostly White – The U of R is trying to become more diverse, but currently the ethnicity is mostly white. However, there is a massive cultural diversity program that strives for a diverse program."
College Sophomore,1,"The health center on campus is awful, they are not willing to help you and always turn you away when you're sick saying to come back in two weeks if you're not feeling better.

on a positive note though public safety is awesome! During the year I never felt unsafe and they have a great system set up with emergency lights and the shuttle at night."
College Freshman,1,"Lame Frat Parties – The parties are sub par at best. I'm sure they would be a lot more fun if I were always drunk (everyone who drinks seem to enjoy them) but if you're sober they're honestly not a good time.  RYG throws good parties, though, in my opinion."
College Junior,1,"Maybe its the area but Redlands consists mostly of white and upper class kids. There are minorities, just not many."
College Freshman,1,"food service – the food sevice is horrible absolutly horrible. i guess the food quality is better than other colleges, but you have a meal plan where you have X# of dollars and each meal costs a certain amount of $. Bon Appetit spaces it out but the way they price everything and portion everything it is impossible to stay on shedule i used $50 in a week and i ran out of food for that week. other people use $100 a week. i am athletic but not an athelete i lost 18 pounds in the first 3 weeks. i cant imagin what the athletes do. "

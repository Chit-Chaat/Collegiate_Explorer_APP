Alum,5,I had no online classes at Capital University but the online coursework that accompanied in-person learning was fine.
Senior,5,My online learning experience has been great! I have learned so much already. The professors have really stepped up and have helped me learn so much. I enjoy being online!
Senior,5,My overall experience has been great! I have had a great time at Capital so far. I truly enjoy the professors. They are so knowledgeable. The student life is great. There are so many ways to get involved. The diversity and inclusion office is amazing. They are so willing to help.
Junior,5,"I like how small the class sizes are. It makes it easy to connect with your classmates, as well as with your professors. As a nursing major, it's very beneficial because there can be some hard topics to understand. During labs, you can ask as many questions as needed because there are only about 15-20 people per lab. People are always there to help you succeed and they want you to succeed. The campus is small, so you don't have to walk very far in between classes."
Sophomore,5,"Capital was amazing academically, the professors really do care about the students and are very personable. The campus is beautiful and the people are incredible. Capital continually offers opportunities for students to gather and get to know each other and has several ways students can become more engaged with their school. I would like to see Capital University improve housing for its students since it is so expensive."
Sophomore,5,"Professors were awesome when it came to taking classes online, they were very understanding when it came to the troubles of technology. Professors made sure the work we had was both challenging and easy to access online."
Freshman,5,"Capital University is such a welcoming environment. So welcoming that when I visited campus by myself, a current student's noticed my confusion on where to go and they assisted me!"
Freshman,5,"The campus is lovely, the application process is easy, and they give out lots of financial aid! I love that the colors are purple and white, and the teachers are very knowledgeable. The tour guides as well are very intelligent and knowledgeable about campus. The students are nice and welcoming!"
Sophomore,5,"Capital University is a great, small but academically driven institution. The faculty help you greatly throughout your 4 years at Capital. My advisor has been nothing but the best to me since I've stepped foot on campus in August of 2018. Students are often friendly, asking how I'm doing and how classes are going. The faculty put their best foot forward to ensure that you not only leave Capital's campus with a 4 year degree, but you may be as professional as can be and prepared for the real world. Residential and commuter life are very inclusive as well as the other groups on campus. Overall, I rate Capital a 10/10."
Sophomore,5,"The small and intimate atmosphere at Capital University is a once in a lifetime experience for college students. Many college students do not get to have the same amazing relationships with their professors as we do at Capital University. The student to professor ratio is perfect enabling students to be more present in every lecture, lab, and class activity. The professors want to see me succeed. That feeling motivates me to keep working towards my degree and to do my best.  The city of Bexley is a close-knit community that is a perfect college town. Walking down Main Street there are plenty of little restaurants and shops."
Freshman,5,Capital University brings you close to others and helps you find long life friends.  Capital university provides helpful services if you are struggling in class or have questions for your future.
Sophomore,5,Capital University is a beautiful campus that is not too big but just right for anyone. The support there is outstanding. The entire faculty and staff is so helpful and they want to see every student succeed. The availability and support from each professor provides ease and breaks the stress out of college!
Freshman,5,"I chose to attend to Capital University for many reasons. The class sizes are small, the proffers strive to help each student succeed, and they have an amazing disability program. I have a great connection with each of my professors due to the small class size. This allows the professors to truly get to know each of their students and how each works. When a professor sees a student struggling they do everything they can to help them. Capital University has an amazing program for students with learning disability’s. I personally struggle with ADHD and Dyslexia but this program has helped me succeed. I am able to schedule any test or exam with the program and take them in a separate room with no distractions and extra time. Capital University is a very diverse and welcoming campus. The University gives students opinions on how to pay for tuition with monthly payments and lots of scholarships. The University is located in the heart of beauty Bexley with everything in walking distance."
Niche User,5,I liked the welcoming atmosphere and amazing programs and teachers. I also enjoyed the down home feeling of the campus and surrounding area. Visiting Capital was an amazing experience.
Freshman,5,"Capital University creates an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are truly apart of the #capfam. There is a major campus life in a small college, you'll have no issues making and meeting new friends. It's small enough that you will have genuine friends, and large enough that you can always make more."
Freshman,5,"As a first-year at Capital University, I have really enjoyed the new friends new connections I made. With this being a rather small school, it is easy to get around really fast and meet new people. The teachers here I feel also care very much about our future goals and help us succeed so we can have a brighter future for not just ourselves, but for others!"
Senior,5,"Throughout my journey at Capital I have had a great experience. I have met wonderful professors who truly care about their students. Capital has helped me grow academically and on a personal level,m by challenging me with difficult assignments and having me take a in depth look at my life and how the things that I have learned apply to my life. I love the diversity on the campus. Most students are willing to work with one another and support each other."
Freshman,5,"Capital University has so much to offer, from the moment you step on campus to the time you head to bed. There's always activities for you to do, the library is always a great place to study, all fellow students are super nice and welcoming. Specifically the upper class men are always willing to help our the new students with their transitions to college. The staff and faculty make it a priority to see us succeed and do good. Capital is an overall great school with good experiences."
Freshman,5,My experience with Capital University has been nothing short of exceptional. I'm beyond excited to take part in higher learning at such a fantastic university. The university staff and students are always eager to help and promote a positive environment that I'm proud to be a part of.
Sophomore,5,The dorms need to be better and the non air conditioned dorms need to have something other than fans for the warmer weather but overall it's amazing!
Sophomore,5,"Capital has such a welcoming and familial experience. Everyone is always so willing to help, if they don’t have an answer they will direct you to someone who will. The small classroom sizes make for more personal connections to be made with fellow students and professors. The nursing program is great and there is nowhere else I would rather go."
Niche User,5,"My experience was very good there. The tour was very informative and the campus was beautiful. If I could change something, I would choose A/C in the freshman dorms!"
Junior,5,Intimate classes that allow you to ask needed questions and have concerns addressed by the professors themselves. Lots of office hours for one-on-one time with professors.
Alum,5,Very close knit college. Faculty is more than willing to help and be involved in the journey. Small classes that make you more engaged and more eager to learn. I loved it here!
Graduate Student,5,My experience at Capital has been incredible! Amazing networking opportunities with peers and professors. The teachers actually care about you as well. Great experience!
Freshman,5,I love everything about Capital. I especially like the class sizes and how determined the professors are to help you graduate and reach your goals. The campus is beautiful and the people are just a plus.
Freshman,5,I love the overall feel of the campus. They are very accepting of you and your interest. They have a one on one feeling with all of your teachers and overall is a wonderful school.
Alum,5,"Good academics and faculty, most professors are super helpful! Class size is pretty small, good for someone who likes student faculty interaction and ask questions. On campus life, the student body is pretty conservative. ROI is good if you study hard, no problem getting a job in public accounting for me. The downside is the food, it has gone downhill like 2 years ago since the operation got outsourced to a different company."
Niche User,5,"I love that the professors are dedicated, the campus is small, easy to navigate and just outside the city."
Freshman,5,"The Capital University experience is one I would not trade for the world. Everyone here is friendly, the professors want you to succeed, and you can always feel at home. The campus is small, though, so if you don't mind running into people that you know then you're all set!"
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy living here at Capital along with being a part of the Capfam. Coming in as a freshman I instantly felt welcome and now returning for my second year I once again feel welcomed to return. Capital is a very accepting University and tries to meet all students needs and concerns.
Senior,5,"This small private school is located in the heart of Columbus, oh and has a lot to offer. It has great staff and faculty as well as a great location."
Freshman,5,"Capital is a place for everyone. There are so many student organizations that welcome everyone and it feels like a home away from home. The staff is very interested in making sure everyone has what they need and making sure the school year is a success. Personally, I had met with my music professor before I chose Capital and she gave me a free lesson, tips, and method books! All of the returning students are so welcoming during the orientation days. I am very glad I chose Capital University."
Junior,5,"Capital University is a great campus, personally I like the smaller layout and it gives you a chance to know more people and make connections.  I would really like to see the athletic program grow but it has a really great foundation."
Freshman,5,"Capital is a great University. The professirs are very well informed in their respected fields and will help you through anything through constant interaction. The Residential life is pretty sweet, you can really come & go as you please. The cleaning staff are also very polite & friendly. The food is exceptional at all times. The scenery is gorgeous, we have fountains, trees, nice lawns, wonderful buildings as well as ample parking."
Freshman,5,It's a beautiful campus with such a diverse group of people. Feels like home the minute you step on campus. There's always so much going on
Freshman,5,I think capital is a great school and I have a geeat time being on the football team I have fun at the party at the houses the classes are good
Sophomore,5,I love how Capital University is a small school where you can always find a way to contact your professors. Since it is a small school you don't have to walk far from class to class.
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere at Capital University. When I arrived for a college tour here I instantly felt at home and welcomed. This college is one of my dream colleges.
Freshman,5,"Capital is a relatively small school, so everything is very personal. You get a lot of personal attention, and there are a lot  of opportunities for career building activities."
College Sophomore,5,"Like I said before, my teachers are personable and helpful. The class sizes are relatively small since it is a small campus. That being said, it's not too difficult getting help. All the classes are useful in life. I had to take a gen-ed at 8 in the morning, and I thought I was just wasting my time and that I'd never use it in real life. I was wrong. I randomly pull out what I know sometimes and tell my family because they can use what I've learned. Nothing has been useless or in vain at all."
College Junior,5,I just love the care and support you can find here especially the health and wellness center!
College Junior,5,"I will never experience the consideration and friendliness anywhere else. Whether you are a stranger or a familiar face,everyone at Capital will make sure you feel welcomed and if they can't, they'll know where to send you. You will rarely have to open doors for yourself or feel shy about being yourself, little things like this is why we are a #CapFam."
College Junior,5,"Capital is great. The students, faculty, administration, and professors are so friendly and fantastic. This school feels like home."
College Junior,5,"As a Greek member, the Greek society is great. Non-Greek members do not have as good of a college experience as Greek members."
College Junior,5,My experience at Capital University has been great. The students and professors are equally amazing.
College Freshman,5,"As I've mentioned before, when all else at Capital fails, the music program I'm enrolled with will not.  Every one of my professors has been incredible at what they do, and I feel as if each has cared about me as a person and not just another student.  I have formed great relationships with all those who have taught me in the past two semesters, and I am grateful that they are there."
College Freshman,5,Very easy to work with professors
College Sophomore,5,Constantly receiving e-mails with job/internship opportunities and the staff are very willing to help you with career advise.
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is one of the major reasons I love Capital so much. I love being involved in a sorority and believe it is the best decision I have made since coming to college. I wouldn't give up greek life for anything.
College Sophomore,5,"I love how you get the same education as Ohio State regarding professors due to the fact that a lot of professors teach at both schools. However, there are much smaller more personal class sizes and you actually get to know your professors and they actually care about you. On top of it all, the staff are all very friendly and the family of friends that you make is amazing."
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. Capital University is one big giant family, which helps because I am 7 hours away from home. They have some of the best people on campus and are extremely friendly."
College Freshman,5,My school is unique because it is smaller than most schools. Capital University has a small student-faculty ratio and this is a huge advantage when it comes to struggling in classes. Professors are more likely to give one on one time with students and form relationships that can help students get into graduate school.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Capital's nightlife. It is a great time to relax from studying and to take time to hang out with your friends as well as meet new people!
College Sophomore,5,"By applying for financial aid, I was able to receive money to use towards my tuition and books. I received it on time and everything went smoothly for my first year at Capital University!"
College Freshman,5,"Many many places to eat on Livingston as well as Main street. The food is delicious, cheap and convenient."
College Freshman,5,"The Mezz is probably the best place to eat on campus. It has freshly prepared pasta, salads, and pizza and the staff is great. The MDR is convenient and has a wide variety of options. The One Main Cafe is also good. It offers scack wraps, burgers, chicken tenders, chili fries, and french fries. It also has an area wher you can buy food with flex dollars for on the go such as yogurt, milk, tea, chip, fruits, and slim jims, just to name a few."
College Freshman,5,Greek life not only allows you to meet great people but also to get really involved and build a good resume.
College Sophomore,5,"Capital University is located just outside of Columbus, OH. There are plenty of things to do at all times. Right in Bexley there are plenty of places to eat, and just a short drive to the Short North brings you endless options of entertainment, food, and fun. You can visit the Columbus Zoo in the summer to see all of the animals, or even in the winter to see the zoo lights. If you want to shop there are two fabulous shopping centers 20-30mins away. Columbus features baseball and hockey for their sports, and also is home of the Ohio State Buckeyes football. Columbus is perfect for students and adults to get along."
College Sophomore,5,"I love being a music education major at Capital. We have some of the best music educators teaching us and sharing their knowledge with us to prepare us to be in the field. As a sophomore I have already begun observing in real schools and have taught my own class at Capital. The workload may be more than average, but for the experience and knowledge that I am getting out of it I cannot complain. Throughout our 4 years we will have 3/4 different school placements for observations and a whole semester of student teaching our senior year."
Sophomore,4,"Although online learning is brand new to many students and professors, my experience with it has been pretty good. I dislike not being able to go speak to a professor or faculty member immediately but overall online has been a success so far."
Alum,4,"I value the time I had here, but have not seen much come out of my particular degree choice career-wise."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, myself as well as other students were forced to move out of our dorm rooms and continue our classwork online. My professors were engaged and ready to help whenever I needed it. Though this was frustrating because I could not ask my professors in person, they still were about to answer all of my questions in order for me to successfully end the semester on a good note."
Sophomore,4,"Capital University is located in a great location. The school sits right in the middle of the City of Columbus, Ohio which gives students a great opportunity to venture out and explore all the great businesses in which surround the school. What I would like to see change is the diversity on campus. Though Capital has gotten a little better on this issue, I still however would like to see more minority students being enrolled on campus."
Junior,4,"I have taken a few online classes and I genuinely like them. Usually, you can work at your own pace during the week. The professors work hard to try to connect with you, even though you aren't in person. You still feel like you are learning all of the information, but it is more convenient."
Freshman,4,This will be first year at capital. But ever since I went on a tour there it felt like another place I could call home and how welcoming it is.
Freshman,4,"Since it's my first year I haven't had a online experience. But, I hope in the future If I do have online classes then it would be good and well understanding as if I'm in the classroom learning."
Junior,4,I'm taking online classes currently. They are going well and I like them. Communication and layout could be better.
Alum,4,My experience at Capital University was incredible. The university is small so I was able to make many close friends and run into them daily while walking through campus. The size also allows for personal attention from academic advisors and professors which allowed me to succeed as a student.
Senior,4,"Teachers truly care and the environment is nice, but there are some political tensions on campus and religious fervor makes it uncomfortable if you are not a Christian. Also the registrar, as hard as they work, simply is not equipped well enough. The people in the registrar are great, but the systems are kind of terrible and things often get lost and confused."
Freshman,4,"It is such an amazing school. The professors are such sweet people that don't make you just a number, but they know you by name. Some proffesors, I am so very close with, and the really care about your grades, your mental health, etc.  There are many things to go to if you are struggling at school, and everyone is willing to help and tutor if you are having a hard time I'm a class. With that, there are so many things to be involved with and so many things that are connected through capital that you will not experience with many other schools."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here. The people are great, the classes are small and intimate, and I've really found myself. Only thing I'd change is the housing- overpriced and a little rundown for what it is."
Freshman,4,"It's nice how small the school is and the class size and the likelihood of having access to professors is very high compared to large campuses. However, the school is very expensive and there isn't a lot of diversity. It's a tad bit boring but I don't mind because I'm only there strictly for my education, nothing more nothing less. I definitely feel like I'm still in high school because of how the engagement levels are with the professors and students and simply the fact that I see the same faces around campus. I also strongly suggest that the school provides more ""Woke"" events for students because a lot of them are blind to what reality is and the things going on in the world."
Freshman,4,I enjoy going here but I feel like the school is lacking in diversity. The housing situation is also not the best. I've had excellent experience with my professors and advisors.
Junior,4,"Capital Univerity is a great small liberal arts school. The majority of the professors care about their students and because of small classroom sizes, professors can actually have relationships with the students."
Alum,4,"I graduated from Capital Spring 2019. Throughout my time there I was apart of several student organizations, such as Sister Network, Students for the Advancement of Afikan American Society, and Student Government. I can honestly say the organizations and the relationships I made through not only them but the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and Smooth Transitions were the keys to my survival at Capital."
Senior,4,"The greatest thing about Capital is the emphasis it places on personal relationships. From students up to faculty and staff, Capital University excels in fostering long term relationships. I've made some of my best friends there, as well as found some mentors. I do wish that Capital would be more intentional in creating an atmosphere that is truly diverse and inclusive."
Senior,4,"Capital University is a close-knit campus based on approximately two blocks of land in Columbus, Ohio. It is a wonderful school for greater professor-student relationships. The class sizes make it easier to learn and makes the classes more student need based. However, the buildings and equipment for nursing majors is extremely outdated."
Freshman,4,"It's a relatively small campus, so getting from one side to the other takes about 5-10 minutes, which is ideal for me. I personally don't like big campuses where there are too many buildings to even remember where anything is. I'm not sure if this is how every college is, but the professors here teach the students like mature adults and it is a freeing feeling. I'm trusted to do my work, and when things get in the way of my work, they are understanding and usually willing to extend deadlines since life can be difficult sometimes. It's more diverse here than at my high school and I love seeing other Asian American students besides myself. There is also a strong LGBTQ+ presence with many diverse clubs and communities. I feel comfortable here and I found a great friend group within a week."
Freshman,4,"Capital is a fun loving school! With it being a smaller campus, the walk to classes are extremley convenient. I enjoy walking around day to day seeing the same familiar faces greeting you. The proffessors are kind and caring. They are always willing to put in that extra bit of help to exceed your learning. Not only is capital and family in academics, but also sports. I had the opportunity to play basebatball here and i learned so much more about life. Capital is a great University to attend!!"
Senior,4,"Capital University is a small campus, which I love. I have had some amazing professors and am lucky enough to be in a nationally accredited program."
Sophomore,4,"After completion of my first year at Capital, I am very grateful for selecting this college versus all my other top contenders. As a Music Tech major, Capital has a very large and hands on program to quickly establish your understandings and abilities as a prospective or current audio engineer. 

First year housing is as expected; nothing fancy. Currently Capital is in the process of getting a new food services company as they have parted ways with their old one, so the rating only reflects what has been offered not what will be offered.

As a first year, I had a very pleasant experience and had many opportunities presented to me that I was eligible for despite being a freshman. The school offers a study abroad in Hungary and the Music Tech dept. offers trips to AES conventions and starting to offer international spring break trips to work with other schools or places for audio engineers."
Niche User,4,"I researched this university and it is a very nice college that has everything you could possibly need. Yes there might be a hefty price, but the overall experience is worth it."
Junior,4,"I love the small campus and the sense of community! Even being a commuter, I still feel connected to my fellow students."
Junior,4,Capital University serves students with a sense of excellence.  My experience with Capital University has proven to be a hardworking and self-advocating lesson.
Junior,4,"Great professors for the most part, but the food it very poor. The campus's recent push for community engagement is great and all, but it'd be nice if that time, effort, and money went into maintaining/updating/renovating the on-campus housing and classrooms first. Facilities is short staffed and always behind or overworking the low number of employees they have, and it shows when the campus gets heavy rainfall or hosts an event it doesn't have the staff to clean up after. The education I am reviewing at Capital is wonderful, and I couldn't be happier with my professors and the friends I've made on campus. But it would be nice if the higher ups took care of their current ""Cap Fam"" before spending money on appearances."
Senior,4,"Capital has offered me many opportunities to network through my close faculty relationships. I am still shocked at the willingness of my professors to assist me in class and beyond. 

I have not lived in a residence hall for a couple years, but I really appreciate the ability to live in university-owned homes, apartments, and townhomes. 

Truly the academics and close faculty relationships are what I came here for, and that's what I'm getting. Improvements have been made to student life in the last 5 years, which adds a good environment to the campus. The food situation seems to be an issue with students, but I have no experience. I love being in the Columbus area, and Bexley does well to accommodate students and make us feel included."
Freshman,4,It was very organized and the staff was very welcoming. I applied to attend this college and it is at the top of my list. I would love to learn more about it as I am deciding on a college
Sophomore,4,I love the nursing program at Capital University and how it allows you to begin nursing sooner than most colleges. It also has very invested professors that are always available and flexible with their office hours. There are many resources that help you to succeed in your academic assignments which is very useful. I believe Capital could be even better if they renovated/updated some of the older things on campus because the dorms could definitely use some changing. I think it would be great if it could have more modern and up-to-date things on campus as well as more diversity.
Freshman,4,"I couldn't have made a better decision than coming to Cap. Although I'm only freshman , it's been some of the best months of my life. 
I was immediately welcomed by everyone and I have never been surrounded by so many kind people. 
Capital truly cares about their students and made welcome weekend awesome. I went to many events that were provided and met the girls who are now my best friends.
While moving in, there were so many volunteers that I didn't have to carry anything myself. 
There were AMAZING OL's to help make my transition smooth and made me so much more comfortable.
The only complaints I have are the food, and parking. I got food poisoning and the options are limited in the dining hall. The freshman parking lot is only open a few hours of the day and I don't always have access to my car."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the small campus and the beauty of it. It feels like a second home with everything being so close together.
Sophomore,4,"Capital University is a very nice private school in Bexley, OH. The location is so nice being 10 minutes from downtown Columbus and the atmosphere around campus is great. Everyone you meet is so friendly and open-minded. There are no ""cliques"" as you would say but everyone has their friend groups. But since the campus is so small everyone is usually all together anyways. Everyone at Capital University is so involved on campus and in the community. They do service work such as cleaning the streets to helping make sure that you are safe and in a good environment. The staff at Capital makes you feel so at home. They are always happy and welcome you with open arms and are always there if you need help."
Freshman,4,"What i love about Capital Universtiy is the ablility to do whatever I want. Becauase it is a small campus I am able to be a part of many different clubs, be involved in sports, and be a nursing major. No where else I looked let me do all of this. Another thing I loved about Capital is that the Nursing Program was direct admittance. This was so helpful. Instead of dreading and stressing about getting into a nursing program at a large school, I already knew that I was set and secure with my major. Another thing that is great about Capital is that it was my cheapest option. It may be a private school and cost a ton, they were the most generous with scholarships and financial aid. This was the most crucial in my decision making process."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Capital University has been fairly decent.  The professors I have had, have worked with me around my sports schedule and are very easy to talk to if you have questions.  I have not had any problems with professors.  The only things I dislike about Capital University is the cafeteria food, which could be said about any college, and the heating system in the dorms.  There is no air conditioning and my heat is always on. Sometimes my room is so hot I have to go somewhere else to sleep.  Overall I would recommend Capital University to someone who is looking for a small school."
Freshman,4,"I really loved how friendly everyone was. You know everyone on campus in a pretty short time, and I liked that the staff was always so welcoming. #CapFam is a real thing! However, the food is a huge minus. The cafeteria has poor gluten free items, and simple things like coffee are to expensive. A lot of the dorms are not ADA regulatory as well."
Senior,4,"I felt that administrators, faculty, and staff were well acquainted with members of the student body, and took interest in students' success. In addition, degree programs are structured in such a way that it is more than possible to complete a double-major within the typical four-year period. However, because the university is small, many courses are only offered for a single session, making scheduling difficult."
Freshman,4,"I came from a small high school and I wanted to attend a smaller school. Capital University the perfect example of a small school. I am so glad i made the choice I did. Capital is located in Bexley, a small town, but only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the big city--Columbus. Being at a small school, I know most of the students in all of my classes and all of my professors. Campus is friendly and most students are very involved in on-campus events. Some people think that going to a small college keeps you from really experiencing college, but that's not true. College is a crazy ride with lots of ups and downs and you will experience that at any school you attend. By being a small school Capital provides you with support through it all."
Junior,4,"I like that it  is a small school because class sizes are small and the professors are easy to get to know and contact. I think the school could do a better job of communicating events that are going on. News travels by word-of-mouth mostly, which is not efficient. "
Sophomore,4,"The Campus is gorgeous. The only part I really don't like too much is the atmosphere on the weekends. Lots of students go home so there is no one here. Also, there are a lot of cliques and making friends at first was hard."
College Sophomore,4,"Friendly people and helpful professors, they really want the best for you and to help you to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,I very much enjoy attending this school and think it is a very nice community to be a part of. I enjoy the small class sizes and feeling cared about by the professors. They are all very understanding and are very willing to make accommodations in difficult situations. They care about the well-being of their students and do everything they can to help you if you fall behind.
College Sophomore,4,"A degree from this school is highly valued, and the school does everything they can to help students who are getting ready to graduate to find employment. They also do a great job of pairing students with internships while they are still in school, as many majors require at least one type of internship."
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe and taken care of when I am on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is very prevalent on campus, but it is not the end-all-be-all. People involved are still very good friends who are not involved, and although it does require heavy involvement most people in greek life are involved in several other ways on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at school is like a big family, we all care about each other and are very tightly knit. Everyone is always wonderful to everyone else, and there's a mutual understanding that everyone can be whoever they want and there isn't any judgement."
College Sophomore,4,"I've lived in one of two freshman (only) dorms. There is one more, but there are freshman as well ans upperclassmen. Mine was bigger than the other freshman only dorm even though they had AC. I didn't mind it too much because I could open my window and let the fresh air in at night. It was clean (cleaner than the horror stories established by the movies) and I didn't have problems with any of my hall-mates. Since campus is small, it wasn't bad to travel on campus. I don't have any complaints about my housing whatsoever."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though the freshman dorm was super hot all the time, we had problems with meal swipes, and the parking situation is't all that great, I would choose my school all over again. The teachers are very personable, knowledgeable, sometimes a tad eccentric, and helpful. If there was anything I was struggling with, they'd gladly setup a meeting time so we could meet, and they were very attentive. They made sure I understood everything before I left their class or office. The students are equally friendly as they are willing to bond over what we perceive as the flaws of our school. There are no such things as lonely Friday nights because you'll either be exploring the town with them, or playing board games with a group of friends. Capital is my home away from home, and I'm so glad I go there."
College Junior,4,"Although I don't participate, the athletes and the spirit they continue to bring allows people like me to still feel a part of a team."
College Junior,4,"Students don't focus much on athletics, but there are always events and game that students can attend for free. The athletic facilities are very nice for athletes and non-athletes."
College Junior,4,Athletics are great. The coaches are very kind and interesting.
College Freshman,4,"As wonderful as the music program at Capital is, and as it makes strides and grows in the right direction in this aspect, that does not take away from the fact that making it in the music business is not easy.  No professor in my degree program try to sugar coat that fact, but they have promised to help all of us to the best that we can."
College Freshman,4,"The area around Capital isn't all that great, but overall I have always felt safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is great and so are the students. There are a few things here and there that could be fixed but overall, its pretty good."
College Freshman,4,The classes are great and the professors are really nice and helpful. All the students are friendly and its nice since the campus is pretty small.
College Freshman,4,"The area around capital is not the safest, but the campus is very safe. The campus police constantly patrol around making sure nothing bad is happening."
College Freshman,4,"Capital university is mainly known for its nursing program, but it also has many other degree programs that are all worthy for it to be known for."
College Freshman,4,Professors are very hands on with students and are quick to respond to e-mails. They teach the materials very well and help the students understand what is being taught.
College Freshman,4,Most people are different but very accepting
College Freshman,4,My dorm is extremely clean.  The rooms have been painted multiple times.  The paint continues to peel. Windows and heaters work; but no air conditioning.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus is safe, but the area around it is not."
College Freshman,2,"The times and appointments aren't the best for a busy college student and the people who work there are rude
"
College Freshman,2,"The girl to guy ratio isn't even. It's hard to find a guy who is fun, nice, and not judgmental because I'm not all godly. "
College Freshman,2,There is nothing interesting within walking distance to have fun with while still being safe. AKA I am bored a lot.
College Sophomore,2,"The public transportation around the city can cost quite a bit. People are almost always taking their cars and going down town. However, the is a ""drunk bus"" that will take students down town to clubs but I am not sure how much it costs."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus food has given my and my roommate food poisoning a few times. I have to understand though because they have to feed thousands of students. If everything was quality, it would take longer and be more expensive. There are quite a few different places but the choices are not very unique."
College Sophomore,2,"It is located in Bexley, a suburb of columbus. It is also surrounded by Whitehall a very dangerous city. "
College Sophomore,2,"Overall I feel like I have gotten screwed over. I was receiving very little aid because they looked at my parents income for the past year. They did not consider the fact that my dad lost his job and my parents separated. At such an expensive school with very little help to get a loan they basically told me there was no more help that they could offer me. They eventually considered me for ""special circumstances"""
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is average on campus. It's not a big deal. No crazy greek parties either. I'm not apart of greek life and to be honest I don't hear much about it or know much about it. Some of my friends love it though. The friends they make and the community service they do seems to be the best part of greek life.
College Junior,2,"Although the school spirit and fan support may be high, I believe our athletics are sub-par as a whole. Soccer and Basketball teams are relatively good but all other sports are mediocre. Capital does not offer sports such as Wrestling, or Swimming.  Lacrosse was just recently added to the mix. The outdoor track is extremely small with only 4 lanes. The indoor track is great."
College Junior,2,"Its a small college so there is a decent amount of nightlife, just not as big a as bigger school."
College Junior,2,"Most students here come from small farming towns around Ohio and are Caucasian, there is a small multicultural population mostly African Americans, some Hispanics, and there is a very small international student population."
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing at CU is nice, but it is more expensive and risky because of location."
College Junior,2,It is a really nice school but the cost of it scares people away.  The campus is really pretty but it is just to expensive
College Junior,2,"Not enough computers, and the login in time is way to long and the printers are always jamming or not working"
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus dinning at Capital University is average for what a college student would expect. There are many different pizza places to choose from and also other diners that are well known to all the students.
College Freshman,2,"Not much of a variety to choose form. The Bexely Square are has a great sushi are and a good sit down resteraunt called the Rusty Bucket, but you have to drive about 20 minutes to get good food."
College Freshman,2,"Parking can be a pain, but at the same time, it's not the worst I've ever seen. Plus, there are plans to add parking in the near future."
College Junior,2,"Public Safety can be strict about parking. If you don't park in the  lot that matches with your parking pass or if you don't have a parking pass, you'll be lucky if you don't get a ticket. If caught, underage drinking will be punished as will keeping a pet in your room. If your roommate is doing either of these things, you should avoid being in the room when it happens or you should report them. If you want to do either of those things, be sensible and quiet and you probably won't get caught. Don't invite a ton of people and don't be loud and obnoxious. If you want to keep a pet, don't. Pets are great, but not worth having to deal with taking care of while you're also dealing with class and you'll probably get caught and be forced to give it up anyway."
College Freshman,2,"Like most places in the US, the school's white population trumps all other race populations. That being said, the fact that there are several other races should not be ignored. There a few Asians, but they are mainly foreign exchange piano students from China due to Dr. Wang's piano ability. There are quite a few black students as well. It seems as though there are a few middle-eastern races here too, but it is still predominately white."
College Sophomore,2,"The main dining hall on campus has very specific hours and the food is not great. They have the same meals over and over again. Also, there are only two other options for dining, which are only open late at night and certain hours on the weekends. The restaurants around campus are very nice but can be pretty costly."
College Freshman,1,Nothing happens at Capital. The only parties (at the houses on Sheridan and College) are busted by midnight.
College Freshman,1,"It is awful. There are 3 places to each on campus. All 3 places are run by Parkhurst Dining, so its all made the exact same way and its all gross. There are no healthy options. We have a salad bar, which in almost a year of being here, I have not yet seen fresh. The lettuce and fruit and vegetables are usually old, dried out, and wilted. Each meal swipe is worth $6.50 in food, but when divided, the meal plan makes each meal cost about $12, depending on which meal plan you have. We have two Starbucks on campus, which you cannot use meal swipes or Starbucks gift cards at. Our meal plans do not extend to any local restaurants. Dining hall hours are awful."
College Freshman,1,"The Bexley police are constantly patrolling as well as the Capital police. If you were to walk down Sheridan Ave (party street) at night with a group of people, the Bexley police will practically slow down and follow you to wherever your going. No one parties on their front porches or even in the upstairs of their houses. Police will come to just say they got a ""noise"" complaint. Overall they are very nosy and spend way too much time trying to bust underage."
College Freshman,1,"This school is infamous for promoting that even though tuition is 41,000 a year, they give out so much financial aid its like attending a public school. wrong. I'm currently paying almost 30,000 to go here. they trick you into thinking you are paying less by giving you and your parents a subsidized or unsubsidized loan... which makes your tuition look anywhere from 5000 to 10000 less than it actually is."
College Freshman,1,"If youre expecting a ""real"" greek life experience, dont come to find it here. There is no greek housing, they meet in dorm basements or other random buildings on campus. Nor do they ever really do much except have random mixers. I really want to join greek life, but i refuse to here."
College Sophomore,1,Capital is surrounded by a very poor neighborhood. There are a few sit down restaurants around but those are expensive and then there are fast food options such as chipotle.
College Sophomore,1,The parking on campus is a big problem they tend to give out to many passes for the S lot and then you can never get a parking spot. and even though you are a sophomore they will make you put your car in this car lot that you have to be shuttled to and from to be able to get you car to be able to use it. Its a bit ridiculous.
College Junior,1,"Capital boasts itself on giving out financial aid to 100% of it's students. They do this but the amount of aid needed is rarely matched. I know two people that received full tuition scholarships but because they still had to pay an outlandish amount for board, they could not afford Capital for more than a couple semesters. Then the students scholarships were just lost with their withdrawal. The scholarships were not handed down to runner ups. The financial aid office is not very helpful. Their catchphrase is ""Have you tried fastweb.com"" Unless you fall into a special category such as lutheran heritage, tuition may be a struggle."
College Junior,1,I don't have a car on campus but I usually hear people complaining about how bad it is. Freshmen have to park somewhere that's 10-15 minutes walking distance away. Cars usually get tickets if they are in a specific area for too long i.e. Car parked in front of lohman until 3am
College Sophomore,1,Capital University isn't too diverse. The overall race here is white but there are many diverse programs that anyone can join.
College Freshman,1,"At almost $1000 dollars a month for room and board in a shared room with no air conditioning in a building where half the time something is leaking or the water does not work on your side of the building; Capital's housing is ridiculous. Do not waste your money on this school until you are at least a junior and can get in to a building that is actually somewhat worth the money. Sure it's an okay school if you look past their disgusting spending habits, terrible dining options, and love of nickel-and-diming students, but if you have any other options, take them."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is pretty hard to come by. If your a freshman, you have to park off campus and take a bus or get a ride from a friend to get your car. Upper class men are allowed to park on campus but they have to have a specific pass for that certain lot. The nice thing is that parking is free in the S lot on weekends. So if you were to have visitors on the weekend, their able to park their for free"
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Capital is not that good. If you have a car on campus, you have to buy a $80 parking permit. Its usually very hard to find a parking spot. If you are a commuter, you should arrive about 30 minutes before class so that you can find a parking spot."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is next to impossible unless you show up at 8am. You pay $80 for a parking pass that you can't use because public safety always finds a reason to ticket you or just because you can never find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,I think there is a lot of drugs and drinking anywhere. Because capital is still close to Columbus access to drugs and alcohol is farely easy.  I personal do not do drugs but quite a few people who do.
College Sophomore,1,"it means that you have fail 
and assessment and exams was not able to exceed 45 that is wy you have fail"
College Senior,1,"I Am an Off-Campus Student – I don't go to bars near the Capital University campus other than the Top Steakhouse down the street for a glass of wine or a martini every so often.  The area is riddled with crime and is not safe for walking around drunk.  There are also very few ""college-type"" bars in the area."
College Freshman,1,There Are Not Many Options to Get Around Town – If a groccery run is needed there is no transportation provided.
College Junior,1,"My FAFSA score is 0 therefore you can assume my parents have very little money. When I initially decided to go to Capital the financial aid package in scholarships and grants was a lot more than I actually got. They issues a letter to me stating that because of the economy and Obama's change in federal aid for private school I wouldn't receive some of the aid they had initially declared to give me. At this point it was to late to withdraw and transfer plus I'd still have to pay them some tuition. Than they expected my single mother of 4 who makes 15,000 a year to take out a parent plus loan which she would have to start paying immediately. This clearly was not going to work out so I went to financial aid and begged and cried for more assistance that they initially told me. It was such a hassle and the staff at Financial Aid are rude and unsympathetic."

Freshman,5,"This is my first year at Missouri State. This year is different from any other, but I would not know any better. This school has made what is happening in the world a little less scary. There are still events, ones that I have found my best friends at. There are still in person classes, but also online which is okay too. You walk outside and you never know what you are going to see. The other day I saw a girl walking her cat. My best friends don't live in the same building as me, so that makes it hard to see them. It makes me sad but we find other ways to see each other. I have had a sandwich everyday for lunch. The food here does not mix it up. It is always some sort of chicken or fish with cooked vegetables and a potato of some sort. not to mention the regular pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and burgers. my experience at Missouri State is better than I could have hoped. This is a crazy year and I have met some of the best people."
Sophomore,5,"Missouri State is a great university, I am currently in my second year, and I've been having a blast since I enrolled. Everyone here is super friendly and open minded, it's a great place to learn and meet new people"
Freshman,5,Freshman. Love it so far. Great community and good response to COVID. The overall atmosphere is welcoming and enjoyable. The campus is beautiful but not large so everything is a close distance to eachother.
Freshman,5,"COVID is annoying but they are doing well in adapting. The teachers have done well in acknowledging the change in learning style and have thus adapted to the change in lectures, assignments, etc."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman and so far MSU has been amazing, I have alot of great teachers and they are all pretty helpful, campus was confusing at first but now I got it down. Would definitely recommend this to anyone"
Junior,5,Professors are easy to get ahold of and the online criteria is easily laid out for the student's ease.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed the first year of my college experience here. The atmosphere is very friendly and educational.
Junior,5,"I taken a few classes online all pertaining to my major and the professors I had for the classes are all really helpful and provide an interesting overview of the screenwriting minor, which is apart of my degree at Missouri State University."
Graduate Student,5,"My online classes proved to be very well-structured and easy to follow, especially in courses I would have otherwise considered to be extremely difficult. Overall, online classes at Missouri State are very comprehensive and helpful."
Freshman,5,"Professors were so accommodating and were always willing to help or extend a deadline. Professors also did not just give up on teaching completely, instead they would send weekly lesson videos to discuss the chapter and assignment."
Junior,5,"When the coronavirus pandemic happened and universities started to change their in-person classes to online classes, I had to finish my spring semester completely online. I appreciated that my professors attempted to make the switch as smooth as possible and that they wanted to make sure we were still able to succeed without having normal lectures. Considering the sudden change, I would say my professors did an excellent job of adjusting their curriculum."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Missouri State in fall 2019 with a fashion merchandising major and didn't know what exactly to expect from Missouri State's fashion program. However, after taking classes for a year in that department, I can say that the professors are excellent teachers and very invested in their students' success."
Sophomore,5,I love going to Missouri State University. It has a fun and welcoming atmosphere. You will make all kind new friends and experience thing you never thought possible.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are always willing to help, and want to see you succeed. I did very well in my classes. All you need to succeed in motivation and time and you will pass"
Alum,5,"For me Missouri State was the ultimate college experience. I immediately made tons of friends in the dorms and was very involved throughout my four years there. The student life is incredible. I almost went to Mizzou but I hated the campus and loved MO State's. Professors are mostly good as well. Don't like the sorrounding area much, Springfield is a fairly boring city and the residents aren't thrilled about MO State being there. Overall great school!"
Graduate Student,5,My professors were so nice and truly cared about how I did in their classes. The campus is beautiful and well taken care of.
Graduate Student,5,I loved online classes. The professors were very involved even though classes were virtual. The classes were well organized on Blackboard
Junior,5,Missouri State is a big school but has that small school feel. Everyone is very nice and helpful and there are so many resources available to students!
Freshman,5,"I have been taking piano lessons with a piano professor through the university and it has been an exceptional asset to my growth in my desired career area. Dr. Hye-Jung Hong has gone above and beyond to help me with my music development, preparing for college, and finding scholarships."
Junior,5,"Missouri State is an awesome school with great faculty, opportunity for extracurricular involvement and research, and students! I highly recommend it."
Freshman,5,"I am a soon to be transfer student, and have heard nothing but great things about Missouri State University."
Junior,5,"The Theatre and Dance department (of which I am a part of) is truly one of the most compassionate and helpful families I could've asked for! This goes for staff and faculty AND my peers alike. The campus is beautiful, and the facilities are grade A! Missouri State actively wants to see you succeed and provides the resources to make that possible. They are there for assistance, without holding your hand throughout the entire process. Missouri States 3 Pillars of Public Affairs are Cultural Competence, Ethical Leadership, and Community Engagement. This allows for a safe and productive learning environment. My only real complaint would be the lack of diversity, which I do see efforts being made to address the issue."
Niche User,5,I went on a visit a few weeks ago and now I have decided to go this fall!  Great campus and affordable.
Niche User,5,Missouri state university is an awesome university. I have not started full time classes at this time. However I am taking a dual credit class while in high school right now and I am enrolled to start college classes at the University Fall of 2020. From what I have seen while visiting the campus it is a very friendly campus. Everyone willing to help anyone of the fellow students. Campus is very clean and easy to get around. I can't wait to start classes there.
Freshman,5,I enjoy all of the people and connections I have made through Missouri State. This school has quickly gone from a place I have attend for four years to home.
Freshman,5,Coming from out of state was very nerve wracking but I instantly felt like I was accepted and at home I was able to find so many good people in my life so quickly I love it here!!
Niche User,5,"I've only been attending this school for a semester and a half, but the atmosphere and people are all so warm and welcoming. All the faculty I've encountered are well versed in their areas and they really cares about their students' well being and success."
Sophomore,5,I love Missouri State. Its home away from home. Everyone makes you feel so welcomed there. There are many groups and clubs to get into. I definitely recommend MSU!
Sophomore,5,"At Missouri State University, I feel as if I have a support system. I have people I can go to for academic help as well as personal help, but I also have people on campus that are going to push me to my limits."
Sophomore,5,I really like Missouri State and everyone who is willing to get involved will like it a lot. The key to having a good experience at MSU is getting involved
Junior,5,"Missouri State has a great choice in academics, offering many diverse majors and minors with the option of creating your own. The professors seem to care about their student's success, and are willing to help. It is mostly safe due to the emergency poles and the safe-walk program. Campus is well-kept. The local area has many options. Student life offers many events and over 300 clubs with the option to create your own."
Niche User,5,"MSU has a large campus feel,  but it's close together and easily walkable. The campus has a nice mix of modern and older architecture that is nice to look at. In the student center, there is a wide variety of restaurants to choose from, which is amazing! They are also quite inclusive and welcoming to gender non-conforming students."
Freshman,5,I liked the Missouri State university a lot when I went to visit. I think it is a great school filled with great people. I am astonished by how great the men's soccer team is and am proud of their progress this season.
Sophomore,5,"What I truly love about Missouri State University is the school pride and how seriously they take their students. They give their students the best of the best in faculty and opportunity. Although the football team could use some improvement, the overall ability of the school to reach students and pour into them is fantastic. It's also just a beautiful campus and there's good scenery around the area as well. In the fall, the change of leaves are gorgeous! There are many clubs, from fun clubs to religious organizations and there are many sororities and fraternities. There are plenty of places to fit in. There's also a lot of international students and places where they can find a home far from home. It's a welcoming campus and I wouldn't want to go to any other college."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love MSU! It's an amazing campus with so many opportunities to get involved and feel welcome. Within the first month of my first semester as a freshman at Missouri State, I immediately felt at home. The faculty is amazing and really friendly. I couldn't see myself not attending MSU. I highly recommend MSU to anyone looking to go to college."
Niche User,5,"Missouri State University has a beautiful campus and has many ways to get involved. When I first visited the campus I was immediately impressed, and am looking forward to attending in Fall of 2020."
Junior,5,"This school rocks!!! The campus is tight knit, you don't have to walk 25 minutes to get to a class across campus. It has a very home town feel and you will always feel welcome at missouri state"
Freshman,5,"I'm still just a wee Freshman. However, I knew I wanted to go here from the minute I toured it. MO State is so welcoming and offers ENDLESS possibilities. I couldn't be happier."
Alum,5,"MSU is an excellent choice for undergraduate studies! I had such a wonderful experience at this school. The professors we so helpful and kind. My education was so complete; now that I am in the workforce, I feel that I was more prepared than students from other schools. The school is more affordable than many others. There are numerous clubs to get involved in. The campus is small enough to be able to walk to all classes easily and there is a great shuttle system. I made friends here that will last a lifetime. GO BEARS!!!"
Junior,5,Everyone is super outgoing and it is just a fun campus to be on. There are so many opportunities for you to get involved and you will always feel included. The professors are amazing and will work with you as much as possible. They are there for your success.
Niche User,5,I love the staff and students that currently attend Missouri State University! My dad has been a professor at the campus for a very long time and I have always loved visiting the campus and meeting the staff. I have found so many great opportunities for my future college experience and I can't wait to be an MSU bear!
Freshman,5,"Missouri State University is a prime example of a school that is extremely well rounded and there to support its students in every aspect. They have wonderful academics programs, ranging from Wildlife Biology to Hospitality and Leadership to Graphic Design and everything in between! Missouri State University takes very good care of their athletes, with a variety of sports and all the team spirit to back them. The vibe of ""Go Bears!"" and just school pride is always present on and off-campus with its students and faculty. Additionally, there are more campus organizations than you could ever imagine and so many fun events constantly going on to keep students busy."
Junior,5,"I love Missouri State University, all of my professors are very informative and go above and beyond. I would love to see MSU expand their master's and Ph.D. programs."
Junior,5,I love the student community at MSU. There is a sense of belonging and everyone is very kind and supportive.
Sophomore,5,Missouri State is a wonderful school with easy to access resources for all students and help and support available when you need it.
Sophomore,5,Feel like my home away from home. I take so much pride in going to this University. Everyone is so welcoming and the whole time I was there it felt surreal. I honestly was not a fan of school before attending Missouri State. Now I cannot wait until it's time to go back!
Sophomore,5,I came to Missouri State University not knowing anyone. Literally the first day I arrived on campus I made three or four friends. From then on I was surrounded by friends and professors that helped push me towards who I wanted to be. I was constantly amazed by the diversity and inclusiveness that MSU offered. Nearly every interaction I had on campus was a good one. No one was ever rude or mean. I definitely recommend Missouri State University.
Freshman,5,"I recently attend my orientation day and it was great! I learned so much about the campus, student life, and how to balance school with everything else going on in my life."
Junior,5,"Everything from the campus, to the administration, to professors and the students has been nothing but great. There is a wide variety of organizations, and majors on campus that anyone can feel at home no matter what your interests are. Our president, Clif Smart is amazing and more hand on than any president I have ever met and is really changing Mo State into a diverse, positive and excellent place."
Sophomore,5,Missouri State is my home away from home. Missouri State has a wide variety of career choices and if you do not know what you want to do. They have people there to help you. The campus is absolutely beautiful and everyone is so friendly. It really does not matter where you are from or what you're majoring  in.
Senior,5,It's a great college where diversity excels and community service is important. It has an opportunity for all to gain experience and really find what they want to do.
Sophomore,5,"Missouri State University has so many wonderful people, I have made some of my closest friends here. I also have enjoyed all my professors, as each one cares deeply about their students success and will always go out of their way to ensure each and every student is getting the help they may need. The campus is beautiful and has a great team who works tirelessly to keep it maintained. There are so many activities for each student to get involved with, MSU is a fantastic college and I have enjoyed my academic experience here!"
Senior,5,"Attending Missouri State was one of the best decisions of my life. It is the perfect size and is in a very good location. A lot of people don't like Springfield, but it is perfect for college students. There is so much to do, you could experience the nightlife downtown, watch movies, outdoor activities (hiking, mini golfing, go cart racing, etc.), and a wide variety of restaurants. The professors are very helpful and only want the best for their students. I joined a fraternity and also play rugby so I have had the honors of meeting some of my best friends that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. My experience at Missouri State has been nothing but exceptional and some of my greatest memories have happened at Missouri State. The only thing that I would change is to add more sports for males and females."
Sophomore,5,"I like Missouri State for many reasons. I like that Missouri State is very large to me, coming from a very small home town, but MSU makes the campus feel like a small community and doesn't make it seem so big. I like the small class sizes and all the resources they offer their students."
Freshman,5,"The best thing about Missouri State University is the professors. They are willing to help the students, and try to connect with them, ensuring they have the best experience in class. I would not want to change a thing."
Freshman,5,"Best college experience ever!  I am enrolled in the Bear POWER program for student with disabilities.   MSU has given me the opportunity to participate in classroom activities, social activities, service activities and work activities.  It has been the best experience for school I have ever had!"
Junior,5,"I would love for everyone to consider this university! I love going to school knowing I'm getting the best education possible. I love my major, my professors, and everyone I go to school with."
Freshman,5,"I love it! Great environment to learn and live in, backed by an even better community. The staff is great and I feel like I'm more than a number in the system. My peers in classes and dorms understand and support me and I feel like I belong."
Junior,5,It is a liberal college with PLENTY of opportunity for student involvement. The student union always has stands with clubs or events set up.
Sophomore,5,"I love Missouri State, tons of opportunities from career development help, sports, inter murals, help in classes, and a very diverse group of students. I have so far loved my experience with Missouri State."
Senior,4,Missouri State is pretty fun. They definitely do a good job of trying to give you the college experience. I am a commuter but I still feel welcomed and like I’m living a college life.
Senior,4,I’ve had a pretty good online experience. Most of my teachers seem to have done online classes before so that helps as well. For the most part I feel like the expectations and layout of the course have been fairly simple to navigate and user friendly.
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any online classes. However, I do know people that have and they seem to be enjoying the class. Sometimes it is easier and sometimes it is harder, depending on the subject."
Senior,4,Missouri State can surprise you in the best way possible and then proceed to make you frustrated in the same week.
Senior,4,"Online has developed dramatically since COVID forced all the professors who were lagging behind the crowd to learn to use online. Before that, online classes were a mixed bag and either was amazing or just downright awful."
Sophomore,4,"Learning online at MSU has been an interesting transition, but I think it's one we're all slowly but surely getting used to."
Junior,4,The professors are pretty understanding about the technical difficulties that come with online learning.
Freshman,4,I didn't understand Blackboard at first but I'm starting to get it. It seems very simple once you start it and as more classes go online it's more important
Alum,4,"Missouri State University's online courses were severely lacking at the time. Hopefully, they have improved. They were not interactive and did not offer an enjoyable learning experience."
Alum,4,It is a good place to grow and learn. Classes have a good balance of work and life. It does not have the most school pride but makes up for that in the fun and relaxed air during school events.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere on campus is fantastic, and many of the professors are very good. The degree programs are really great too."
Junior,4,Missouri State University has a beautiful campus surrounded by a bustling city. Campus is located next to the downtown area and there is plenty of non-campus housing located nearby.
Freshman,4,"Missouri State University has a very nice campus vibe to it and has always felt like home to me, even before I was accepted."
Freshman,4,My classes were taught partially in person and partially online to reduce class sizes. I feel that separating them in this manner helps to benefit both the individual student and the college as a whole.
Sophomore,4,"The online classes were hard to adjust to, I will admit. When you get use to it, it’s not too bad , but only after you get used to it."
Junior,4,"I like the atmosphere of campus. I also believe there are many opportunities for extra cirriculars, which is good for students. Student run organizations are always planning activities on campus. The professors are good too."
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed the beautiful campus grounds as well as the diverse selection of courses and degrees suited for just about anyone. As a student of the College of Business, I acclimated well to the fast-paced environment, though a few of the professors I was enrolled under proved to be lacking and disrespectful in my honest opinion. Otherwise, Missouri State University is a great place to get a degree in nearly any field one can imagine."
Junior,4,I think the campus is beautiful. It’s much larger than you expect and has lots of clubs to offer. One thing I would like to see change is the cost of tuition. It’s not the most expensive but still very hard to keep up with sometimes.
Junior,4,I believe the online courses are usually quite straightforward and helpful. They are usually extra work but worth it.
Alum,4,I'm an alum so I wasn't at MO State when quarantine started but this website is making me talk about the switch to online so here's 4/5 stars cause I believe in you.
Junior,4,"It is a great atmosphere, but if you need to get paper work done it is very slow....................."
Junior,4,"It was difficult due to not all professors took using Black Board seriously, but overall everyone tried with what they had."
Sophomore,4,"For a rather large university, MSU has fairly small class sizes and teachers are much easier to connect. From my time there most of the teachers actually care and understand the hardships of students. They also have some advisors who are actually helpful."
Freshman,4,Missouri State has a very inviting and friendly environment. Everything you could possibly need is very close if not on campus. I can walk all of the campus in about 15 minutes which is great when you may be running a little late. I have joined numerous clubs and I have met so many amazing and nice people. There is always some event going on that any student can go to and many free things you can receive for showing school spirit.
Sophomore,4,"I like how all the teachers and departments are very caring and willing to help. Also, I love how friendly campus is"
Freshman,4,I really like the student body atmosphere here. Everyone is very friendly and the student body isn't too big or small. Something I would like to see change is better security for students who park their cars within the parking garages.
Niche User,4,It was really good to visit Missouri State because i learn a lot about that school and made me really interested i apply for it
Sophomore,4,"Missouri State University is an amazing campus. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone on campus is so welcoming. The staff at Missouri State want the best for each and everyone of the students that are enrolled in the university. All the professors are extremely knowledgeable in the field that they teach in. They want all their students to do their best and gain as much information about their field of study as they can. Professors here allow students to come into their office hours to meet if they have questions and that way they can help them in the right direction. Missouri State offers a lot of different ways to get involved on campus. Whether it be through the fraternity and sorority life, to the academic clubs, sports and different other opportunities, there is never any doubt that people are always gonna be there for you."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors are really nice and kind, and they have a passion to teach students who are eager to learn. There are a lot of events and activities which we can join. The campus is beautiful and the environment is also good to focus on studying. The one thing that I hope they could change is food of the dining hall. The quality of food does not deserve the price. It is really difficult to keep eating from the dining hall."
Freshman,4,Missouri State University offers many resources to its students. It’s an amazing place that feels like home!
Junior,4,"I personally love the university. It has a very diverse population, lots of things to do, and is so open towards students of all types. However, I feel as though they may not always cater to commuter students all the times, since most events are planned to attract those who live on campus."
Niche User,4,"I like how the campus feels big, but it is really not compared to other universities. It is also well maintained and the school spirit is great!"
Junior,4,Beautiful campus! Clubs for just about anything you can think of or create your own club. Lots of ways to meet new people and events that give away free shirts all the time.
Sophomore,4,I have yet to start but when I talked to the faculty for my degree they were very helpful and knowledgeable.
Niche User,4,It is a very positive place and has a very good community. A lot of my friends go there and they love and have loved the experience.
Freshman,4,"Missouri State offers a stunning, well kept, and clean campus that makes you excited to attend. The advising counselors actually care about you and your goals. The housing is not the greatest (since a lot of the rooms have not been updated) but the school is making an effort to improve on them. Everyone seems genuinely happy and proud to go to school here, which makes you feel happy and proud. There's campus security, emergency alert poles (everywhere), and adequate lighting that ensures the safety of students. The one real complaint with the campus is the parking. With the growing number of students, the demand for parking spaces is increasing which is making it more difficult for students to find adequate parking. The university needs to restructure its parking situation for its growing number of students. Aside from parking, you receive a quality education at a reasonable price. I would recommend Missouri State for anyone looking for a safe and quality education for a good price."
Sophomore,4,"Dorms are overpriced and food is not so good, but other than that, it is a great school. The academics are fine and the teachers are mostly laid back. I have heard, however that there are some you shouldn't take. The only thing I can't stand is that there isn't ever any parking on the campus."
Freshman,4,I’ve gone to this school for a week and the transition has been welcoming and easy to do. The plans they have for food and transportation to and from class to dorms are ideal for a person who isn’t fortunate enough to have money. My only concern is the SOAR session that’s mandatory to enroll as a student. It’s too suffocation being hustled around every hour to sit in on hour long talks over how sensitive people are. They split me up to have my parents sit in on stuff I should have been listening to so I could pay for my college and put me in a room to make a silly chant. The college life is great but 50% of the soar session is unnecessary.
Junior,4,"Missouri State University has low crime and a beautiful campus.  The campus bus, the Bear Line, is very convenient.  However, parking could be improved as there currently isn't enough for everyone.  The classes are generally small if department specific, creating a better learning environment to focus and get to know your peers."
Sophomore,4,"Missouri State University is a fairly cost-effective school. All of the professors that I've had care about the students and their well-being. Mental health is important here; each student gets 8 free sessions a semester. Everybody is friendly here and do a good job at making everybody feel welcome. Classes have always been manageable, and there's tons of resources for the students. There is so much to do on campus every week, and almost everything is free. The only thing I wish they would fix is the parking; it's hard to get anything close to where you're living and you usually end up having to park far away. Despite the parking situation, I'm very glad to go to Missouri State."
Junior,4,"Overall, MSU is a wonderful place for students regardless of background! As a music major especially, there are tonnes of resources and support to encourage newbies to grow. The music program treats everyone like family.

My biggest complaint is that the campus food is entirely lack luster. The PSU has good food only because they are normal restaurants, but the campus cafeterias (Blair-Shannon especially) are a total nightmare to eat in, with students leaving containers open and the staff hardly bothering to make sure that the food is fresh before serving.

The professors are always friendly and down to earth. As someone who studies in obscure musical theory, it's wonderful to have multiple people knowledgeable in the subject."
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my second year at Missouri State, and I absolutely love it.  I have become involved in an environment that truly brings me joy.  Each time someone asks me where I attend college, I am able to say with great pride that I go to Missouri State University.  Although I have great admiration for my school, I find it difficult to receive scholarships and that they are very particular with their scholarships."
Junior,4,"Missouri State has a massive variety of degrees to chooses from and was one of the first I found to have the degree I wanted! Easy adjustment for transfer students, constant opportunities for student involvement and a beautiful campus. The only thing I'd like to see change as far as efficiency goes is the financial aid department."
Sophomore,4,"I felt comfortable there, more than what I would've expected. There were a lot of people and students, including staff, that were always there for me. The professors were on top of it all the time. They would always answer my questions thoroughly. I got really comfortable with he area and the community within."
Junior,4,"I like that Missouri State has the feel of a small school in a small city, but offers all the amenities of a large city campus, and is in a great town. The students and faculty are friendly, and the school is close to anything you'd need. The professors truly care about your success, and the school feels close knit, like a large family."
Senior,4,"Great choice if you don't want to graduate with student debt. Academically it really depends on which program you are enrolling in. The business department seemingly gets the most funds thrown their way, while the lights on the media studio don't work. No one really cares about sports here, though the ladies basketball did just make it to the Sweet Sixteen."
Sophomore,4,"Great school with a wide variety of people and organizations. Many great opportunities for networking and socializing but only if you make a legitimate effort to get involved. I would estimate that 15-20% of the student population is actively involved in an organization or has a role/leadership position in one, these people interact with others in that same breakdown a lot more and thus are exposed to more opportunities on campus by networking. Joining an organization, whether FSL, Student Government, or a club/team, is very easy and I highly recommend it for easy professional, academic, and social growth.

Facilities are being renovated constantly as funding for the university increases. Recent projects include Glass Hall, Ellis Hall, the Health & Wellness Center, and smaller installations like hammock stations and outdoor areas. A new residence hall is also being constructed for the coming Fall."
Freshman,4,"It is an easy going campus with a lot of great people. Excellent College of Agriculture. The faculty and staff are wonderful.  Very easy to navigate, small campus.  You can get almost anywhere on campus in 15 minutes."
Sophomore,4,There is always something to do and always a chance to create bonds with amazing people. Whether that be fellow students or faculty.
Freshman,4,The atmosphere at Missouri State is awesome. The professors I have had have all been incredibly and caring. The professors and advisors at Missouri State truly care about you and what you to exceed during your time at the university.
Sophomore,4,"missouri state is a very accepting campus. there is something for everyone! there is every club you can imagine, fsl, study abroad (which i did), and much much more."
Freshman,4,Missouri state is in a great town with plenty to do. Most professors are fairly easy to deal with. You may have more fun here if you're in a frat or sorority.
Sophomore,4,I like how open the campus is. It is relatively easy to get around! All of the professors are super helpful and friendly and all my peers have been super encouraging and friendly as well.
Freshman,4,"Missouri State University has been like a family from the very first day. Everyone here has pride in our university and supports each other, from sports to the amazing band that we have here."
Senior,4,Missouri State University is a great school. This should be high on anyone's list in Missouri if looking to further their education in at university.
Graduate Student,4,"Missouri State is a great college. It is in Southwest Missouri, so students from rural areas all around often come, but it is also not far from major cities like St. Louis. The tuition costs are the best around for a quality degree."
Niche User,4,Missouri State is awesome to do online college through! I have been enrolled in a few MSU online classes and they are very easy to work with. The classes are made to help you learn. My friend attends school here and has helped me with rating the food and environment.
Freshman,4,Missouri State is a very diverse school with students from all over the world. O have made friends with people from around the world and it has helped me appreciate other cultures as well as mine.  One thing that can be improved is the spaces for parking. There are not enough spaces for students to park and it is sometimes stressful looking for somewhere to park.
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus with lots of opportunities to get involved. The professors are generally helpful and always willing to aid students with whatever they need. Campus manages to have a small community feel while still being diverse and interesting. The only challenging part of living on campus is finding a parking spot.
Senior,4,I love the atmosphere at Missouri State University.  It is very culturally diverse.  I would like to see it offer a greater variety of majors.
Freshman,2,"My online professor has been very flexible and understanding during the given circumstances. Also, Blackboard is the worst program that I have ever used. Every time I use it a demon transports me to hell."
Junior,2,While taking online classes in the recent shutdown the professors were not at all prepared and that made for a generally unpleasant experience.
Junior,2,"My online experience with classes was poor, but only because it was rushed due to Covid-19. We went on spring break and didn't expect to not return. The instructors, however, did their best in order to ease students into the transition."
Freshman,2,The campus is amazing but if you aren't in greek life then there isn't much to do. The professors are also not helpful at all. If you are looking for a school that revolves around sports and student life then this isn't for you. The sports suck here.
Alum,2,Very low return on investment unless you graduate and attend a prestigious graduate school outside of the Midwest.
Freshman,2,I loved the beautiful campus and there truly was a sense of community. I did not like the pressure to choose a major as soon as possible and finish in 4 years. I personally was not ready to choose a career and my adviser was not accepting of that. The parking is also terrible and other students do not keep the dorms clean.
College Junior,2,"Greek life at Missouri State is literally a joke. We aren't even suppose to call it greek life because that's offensive. It is FSL, fraternity and sorority life."
College Sophomore,2,Springfield has a dominantly white community which is apparent on the Missouri State campus.
College Freshman,2,"The football team blows, the basketball team is hit or miss but the baseball team is really good."
College Freshman,2,i don't like the frats
College Freshman,2,"People are generally accepting of minorities on campus, however within Springfield, minorities are not well-respected. Furthermore, there is very little diversity within Missouri State University."
College Sophomore,2,Being required to live on campus put me in an awkward position as I could only afford the cheapest resident hall and even then it still seems very overpriced for the conditions.
College Senior,2,"In the Kinesiology department, you do not get to choose your internship. They have a list of unpaid internships and those are your options. Ugh"
College Senior,2,"I can't wait to graduate from this hell hole. If I had to explain the top complaints, it would be parking and the financial aid office. The people working in financial aid are not helpful, nor nice. Even if you are eligible for FAFSA, they will make it as hard as they can for you to access the money, which doesn't even make sense. The are old and rude. Perhaps they should get some young, recently graduated students so that there is a little compassion and understanding for students needing financial aid.The parking is an absolute joke. One of my professors told our class that MSU's second greatest income after tuition is parking tickets. I don't have a single doubt in my mind. Thinking metered parking to avoid the over-priced parking permit? Think again. Metered parking is more expensive than city metered parking. The only thing keeping me from rating the school is one is a few good instructors i've had over the years. You know that saying, ""You get what you pay for?"" Missouri State fits this perfectly."
College Junior,2,"Our football team is crap. Basketball is pretty good, as well as track and field."
College Junior,2,It seemed like every weekend we were getting an alert about a student being sexually assaulted in an acquaintance's dorm room. I can't tell you for sure what they were doing in the room but there were about 10 incidences this semester (Fall 2015).  I haven't heard of any other problems around campus. My poor rating was due to the number of incidences not because I feel like the campus is unsafe or anything. I've walked on campus at night by self going to the gym and I've never had any problems.
College Senior,2,No one goes to events and the only time people attend is homecoming game because fraternity and sorority life are required to attend.
College Freshman,2,"The classes are not bad and most of the professors are adequate. I had one professor who never emailed me back, which is very unprofessional. The social scene is not a fit for me. I am not interested in Greek life, so I don't have the opportunity to go to parties. I also don't like to drink, and that's all there is to do in Springfield, MO. It's not a very safe town."
College Sophomore,2,"Like most big colleges, the administration constantly messes things up. Students complain about any work and always find excuses for why they're doing poorly. There are a few very bright people, but you always feel badly for them because their talents are wasted here. International students seem to dislike the town and you can't blame them. Springfield is barely 5 miles across, but everyone drives in this ""bike friendly"" town. You will probably be part of or witness an accident in your first semester. There are many good faculty members, but there are no opportunities for research outside of classes you won't get into until your last two years. Clubs are hit or miss and most people are very happy to be somewhere so mediocre."
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls are the biggest way the school forces you to shell out cash. It is required to have some form of meal-plan and boomer meals if you live on campus, and let me tell you, it is NOT worth it what so ever. While boomer meals are useful, the mandatory meal plan options will have you feeling like you just wasted a whole lot of money. First of all, most people I have talked to say that the catering service the school uses is the same thats standard for St Louis area high schools, so expect high school lunch style food. The lunch/dinner hours are a serious inconvenience to many students, with nothing but junk food being served outside of meal hours. Unless you are incredibly frugal and have the intestinal fortitude to handle the repetitive, frequently under and over cooked food multiple times a day, there is absolutely no need to go above a 10 per week meal plan. Everyone I know with a meal plan has no trouble staying under 10 and I've never heard of anyone maxing out for the week. If you go higher than 10 per week and aren't even coming close to using them, you cannot change your plan till the semester is over. As for the dining halls themselves, things are not much better. Garst is a very nice building and is an enjoyable place to be at, but the food quality dips significantly as the semester drags on. The menu becomes far less varied, the food becomes worse, and at times you wonder if they're just running out of supplies back there and just don't feel like restocking until the semester is over to cut costs. That being said, Garst reigns supreme over Blair-Shannon seven days a week and for the first two months of the semester is pretty good. Blair-Shannon dining hall, which I live on top of, is notorious for being crap. The facility is nice besides the noticeable lack of a floor (it's just multi colored slabs of granite that clearly used to have a floor on top of them). The food however is almost always flavorless, not properly cooked, and frequently cold."
College Freshman,2,"Other than Hutchens, the dorms are very small and crammed. I get like a 1/4 of a kitchen. The building's are very old. The dorms are definitely overpriced! It's almost $10,000 a year to stay in Hammons & Hutchens and it's definitely not worth it."
College Junior,2,"A lot of people complain about financial aid here. I didn't realize I wasn't getting any this semester and they didn't tell me until 50% course refund drop deadline had come up, so even if I drop out, it's not going to make a difference. I might as well take the higher debt and keep all my classes."
College Student,2,They were very helpful. You just need to be prepared for everything and I wasn't.
College Freshman,2,"Springfield is notorious for being a dangerous place crowded by homeless and muggers. The drive to the town is beautiful, but the actual city is too industrial. The traffic is TERRIBLE."
Recent Alumnus,2,Gigantic class sizes with very few sections offered.
Recent Alumnus,2,Class sizes are gigantic and not a variety offered.  Everyone says it's different in the College of Business and the rest of the university has smaller classes - including my professors.
Recent Alumnus,2,"No culture really unless on the college campus.  No big sports, very safe."
College Freshman,2,"Now, it may look like I have ranked this backwards, but let me explain. Sports are a pretty big part of campus. THAT IS A BAD THING. You go to college to learn. It's like high school all over again, where the football players are the big shots. Some athletes are stuck up. Not a very fun environment for a student who takes school seriously."
College Junior,2,Enforce the important stuff like where you can park your bike not as much on underage drinking or any other small violations.
College Junior,2,Not a fan of greek life. Its good for drinking and friendships you must pay for.
College Senior,2,"Workload is okay, the department is strict."
College Senior,2,"Not much to do, not prominent on campus."
College Senior,2,"Not many options, weird hours, can't take food to go."
College Senior,2,I have a 3.8 GPA and received no scholarships.
College Senior,2,"The general population of students are Missouri raised, caucasian, and from the St. Louis suburbs."
College Junior,2,The food is not good at all especially late night. Ew!
College Junior,2,"We have a lot of students from different countries, but it's still segregated by race."
College Freshman,2,It is ongoing and I feel like I am at a complete lose with any aid. I feel like I will not be able to afford the college of my choice.
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus food is subpar and the lines are too long. Too few choices for the number of students
Recent Alumnus,2,"No issue getting my aid, however the government doesn't take personal issues into account like my parents having to a mortgage and medical bills and I was not issued enough aid."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't agree with having to ""buy"" friends. But networks are a great tool."
College Sophomore,2,"We are not good at sports, or at least not football which is what I pay attention to"
College Senior,2,"The dorms have very strict visitation rules: each floor is either male or female, and no members of the opposite sex are allowed on the floor after midnight during the week. On the weekends, you can have overnight visitor's if the opposite sex, but they're supposed to register at the front desk of the dorm. It's a dry campus and you'll have to pour everything out, pay a fine, and attend a class if you're caught drinking in the dorms. However, so long as you're not loud and stupid, it's easy to get away with drinking in the dorms if that's your thing. Campus safety is a joke and police are usually pretty understanding so long as you're not rude to them."
College Freshman,2,"While on campus, transportation is great.. I listed a bad rating because I do not have transportation to school and have to rely on friends and coworkers to get to class..."
College Freshman,2,"College students should be offered healthier options when it comes to dining! Fast food and ""convenience"" is SO yesterday. haha, seriously though, more thoughtful and healthy options should be available."
College Freshman,2,I recieve no information and they try to get my mother to apply for loans when im supposed to be paying for my own school. you cant register until all your funds are cleared which is a struggle for me everytime.
College Senior,2,"I have not yet done any internships in Springfield, Missouri.  All of the internships are achieved on individual basis and not school sponsored."
College Senior,2,"There are only a handful of apartment owners in town so selection is rather limited.  There is no way to be approved unless you have a cosigner or work full time while attending school.  The prices for this city are, in my opinion, way too high for what you get.  The prices are comparable to a larger area that has a larger number of amenities."
College Freshman,2,"On campus parking is expensive, and there seems to be a lot of spots… but there are definitely more students than spots (unless you want to park all the way in Bear Park North) Also, when there are basketball games, lot 15 A closes which takes away about 3 rows of student parking and it is very frustrating having to park so far away when there are no spots."
College Senior,2,"I pay $76 for fall and spring semester, and depending on when you have class, you have to get to MSU at least an hour early and drive around to find one spot. It's ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"It sucks, there is no lie about that. We need more spaces."
College Sophomore,2,WINTER IS THE WORST. I have lived in Missouri almost all my life. Not the greatest. But i do suggest being around in the fall and spring. It's beautiful.
College Freshman,2,"Students pay to park, but a required to leave when basketball is at JQH."
College Junior,2,"I have a green parking permit and out of the 3 or so relatively close green lots, not a single one ever has any open spots. Every day I come home I have to wither park all the way over in Bear Park North (and I live over in the Monroe) or down on Elm or Walnut. There's never any parking on campus."
College Senior,2,Class cancel due to weather a few times
College Senior,2,There's is always a story.
College Senior,2,Not much ...just a liquor store Taco Bell and a Burger King. also a domino pizza
College Sophomore,2,"The student health center does not accept my insurance, therefore I can not even go there."
College Sophomore,2,Even the athlete's partake in use of alcohol and drugs.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't do it again and wish I hadn't done it in the first place.
Senior,1,The school did not do a good job with the transitioning to online learning. The teachers weren't helpful when students needed more assistance.
Alum,1,"Back in the 1990s when I was attending Southwest Missouri State University, now Missouri State University, there was no online learning.  We did not have laptops to take notes from.  We did not have devices at our fingertips.  Every class was seated.  If you missed class, there was no way to watch it online to get the content.  You had to hope someone would share their notes with you the next class period.  It was a different world.  But one I'm so glad I was able to experience."
Niche User,1,"I went on a tour of Missouri State and really liked the campus. However, I had a couple of meetings scheduled in regards to my major and both of them got cancelled without notice. The first one I had scheduled with was with an admissions advisor and he was out of town and the lady I met with instead didn’t seem to know much of anything. And the second was with someone specifically for my major. I arrived about 10 minutes early. Explained that I was a perspective student and where the email said my meeting was supposed to be held with no word of who it was supposed to be with. Confused they took me in there and someone would show up soon since I was early. Meeting time rolls around and someone else came in there and said there was a different scheduled meeting and had no clue what I was talking about. So if you want organization you should look elsewhere."
Niche User,1,I've stopped hiring people from this university. There's a level of critical thinking and ability to do research that has not existed in the last several that I've hired from this school.
College Freshman,1,I do not think that I get the quality of housing for the price I pay.
College Senior,1,"Springfield is right in the middle of the bible belt. We have many elderly people and many hillbillies who are not tolerant of other cultures and races. Its been this way for so long, it makes it seem normal to the students. There is especially prejudice towards muslims and african americans."
College Senior,1,"Totally unsafe. Security guards are grossly overweight, very old and incapable and in my personal experience, they are annoyed if you need them for anything. I used to work on campus and we were supposed to call security to escort us to our cars after the computer lab closed down late at night. After many nights of waiting half an hour for them to get there and be angry that they had to escort us,we simply stopped calling. There have been reports of sexual assault every week for months on end."
College Sophomore,1,I had no idea how to find or get scholarships because there was no one to help me.
College Freshman,1,"Springfield is a big city with a small town mind. 

Actually, that's not true. Springfield isn't really what I classify as a ""city"". It's not urban. There are no skyscrapers. It's very spread out. It's more like a giant suburb. 

People all think the same, all dress the same, all grow up to be the same thing. Prom is the biggest day of your life, go to a state school, get married, have kids, spend the rest of your life without any meaning. If you believe in anything remotely liberal, don't you dare say anything about politics or run the risk of being shunned. You know that song in High School Musical? ""No, no, no, stick to the status quo"". That's Springfield's motto. Which is perfectly fine if you fit into this mold. If you don't, you will be very lonely and very miserable.

Also, whoever built the city did not account for the population growth. There is NO parking, buildings and schools are overcrowded. Downtown is very run down and sketchy. 

There isn't really anything to do in town unless you're under 10 or over 21. And they wonder why Springfield has a drug problem."
College Freshman,1,"Sometimes I feel left out because I didn't join a sorority and it seems like I am always surrounded by sorority girls. In one of my classes, at least half of the girls are in a sorority. It's almost like middle school again. Since you're not ""in the Clique"" you're missing out. 

I might have been more inclined to join a sorority if it weren't so expensive. It also eats up a lot of time. Sometimes they have events going on until 10 on a weekday night. Don't these girls have homework to do?"
College Freshman,1,"I hear police sirens go off at least once a day. 417 is Springfield's area code for a reason. HECK YES DRUGS!!!1! 

As for health, if you ever feel poorly, you could always ask one of the 874059175386`5623328463 nursing majors there are around you at any given moment in time."
College Sophomore,1,"I am an honor student in 3 different honor groups, and I can't get any scholarship money outside of FAFSA due to my parents not making less than $12,000 a year."
College Freshman,1,"Not a fan. snobby, annoying, selfish mostly... mommy and daddy pays for everything"
College Freshman,1,"last fall I had to wait an extra month to receive my financial aid because 1 of 2 employed workers who dealt with paperwork, went on vacation in the middle of filing!!!!"
College Freshman,1,I do not like the girls here. They think they are hot stuff and they are mean.
College Freshman,1,I really don't like dining hall food. I think it is gross and not worth the money. Next year I will not be getting a meal plan. We do have meal trade which is nice because you can get chickfila and stuff for one of your meals instead which is what I usually do.
College Sophomore,1,Same as high school lunches. rather drive some where to get food
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is terrible.  There is not enough lots and the permits are too expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"for anyone who does not live on campus it is difficult to find parking.  off campus students do not have covenient parking and the fee for off campus is ridiculius.  if you part in the wrong lot they charge you., its all about trying to make things difficult and then profiting from that difficulity"
College Junior,1,There is not as much excitement for our sports at MSU. Most students prefer hanging out at coffee shops or downtown instead of at games.

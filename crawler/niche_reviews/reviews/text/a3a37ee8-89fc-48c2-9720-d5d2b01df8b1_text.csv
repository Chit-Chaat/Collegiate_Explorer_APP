Alum,5,"An excellent school with high academic standards and commitment to training students to think critically and perform excellently in their fields. The community is incredibly supportive, the professors knowledgable and willing to work with students, and even the general education classes are engaging and useful."
Freshman,5,"I love The Master's University! Everyone is so nice and helpful. It is a small campus, so everything is in walking range."
Senior,5,"This University is great university with a wonderful community, wonderful doctrine, and many opportunities to get involved in the church and in learning more about Scripture."
Senior,5,"I was originally worried about taking some of my classes online, but the professors really made it simple and easy to transition from an in-person class to an online class with the same if not more resources available to use to complete our assignments and finish the course strong."
Freshman,5,"It has a BEAUTIFUL campus and amazing and efficient facilities. The staff and students are very engaged and care deeply about everyone, whether you go to the school or not. Everybody becomes like family really fast, and everyone is extremely nice and helpful. Everyone is very encouraging and grateful to be at a college as well rounded and beautiful as this one."
Niche User,5,"Master's is truly unique. No other school cares for you the way TMU does! I have taken one online class, starting my freshman year here in the fall, and I have lived right by the school my whole life. What a gift this place is."
Alum,5,"The Master's University is a beautiful place to live and learn. It's big enough to give you a high-quality education and degree, while being just small enough to still provide a more personal environment."
Alum,5,"I came from public school and chose TMU over the UC system to enjoy a christian-based education. I learned so much about biblical studies, was able to study in Israel for a semester and made life-long friends. The on-campus experience is filled with activity throughout the year. The biblical education was taught by great bible teachers and the business courses were taught by extremely competent and successful leaders in the business world. Although not as well known as a UC school, I would not trade my experience and personal/professional education for the world!"
Freshman,5,It is an EXCELLENT school for people who want to strenggthen their relationship with God. It is an amazing place to get ready for the real world and gets you ready to be an independant citizen. I highly recommand this place for individuals who want to learn about God and become more holy.
Sophomore,5,"The Master's University is a Christ-centered institution that is very strongly and unwaveringly committed to the inerrancy and sufficiency of Scripture, preparing students for a life of Christian influence and kingdom work.  As a small university, the professors are deeply involved in the lives of students, as evidenced by the success of students in their subsequent careers both while in college and once graduated.  The cost is far more affordable than other private Christian colleges, yet the college provides the best in every area, whether it be dorms, teaching, facilities, library, resources for students and so on."
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed the culture at TMU, and how everything is run. When I last visited, which was on a viewing day, the students and staff there made me feel like I was home. Another thing about this school is that it's in California which makes it a great springboard for many career paths."
Alum,5,"I had the best experience at The Master's University. It was amazing being at a school that values biblical truth, and encourages others to pursue Christ together. The professors are great, and they really care about their students.  Student life offers fun events, intramural sports, clubs, and an environment centered around the Lord. Really. This is not a school that just claims to be christian. It really is. It takes God's Word seriously, and it helps teach it's students through a biblical worldview. this is true whether you're studying Bible, Business, Biology, Teacher Education, etc. I have been blessed to be able to attend this amazing university. It prepared me to get a great job in my field after graduating. It taught me how to share the gospel with others in my field in a loving way. The Master's University is as much a ministry as it is an institution of higher education."
Sophomore,5,They teach the subjects!! Getting rare these days in college. And they're so helpful with finances. Kindest staff I've ever met.
Freshman,5,"They are very personal and very helpful. The admissions counselor always responds right away and other departments, too, spend time explaining and making sure all your questions are answered. 

They have a very good reputation and put a good emphasis on the Christian faith and the Word of God."
Niche User,5,Though I haven't attend The Master's University. I know people who went there had an amazing experience with the campus and the professors. I visited the school and everyone was kind and helpful on telling me what I needed to be a student there. I think I will have an amazing experience when I do attend The Master's University. I checked out the dorms and other students told me that its the best there.
Niche User,5,Master's is great. Friendly atmosphere and kind professors. You'll make plenty of friend if you look in the right place. If you want partying this school isnt for you though.
Freshman,5,"I'm taking online classes with The Master's University, and quite enjoying them! The teachers are excellent at interacting and responding to questions, and the lectures are presented in a clear and orderly way. There's still plenty of interaction between students in the discussion boards, and the flexibility of the online schedule is allowing me to work, travel, volunteer, and still finish college!"
Graduate Student,5,The atmosphere is wonderful.  Study is challenging but not overwhelming.  Lots of fun activities planned and the people are very genuine.
Junior,5,"I think that this is a very unique University that holds strongly to the Bible and incorporating it into every aspect of the school. Excellence and integrity are highly valued and expected in every class. The professors are caring, passionate and intelligent professionals, while also down-to-earth. The classes are not easy. They are designed to make you actually learn the material and apply it to life. But the professors are skilled at incorporating various avenues of learning so audio, visual, and kinetic learners are reached where they are. Not to mention that the staff are cheerful, helpful, and go the extra mile to make sure you're taken care of. 
Only way I can see the school could improve would be to better communicate internally and externally."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. The students are welcoming and friendly. Also, the financial aid department is very welcoming and they aren’t afraid to assist those in need as much as possible with options in how to afford this school. There is nothing I would change."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love my university . The faculty are wise and seek to know their students. I love my classes and have learned so much. I have also learned a  student leadership, and enjoyed being employeed by my university."
Junior,5,"The Master's University is a uniquely blessed university. It offers an exceptional academic career, while holding tightly to the core beliefs of it's foundation. Understanding and experiencing the Truth of God is the prime focus at the Master's University and gravitates all knowledge and wisdom from the written word of God."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love The Master's University!  I transferred to this school from my state college in Florida, and it is two completely different worlds!  I have never known professors like the ones I have now.  They care about me as a person and only want to see me grow.  My professors also work with me when I am struggling and give encouragement whenever they can.  The Master's University has been such a blessing to me and I would recommend this school to anyone and everyone!"
Junior,5,"I love the dynamic that TMU has. It's a small school, so it's easy to know the people that you see around every single day. It's easy to get plugged into groups or activities, and the staff and faculty truly care about the best interest of the students! This is not a party school, unlike many other universities in CA, rather this school takes education very seriously as well as student life."
Freshman,5,"Coming into Master's I didn't know to expect coming into private Christian University, but I can say that after completing my Freshman year there, my experience was awesome. Not only was I able to go to a University where I am able to go to chapel three times a week and tea God's word, but I was surrounded by students and staff that believe in Christ. Being part of the Cross country and Track team was truly a blessing because I built so many amazing relationships with my peers  and just itself the team bonding we have in Christ is one of my favorite parts I love about Master's. Although my Freshman year was hard for me I had many people supporting me and praying for me, if you're going through hard times not only will your teachers, but your peers and others working at the school would gladly pray for you. I can say that at Master's I am getting an education and experience like no other."
Niche User,5,"went to visit and noticed the environment is ""feels like home"", the staff is friendly and welcoming, the ratio is 10 to 1 which gives the student a one on one attention, other students are ready to assist, gave the impression of helping one another actitud. Love it."
Freshman,5,"Best place in my opinion for 4 year college. Classes are much more intimate, and you can get to know your professors. People are really out here to help you if you need it."
Freshman,5,"I have had a phenomenal experience at The Master's University. The university staff is very invested in helping every student to achieve their goals. The academic programs are very well-designed and the professors are excellent at helping students to understand the material intellectually, as well as practically. The university campus is very well-laid out and the food is delicious. While the school's weakest aspects would be its athletics department and party scene, that can be a positive, depending on what is most important to you. All things considered, The Master's University is a fantastic school and you will not regret furthering your education here."
Niche User,5,"I haven't been yet, but just from interacting with their staff and the things I hear, it is a very good school!"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my school. There is no other school I can imagine being at. The school is a relatiely small school which makes getting classes easier and gives you more face-to-face time with professors. The students and faculty are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet and will go out of their way to help you out. The classes operate just as I would expect a university class to operate. The lectures and labs are serious but fun, because the professors actually care and want you to retain the information you learn."
Sophomore,5,Excellent academics and great teachers.  I do online schooling and the format is easy to understand and very user friendly.
Junior,5,This is a great school that really yearns to teach about Christ and surrounds all the teaching around his word. The people are great and have a love for the Lord that I have never seen before. I am blessed to be attending this school and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to enter a Christian College.
Alum,5,"The Master's College was a fantastic experience for the 4 years I attended. Even though it is a small school, they have a lot to offer, and I left wishing I had taken advantage of more opportunities."
Freshman,5,"The Master's (now) University is unlike any other school I know of. The dedication to the Scriptures and truth of God is unmatched. The faculty and staff, primarily the Professors are beloved by all the students as they continually practice soul-care and devotion to the spiritual benefit of the student. 
As a daughter of an alum, I have seen this institution evolve and develop into a phenomenal competitive university, yet without negligence to the holiness of Scriptures. 
Whether you are in the field of music, business, science, missions (and more) with a firm stand for the truth, The Master's University should be considered as you will not find any similar nearby."
Freshman,5,The quality of the professor is great. People on campus are very friendly and welcoming. The food at the caf is not the best but it is okay.
College Freshman,5,"The Master's College is a school that truly stands for what the Bible says. In classes and out, the professors are a shining light among the students and leave a God-Honoring example of how us students should walk with Christ."
College Junior,5,The school has a great security staff
College Junior,5,I am glad I am going here
College Junior,5,It is one of the best schools in the country and even the world. God is honored at this private Christian Collage and I am blessed to be able to attend.
College Freshman,5,"The Security Guards at TMC are incredibly helpful and supportive - They'll walk with you if you feel unsafe, help you find missing items, and are present all over the campus"
College Freshman,5,"I've grown up around this school, and have been deeply touched by TMC's students and professors. They all have a heart for the Lord, and display that in everything they do, encouraging one another in every situation."
College Junior,5,"The Master's College is located in a very peaceful, residential area. Very infrequently, someone who seems to be dangerous wanders onto campus. In this situation the school immediately notifies students, staff, and faculty to go on lockdown. Classrooms seem to be securely built if such a situation were to arise. It should be noted, that I have not experienced any danger internally from students. It's a very safe school."
College Junior,5,"Classes are relatively small, which allows for in class discussion and the opportunity to be known and know the professor. Most classes are lecture based."
College Junior,5,"The Master's College teaches me about the importance core character and integrity and prepares me to be competitive in my desired field. Faculty and staff are examples of excellence in their work places and relationships with students and other employees. The importance of the Bible is tangibly demonstrated through students who attend TMC, as well as, through the faculty and staff and I feel prepared to defend my faith in a loving and compassionate manner. The Master's College is unique because they do what they say. They are very intentional about discipling students and challenging them to be the best they can be for the glory of God. Even despite my accumulating loans, I would choose TMC time and time again."
College Sophomore,5,Our security does a great job at keeping us safe.
College Sophomore,5,"Fantastic school. The community feels like a giant family, and is always encouraging. The courses are challenging and educating. Profs are willing to work with you. I love the small class size and Chapel"
College Freshman,5,"It's easy to find internships, and gen eds are even accommodating to them. A degree from here is very respectable and employers love our graduates."
College Freshman,5,The education here is the best there is. I will never regret the things I've learned and experienced here.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is always safe. I never feel uncomfortable.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are extremely knowledgeable in teaching their courses.
College Sophomore,5,The dorms are great! Everyone in them is always friendly.
College Sophomore,5,I would choose my school over any other school. It continues to teach me and build the education that my parents started.
College Senior,5,"As an English major, there are few jobs that are directly related to my field, but the skills I learned in my field are applicable to many jobs. Therefore, I feel extremely confident that I will find a job I love with my degree."
College Senior,5,"The professors at TMC are amazing. They challenged us academically as well as personally. I was stretched in ways I didn't think possible and challenged to pursue things I didn't know I could. The courses are difficult, but rewarding. Class sizes are small, even for Gen-eds. Upper division English courses are usually seminar style, which is preferable."
College Freshman,5,The team of security guards are well trained and committed to keeping the campus safe.
College Freshman,5,The Master's College strives to prepare students to live in the real world and make an impact for Christ.
College Freshman,5,"As a music major, the professors are committed to teaching excellence as well as preparing for real life application."
College Freshman,5,The social life at The Master's College is great with opportunities to do things with friends. The dorm staff is also committed to the growth of everyone in the dorm.
College Freshman,5,The Master's College is committed to training students in both academics and character based on the Bible.
College Senior,5,This school is great and has an incredible education. The doctrine at this school is very much accurate and the professors can confirm anything based on the Bible. This school has been so good to me and has been very helpful to me.
Freshman,4,"The online classes are very difficult because they are done in 8 weeks, but they are also very helpful."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and surrounding area.  I love the athletics program and team.  The people on campus are all very nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,What I liked about the Master's University is how kind everyone is to one another. Not to mention how helpful they are when one needs help academically. It would be quite amazing if there were more clubs to be involved in. Overall it is an amazing school.
Alum,4,This college offers a great community for students seeking a Christian education. All subjects are taught from a Biblical worldview. Professors are very caring and invest personally in students' lives. The campus is small but attractive and well maintained.
Senior,4,"The Master's University has one of the best business programs around. This is the third school I have attended and it has has by far the best business program that I have been apart of. Their dedication to the scriptures is remarkable, as is their experience in the business world. What I love the most is that all the profs are successful businessmen that do teaching as part of their ministry. They teach concepts and skills that they know are effective because they have used them in their own careers; they are tried and true. They are also all very easy to talk to and want all their students to succeed and thrive in whatever career their choose to go into."
College Freshman,4,"Master's athletes are good at what they do while being fair in their game. Winning or losing, they strive to glorify Christ in everything they do."
College Freshman,4,"During WOW there is a ""job fair"" for work study students, and throughout the year, different organizations come to campus passing out job applications."
College Freshman,4,"Professors at TMC put a great deal of effort into the classes - every one is different, so there's always something new to learn. The classes are relatively small so that the professor can focus on the students individually."
College Freshman,4,"I'm more in the Music and Communications Department, but my fellow Students and I love to encourage our Teams!! Whether it's watching the home game in the Gym, sitting out on the field, or watching an away game in the Mustag Grill, the team members always give their best, and do it all for God's glory instead of self-glorification."
College Junior,4,"I do not live on campus, but in talking with students who do and touring the dorms I think students are overall satisfied with what is offered. While some dorm layouts do not provide as much storage space as students might like, the overall social atmosphere and fellowship is worth it."
College Junior,4,There are always decent sized crowds every game day and at the homecoming games our gym and baseball field are overflowing with students and alumni. I think one thing that positively influences athletics is professor support. Professors attend games and extend reasonable grace to athletes while maintaining a challenging class atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,Teams do their best to perform well. Our baseball team and women's basketball team are really good.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. Our security guys are very good at their jobs and they're very personable too.
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are good. Professors care about their students on a deeper level than academics. The courses are amazing.
College Freshman,4,"Dorm life is great. Some buildings are older and dingier than others, but all are great."
College Sophomore,4,The rate of students being hired after graduation is much higher than other colleges.
College Sophomore,4,"Every time there is a game, wither home or away, the excitement is felt all around campus with the school colors seen everywhere."
College Senior,4,The security at TMC is very good. I always felt safe even when walking alone at night.
College Senior,4,"I loved my time at The Master's College. What makes it a unique place is that the Bible is placed at the forefront in every class. Naturally, this means that TMC is not for everyone, but it isn't intended to be. It is a small campus with an ""everybody knows everybody"" feel, which makes it both homey as well as claustrophobic. Overall, it is a wonderful school with strong academics."
College Sophomore,4,I love my school and would so go there again if I could go back in time.  I've been to a community college before and this one was waaaaaay better.  The teachers and staff are great!  The professors are passionate and the staff know what they're doing and talking about.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great school, honestly. The small class sizes rock and I love that I've never had any registration or parking horror stories like my friends who go to large schools. It's definitely very Christian. It's not really the college for someone who doesn't practice strict Christian living or doesn't believe in a strict, literal interpretation of the Bible. 27 units of Bible courses are required to graduate, which is really rough if you're not interested in theology. On the plus side, because of the school's strict Christian commitment everything is done to the fullest and the faculty and staff really care about the students. Everyone at the school is serious about being good stewards in every way, so the campus looks nice and people take classes seriously. The coolest thing about this school is probably the community. The combination of the small school (900 undergrads) and the nice character of the students is great. I remember my first year I was totally tripping out at how many smiles I would get just walking to class, when I didn't even no anyone."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is pretty small and as such cannot offer as much as other schools but, taking that into consideration, it is an amazing school. It has an alumni network all over the world. Since the school is close to the heart of LA, Master's has quite a few partnerships with businesses and offers many internships. The profs are amazing. They all desire the students to learn and excel in their major."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the people that go to my school. They come from all different backgrounds and each add to the overall experience. That being said, a lot of people dress like hipsters and like to visit coffee shops and make flower crowns. There are also a lot of musicians. Music is a huge part of our campus culture. Since we are a Christian school we joke about ring by spring but honestly I don't think it happens as much as people would like it to."
College Junior,4,There are lots of spots and places to satisfy any kind of variety one could look for!
College Junior,4,"Just at any school, there are people who do follow the rules and those who don't. There are saved people here and those who are unsaved and those decisions (or lack thereof) are manifested in different ways."
College Junior,4,"I really don't have much to say. It was pretty easy because I am an athlete, so I got some athletic money. However, not allowing athletic and academic scholarships stack is a huge hassle for not only me, but also lots of others."
College Junior,4,"It's fantastic, especially compared to other caf's in other schools. We have a fairly good variety of healthy options to eat!"
College Junior,4,I love living on campus! It's lots of fun and a great way to meet other people! It's very expensive (as is any school's on campus housing) and is not very far away from the rest of campus.
College Freshman,4,For those who live off campus I hear it's good
College Freshman,4,"Scholarships are somewhat easy to get, but the staff want you here, they will do what they can to help"
College Sophomore,4,they do a good job of keeping us accountable based on integrity
College Sophomore,4,I am really thankful for the care that the department puts into each student.
College Freshman,4,"My dorm is great, and I have RA's and Assistant RA's that really care about me."
College Freshman,4,"My internship is great. I work in the President's Office, and my supervisor has been extremely kind. I enjoy my work there and know that it will be valuable experience to add to my resume."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid office was very helpful when we called to better understand my financial aid papers.
College Freshman,4,I got a decent amount from the school but not too much is available because it's so small.
College Freshman,4,A definite pursuing-marriage style of dating. I think guys are pretty darn respectful here and we have a joke about DTR-ing--defining the relationship.
College Freshman,4,"Lotso of chains around, including chick-fil-a and in n out, which are fun for me because we don't have them, lots of Asian and Mexican restaurants, and a place called Egg Plantation which is supposed to be very good but I havent been there yet. I've been to a place called urbane cafe which was delicious and just a little expensive. There's a ton of froyo around too!"
College Freshman,4,"We have a clear-cut contract based on Biblical mandates and college policies. We are expected to agree with our signatures, but some don't on dress code and such and aren't too called out. Which is actually kind of disappointing as a lack of integrity. Campus is safe and virtually crime free."
College Freshman,4,"I wish we had quite options with kitchens, but bathrooms work fine even sharing on the wing. Dorm life is really healthy and sisterly, although there are still people I haven't met yet on my wing. However, I know some friends who know everyone on their wings so maybe I'm just too self-contained: )"
College Sophomore,4,Enough room to live in.  One of the smallest dorm room sizes I've seen.  Hot showers and plenty of bathroom stalls/sinks. Very clean facility.  Bummed that the dorms are so far from the caf - this prevents me from eating there as often as I'd like.
College Sophomore,4,"The regulations here on campus are very strict.  I believe that this creates a safe and fun atmosphere. I have noted that the staff will not hesitate to point something out if they feel that it is breaking regulation. 

The ONLY rule I disagree with is the policy of no dancing.  It is pointless - we all like to dance."
College Sophomore,4,"I had no problems enrolling in the English program at TMC.  However, upon taking my classes, I noticed that there is no emphasis.  Unlike most other colleges I've looked at, TMC does not offer an English major with an emphasis in writing/composition.  The program overall is very literature based.  However, as a literature-based English program, this major is a great one.  Plenty of class discussion concerning historical works combined with challenging, yet engaging projects."
College Senior,4,"I enjoy the city my school is located in. It is small but charming. Six flags the theme park is only ten minutes away from campus, which makes it fun to go with classmates. It is also near big city's like Hollywood, Los Angeles, and others. It gives students to go out of town but not too far."
College Senior,4,School spirit is highly encouraged and so is attending games to support team-mates and the school.
College Freshman,4,I don't personally live in campus housing but I hear its great
College Student,4,It's a great campus located in a beautiful part of California. I love it so much
College Sophomore,4,The local atmosphere is great. The locals really enjoy knowing students and treat them with kindness.
College Sophomore,4,"Off-campus dining is very diverse because we are so close to Los Angeles. If you have a car, you can drive into the city and get pretty much whatever kind of food you would like."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are very good on campus. The home games are well attended and the students enjoy cheering one another on.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing on campus is great. The rooms are on the smaller side, but you only have to share with one person. The bathrooms get cleaned more than once per week which is great because they always feel clean and not cluttered. The dorm atmosphere is also very good. The girls are all kind and it is fun getting to know one another and build relationships and friendships."
College Junior,4,The professors are great and really care about the students.  The class sizes are fairly small so it makes for good discussions and ability to actually get to know your professors which helps a lot.
College Senior,4,"Professors are fantastic, class sizes are usually small and personal. Curriculum is Bible-centered, Israel study abroad program (IBEX) is amazing."
College Senior,4,"It's California! There is no weather here. Fall semester is warm to hot until November, and even then it doesn't get real cold. Spring semester warms up pretty quick too. It rains maybe four times a year."
College Senior,4,Santa Clarita has a lot of places to eat and Greater LA has endless places to eat.
College Senior,4,"Usually no crime, personal safety is good, I feel pretty safe on campus."
College Senior,4,"It's pretty diverse; people from all over the country and around the world, from an ethnic and economical standpoint. The guy-girl ratio is about 1 to 1."
College Senior,4,"Santa Clarita is a good-sized city, there's an amusement park and a large mall within 10 minutes from the campus, Old Town Newhall is right down the street, and the locals that live right off the campus are used to the functions of the campus and even invite and house students in their homes for little or no rent sometimes."
College Sophomore,4,I've never had any complaints.  You are required to have your own computer but they have student computers in the library too.
College Sophomore,4,I've found a lot of nearby places that I like.
Alum,2,"The only good thing about this school was the small professor-to-student ratio. Being able to interact with the professors was nice, even if you disagreed with them. Otherwise, this was a closed-minded school with cultish characteristics, weak academic rigor, and an awful culture. Avoid at all costs unless you are part of their fundamentalist circle."
College Sophomore,2,I have overheard students involved in the athletic department that they either hate their members or got into a quarrel with them.
College Freshman,2,They don't really want you to live off campus... Have to check out of dorm when you leave
College Freshman,2,"HOT HOT HOT. 100's like ALL THE TIME. And It's literally in the desert, so I think it's ugly. But close to L.A. and like 40 min from beach...decent shopping and places to eat. (Everything is expensive though)"
College Freshman,2,"The local town, Newhall, isn't much. Students usually either stay on campus or go elsewhere for entertainment."
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of options in the cafeteria. it is a small school but also going off campus to any sort of food option necessitates the use of a car.
College Junior,2,"Since Masters is a conservative Christian school, there is no drinking or partying allowed. Nightlife is virtually non-existent."
College Junior,2,There is parking near the dorms but no parking is allowed on lower campus during the day and so you have to walk a long way all the time.
College Junior,2,There are some scholarships available but most money is reserved for athletes.
College Sophomore,2,The dining selections at the Master's College are less than stellar. The food resembles camp food and they don't have a whole lot of options. There really should be an actual mini restaurant on campus because a lot of students go hungry because the food is gross. The only upside of the Master's College is having flex dollars to get snacks in the lower cafeteria between classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I Wouldn't Come Here to Date – The dating scene at the Master's College is in a word, awkward. The people here are looking for spouses. Do not come here looking for a casual fling, to hook up, or to date exessively. It wont be pretty. However, if you are a good Christian girl looking for a young Christian boy to hold hands with, welcome. This is your spot."
College Student,2,"There are no fraternities or sororities on campus. The only Greek on campus is in the Greek classes.  This is a Bible school, so many people take Biblical Greek."
College Student,2,The financial aid process has not been without its difficulties. There are many documents required to receive scholarships. I am hoping to receive more than what they have initially awarded as I will not be able to afford what is expected of me to pay.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car with you, you are going to need a good pair of walking shoes AND start making friends who have cars because although walking is the easiest way to get around campus, everything off campus is easier to get to by car or bus. The bus station is a good walk away."
College Junior,2,"Food Options – There is one cafeteria, and also a shop area where you can pick up some ready-made meals, coffees, snacks. The options are fairly limited.  Food is OK.  Because of suddenly increased student body, which has somewhat outgrown food options, campus seems to be in a period of transition food-wise."
College Freshman,2,"We have different types of activities at night, but no hard partying. Definitely no alcohol or drugs."
College Sophomore,2,There is no Greek life on campus-Other than the kids who take Greek and Hebrew for Bible.  :)
College Freshman,2,"Private Colleges Are Going to Be Costly. Master's Does an Alright Job Balancing It Out. By God's provision, I have been able to attend here for a year! However, their financial aid is alright. They don't stack athletic scholarships with academic, which is a major setback since the student athlete must balance both, and therefore needs the money."
College Junior,2,"well, I really don't pay attention to that sort of thing, but it seems that there are a lot of white people there, but we also have an international program for students. So there are a lot of students who are not from the states."
College Sophomore,2,"Students' Cars Are the Best Option. It's best if you have your own car; if you don't, make friends of lots of people who do.  Bus lines and trains are far enough away from campus that it's usually not a great idea to walk."

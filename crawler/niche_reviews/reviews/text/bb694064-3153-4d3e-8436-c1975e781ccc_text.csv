Sophomore,5,Making the switch over was a little bit of a struggle but i think I got the hang of it after while. The way the professors made everyone feel comfortable with switching over was really amazing
Sophomore,5,I love the calming atmosphere that the campus possesses and I just simply love being around all the people.
Niche User,5,"Overall good, professors do a good job teaching, giving you feedback, emailing and generally responding to you."
Senior,5,I absolutely love this school! Starting every class with prayer and having the access to everything you need including the professors is a plus!
Senior,5,Online classes here are awesome. The response of the professors and other participants makes you feel as if your all right here together. Such a great school!
Freshman,5,"Montreat College is full of outstanding individuals who treat the campus as their own home. Not only does the campus make me feel safe, but my peers help me feel comfortable. Life long friends are made in college, but with my basketball scholarship, I was able to make lifelong friends AND family."
Freshman,5,"Very beautiful location, welcoming students, great staff. I love everything about the school and i would recommend to anyone."
Freshman,5,Great school surrounded by a loving community. The school and the people both do a great job at making sure everyone is included.
Junior,5,The teachers are great and push you to be the best you can be. Love that it is Christian based. They offer both online and traditional classes. The staff never belittle you or make you feel stupid. It is a great school.
Niche User,5,"I went to Montreat college on a baseball visit to see if it was for me. When i got there i was blown away by all the scenery and the beautiful mountains. When walking around campus everyone was very nice, the campus was stunning! They have a beautiful waterfall in the middle of campus. After being shown around by the coach i knew that this was the place for me."
Freshman,5,"I love the people on the campus. I feel that I am at home while I am there, I feel that I will be very connected with the people and professors. Since I will be playing basketball I am excited to be connected with my teammates."
Niche User,5,I loved how tight of a community it was and how you felt so close to nature. not to mention how nice the college counselors were.
Sophomore,5,Welcoming and friendly environment. Great sense of community. professors and faculty do their best to help you out and are quick to respond to you in most cases.
Senior,5,"I like that its small class size and everyone helps each other. The professor loves what he do!@i have learn alot because its Billy Graham school and what he believed in, i follow GOD so this gave me more direction to become the best student i could be. We are rewarded in my College and we strive for excellence seeing that its a college for working adults thats been out of school for a period of time. They help you get back on track!"
Freshman,5,"Montreat College is in a great location tucked away in the Western North Carolina Mountains. The staff, students, and community are welcoming and encouraging always challenging students to grow intellectually and in their faith."
Niche User,5,"I went up for a campus visit and tour with the Baseball staff. I was incredibly surprised and impressed at the beauty of the campus and that everyone in Black Mountain, NC. I did not get to see the dorms but on pictures they look decently sized. A cool fact about Montreat is that Billy Graham was married in the main Chapel."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful college campus, small environment that contributes to student success, small student to teacher ratio, feels like home, living Christian environment."
Sophomore,5,"I love how Montreat is a great private Christian higher education institution. I like how the classes are small with an average class size of 19 people which allows for great student teacher interactions. At Montreat the campus is small which means you can get to know alot of people on a personal level. Also being a collegiate golfer at Montreat I like how majority if the student body are athletes, how the professors are very understanding when it comes to missing classes for a sporting event. Although Montreat has some flaws with the way they handle financial aid and the condition of the dorm rooms overall the college is a great place to learn."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the recruiters. I had no trouble getting accepted, registered, and begin my journey."
College Sophomore,5,A lot of work but a lot of one on one time with Professors.
College Sophomore,5,Lots of diversity at Montreat College. I really like that aspect of this college.
College Sophomore,5,There are no issues at the Charlotte Campus that i know of.
College Sophomore,5,I love the Charlotte Campus professors and faculty. My cohort has become very close in a short time. I love the classes and topics and my professors are very smart and knowledgeable.
College Sophomore,5,"My Admissions Advisor, Mary Banks is a wonderful Christian woman. She is sweet, caring and I still meet and speak with her to this day. She made me feel welcomed and everyone at the Charlotte Campus has made me feel like I am a part of a family. I really like this campus and all of the faculty."
College Sophomore,5,I love my school! I can't imagine myself anywhere else! I am on the soccer team and love it. The school is in the mountains and the views are gorgeous. Also I cannot have picked  a better place to grow in my relationship with God.
College Sophomore,5,"The parties are great, but never party on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"As an athlete, coaches make the sports extremely enjoyable."
College Junior,5,"The Outdoor Education department is awesome. I have many opportunities to shadow,experience, and intern in the many different fields in outdoor education. "
College Junior,5,As far as I know there are a lot of options at the school. Being a very small student body helps to enhance the student professor relationships. 
College Junior,5,The Financial Aid office was very helpful Knowledgeable and friendly. I was able to get all the assistance required and they did a wonderful job at communicating with me. The school offers many scholarship programs and does a wonderful job of relying that to its students. 
College Sophomore,5,Very good parking. Plenty of room and very reasonably priced 
College Junior,5,"The off campus dinning has the best restaurants to eat at with great food.  The cost of the food is good, and some places gives out student discounts. "
College Junior,5,"This college accepts people for who they are.  They accept all ethnic backgrounds, economic backgrounds, political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientation."
College Junior,5,"The night life is in a safe area in Black Mountain, NC.  They have a few bars that are great places to check out."
College Junior,5,The school is adequately located in the center of uptown and easy to access when you get into town. There is no transportation provided by the school .We are all adults and should be able to find our own way to school. If you can't get to school here you are out of luck.
College Sophomore,5,With only about 500 traditional students I would say that a large percentage are of the minority.
College Senior,5,"Best Place for Personal Teaching and Proffesors. The campus is a tight knit community. when a fellow student died two years ago it hit everyone, when a professors son died this past semester there was a large turn out at the memorial service. Here you are not just a number in a seat. Every professor wants to see you succeed. They know you by name not just what seat you sit in. They are very available to talk when ever you need to or to get extra help on things."
College Sophomore,5,"Not too many students drive in the first place, but then you have to realize that on top of that the number of students attending is roughly 1600...Small campus so everything is nearby. I have never seen the parking lots full...Ever..."
College Sophomore,5,"Location, Location, Location! Montreat College is a small college located in the Appalachian Mountains. The atmosphere surrounding Montreat is quite peaceful, which makes studying very easy. Montreat is a great place to enjoy nature. Conveniently enough, Montreat is located about thirty minutes away from The Orange Peel (Asheville), which is amazing if you love music as much as I do!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Located in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, Montreat's traditional campus attracts high school and transfer students from more than 30 states and 10 different countries. Historic stone facilities surrounded by national forests set the stage for a safe, caring learning environment where students can grow spiritually and academically.
Through strong Christian foundations, Montreat College helps to build and strengthen character and values in our students...things they can apply to their lives, in their families, and in their careers. We offer a four year, residential campus experience to an active, engaged student body who are seeking to be more than the typical college students. Montreat students seek to become effective leaders, good stewards, and responsible, productive citizens who hold on to values, morals, and ethical reasoning."
College Senior,5,"I absolutely love the classroom size of Montreat College because it helps the professors to teach the students a great amount of knowledge, compared to other large classrooms at big universities."
College Junior,5,Montreat College does a wonderful job in creating a diverse atmosphere. There are many students from different countries and origins that attend Montreat. There are also many students who are both believers and non-believers. The believers all come from various affliations and therefore add to the diversity on campus. It is an excellent way to get to know other cultures and religions. There are both males and females who attend the college.
College Junior,5,All of the facilities on campus are extremely beautiful. The college does a wonderful job keeping the facilities up and completing repairs when needed. All of the facilities are places in which people actually want to spend time.
College Junior,5,"I am an off-campus student, so the transportation and housing issues don't apply to me.  Overall, I love Montreat.  I would definitely choose it again."
College Sophomore,5,"It Is a Privilege – At Montreat College, the Biblical Studies discipline is very professional not only with its professors, but with its strong expectations of faith and integrity. The internship/job opportunities are exponential."
College Senior,5,"Great Off Campus Food Options – The food just 20 minutes down the highway is the place to go. There are tons of options in downtown Asheville to eat food. There are chain restaurants like Olive Garden, Applebee's, Chiles, Red Lobster, and many other options. One great one is Papa's and Beer if you are interested in some great Mexican. However, if you want to stay within five minutes of campus than stop at Morning Glory for an award-winning breakfast or a just-as-delicious dinner or lunch. But the best spot for the college students to stop is the 24-hours Denny's just minutes from campus. It is a great place for a late night snack, study break, or a random hang out time with friends. The best part is the food is great and cheap!!"
College Sophomore,5,"Campus Life – What attracted me to my school the most will be its scenery. Our school is surrounded by beautiful mountains. Plus, we have a gorgeous lake on campus!"
College Senior,5,"Beautiful and Charming – Montreat in and of itself is a very small town, but it is beautifully situated right in the middle of the Seven Sisters, which is a range of mountains. There is so much to do within 1-2 hours of the school that it's impossible to list it all. Black Mountain, the closest town, has a good deal of shops and festivals, and Asheville - also nearby - could possibly be the cultural center of North Carolina."
College Junior,5,There is a great diversity on Montreat's campus. We have lots of exchange students and students who've been on mission trips or come from missionary families. The community is very accepting.
College Junior,5,"I love Montreat. The campus is beautiful, the people are great, it feels almost like a utopia. :):)"
College Senior,5,"We get the perfect blend of every season. Fall is gorgeous with the leaves changing colors. Winter is pretty with snow falling. It can be a little chilly sometimes, but for the most part it's not bitterly cold. Spring is also beautiful with the flowers blooming. Summer is not as hot, since we are in the mountains."
College Junior,5,"Mountains, Hippies, and Tourists – Montreat is located in the Appalachian Mountains, so there is much to be done in the outdoors.  There is skiing in winter and hiking year-round.  It is 20 minutes away from Asheville, which has a very eclectic population, with much to do, from nightclubs to drum circles.  It is a beautiful area, so there are many tourists, and so everyone is always accommodating of visitors and students."
College Sophomore,5,Off campus housing is a great thing. Living off campus is much cheaper than on and it feels like you have more freedom.
College Sophomore,5,The town of Montreat is a very close-knit family. It is a small town and everyone is very nice.
College Sophomore,5,"As a student athlete, I believe the athletic program does an excellent job. Our athletic facilities are a bit outdated, but they get the job done. Fan support and team performances are excellent."
College Junior,5,"One of the favorite commodities for student life is Denny's, in Black Mountain. What is wonderful about it is that it is fantastic for those students who want to go hang out somewhere late at night and grab a bite to eat, as it is open 24/7. The prices are good and affordable (they even have $2 menus for those who do not want to spend a lot) and also give 10% discounts to Montreat students."
College Junior,5,"It Varies Quite a Bit – Obviously during the winter we get plenty of snow. During the fall and spring it either rains or is sunny out. Personally, I love the weather up there."
College Junior,5,"Beautiful from Head to Toe – Montreat is a beautiful community and the nature makes it possible to go on long walks and just relax, as well as good study spots for those who like to study outside. Montreat also has an outdoor education program that is one of the top in the country."
College Freshman,5,"Lots of Places. Black mountain has some places to eat, everyone goes to dennys. Lots of places to eat in Asheville!"
College Student,5,"Amazing people that are a part of the Monteat family. The school, offices, teachers, classes, and sporting events all come together to make the college experience special"
Freshman,4,"I absolutely LOVE the campus and the community that the college and the community around the college brings. It is the perfect small town vibe with easy access to Asheville. The teachers are very personal and are here to help their students and watch them succeed. It’s small so funding is slim so some things need a little updating, but overall great."
Senior,4,I would Like there to be more of a program set up for commuters. Like parking experiences and when they require students to attend events.
Freshman,4,"This college has Intentional people and educators, excellent learning environment and athletic programs.  This Christian college is very rigorous and of course, Christ-oriented but a great safe and friendly place.  The diversity here is functional,  I have met all different types of people. The education system here is excellent, as well as spiritual formation and professional growth.  The athletic programs are great here as well as student life. The college as stringent rules for students, so there is not much partying here which results and a pleasant calming environment. However the college is very small, but a great place to be at for an education."
Junior,4,Professors are helpful and desire your success. Staff members strive to help make the most your college experience. Small class  size allow for closer relationships between peers as well as students and professors.
Junior,4,Montreat College provides a well-rounded education. Here you will receive an education that will prepare you to accomplish your career goals as well as give you a gospel centered worldview. Montreat is beginning to grow again. I look forward to seeing it as it continues to successfully educate people to change the world for good.
College Sophomore,4,I very much enjoy attending Montreat. It is worth the hour and a half drive to class in the evenings. Montreat's college undergrad program fits perfect for a full time working parent who also wants an education. I would recommend Montreat to anyone who wants to pursue furthering their education.
College Sophomore,4,Security at the front desk and the doors lock so non students cannot enter building.
College Sophomore,4,It's made going to graduate school achievable!
College Freshman,4,"I'd never say Montreat is the best; it has its flaws like every school does, but I will admit it's amazing. We're in a mountain surrounded by nothing but nature, classmates, and God. It's a place of serenity, a place of fellowship, and a school all in one. The teachers are willing to go out of their way to help you and with the smaller classes it makes that a little bit easier. Montreat is a beautiful Christian college that is focused on making you into the best person you can be professionally and spiritually. I wouldn't pick another school ever with the fact I'll be a little over two hours away from home because im receiving a great education, meeting new people, and playing college lacrosse."
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus. The dorms stay clean and kept. The best part of living on campus is the social aspect of it. I love being just a few doors down from my friends. The worse part is the cost to live in the dorms.
College Junior,4,nice options for dining on and off campus
College Junior,4,haven't seen any problems related to racial or ethnic issues
College Junior,4,campus security are always present
College Junior,4,Everyone is just like any typical private college.
College Junior,4,"This school is a very small and quiet school with a wonderful group of students and faculty. The personal relationships that the school promotes is outstanding. It has been great to go to a school that is not afraid to include Christianity and religion into the Educative experience. I am very pleased with the education that I have received this far, and will continue to attend this school until I complete my degree or until I have reached the level of education i am seeking. "
College Junior,4,Montreat is a private Christian college but not everyone there is Christian. The school has a lot of international students as well as student from all over the US. Most of the students are accepting of others I am not really aware of the LGBT community but I am sure it is present. The cultural diversity is pretty obvious. There is a lot of different ethnicity and race diversity within the student body.  
College Junior,4,If you come to class early or live on campus finding a place to park is not too difficult. There are peak times when parking is a little hard to find but overall the parking is not bad and the location to classes is great.  
College Junior,4,The town of Black Mountain is very small but quite nice. It has two nice coffee shops several restaurants and some quaint little shops to visit. The town is located in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains and provides the best views and scenery in the East. All of the local businesses appreciate the students support of the community and are very friendly and outgoing.   
College Junior,4,For having such a small student body (450) the sports at this school play an important role at Montreat College. Almost 3/4 of students enrolled in the traditional program are involved in sports. 
College Junior,4,"So far it has been beautiful. Not too cold, and being in the mountains it doesn't get too hot. "
College Sophomore,4,Lots of computers available in the labs but wifi is somewhat undependable 
College Sophomore,4,Most everyone is Christian but not everyone. There are some gay couples and some very liberal people but overall it is a conservative college.
College Sophomore,4,It is strict enough to where campus life is enjoyable and safe but no so strict that people feel like the college is their mom.
College Junior,4,Athletic and academic scholarships are available as well as the Keystone scholarship
College Junior,4,"We have computers on campus; however, sometimes we do not have enough computers in the labs for all students in a class to use."
College Junior,4,Im at the Charlotte Campus an Charlotte has dinning to meet any budget or taste...
College Sophomore,4,"Friendly. Great normal sports, religion and great freiends."
College Junior,4,"Many times we get terrible snow storms, therefore it is difficult to have class. However, the campus very carefully considers the safety of the students by cancelling class when conditions are dangerous. However, the weather is typically beautiful at Montreat."
College Junior,4,"Printers Work....Sometimes – Wireless works great in most common areas of campus.  Labs in the library and Belk Center make it easy to access computers without a laptop. Only problem is, sometimes you have to try all three labs before you can get something to print, and even then you may end up out of luck."
College Sophomore,4,A tip for getting financial aid is simply to look everywhere for it.
College Sophomore,4,Caution a Must – The school's safety and health availability is excellent.
College Sophomore,4,Financial aid is pretty easy to get at Montreat College. I have never had any problems working with Financial Aid!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Definitely Needs Improvements – Just as we pay a lot for our meal plans, we pay a lot for our dorm rooms. Between mold growing in the room and shower, small living spaces, and extremely limited access to cooking/food options within the dorm, it is less than ideal. However, it is very nice that we have our own bathrooms (as in, we don't have communal hall showers like most dorms do) and it is also nice to be so close to the rest of campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Not the Best School Cafe I've Ever Eaten in, but Overall, It's Not Bad. As on-campus students, we pay a large amount towards our meal plans. As off-campus students, we pay a large amount for a partial meal plan or to just buy one meal at a time. Because of this, I believe that we should get a quality meal that is equal to what we are paying for. While the Montreat cafeteria sometimes does a fairly good job at this, I believe they could make some major improvements in food quality, variety, and most importantly, healthiness."
College Senior,4,In the Doors – I feel safe on campus because the tension levels are kept pretty low in the doors. Security is very visible but fairly easy to avoid.
College Sophomore,4,"Need a Car on Campus? I must say, attending Montreat College I've realized very quickly that you will not need a car on campus at all. All of the facilities on campus are within five minutes of walking distance. Our campus is very safe, so you wouldn't have to worry about if you should be concerned when walking alone."
College Senior,4,"A Christian College, but Could Be a LOT Worse. Some complain about Montreat's strictness, but it's seriously NOTHING compared to almost any other Christian school. They crack down hard on students who drink on-campus, especially athletes. You are only allowed in the dorm of the opposite sex during certain hours, and underclassmen have to have a specific (but low) number of convocation credits (this doesn't have to be chapel)."
College Junior,4,"Good Athletic School – I don't know much about the athletic program because I am not involved in it. But from what I hear and see, it seems to be a good athletic program, lots of people are accepted, and they are all hardworking. They are held to high standards in their schooling, and the school is very supportive of them."
Recent Alumnus,4,Elementary Education Major – Being an elementary education major you have your own place to take your classes and the professors are very willing to help you.  Since there are not tons of el. ed. majors they really care about each one.  The curriculum and facilities are great also.
College Senior,4,"There are pros and cons to every situation. Off-campus housing is another thing that has its good and bad qualities. Living off-campus makes the price of school go down tremendously, because living on campus is pretty pricey. However, the rumor is once you go off campus, you are never seen again. I enjoy my social life and love being able to see everybody around campus. Being off-campus feels like it secludes yourself from the people you go to school with."
College Senior,4,The school policy is strict but you are able to have fun. You just must follow the rules.
College Senior,4,We have several diverse students on campus. Everybody has treated me with repect and seems to really care. All the teachers help out with all students no mattter what.
Recent Alumnus,4,"On Campus Food – The food is over all very good.  There are always things that people will dislike or complain about, but on the whole, for the size of Montreat, the food is really good.  There are plenty of options in the cafeteria, and you can always make a sandwich or have cereal if nothing else appeals to you.  The grill also has pretty good hours, but could be open a little later."
College Senior,4,"There aren't a lot of drugs, but there are still some. Like I said earlier, that's with any place that you go to."
College Senior,4,"Off Campus Food – It's relatively close, just a five minute drive. Taco Bell, McDonald's, Wendy's, Denny's, and a few Mexican restaurants. It's all pretty cheap for a student, unless you are really hungry."
College Senior,4,The professors here are great and give you many opportunities to improve your connections in order to get a job-- they are interested in you succeeding.
College Junior,4,It Is Good the Faculty Know Their Stuff – There is quite a high workload but it is all relevant to stuff you will have to do after college. There are good internship opportunities.
College Junior,4,"Montreat College has a beautiful campus! They have a very secure and safe location and all stone built sparkling buildings built in the 1930's (they sparkle due to the mica mineral present). For a fond outdoors person it is ideal! There are plenty of great hikes all walking distance away. 

Montreat also has a great community between students, faculty, staff and non-student residents! This is means for a great social network that helps give you a better advantage in the 'real world'

AND for being a small school, Montreat takes pride in their many available studies and educational opportunities for students! The college's motto is 'Christ centered, Student Focused, and Service Driven'- and that is exactly what the strive for.  

It's not a perfect place, but it certainly makes a perfectly pleasant home."
Recent Alumnus,4,I Have No Idea – I was not a recluse but it was very diverse and every one had there voice. Everyone was different and still got along. Montreat is great about that. We are so diverse but still get to know other people and reach out to others. I think one of the reasons the majority of people stay is because they enjoy the people and how we connect so well at Montreat.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It Is Safe. It is not a big school and it is not always safe but it is not perfect, too. There has been incidents and ones that could have been prevented. But overall I feel safe in the buildings and on the roads that are part of our campus."
College Junior,4,"Fast Food/Denny's – Since Black Mountain is a tourist town, there are several casual-nice restaurants.  These are generally a little pricey for poor college students, but there is also a McDonald's, a Wendy's, a Taco Bell and a Denny's just a couple of minutes from the campus.  These are nice, cheap options that are close enough that students with cars can easily access."
College Junior,4,"The buiding facilities at Montreat are pretty good.  The cafeteria, Belk Student Center, the Chapel of the Prodigal, the library and Morgan Science Building are okay, but the dorms and McLeod need work.  While most of the buildings are fine, the dorms do have some leakage issues and, in some room, mold, as well as a few other issues.  Again, it's mostly fine, but since we have to LIVE in the dorms, it'd be nice if at least those were fixed up."
College Sophomore,4,"Montreat is a fantastic place that is supportive and friendly. If you like big campus atmosphere with tons of nightlife, though, Montreat is not for you. We're small and many students go home for the weekend."
College Senior,4,"Secret Parties – Montreat does not allow alcohol or drugs on the campus.  Anyone with either or under the influence, even if above age for alcohol, can be on probation or even expelled from school.  That being said, there are some students that live off campus who throw parties where there is alcohol and sometimes drugs, usually marijuana."
College Sophomore,4,"The computers at the school are very helpful. Computer labs are placed at convenient spots around campus. However, the printers aren't always helpful when they aren't working. I do think there is a need for wireless in the dorm rooms."
College Senior,4,Music Business – The Music Business Program at Montreat is unique in that students are required to take both music and business classes. Music Business Seminar classes bridge the two concentrations and give students real life experiences in the Music Industry.  Every year they are require to run some event or concert which puts the newly-acquired skills to the test.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One of the best things about Montreat's academics is that, along with providing a good balance of liberal arts classes, there is flexibility. My experience has been that the professors will work with you to help you be able to pursue studies in areas where you are interested. The professors are also very  adept at seeing strengths and weaknesses of their students and challenging them to excel."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Comparably Good – The dorms are fairly nice, especially the upperclassmen dorm. Rooms are decent-sized, and each has its own bathroom which I appreciated. Also, for off-campus living, there are tons of beautiful mountain cabins near campus that are rented out to students very cheaply - just grab a couple roommates and you're looking at no more than $200 a month, and still within walking-distance of classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Must Be Community-Oriented and Self-Motivated – As it is definitely a small school experience, I feel the best way to get a quality and even superior education at Montreat is to be self-motivated, i.e taking advantage of the fact that the professors are very accessible and the class sizes are small. Also crucial to enjoying a place like Montreat is the ability to connect with a small community without feeling suffocated. In such a small student body there is greater accountability (for example, if you skip a class, you will probably run into your professor at some point in the day and be asked with great concern if you are doing alright.) If one thrives in situations of high accountability and seeks opportunities to be self-motivated and fill leadership roles, Montreat is the place where you will definitely be able to make a difference and be surrounded by a loving and supportive community."
College Junior,4,"Montreat offers great financial aid. I only pay a little bit myself, and haven't had to take out too heavy of a loan. If it were not for Montreat's financial aid, I don't think that I would be there."
Niche User,2,"Professors are okay, calm peaceful safe college. However, Montreat college does not celebrate ethnic diversity. Most of the people around are conservative white Christians who will not take anyone seriously unless you are like them.  Not inclusive for people who are different. People tend to hide their true selves and ideas to fit into the Christian ideal at Montreat.The school is very cliquey, you are either an athlete, Bible major, conservative, Outdoor education camp geek ,or from Florida. No interesting clubs or student life as well as a very small campus and poor dorm conditions, not worth the pay."
Freshman,2,"Montreat College has a beautiful campus with above average dorms, food, and inspiring chapel messages. However with a high and imbalanced athlete ratio on campus, academics were not seen as the top priority. There is a very high party scene, and I often felt unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process was definitely a headache. Do I have any tips for getting financial aid at my school? My tip would be to be prepared for a heartache and your entire day sitting in an office.
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria food is absolutely repulsive. There is no such thing as a ""nutritious"" meal at Montreat College."
College Sophomore,2,Expensive and hard to find.
College Junior,2,I am not aware of any campus shuttle. The town of Black Mountain runs a shuttle into Montreat but I have never seen it on campus. Outside of Montreat there is public transportation that runs into Asheville which is nice if you have the time to take it. 
College Sophomore,2,Depends on what circle you are in. Who do you want to be?
College Freshman,2,"Bad experience – From what I can tell, there aren't many drug incidents on campus.  But I had a bit of a run in with someone who has a drug problem and the school didn't handle the situation very well.  I was pretty much on my own.  I guess the take away message is to be careful.  Just because it's a Christian school doesn't mean everyone acts like a Christian."
College Junior,2,"There is a stunning lack of workout equiptment offered to non-athletes. We have one gym and the athlete's are always in there, leaving those of us who would like to get in shape no where to work out."
College Junior,2,"Montreat College is one of my favorite places on earth, and I love that I attend there, but I really struggle with my major because there is only one Creative Writing professor and only one creative writing class offered per semester. I do not feel like it is the best it could be at this time."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Athletics offered at Montreat College: 6 for men (baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, and track and field) and 7 for women (basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, soft ball, track and field, and volleyball)."
College Sophomore,2,"Since Montreat College is located on a beautiful mountain, it would be an excellent choice to have a car if you plan on being involved in a lot of activity off campus."
College Junior,2,"Poor, Must Be Prearranged – Not much help from the school with transportation.  No real buses or anything."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everybody Knows You – The campus life was good. I enjoyed having friends to listen to me and also me returning the favor whenever someone needed me. The dorms themselves were horrible. They had mold along the walls and the showers. The ventilation was not there and nothing was ever completely dry. The walls were very thin too. So the dorms were horrible. The social environment was great and the cost outrageous and it was nice walk to and from classes for the Anderson dorm.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Students – I'm not a Greek student, but when I come across one they are nice and friendly."
College Senior,2,"The Dorms Need Updating!!! The dorms at Montreat are in desperate need of help. I can't personally speak of the male dorms, but I've lived in both female dorms (Anderson and McGregor) and was not impressed. The windows are drafty (which makes the windy mountain winters very unpleasant), the plumbing system needs to be either fixed properly or replaced, and there's a mold problem. We do have brand new flat-screen televisions in the lobbies - I would have preferred that money going to fixing my room, but being able to watch movies in HD totally makes up for freezing in the winter.

I think the student center (Belk) is adequate, although having functioning computers in the labs would be nice. The library is great, especially considering its size. The classrooms are decent, although it really depends on what building you're in - they could all use new (or at least working) technology."
College Junior,2,Not Much – The best option is to catch a ride with a friend if you don't have a car.
Recent Alumnus,2,"My experience at Montreat has been good due to my own doing. The school does offer friendly staff and helpful people but it is almost impossible to be professional. Athletic facilities are left unattended, and a perfect example of that is the constant decay of the school's soccer field. The dean of students, and some of the higher up faculty, spend too much time figuring out who drank a beer when rather than tackle important issues that plague the college on a daily basis, such as the use of computers in Belk, which is equipped with six computers but at one time only one worked. Montreat could be so much more than it is but it is impossible to do with the close-minded religious and political approach the school has."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Enough Preparation – The college is staffed with a few talented professors, but I think the school does not do an adequate job to prepare students for a life outside of its campus."
College Junior,2,"It Leaves Much to Be Desired – The computers are old, some of them don't work, they run outdated systems, and the keys on the keyboards stick. They're also abominably slow. The one good thing is that there is more than one computer lab, and there's often multiple computers free. However, if you want to have a computer that you're sure you can rely on, bring your own.
The internet is slow, often doesn't work, and there is no wireless in the dorms. There is also a limit to bandwidth.
The printers usually do work, but there is a limit to the number of pages you can print. 
It's really handy if you need to print something out and don't have time to run back to your room. The only drawback is waiting for the school computer to log you on."
Sophomore,1,Montreat is way to expensive for the what you get out of the school. Over 90% of the school are student athletes which creates clicks within the school. Almost everyone that attends Montreat is only here because they had no other chose. The residence halls are pathetic as I have gone all year with no hot water. The rooms are also very small. Earlier this year mold had to be cleaned for on many rooms. The food is ok at best. With only one dinning hall on campus their are not many options. The school also has some irritating rules in place such as no visitation on Wednesday. The athletic programs do quit well but their is not much school spirt here at all. Also unless you plan on going to Asheville their is nothing to do in Black Mountain.
College Sophomore,1,We dont have housing at the Charlotte Campus
College Sophomore,1,I dont think we have a greek program
College Sophomore,1,This school is the definition of strict.
College Senior,1,You are there for education. And education only. Spend your time wisely. Don't do anything to jeopardize your education
College Freshman,1,"Howerton rooms are small and have mold. Davis rooms are bigger and cleaner, but the residents are louder."
College Freshman,1,"Campus police are a joke. Homeless man on campus walked into the women's dorm twice. Much theft all semester and the campus police still haven't solved the case, just charged someone after their disgruntled roommate made up lies. No evidence? No problem. School disciplinary hearings are a joke too!"
College Junior,1,We do not have athletics at this locations. I wish we did because i would love to be in a caviler uniform for basketball or another sport.
College Freshman,1,"Very Hit or Miss.... mostly miss – I understand that cafeteria food is cafeteria food but I wouldn't feed some of this food to my dog.  Sometimes they have ok food but half of it isn't worth eating.  General rule of thumb- if you can't ID it, don't eat it. The Huck generally has good food but the choices are limited."

College Senior,1,"No Greeks Allowed – There are no sororities or fraternities at Montreat College. There is no Greek life. Instead, there are just sports and different groups of people there."
College Senior,1,Not in CA Anymore – It ranges from snowing to low 80s within the same week. It is very scattered and unpredictable.
College Junior,1,"There Are Too Many Inappropriate Rules – There are too many strict rules, such as terrible visiting hours. You can only hang out in your room with someone from 6-11 p.m. and not at all on Wednesdays. We are treated like little kids."
College Senior,1,"You Can Be Different, as Long as You're the Same as Everybody Else – Let me start out with the positives. I'd say that Montreat is, ethnically, very welcoming, even though the majority of the student population is white. 

Montreat pretty much fails, however, when it comes to religion and politics. Now, Montreat is a Christian school, so if you're non-Christian obviously it's going to be a little difficult. But I do consider myself a Christian and I've still had a hard time, because I'm not the right ""brand"" of Christianity, if that makes sense. And if you fall on the left of the political spectrum, don't expect your ideas to be taken seriously - not by the majority of the students anyways. Most of the professors are very open-minded though. 

As for sexual orientation - let's just say that if you're not straight, keep it to yourself. If you don't, you'll either be ridiculed, or descended upon by a bunch of people who want to ""heal"" you. And even if you are straight, don't practice it too much - the ""slut shaming"" here is ridiculous. I can testify to this, and the rumor mill is brutal."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Security a Joke – The campus police is a joke. The college spent money to buy a new Jeep that was not needed for security to do its job. Cleaning crews take days or weeks to make stairs safe during the winter, and the schools often fails to make sane judgment calls on when the roads are icy."
College Senior,1,"Like any college there is an even balance of different views. Unlike most colleges this is a Christian school. If you come from a secular background I fully advise you to turn away, because what awaits you is nonstop debate and judgment from a small portion of the college's population. The population is further split because of the higher value put on athletics at the college. Not the best place in the world to meet women or men unless you are into the whole Christian dating thing. Congratulations on your incoming marriage three weeks after you start dating."
College Junior,1,"Unless you're willing to get way off campus, there's not a whole lot going on within a ten-mile radius.  Make your own fun, it's more worth it."
College Senior,1,"The school is not cheap and the financial aid packages are fairly good, but it takes the financial aid months to process the award packages for returning students."
College Freshman,1,If you like predictability and the same ole same ole you'll like it here. I've never been to a more prejudice place in my life. So if you like being immature you'll love this place. You don't get treated like an adult you get treated like a minor.
College Freshman,1,"Not Bad. Majority is white but there are minorities which is good. There are only like 500 students (if that) so you pretty much know everyone on campus. If you're not a Calvinist religion people won't like you as much. There isn't any political diversity. If you're liberal then you will deff. hate it cause they pride themselves in a traditional non-progressive highly conservative atmosphere and they see change as really scary for some reason. Also they hate jews for some reason, not even kidding."

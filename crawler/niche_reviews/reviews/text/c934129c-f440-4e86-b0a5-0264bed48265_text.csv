Alum,5,"I enjoyed my summer online class. The simple layout of the programs made it easy to submit my work, take quizzes, and watch videos that the teacher posted. The teacher was available to answer any questions a student may have."
Alum,5,I enjoyed my time at Cairn! The professors are caring and helpful. It’s a fairly small campus so it is easy to make friends. It’s a great college to help students learn more about the Bible and become closer to God.
Sophomore,5,"Cairn University is a warm, welcome, and Christ-centered educational institution! I thoroughly enjoyed the faculty and staff who made it their number one priority to see us as real people and not just names on a roster."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19, we had to make a quick transition to online learning. Cairn handled this transition excellently! I feel that the quality of my education remained the same given the challenging circumstances."
Freshman,5,"The environment is incredibly friendly, the professors are genuine and always willing to to go our of their way to assist you in whatever you need. There are plenty of things to do around campus. The small environment makes it really easy to make genuine friends- a much better environment than high school"
Alum,5,I had a wonderful experience at Cairn.  Their business program is excellent.  Dean Curry is a great leader.  The online MBA was great for a working professional.
Freshman,5,I really loved the atmosphere of fellowship. Everyone is so kind and loving to one another and it makes it feel like home away from home. When you see the campus it is small but very nice. I am on the soccer team and they have really helped me feel at home and welcomed. Easy to make friends and the academics are great as well. They keep God in their lessons and teaching and yet keep it college levels learning. It’s hard work but you will learn a lot. The school is all about its students which is really awesome
Junior,5,"From the moment I stepped foot on this campus, I fell in love with the genuine, caring atmosphere of the faculty and staff, and every professor I have had the pleasure of having in class has been nothing but gracious, incredibly understanding, and kind. There is a unique element to this small Christian university, an element of community and togetherness that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a beautiful campus, situated right outside of Philadelphia. The opportunities I have been given here and the flexibility I have been given in pursuing my major is so appreciated and allows me to almost completely personalize my program. I have never once regret choosing this university, and I am deeply grateful for how dedicated it remains to Scripture and seeking God in every area of life."
Junior,5,Cairn University is a small college in Langhorne Pennsylvania that strives to focus on assisting each and every student in their journey to graduation. It has a friendly atmosphere where everyone seems to be included. They have great programs in which all the professors are invested in their students in order to help them achieve their goals.
Niche User,5,"At Cairn University I felt like I fit in completely. It had such a great atmosphere and I knew automatically that I was going to like it. If you are interested in playing a sport, I recommend reaching out. All the coaches there are so caring and take good care of you and try their hardest to make you feel welcomed with the team. The classes are super small and they feel like it is just you and the teacher in the room. That was one of the biggest deciding point was seeing the class sizes, being so small."
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere of Cairn University, everyone is so friendly and loving! It is the best University/College I have ever been to!!"
Alum,5,"Cairn University professors are intentional, the staff are helpful and kind. The President has strong vision for future and is engaging with students. Proud to call Cairn my Alma mater and to continue to give toward the unique and important mission of this University."
Freshman,5,The staff are so willing to help. The location is beautiful. The focus is in the right place. You are welcomed into a community that is like family. Students really seek to walk a different path.
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Cairn is committed to you from the time you submit your application.  They are very sincere, helpful caring people who want to assist you in getting the degree you want while glorifying God in the process."
Freshman,5,"What I love about Cairn University is that I feel at home here! The professors, Deans, President really do care about the students and their lives."
Freshman,5,"Cairn University is a close knit community which empowers individuals to serve Christ where ever they serve in the professional world. Professors know the students, and are able to help them accomplish their dreams. This school grounded in truth and equips it's students well."
Alum,5,"I love Cairn's Mission and the way that it truly strives to carry out that mission in different areas. Faculty and Staff were continuously striving to integrate Faith into my classes, events, etc. It was such a beautiful experience for me to finally have fellowship with so many of my classmates."
Alum,5,"I appreciated how much biblical truth was integrated in my non-Bible classes. The teachers not only care about the academic well-being of their students, but the spiritual well-being. There is nothing in particular that I would want changed about Cairn!"
Freshman,5,"Cairn University is a fantastic school! If you're looking for a strong Christian University, Cairn is a good place to start. I cannot wait to see how far the school brings me. The academics are amazing and all the professors do as much as they can to personalize your college experience to you!"
Senior,5,"Cairn is a beautiful private Christian University where the professors care about your natural and spiritual growth..
 I'm so privileged to be going to this U
Universiry"
Graduate Student,5,"Cairn university is an excellent place to learn. Going to cairn is one of the best decisions have ever made. The faculty and professors are kind and are ready to assist students to achieve their academic goal. Moreover, there is no discrimination at Cairn, instead there is a feeling of acceptance."
Alum,5,"Phenomenal experience in the school of business and leadership. Professors were knowledgeable, with many global and corporate accomplishments. One in particular, having run a large division of Campbell's soup.  I was well prepared for a career in business and leadership."
Freshman,5,"I love Cairn University it is an amazing atmosphere, a most beautiful campus, and one of the safest in the country as well. The classes are amazing the professors are willing to have one on one conversations with you and also are willing to pray for you. A couple changes for Cairn I would like to see is that we have a more diverse student body and that we have more classes on prayer."
College Sophomore,5,"Cairn University has been a tremendous blessing in my life. From the Christ-centered values and education to the personable and hardworking professors, there is little that I would change about this school. It is small and community-focused. While there may not be a TON of variety in events, clubs, and studies, the students and faculty work hard at making Cairn a loving and warm community."
College Freshman,5,"My classes have been easy to understand, I love my professors for how they teach and how they care about their students. Class sizes are small and allow the professors to know each of their students personally."
College Freshman,5,"I am in Cairn's first year Israel and Archaeology program and absolutely love it. I have never learned so much about the Bible and its history, alongside learning about its parent religion and people - Judaism and the Jewish people. The professors are passionate about student success and what they teach, and the ones I have had are also caring about their students' personal struggles. I haven't had any troubles at all and have loved every minute so far."
College Sophomore,5,The professors help you reach your full potential
College Freshman,5,"Cairn University is one of the best decision I have ever made. The faculty and staff are genuinely interested and involved in the students' lives, desiring that they succeed and honor the Lord in every way. The student body is a family, encouraging one another and holding each other accountable. The classes are designed for interaction and growth, looking at every topic through the lens of the Bible. This does not make the education biased, because the professors are intentional about teaching accurately, but ensuring that there is a connection or comparison to the Christian worldview."
College Freshman,5,"Cairn has a very welcoming environment, and the curriculum for the program I am in offers much to gain for students."
College Sophomore,5,"Internship prospects are high, Cairn prepares us for our future careers on a strong biblical foundation."
College Sophomore,5,Small classes and professors who are sweet
College Freshman,5,It's a Christian school. We do not have a lot of Health and Safety issues.
College Freshman,5,The school administration is very friendly and helpful
College Sophomore,5,There is everything you would ever want when it comes to food.
College Sophomore,5,There are absolutely zero parties on campus. It is good for this school.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is great! There are never strangers on campus.
College Junior,5,The Business program is awesome. Most of the professors are experienced professionals who offer real life examples to teach students about approaching different issues.
College Senior,5,"Haven't heard of anything remotely bad happening in the last 5 years. Campus is very, very safe."
College Senior,5,"Policy says that Cairn students will not use alcohol or tobacco while the semester is in session. It also says that we are a drug-free campus. I think we are 0 tolerance. If you do not want to see drugs and alcohol, come to Cairn!"
College Junior,5,"We have campus security around campus on foot and driving. There a numerous phone available to emergencies and they hand out their number to all students, staff, etc. Our nurse is extremely kind and is always willing to help."
College Junior,5,"There is 0 tolerance for drugs, drinking, or sex."
College Sophomore,5,"Cairn University thrives on its close knit community and the opportunity to learn from your peers and professors. The idea to serve others and follow the example of Christ is seen amongst students and faculty. The professors are very caring and are available to help with more than just class based curriculum. Most courses offered at Cairn are rigorous and challenge the students to put in their best effort, and it pays off as the student's knowledge grows in all areas of life."
College Sophomore,5,"There is no crime on campus. If someone ever experiences any trouble, they can call the campus security and they will be there as soon as possible. My car battery died so I called the campus security. They showed up within 5 minutes and jumped my car for me with a portable battery. They were very helpful and friendly!"
College Sophomore,5,"There is tons of options near school. If feeling like really going out, the campus is only 15-20 minutes outside of Philadelphia. There is a grocery store right around the corner from school, and fast food restaurants less than a mile away. There is a little Chinese food restaurant where Cairn students receive special discounts, and 3 Chick Fil-A's in the local area which provide discounts to Cairn students."
College Student,5,"Very strict, no nonsense allowed. Girls and boys are kept seperate"
College Sophomore,5,"The Off-Campus dining is great. There are many restaurants that is very convenient for students such as WaWa, McDonalds, Chick Fil A, etc. Our student discounts are very convenient as well."
College Senior,5,There are many people from different places around the world. The topics in the school are also very diverse.
College Senior,5,I have received quite a few problems and financial aid was always able to help me find the answer to my problem.
College Senior,5,"I love my program.  I am an education major, and I chose to come to Cairn University (formerly Philadelphia Biblical University) because I wanted to be a part of their education major.  I love how the professors are Biblically minded and are interdisciplinary, so the Bible and other subjects are woven into all of my teaching methods classes.  I have learned how to view my students in a way that will respect them while maintaining a teacher's authority, and I'm excited to have my own classroom soon!"
College Senior,5,"Because our campus is a dry campus, that means that often the pranks that do happen are harmless pranks where students are just out to have a little fun.  Security is on patrol throughout the night, so I feel very safe on campus.  We do have an open campus, so neighbors can come on the campus to walk their dogs, etc.  Security does a great job of patrolling, however, and the local police drive onto campus every so often as well."
College Junior,5,"I Love My School! PBU is a great school. They really foster a deep sense of community and love for each other, our studies, and the Word of God. They build integrity in their students as well as professional competence. If i had it all to do over again I would most definitely choose PBU all over again - they're a great school and I believe in their vision!"
College Junior,5,"Don't Want to Be Anywhere Else! This place has become more of a home to me than my hometown over the past two years. I'm so glad that God led me here! It reminds me of a safe haven in the midst of the world's chaos.
Academics and extracurriculars are important - there is a lot more variety than you would expect in such a small university.
The train station is within easy walking distance and people travel into Philly all the time.
It can be a tight-knit community, but there is also diversity."
College Junior,5,Minimal Noticeable Use of Drugs on Campus – The drug and alcohol scene at Philadelphia Biblical University is less than noticeable because nobody I know partakes nor do I know of anyone who does.  Because it is against our school policy it is very underground.
College Sophomore,5,No Drugs or Alcohol – PBU is very strict on drinking alcoholic beverages and drugs. Smoking cigarettes is not even seen on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Penndel Apartment Shuttle – The best form of transportation is the shuttle which comes every 15 minutes. The shuttle practically drops you off at your class. All of your classes are in the same building and the shuttle takes you right there. It doesn't get any better than that.
College Sophomore,5,"Professors Are Serious and Nice. Professors are all about getting us to understand the curriculum at an awesome pace. Not to fast and not to slow. Challenging and not overwelming. This is why I love my school. 

The registration process was made easy by all the friendly departments. Everyone constantly gave 110% to answer questions and do their job to complete the registration process from their end. Also this is a school where you are surrounded by fellow students that mean business. Everyone studies. Everyone completes their homework. You are not alone if you want a campus that reaches for gold. For the better of thier grades and campus community."
College Sophomore,5,"Fast Food, Italian, and Indian Spots – The food prices are reasonable. Plenty of fast food choices for those addicted to cost and quick service. The pizza places are great and deliver ordered food ultra fast."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I did not have any issues with financial Aid.  As a matter of fact when I first applied PBU financial aid office put an application in for financial needs scholarship and I had more than I needed for tution, books and supplies."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Drug Scene – You will not see any drug activity on or around PBU campus.  I will not say that there are not any students who smoke or use drugs, because we do live in the world.  But, I have not had any such experiences in my 3-years at PBU,"
College Sophomore,5,"The cost for parking is very low, $18, I think (don't quote me on that).  The rules are carefully spelled out and strictly enforced, so if you get a ticket or a fine, you have no one to blame but yourself.  They're no more expensive than a fine anywhere else, I suppose.  Since you are encouraged to be part of a local church, a car comes in real handy.  No one wants to be the person who has to mooch rides off of their friends, and if you want to go somewhere, it's nice to have a car.  There is plenty of parking, all of it right near the dorms and main buildings of campus, so you hardly ever have to worry about not having a parking space right where you need it."
Senior,4,I've loved it so far. The staff and faculty do a great job of making the experience a great one. They do an amazing job creating opportunities for community.
Freshman,4,"Liked the classes, chapel, professors. Good spiritual atmosphere for a Christian campus. Good amount of activities each part of the year. Best all campus activity was Starry Night ( Christmas light up). Also Super Bowl night and Homecoming (literally bring in a Ferris wheel!)

Get better dining hall food! Quality is definitely lacking and more variety."
Niche User,4,"I haven’t yet got the whole experience I am a senior in highschool I will be attending cairn next fall. I have visited many time, and they are very welcoming and loving. I feel at home when I am their. I have made many friends there and only visited twice. I have never had a good school experience from middle to highschool, but walking through the halls of cairn I had a peace of doing great their, I am studying social work and there program is very good. I don’t think they should change anything, because it’s a Christian school it’s different yet you still have fun."
Freshman,4,"The communication is not very good, but the colleges small and very safe. There is a good staff to student ratio and relationship."
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere and sense of community is what attracted me to Cairn before I even visited, and it’s remained true as I’ve been attending."
Niche User,4,I liked the way they made the visit fun instead of boring and they aloud me to see a class while students were learning. I also met with the basketball coach.
Alum,4,Cairn is an up and coming Christian university that is slowly modernizing their campus and upgrade major needs for student activities.
Senior,4,"I am a senior at CU. The staff is great, the food is horrible, and the campus is beautiful. It's a small campus which a newly built Starbucks available."
Graduate Student,4,"The teacher's have been very helpful, made a point to get to know the students and are available to help."
Graduate Student,4,I  like the Univeristy overall but there is no diversity among the faculty. Although there are few professors that try to relate to their student as an African American it is very difficult to find some one to confide.  I have experienced constant microagressions in this school.
Alum,4,"Great Christian college, but it is not for everyone, i.e. if you are looking to party for 4 years, go elsewhere. If you want a Christ centered education, this is a great option."
Freshman,4,"Cairn University is great university to attend if you're looking for a strong Christian community.  They have excellent academics and they do everything with a Biblical worldview. Also, the dining hall is very good."
Sophomore,4,"The community here at Cairn is better than any that I've seen, especially within such a close knit group as the music department. There are very few things to complain about, save a few professors and some of the cafeteria food."
College Sophomore,4,"Some rooms aren't great, but the social atmosphere of both on campus housing is dynamic and thriving, which makes the process very enjoyable."
College Freshman,4,I do feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Putting their faults aside, I love this university"
College Freshman,4,I really love this school. The atmosphere is really amazing and I love being in a Christ-centered environment. My only problem is that it doesn't have as many opportunities as other schools do.
College Freshman,4,"In the single semester I have been in campus I have not heard of a single crime being committed on campus. There was one close call, but it was stopped before it could become an a rape. There are emergency buttons around the entire campus to call safety and security. The office of safety and security encourages all students to have the office number in their phone, and patrol the campus all the time. The campus feels very safe, even if I personally prefer to avoid walking alone after dark because of my own upbringing."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of work put into connecting current students with alumni and programs in which they can use their major.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Manor Dormitories, which are situated right in the middle of the food and gym and the class buildings and offices. Location is excellent. Room size can be a bit cramped, especially if you bring a lot of things, but if you keep the room clean and keep it organized, you shouldn't be tripping over things. My RAs have been great - very friendly, willing to help with anything, and up for talking about anything. The housing process went very smoothly for me and I was paired with a roommate who is now one of my closest friends after just one semester."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe walking around campus at night
College Sophomore,4,They are always reaching out to new people
College Sophomore,4,Cairn has a great community with some great students
College Freshman,4,"Cairn athletics is a program that has great potential. The student body supports and encourages the team, no matter what the outcome of the games are. Team performance sometimes suffers due to lack of commitment, but in many areas of the athletics program, teams are building momentum and becoming successful in their efforts."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security drives around all the time, and are happy to walk students back to dorms if needed."
College Freshman,4,"The professors take their position seriously, and it is obvious how much they care about their students. Homework is moderate, but do NOT get behind. You will regret it."
College Freshman,4,"The school here has a lot of team spirit, but we usually do not find out scores or whether or not our team won unless we go asking."
College Freshman,4,"Except for the train that passes by every day, the local area is great!"
College Junior,4,The campus has been improving a lot. They have modernized a large amount of buildings.
College Junior,4,Cairn is very strict and often takes action regarding any behavior that does not meet codes of conduct.
College Junior,4,"I don't mind it. There's enough to do, you just have to know about local attractions."
College Junior,4,There is very little required for most undergraduate programs other than an average GPA and SAT score. But getting accepted into Graduate programs does require at least a 3.0 GPA.
College Sophomore,4,"I currently attend a private christian college so that being said, everyone is for the most part very religious. Don't underestimate that for boring and meek because everyone seems to have a nice time here. Everyone is very sociable and approachable. the biggest interest surprisingly amongst the guys and girls is that a huge majority loves Duck Dynasty. I've personally never seen it but they love it. Everyone is for the most part very down to earth and laid back and it shows in the way the dress as well. Most people here tend to get into relationships fast, many actually go on to get married before they even graduate."
College Sophomore,4,The Campus Housing Life at Cairn University is really Great. Its in very close proximity to the different buildings including the Gym and cafeteria. The RA's make it very enjoyable as well because they all are so interactive with their fellow wing mates and their are always activities going on at the different dormitories. Even the washers and dryers are very accessible and up to date. All together I have no complaints dorm life is pretty fun here!!!
College Senior,4,Availability is great! The network tends to crash. BEWARE!
College Senior,4,"They are so nice and easy to work with. On the real, tell them your need and they will try their absolute best to help you."
College Senior,4,"I'd suggest living in Heritage for your first year or so, then moving on to Manor for a year or so, then finishing up at Penndel Apartments. As you mature and seek independence, you're going to want to get off of main campus. Penndel and Manor are old and you'll be able to notice that right away. Heritage is newer and modern."
College Senior,4,"The Langhorne Train Station is right around the corner from campus (walking distance). It takes you down to the Philadelphia Airport and stops at all of the major Center City stops (Market East, Suburban, 30th Street, 69th Street). You can take a train to 30th Street Station and take a bus to many cities, such as Boston, New York or DC. You can also find the Amtrak there."
College Senior,4,"Typical northeast weather patterns, ha! Regardless of the weather, campus is seemingly always gorgeous."
College Junior,4,"They do offer some financial aid, need based scholarships, and very decent merit scholarships."
College Junior,4,"We are expanding our academic programs lately and have just added psychology. The biggest schools are education, Bible, and social work. The campus is beautiful and student life is constantly coming up with activities for everyone to get involved. We are small, but function as a community."
College Junior,4,Average area. Everyone knows Cairn students and are used to many of them and are kind. Plenty of restaurants and is close to 3 malls. School is located right next the train station so Philly is a short ride away.
College Junior,4,"Campus is beautiful through all the seasons especially on the walkway and near the pond. Strong storms occasionally knock the power out. Rarely, our area will be affected by hurricane season so they do have lock-down safety procedures ready."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite sport is basketball and basketball season was my favorite part of the year. I looked forward to when we had home games and I was a big supporter. Our basketball team did not win a lot of games but the gymnasium was always packed with screaming fans. Our school is big on school spirit, students are always going to volleyball, soccer, basketball, and baseball games. Our girls soccer team won a lot of championships and they worked very well together as a team. People from different teams would always be seen hanging out together."
College Freshman,4,"Being a social worker is definitely not for everyone, it is very rigorous and before you get accepted into the program you have to go through specific clearances. You have to reviewed by the entire social work faculty in order to make sure you are good for the job. I believe that everything you do as a student definitely prepares you for being a social worker in the real world. Every student is required to participate in a field trip where they will experience what it is like to be homeless and living in the Philadelphia area. The courses are very interactive, for instance the class I am taking now is called Social Work Experience and it is helping me understand every aspect of being a social worker, both positive and negative. Students are also required to do one day and four day placement at real agencies. Many students end up getting jobs at these agencies and quite a number of agencies specifically request for social workers from Cairn University. Most students who graduate get a job in the field right away."
College Sophomore,4,"The shuttle is easy to get on and off. While it only makes three stops, the campus is very small and those three stops will get you all over campus. "
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, while some parts of the school seem bleak, i really appreciate the lesson I've learned here at Cairn. The Christian living has stretched me, but I really love it at moments, and I really hate it at times. "
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my program of interest. It has a wonderful opportunity to go to Wisconsin for a year and intern there. 
College Sophomore,4,The quality of the health center is quality and the safety part is okay. I see the campus police around. 
College Senior,4,All systems are reliable at tis time
College Senior,4,There is no tolerance for drugs
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently in the undergraduate program. These classes are preparing us for grad school where I have seen and heard that the curriculum is rigorous, but the students actually apply what they have learned. The counseling program is unlike many as we are able to get lab hours while in school and also get licensed for both PA and Jersey. The opportunity to get both a Bachelors and Masters degree in five years in the dual program is also rare. The professors that lead the program are all experienced counselors with prestige backgrounds and experience."
College Sophomore,4,"There are amazing deals if you are a Cairn student. We get discounts at Dunkin Donuts, Chic-fil-A, Dominoes, and California Tortilla. There are numerous other places to eat such as Panera, your regular fast-food drive-through and nicer places such as Olive Garden or Bertucci's. There are also many fun frozen yogurt places along with Sushi restaurants, none too expensive."
Recent Alumnus,4,Off campus is great in langhorne. Excellent variety is you have a car
Recent Alumnus,4,The dining is awesome and the variety is ecceptional
College Senior,4,I love off-campus housing! The apartments around school are very inexpensive and most of the landlords love having Cairn students in their buildings. Many of the apartments are within walking distance.
College Senior,4,"Cairn has a diverse student body.  Many people are accepting and willing to talk about race/ethnicity/economic/political issues.  While we are all Christians, we are not all the same in every area of life."
College Senior,4,"There are always spots on campus.  Spots at the Penndel Apartments are hard to find, though.  Not everyone can get a spot there so a raffel is completed at the beginning of each year.  I didn't win when I was a junior and had to park my car on campus and ride the shuttle back everyday (except for weekends- parking is available and you won't get ticketed!).  The prices for parking are also very low to many other schools. I give parking at Cairn an A- because the parking is great overall besides at the Penndel Apartments."
College Senior,4,The computers work well in the computer labs. Printing fees are fair too.
College Senior,4,"Nice Location – It's not in the middle of nowhere, but it's not right in the city either. It has enough in the area surrounding it that there are things to do off campus and is away from the loud city (which I like)."
Senior,2,"Low quality, this college is not a good return on your money. If you can afford it, go somewhere else with more opportunities. Cairn has issues with communication and money management. Flaws behind the scenes that affect the students. They overwork the teachers and crowd the dorms. Very few campus events. Small selection of classes. Open campus so they've had some problems with saftey in the past. A lot of the students are immature/loud and act like 14-year-olds. You either belong here or you are mystified at how people can say they love it here, and it's not my type of place. You do get to know the teachers since it's a small campus, but I missed out on things that better quality/bigger campuses have."
Senior,2,"Online classes are harder than in-person classes and you don't really learn much from class, you learn on your own and do homework based on that learning. During covid, zoom meetings and moving to 100% virtual was rough because no-one was prepared for it. Too much homework until they realized it was taxing the students. It's a little bit smoother now but it depends on the professor."
College Junior,2,I don't like food here at all
College Freshman,2,"Your meal plan includes the Cafeteria, or the Highlander Cafe. All the food in the cafeteria is bad, and your options in the cafe are limited. Plan on eating out and spending your own money a lot."
College Sophomore,2,Because we are a division III school we can not give out athletic scholarships.  This really hurts us because the financial aid doesn't help athletes like be able to stay in school.
College Junior,2,"The off campus housing lies in very dangerous areas with lots of crime. Living on campus is also required for anyone under 22, unless they live with their parents."
College Sophomore,2,"It's definitely a hassle. I like the school but it is way too expensive and I am not receiving that much money from FAFSA as it is. I barely was able to make it through my first year and am a little worried about this upcoming semester. If your late with a payment by a day, everything is on hold on your account until you pay the school. I wasn't able to eat or have access to my dorm for 2 weeks."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a Christian Institution, there is not much you really can do. Dancing is even Banned at my school"
College Freshman,2,"There really is not a lot to do at night. Because it is a Christian school people don't really go to parties or bars and things like that. Some students go out partying but it is not really a big crowd. There is also not a lot to do in the area especially if someone does not have a car so if a person wants to go out on a Friday night some options include bowling, movies, or going out to eat."
College Sophomore,2,The internet goes in and out frequently. 
College Sophomore,2,At Cairn there are a lot of wanna-be hipsters. 
College Senior,2,"The food often isn't good. It's served cold sometimes and chefs seem to have fun making food where students have to guess at what they're eating. They often do have good food on the grill, but there's normally a long line for it."
College Junior,2,"On campus the dining options are varied, but not too healthy. Cafeteria food is typical cafeteria food. There's a buffet line, sandwich bar, drink bar, salad bar, and fruits. They also offer different things on the grill everyday like stir-fry or quesadillas. There are gluten free options on the buffet line as well. Then there's The Cafe- if you're on the student meal plan you can eat here 15 times a semester for free. There's burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, fires, onion rings, salads. That kinda stuff. There's lots of fast food places and restaurants right outside of campus and there's a small grocery store too."
College Junior,2,"You can live ""off-campus"" but it's still attached to ""on-campus"" dorms. We call these the ""renters"" dorms (or the ""married"" dorms). This can come in handy in some cases, but for most students it makes more sense to remain a residential student, since they wouldn't be any further off campus. Bonus: shuttle services are available."
College Senior,2,There aren't that many scholarships available at pbu. The process can be very difficult if you just do not have all the finances. They do not try and work with you very well.
College Senior,2,"Not Much Variety – The variety at the school dining hall is very limited. There is not much to pick from at all. The eagles nest is pretty good, but you are limited to only spending a certain amount there before you have to use your own money."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food needs to become about promoting healthiness.
More of a variety would be great"
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Good and Repetitive – The campus only really has two places to eat at; the cafeteria and the eagle's nest, which is like a little cafe restaurant. The cafeteria's menu is very repetitive and often consists of multiple leftover meals being thrown into one. The eagle's nest is much better, but the food isn't always done the best."
College Senior,2,"Dorm Life – I enjoyed living there for my freshman year.  It was a good way to get involved and meet people.  However, the 1 am curfew was lame and if your looking for a party, you won't find it here.  Also, guys and girls are NOT allowed in each others rooms!"
College Junior,2,"PBU is a pretty strict school but is getting more lax over the years. there is a curfew for the first year you are here. there is no drinking during the school year, you are not allowed to live off of campus until you are 21 or you have a legit excuse that you have too. Just to warn you this school treats its students like children almost... when you try to reason with most of the authority figures they will not listen unless your parents get involved so just for future reference."
Alum,1,"Cairn University does not allow unofficial transcripts to be emailed or downloaded. You have to pay them 5 dollars every time for them to mail an official transcript to you or whatever organization needs one.

And He said to them, “It is written, ‘MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER’; but you are making it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Recent Alumnus,1,They're only there for the prestigious position of being a professor in Cairo university! That's all. Not the students or the development.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is always groups objecting the politics in the country outside the campus and they're always attacked and we're always affected by this.
Recent Alumnus,1,"No hygiene. No good food. No good coffee. The spaces for lectures are bad as they don't care about the number of students, they only care about getting them in!"
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have Greek life to begin with!
Recent Alumnus,1,It's only care is about the grades and exams but they don't care about the needs of the work field or the student demands!
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no playgrounds and no is interested in athletes except if they're entering championships outside the university. They only help these athletes by letting them retake tests and that's it but there isn't a university team or coach or even financial help to these athletes.
College Freshman,1,There are parties if you count movie nights.
College Freshman,1,NO parties at all. Very boring.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing normal. All the food is gross
College Sophomore,1,"This is not a party school.  It is possible that there are parties, but very few."
College Senior,1,"We are under a covenant... Therefore, there is no nightlife unless bowling is something you absolutely adore and have money for."
College Sophomore,1,Cairn does not allow greek life. That is part of our community covenant. 
College Sophomore,1,"Going through the off-campus housing process is such a big hassle. It's not really worth your time. If you say you're commuting (must be within reasonable distance) you can get an apartment, if you have money. "
College Sophomore,1,Sexual orientation and religious views suffer on campus vastly. 
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life at Philadelphia Biblical University, it is a conservative school regarding keeping campus life as wholesome as possible.  So, parties are not really happening on campus as far as I know."
College Sophomore,1,"there is only one location for off school housing at PBU, and you still need an RA to watch over you. We are not allowed to live anywhere else unless you are over 21, married, or commuting. However it is nice to be close to all the students because we are all together."
College Junior,1,Drugs and Alcohol Policy – There is a no tolerance policy for alcohol for any student even if they are over 21.  No tolerance policy for smoking or drugs as well.  If you are caught usually there is a warning and you meet with guidance councilors after the second offense you are suspended
College Senior,1,PBU Guys – DISAPPOINTING! There's not too much to choose from.  In fact there are a good amount that I think are closet cases.
College Junior,1,"Sports at PBU – The athletics at PBU are very weak in comparison to other schools. We do well against the other Christian schools in our region, but we have been placed in a very talented conference which usually ends with our sports teams getting beaten."

Sophomore,5,Professor's try really hard to adapt and provide the best learning experience for students. The school even sent out free iPad Pros to every single student in the school which we get to keep.
Sophomore,5,"One of the best undergraduate institutions in the nation. Once you're a Polar Bear, always a Polar Bear."
Alum,5,"I was a senior during the year we transition to online school, and most of my classes were seamlessly transitioned to online learning."
Alum,5,Bowdoin is an all-around stellar school. It is comparable to the ivy league in terms of the quality of education.
Sophomore,5,I couldn't have picked a better school! I am absolutely in love with my college and proud to be a Bowdoin student. The professors and staff are there to help support you during your academic journey and the students are amazing! The campus is very welcoming and the food is great!
Alum,5,Bowdoin College is an incredible place and I would recommend it strongly to anyone applying. The professors are unmatched. Maine is wonderful. I've built life long friendships and a deep connection with the Bowdoin community.
Alum,5,"Online courses were not available during my 4 years at Bowdoin College, but I'd imagine the experience is still enjoyable."
Freshman,5,"Small school where people are friendly and professors are very helpful. The only downside is it can be a little isolating having so little people, but there are a lot of opportunities that the school offers which makes it an overall great learning experience."
Freshman,5,Bowdoin is a very special community to be a part of. You can tell from the moment that you step on campus that you are welcome and the people there want you to succeed and will go out of their way to help you. The best part about Bowdoin is truly the people that make it up.
Sophomore,5,"I love Bowdoin. The work is very difficult, and parties aren't great, but the people here are amazing and that's the most important thing. Its a really great place in so many ways."
Sophomore,5,Bowdoin College is an amazing college. I think the school has a ton to offer. The small class sizes allow for creating great relationships with professors.
Freshman,5,"The moment I stepped on Bowdoin's campus, I knew that it was going to be my home for the next four years. I am confident that I chose the right school for me. I feel like I'm flourishing in terms of my social and academic life; things are just happening for me here. My professors are wonderful, there's such a tight-knit community, and the people here are so nice. Bowdoin just cares about me!"
Junior,5,"Bowdoin helps you learn and grow far more than just your academics, but your person. For me, this comes primarily from the people in the Bowdoin community. There are difficulties associated with any one of the elements listed below about Bowdoin, but the people that I've met and have created a community with have turned any of those difficulties around into beautiful learning experiences and reinforcements of community. Maybe it's just that I've found my people -- but there is such an overwhelming number of these people that I feel this from. Students are supportive, collaborative, have a crazy range of interests, and a willingness to try new things (even if that new thing is taking a break and forgoing a reading). There are many ways to learn and challenge oneself, and my time at Bowdoin has shown me how that can both be deepened in academics and extend far beyond just those traditional academics. My academics enhance my holistic life, as my holistic life enhances my academics."
Senior,5,"I have loved my experience at Bowdoin so far. My favorite part about the college is its people. It is evident that the professors are teaching because they enjoy it. From my experiences, the professors I have had showed sincere concern and they cared about how their students were doing. Other staff and the students seem just as genuine. The Bowdoin ""hello"" is real and I love it when I walk by someone on the way to class and they say hello."
Freshman,5,"So glad I chose to come to Bowdoin! A very close community where people treat each other with kindness and are excited to learn from their peers. Quality of life is great, with great dorms, food and surrounding area. Classes are challenging but there is very little competitiveness and lots of support for students academically. For a small liberal arts school, there is a very healthy and fun social life."
Alum,5,"Best things about Bowdoin: the PEOPLE (A-grade human beings very smart and very fun), the PROFESSORS (inspiring, caring, personable, incredibly intelligent), FOOD!!!! (see NYtimes article), Parties (DJ pub nights, social house parties, Crackhouse, Joshuas, fun people), CAMPUS (gorgeous gorgeous accessible campus), NO frats or sororities, Great clubs and events on campus constantly"
Sophomore,5,"I loved attending Bowdoin, but it is very expensive and was not very flexible with my family in our financial aid. It is also not a very diverse student body, but is working slowly to change this. Most professor are excellent and you get to engage with them very closely at such a small school, and the professors welcome this."
Junior,5,"Next year I will have a Junior at Bowdoin as well as an incoming freshman. No matter if you are a nerd student or a promising artist, Bowdoin is THE place to help you discover your passion. My girls love their college. Go visit. You’ll fall in love with our Polar Bear community!"
Freshman,5,"Bowdoin provides students with so many opportunities. The professors are excellent, the food is fantastic, the dorms are spacious and clean, and the campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,"I had an excellent experience at Bowdoin. This is a wonderful place to live, work, and learn. My relationships with professors and peers have had lifelong impact."
Alum,5,"Bowdoin provides an excellent environment to learn, grow as a person, and make life long connections. Bowdoin students have incredibly diverse interests yet a common drive to put everything they have into their pursuits. Bowdoin is more than the best 4 years of your life because you become part of a life long community."
Junior,5,"Admissions does a good job of ensuring that a group of enthusiastic, intelligent, and unique people come in each year. My professors all care about my learning, and achieving success is never impossible. I am happy the school got rid of quints for first year housing. They are renovating many dorms and adding new options for upper-class students which is warmly welcomed. The party life may not be bumping, but what the school lacks in basement bangers, it makes up in their outstanding event programming; BOC (outing club) often has weekly events and outings, college houses and academic departments bring incredible speakers to campus, improv is funny for the most part, and Bowdoin must have the most a cappella singers per capita out of all other NESCACS. Club sports and some varsity sports aren't out of reach for anyone, and there is always some kind of food for anyone. Polar bear is a cool mascot, and black and white make for flattering school clothing (very slimming)."
Senior,5,"Bowdoin isn't perfect. Most of the complaints here are grounded in truth. Winters are long, classes are tough, the party scene gets old, you can't escape those you want to avoid, the narp/athlete divide can get to you, and the students can at times seem both too political and not political enough. But damn, I love this school. I've grown - both emotionally & intellectually - in ways that I don't think would've been possible at any other school. Students are friendly, smart, and intellectually curious. There's no social hierarchy. The professors are first rate. Classes are niche, engaging, and interesting, & the near-open curriculum lets you pursue your passions. Town residents, staff, & security are a huge part of the community. Brunswick & Portland are both awesome and having the ocean nearby is HUGE. I was abroad last semester and I'm itching to get back to the challenge and rigor of the academics, the cozy familiarity of the campus, and the places & people I love."
Freshman,5,"Bowdoin is both a beautiful and diverse college and I cannot recommend it more highly. The professors care about each individual's experience. Additionally, the student life and overall culture is very positive and accepting."
Sophomore,5,"I've loved Bowdoin. The school was extremely helpful during my first year. I had math tutors almost 24/7 and was able to reach professors easily. Some talk of an athlete/non-athlete divide, but coming from my perspective as a non-athlete, I think that is made up. If you aren't friends with athletes it is because you choose not to be. So far, Bowdoin has everything I could want. Great professors, beautiful campus, supportive staff, and hardworking kids. There could always be more diversity."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community that is Bowdoin College. The school is full of students who care about their education and about the other members of the community. Athletics is also a great part of the school, encouraging all to get involved if they choose to do so. The food is also great for being away from home. I always feel safe on campus. There is also things to do for students on campus all the time with different activities and things to get involved with."
Senior,5,"Rising Senior at Bowdoin. I love it. It's been welcoming and engaging from the start, and I've only grown more attached to the place since then.

The quality of life is very high, and the academics are mostly excellent."
Sophomore,5,"Bowdoin College is extremely welcoming to all its prospective and incoming students. The culture that Bowdoin’s administration, faculty, students and clubs have created is one that makes students feel at home and confident in themselves and their capacity to learn. Located in the town of Brunswick, ME, it is close to the ocean, hiking trails, shopping (Freeport), and cute coffee shops. Bowdoin is such an amazing place to learn, grow and thrive alongside so many other passionate individuals."
Sophomore,5,I love Bowdoin so much. It's a very supportive place full of wonderful people! I've gotten to take really interesting classes and felt challenged but still supported by friends and the college.
Niche User,5,"I am a parent of a first year student.  We are from South Florida so the first question to answer I hear is “Why Maine, isn’t it cold?”  The answer is yes the weather is cold but Bowdoin is also “So warm” you forget about the cold.  All the students I’ve met are warm, welcoming, intelligent, and supportive; not cut-throat competitive.  It’s truly an amazing place to be with a top moth education."
Freshman,5,"I am a first year at Bowdoin and it's a great school. The people and professors make it amazing. It's a smaller school, so class sizes are small (which I like) and you get to know everybody very quickly."
Niche User,5,"I love the fact that Bowdoin is a small, liberal arts college. I am someone who thrives in close teacher-student relationships, and Bowdoin provides me with such an opportunity. Further, the College's emphasizes on career development is really important. For instance, Bowdoin displays  fashion shows among students and faculty to learn ""what to wear and what not to wear for an interview."" Further, even though Bowdoin does not have a Journalism program, they do have an English major, and also the opportunity to create one's own program/major."
Freshman,5,"The culture of the campus is what makes it great. Most school experiences, as far as I know, are what you make of them, but Bowdoin is exceptional at helping you make the most of your time here. I love my classes, professors, and friends I have made."
Niche User,5,The atmosphere there was very welcoming and they were very willing to help in any way they could to make your college experience the best one possible.
Sophomore,5,"Bowdoin could not have made my first year at college any better. I felt challenged, my brain literally expanded, the people I met were interesting, I loved the present but not all-consuming social scene...even when I was stressed out from work I was still so happy to be at Bowdoin. Unlike other colleges, Bowdoin does not have a stress culture and encourages you to try new activities even if you might fail."
Freshman,5,"I grew up hearing about how great Bowdoin College was, but nothing compares to how amazing it is to go to college here. The food is great, the people are amazing, and it's easy to instantly feel at home. They make the transformation from high school to college easy. The education  I've received is fulfilling and passionate."
Sophomore,5,"BEST COLLEGE FOR THOSE LOOKING TO FORM LONG-LASTING FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS!!! I have met friends at Bowdoin who I now consider my family! Bowdoin's size, genius orientation program, and extracurricular activities are perfect for meeting new people and feeling connected!"
Freshman,5,"Whether its the Outing Club, the Literary Magazine, the Film Society, or an a Capella group, there is always something for every kind of person to get involved in. Also, people here are incredibly friendly and willing to go out of their way to help you. Bowdoin's size, with 1700 students, really enables this sense of community. If I could change one thing about Bowdoin, I would offer class credit for laboratory time. Also , this is just my wish , but I think Bowdoin should advertise more to the outside world. I grew up overseas, so most of my other friends had not heard of Bowdoin, or Brunswick for that matter.  I can understand that I was surprised that not many people in United States knew about this school either. The social scene is great on the weekends, but for the most part exists only on the weekends as people work very hard during the week. As for food, you can guess exactly how delicious it is from just taking a peek at the NYtimes article and the college rankings."
Freshman,5,"Amazing faculty that love to teach, and a great campus community.  Recommend to any one who wants a challenging but inclusive academic environment. "
Sophomore,5,"I love pretty much everything about Bowdoin. The people, the classes, the campus, the professors all make this campus what it is. But although I love Bowdoin, I love the person Bowdoin made me even more. Here's to the happiest years of your life."
Junior,5,"Scholarly atmosphere overall. Students are incredibly smart and give off an intellectual vibe, but at the same time are down to earth. Work tends to be very challenging, but the environment is supportive. At Bowdoin, you can feel yourself learning and growing in many ways. "
Sophomore,5,"Love Bowdoin.... best choice I've ever made was to apply ED1 here. Everyone is incredibly smart, but incredibly humble. The environment here is 100% collaborative instead of competitive and  that is what makes Bowdoin different. "
Senior,5,"I applied to Bowdoin through ED, and are in my senior year here. I truly have no regrets and completely enjoy my time here. The college really stands by its three core values: intellectual engagement, connection to the place and commitment to the Common Good. The people here are exception, and willing to know and help you as much as they can. It's a place that you learn how to stretch yourself and step out of your comfort zone. If you don't like to do so, maybe Bowdoin is not the place for you. "
Sophomore,5,"This small community, top-notch food and board, great professors and diverse community earns a 5-star review. My only objection is the extremely pc atmosphere; though, I'm sure that is common among many colleges. At Bowdoin, however, you can't ignore it."
College Junior,5,Bowdoin was one of the best decisions of my young life.
College Junior,5,"Housing gets better as you progress through your Bowdoin career. Freshman dorms are not the greatest in terms of quality, but definitely have very convenient locations."
College Junior,5,Hockey and Rugby teams are the best. Football is meh.
College Junior,5,"There's a lot of emphasis on independence and responsibility when it comes to things such as alcohol. However, the security team on campus is absolutely the best."
College Junior,5,It's hard to do well at Bowdoin; persevere through it. Enjoy the four years and embrace the tears and triumphs.
College Junior,5,"Nothing much to say. Overall, extremely nice and crazy smart."
College Junior,5,We try to take care of each other on campus and we all take these matters extremely seriously. There is an incredible effort by faculty and students to make sexual violence/other health issues visible on campus.
College Junior,5,"Great food, great people, great academic and scholarly atmosphere. Love it."
College Sophomore,5,We have the best security ever. Campus police are concerned with students' safety and it never feels like they are out to get you. They really are friendly and look out for students. The health office is also staffed with extremely friendly and helpful doctors.
College Sophomore,5,"After having visited 24 college campuses, Bowdoin easily has one of the best housing options. There is a wide variety of types of housing, and the school does a great job of pairing incoming Freshmen roommates"
College Sophomore,5,Close to class and very comfortable.
College Sophomore,5,"I've met some awesome kids, learned from great professors, and enjoyed an incredible quality of life here on the Maine Coast."
College Freshman,5,"Really enjoyed my overall experience thus far. Liberal arts allows me to take any class in any department, which is pretty cool."
College Freshman,5,"Security just wants to help. In the heat of the moment they may be annoying, but they are just there for us at the end of the day. Usually not there to get you in trouble, either."
College Freshman,5,I had a great first year here. Truly great experience.
College Freshman,5,The drug scene at Bowdoin is almost non-existent. Alcohol is about the only substance on campus
Sophomore,4,"I took classes online just like every other college student during the pandemic, for being a small liberal arts school that has never taught online, I would say Bowdoin did a pretty good job at coming together to teach virtually. However the school does not offer online courses with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Freshman,4,"I expected more to be honest, this would have been a great school if I was only interested in doing schoolwork but there isn't much life on the campus at all in addition to the lack of diversity but what else can I really expect from a PWI that's never had to make space for someone like me for like 400+ years."
Freshman,4,Some professors were being difficult but most of mine were being so lenient and I actually learned more than I did before in the one STEM course I was in because I was no longer being forced into group work with closeted racists who dismiss me and every answer I give because they don't think a black woman like me is smart enough to come up with something worth while but they would never say that because again it's implicit racism and everyone's scared of being outwardly racist.
Freshman,4,"Bowdoin made it as painless as possible to  finish my semester from a distance. It was challenging, but not because of the school."
Freshman,4,Bowdoin supports its students and does whatever it can to facilitate it's students learning all they can.
Junior,4,The professors are fantastic to work with and dedicate large amounts of time outside of class to helping their students. Certain departments are a bit short-staffed and could use more professors.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy how nice the community is, and how easy it is to feel apart of it, even as a freshman. Because it's a small school, it's easier for everyone to get to know each other, regardless of class year."
Sophomore,4,"Sometimes it's embarrassing when non students say Bowdoin is for the privileged. The bulk of students are definitely wealthy and have the luxury to participate in sports rather than have to work. The education aspect is great but there aren't a lot of connections to make for after graduation because of the small size. Obviously it is one of the best liberal art schools in the country, it's just not perfect."
Senior,4,"Bowdoin College has become my second home. It has it's many flaws but it also has a way of making your feel safe and welcome even on the worst of days. I came here looking for that tight-knit community feeling and that is exactly what I got. The campus is beautiful. The professors are amazing and have been life-changing in some cases. It is lacking in terms of diversity of all kinds unfortunately, but the college is receptive to its students attempting to make changes in campus culture for the better. I've had my share of good and bad times here but Bowdoin is a truly unforgettable place."
Niche User,4,Everyone on the tour was helpful and enthusiastic. Bowdoin campus was pretty and I can only imagine more so in the fall. I would’ve liked to have seen more variety in class options. The students are diverse which is a huge plus.
Sophomore,4,"At Bowdoin, I personally feel that you just need to find a group of people that makes you feel comfortable and happy. Yes, I do recommend mingling and getting to know others outside of your group, but there is a need to have a safe space that you can go back to when needed."
Sophomore,4,"Academics are top notch; friendly and welcoming student body; tight-knit campus community; and there are always a variety of events happening on campus at any time.
However, it’s possible to feel socially isolated at times because the student body is so small and located in a small town in Maine with fewer opportunities and amenities than in bigger cities."
Freshman,4,"Bowdoin College has an incredibly welcoming environment and the administration and staff work very had to provide financial assistance for every student. While it is a friendly campus, there remains some problems of racial diversity and inter-racial inclusiveness to address."
Freshman,4,"I like Bowdoin because it’s in a wonderful location if you have any interest in the outdoors. The professors I’ve had so far has been great and the school provides an abundance of support for its students both academically and in their transition to college. I feel that, while the school is doing okay on its diversity, it could go a long way to really build a more inclusive community. Overall I’m very happy at Bowdoin."
Freshman,4,"After just finishing my first semester at Bowdoin, I can say that there are a lot of ups and downs. I love the campus, and I LOVE the surrounding area. Bowdoin is not that typical LAC in the middle of nowhere--Brunswick is the cutest town with tons of coffee shops and amazing restaurants; Freeport is a great place to do some shopping and spend the day with friends; Portland is an amazing, safe city. It is very easy to get to these places through a $3 bus. The health services are pretty terrible though; the counseling services are subpar at best, and if you are sick and don't have immediately diagnosable strep, the health center won't do anything for you.

For me, it was hard to make close friends at first. Everyone puts forward a version of themselves that they think others will like, and I found myself growing close to people with whom, as I got to know them, I did not necessarily want to stay close. It's rough the first few months, but it gets better."
College Junior,4,So far I've loved my rooms and I heard that it will be better by next year. Fingers crossed.
College Junior,4,"I think around half of all students are athletes. Athletic events are well supported and the facilitues *Gym, courts, etc) are pretty nice"
College Sophomore,4,"Career Planning Center is great, but you must take intitiative!"
College Sophomore,4,"I am not involved in athletics, so I don't find it being much of my life at all. However plenty of my friends are very dedicated to their teams, and seem to really love it."
College Sophomore,4,"I think that Bowdoin's community is absolutely exceptional. In the end, the connections you make during college -- both with peers and professors-- are extremely important for both your social life and your professional career. While I've been  underwhelmed by a number of classes, I think the student body's attitude is one of a kind."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of drinking, but the school keeps the focus on safety and not on discipline. This seems to work really well in my experience. People have some rough nights but in general stay very safe and are never in any danger."
College Sophomore,4,The school is very serious about health and safety and takes all steps to prevent and help deal with all problems of this matter. These issues are not swept under the rug.
College Sophomore,4,"Being a small school, many students are athletes. Everyone has access to the same facilities though, and there is a strong intramural and club sports scene for people not on varsity teams."
College Freshman,4,"I was put into a forced quint, which wasn't so nice, but rooms are very spacious and a lot of thingy can definitely get done."
College Senior,4,"Some people do drugs, but it is very under the radar and can be easily avoided."
College Senior,4,"There are some teams, such as the field hockey, women's rugby, and tennis teams, that are stand outs among the varsity teams."
College Senior,4,"The academics are incredible, but the social life on campus is slightly dull and doesn't keep an outgoing, fun-loving person entertained."
College Freshman,4,There are no clubs around. The parties are fun though.
College Freshman,4,"The gym is amazing. I use it all the time. Classes are now free starting 2015. There's tabata, zumba, etc. You can always get a work out."
College Freshman,4,People are very accepting of diversity among students.
College Freshman,4,"We have had a few incidents this past semester, but administration has handled them very well. I think the security measures are very good."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the upperclassmen housing is a bit far from classes and the dining halls, but other than that, it's great."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are obviously incredibly strong (see the 4 NESCAC titles this fall). I have been a member of the rowing team (club) and have had an amazing experience with that as well.
College Freshman,4,"Stuff happens, but security does all that they can"
College Freshman,4,"I compete nationally in Olympic-style weightlifting, so I'm use to certain types of gyms. I find that the Peter Buck Fitness Center has all that students need to get in shape. My opinion of a nice gym is different than most peoples. All I want are Olympic barbells, Olympic weights, platforms and squat racks. If people want to know what PBFC is like, it's pretty much a smaller Lifetime Fitness."
Recent Alumnus,4,Had a good time overall and met a lot of great faculty and friends and the food was great. I did get rather bored with the scene after my first couple of years as the school and the town of Brunswick are both quite small.
College Sophomore,4,"The Bowdoin community is extremely welcoming. Between challenging classes and an active social scene, finding balance can be a challenge, but it is rewarding."
College Freshman,4,"It went well, submitted the required paperworks and got the aid I mostly needed. Kinda of wish Bowdoin gave may one to two thousand more, since my family it not very well off."
College Freshman,4,Appleton dorms were quite spacious. Moores isn't very good except if you live in the ends of the building
College Freshman,4,"Security is all about keeping it safe, not punishment. If you're caught with hard alcohol you could be put on social probation, especially if you need to get transported, but beer is easy to come by and you almost certainly won't get in trouble for it. If you're caught with drugs you will get in trouble, but if you're honest they'll probably give you an easy punishment."
College Freshman,4,"Bowdoin really tries to be affordable to everyone, and from what I've heard they're usually pretty successful. If you have problems, I would really talk to the financial aid office. We have one of the best endowments for colleges our size and only 48% of the population is on financial aid, so I would be exceptionally surprised if they couldn't shuffle money around if you have a good reason."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is social for the most part.
College Freshman,4,The scholarship paid for nearly everything. The only problem is that doing everything over the internet is troublesome sometimes
College Sophomore,4,There's a ton of cool places to choose from!  They're just too expensive for me to go out much when I have meals already paid for on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not really into Social House parties, so I don't go to those much. there are a LOT of choice of things to do here, which is great, I just don't care much about the hardcore party scene. I have fun with my friends at smaller dorm parties, which is all I need to be happy with the party scene."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is really great and it has a good community, but it's a bit pricey and some of the buildings are a little older.  (Which is fine!)"
College Freshman,4,"Many students are varsity or intramural athletes, but team pride isn't particularly strong."
College Freshman,4,"For a small town, the off campus restaurants are ideal. There are also very few fast food restaurants near campus."
College Freshman,4,"Brunswick is a wonderful community. It's quite small and night life is limited, but it more than makes up for that with small town charm and a close knit community. The downtown is close to campus and has a good variety of wonderful restaurants. Shopping is fairly limited nearby, but Freeport and Portland are not too far away by car or train."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is fantastic, and the career center does a good job of connecting students with the resources they need."
College Freshman,4,The administration is not perfect but does its best to maintain a high level of life in an imperfect world.
College Freshman,4,"A little small but most people participate. What's great is that while there is a big draw, there is very minimal pressure to drink if you're not into that. People tend to be respectful especially on that front."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small town in Maine, Brunswick has a remarkable variety of dining venues on Maine Street. There's a very solid Indian restaurant, several Asian eateries, and an Italian place as well. Several organic grocery stores are available and a farmer's market is on the campus green several times a week in the summer, fall, and spring"
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of participation in club hockey, rugby, and rowing. They are some of the most visible teams on campus because most students simply had no intention of being a varsity athlete. Intramural hockey, basketball, and others are also very much participated in."
College Sophomore,4,"Wide variety of majors, but some departments are so small that there is lack of diversity in faculty thought. Esoteric majors tend to have just a few students per year."
College Sophomore,4,The health center is a marvelous facility and appointments are generally given same day. There is definitely a climate of positive pressure to eat healthily and exercise.
College Sophomore,4,Charming little Brunswick has plenty of resources and interesting things to do. Residents are supportive of Bowdoin and take advantage of our campus offerings regularly. Not really a college town.
College Junior,4,"I always feel safe on campus, security does a great job. Health services is a little bit shaky, somewhat hard to get appointment and the care is usually good but every once in a while, you hear a bad story about the health center. However, they are helpful overall and offer many great services."
College Junior,4,"Very nice off campus housing, though most students choose to live on campus. Off campus housing is not far and is usually reasonably priced. Usually very spacious as well."
College Junior,4,"Other than Ivies, most parties are fairly low key. College houses probably throw the most ""typical"" college parties, but plenty of other places have more laid back parties. Fun environment overall."
Sophomore,2,"I've just finished my first year, and to be truthful, I hated it. The first-year deans were horrible and unsupportive. Bowdoin likes to lure students into the college by making false promises and insisting they will ""take good care of you"". If I could go back on my decision to commit here, I would. However, the academics and my professors have been challenging but amazing, and they're the only reason why I'm still at Bowdoin."
Alum,2,I am very disappointed in the direction that Bowdoin has taken in the past ten years. The college admissions policies and process is completely tailored to increasing their rankings. Political correctness is completely over the top (this coming from a bleeding heart liberal). Sports recruiting seems excessive.
College Senior,2,"The party scene at Bowdoin is pretty terrible (with an occasional fun party), so don't get your hopes up and think this is a party school."
College Senior,2,"The parties at Bowdoin have the same 50 people at them every weekend and they are far from fun, but it is what you make of it."
College Freshman,2,Everyone is an upperclass white kid from Boston/NY
College Student,2,"It's Maine; it gets very cold here. The summer is hot, the spring is wet and the winter is cold. However, fall is awesome here. Autumn in Maine is another experience that is unfortunately overshadowed by the brutal winters. It gets better once the sun comes out."
College Junior,2,Most upperclassmen choose to live in college-owned housing because it is nicer than alternative options
College Junior,2,Spots are far from classes. Students are not allowed to park on campus during the week days. 
College Freshman,2,"Not as bad as the midwest, but it's very cold especially compared to California."
College Sophomore,2,"Average White Preppy Athletic School – This school is you average small, liberal arts school. The students are mostly wealthy kids who play sports.  Everyone dresses up before going anywhere, including classes and the gym.  Make-up is a must for women.  Everyone either plays a sport or is obsessive about going to the gym (I'm not exaggerating).  The academics are strong and the classes are interesting however the distribution requirements can make picking enjoyable classes difficult.
If you enjoy drinking and dressing up then you should definitly come here. I didnt realize how much of a drinking school this was until I got here. The ""chem-free kids"" are shunned for the most part. Everyone makes fun of their dorm.
SO if you're an average white kid from a preppy high school you'll fit right in."
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking Far More Popular – Drinking is more popular. Drugs are pretty limited to weed. But like any school, you can find drugs if that's what you're looking for. Definitely not a ""druggie"" school though."
College Junior,2,"There Is Not Many Options – I actually have not heard of many off-campus housing options. What I have heard is the price is reasonable, but they are pretty far from campus and an automobile is needed."
Sophomore,1,"I went to Bowdoin very excited! I am from SC and I wanted to see a different area of the country. I’m outgoing so I wasn’t worried about the transition, but what I found made me intensely unhappy at Bowdoin.

-Academically, Bowdoin is great. Profs are great (if a little quirky), but always make themselves available.

-Bowdoin is a VERY culturally homogeneous place. Bowdoin’s reputation as a happy campus stems from homogeneity: a vast majority of students are from the Midatlantic or Northeast, and went to private or boarding schools.

-Socially, Bowdoin takes on a boarding school culture. Acapella performances, plays, and ultimate frisbee teams are big on campus, and if you don’t love these, it’s hard. Many people act aloof, tense, and unfriendly, and the parties are pretty bad. Socially it’s pretty dead here.

These things, combined with a large athlete divide, caused me to transfer. All I can say to incoming students from more diverse backgrounds is to tread carefully."
Senior,1,Did not enjoy my time at Bowdoin. Most students are upper middle class white kids who are totally disconnected from the world.
Sophomore,1,"Doesn’t live up to its reputation and was disappointed. Expected a much better education and environment. Way too much drinking. Food is great if you are vegan/vegetarian, otherwise not."
College Freshman,1,Bowdoin is way too liberally polarized.
College Junior,1,Barely has a presence on campus.  In fact I haven't been able to find it at all
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife in Bowdoin sucks. None of these kids can control how much they're able to drink, and getting waste is actually not THAT cool. There is also only cheap beer in social houses or dorms. There are no clubs."

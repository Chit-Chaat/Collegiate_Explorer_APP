Alum,5,"Beloit College has the best professors! They are always willing to help and put their students first. I learned so much, not just academically, but also of different values and backgrounds from my peers. The college provides great financial aid packages and will work around each student to accommodate their needs. They opened the powerhouse recently too, which has been a very exciting feature. The college now has a great recreational facility that has updated gyms, a pool, and study rooms. The local area has also been improving in recent years and now has more dining options as well as cute little boutiques. I loved going to the farmers market on the weekend during the warmer months too. I'm proud to be a Beloit College alumni. I will forever cherish the people that I met there and the undergrad experience I had."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online courses at Beloit, but most professors respond to emails promptly and are very accessible."
Alum,5,"Beloit College changed my life! The campus is absolutely magical and enjoyable though all four seasons. The classes prepare you for critical thinking and setting yourself apart from others in the 'real world.' Beloit offered many internship and research opportunities for all majors and departments (even for an English major, like myself) which helped me for my career after Beloit. I made amazing connections with caring professors and amazing people over a nice meal in our dining hall. Campus was always alive with music and students playing frisbee on the quad. There were always lectures, movies and fun student-lead events to attend during the week and weekend. It's like nowhere else!"
Sophomore,5,"going online has been really hard, but Beloit has done such a good job. All my Professors are working really hard to help us succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I am loving my time here at Beloit! the professors are amazing, and the campus is really pretty. :) Beloit is truly a great community to be in."
Alum,5,"Did not take any online classes, but professors at Beloit are so passionate about teaching that I have no doubt whatever online course is taught will mirror the excellence of an in-person class."
Alum,5,"Excellent college with devoted professors. Really a life-changing experience that benefits all. I had a transformative time at Beloit, and the professors made each class incredible, rich, full of life. I would recommend Beloit to anyone who wants to earn an education that is holistic and purposeful."
Sophomore,5,"I took my second semester of school online due to Covid. It was a unusual and weird change from classroom to online, but the professors prepared very well and made the adjustment very easy. The revised syllabus helped me a lot, and they made sure to set aside enough time for homework, assignments, quizzes, and tests for me with my other classes."
Freshman,5,"I liked everything at Beloit College, people are really nice, and they have good programs. The only exception is that the Tuition is pretty expensive, but besides that, I liked everything in it."
Freshman,5,"I haven't started classes yet I will be a freshman this upcoming course. I will be start some courses in July, to get some credits, so I appreciate that, the chance they give to get some credits extra to help us out with studies."
Alum,5,"Got two degrees from Beloit College, Math and Physics.  It's an excellent school.  It's well balanced, you can study very well and have some fun. Professors are excellent, intelligent and responsive.  I got accepted to all graduate PhD programs I applied to with full financial help. My kids will go to this college for sure."
Alum,5,"Beloit College is an excellent liberal arts school with a lot of heart, character, and freedom to be as weird as you want to be! For someone looking for a big school centering around sports and parties, this isn't it. Beloit has those, but they're smaller and quirkier. The small student body allows for close and quick student connections, as well as small class sizes and regular one-on-one time with the faculty (who all go by their first names). The faculty are dedicated teachers and endlessly supportive. The network of former Beloiters is also strong and it's not uncommon for alumni to reach out to Beloit first when seeking job candidates."
Niche User,5,"I have only toured it so far however, I absolutely LOVED the campus and loved everyone I met. Every single person I met what so sweet and helpful. I also met the softball coach and some of the girls on the team and it heightened my experience and it made me love it even more. 10/10 experience!!!!"
Sophomore,5,Beloit is a very cozy school and has become a home to me over the past year. I think that the relationship between professors and athletes could be improved as well as the divide between athletes and non athletes but besides that it has been one of the best experiences of my life.
Freshman,5,The Beloit college is the best college I have heard and it is in the best colleges that provides excellent qualifications and I like it very much.
Niche User,5,"While I have not attended the college yet, I went to visit for student admissions day and I absolutely loved it. I was able to attend a class and the teacher was so interactive with the students and made sure everyone was doing well. I really enjoyed the environment and the weather was beautiful. I talked to students who attend Beloit and I got a lot of good responses from them. I had such a great time that I actually plan on attending this college."
Alum,5,"Definitely not the school for everyone, but for me, it was perfect. I graduated as a philosophy major and the small class sizes and the tight-nit academic community was exactly what I needed to succeed. The thing I loved most about going here was that the learning didn’t stop after class was over. In the dorms, at commons, on walks in between classes, students discussed and debated the class material non-stop. Such a wonderful academic environment. If you’re looking for a good party scene or fun local culture, don’t go to Beloit. But for me, my friends and academics made it worth it."
Niche User,5,"Beloit is an excellent college although it feels less like a college and more like a community. The atmosphere at Beloit is second to none, the students are very welcoming and you are completely taken care of here."
Alum,5,"Beloit served me very well. I loved the friends I made and the professors who inspired me. The administration seems to be making solid investments in infrastructure, and downtown Beloit is finally picking up and becoming a real destination for beers and late night food. It's a beautiful campus with professors who truly care about the lives and success of their students and community. Beloit is the ideal place to broaden your mind, study abroad, and create a platform for a strong and successful life."
Alum,5,"The professors were knowledgeable and approachable. It was a very diverse student body, which I enjoyed. It is a small town and I enjoyed it. I would have picked a different major, but that was my decision. Everything about Beloit was good."
Alum,5,"My experience at Beloit College was Amazing. I was able to double major in two unreladed fields, as well as play a varsity sport. My only regret, not having gotten involved more on campus."
Niche User,5,"We visited Beloit on a Open House Saturday and came away very impressed. The campus is pretty, the plans for the new student center look incredible, and our tour guide was straightforward and encouraging. My daughter is a vegan and was very pleasantly surprised by the number of tasty and healthful options in the dining hall. We talked to an absolutely lovely, thoughtful, and engaging student who was not part of the admission team to get her take on the school. She said that she had been completely transformed by her experience there--that she has turned into a person who loves to learn. Before Beloit, she was only interested in taking classes as a means of getting to the next step."
Alum,5,"Life-changing experience. Beloit taught me to think critically, helped me find my passion, and supported my academic and career trajectory. I'm still good buddies with all my favorite professors. After graduating from Beloit I got graduate school offers from every school I applied to, including Harvard and Oxford."
Niche User,5,i am very interested in attending Beloit and have only heard that it is an amazing school.  cannot wait to be enrolled as the school has an amazing scenery.
Sophomore,5,I really like Beloit's Criminal Justice program. The teachers are really helpful and the football coaches are on there game.
Junior,5,"Not only is Beloit a beautiful campus, but it has amazing teachers that both challenge and care about their students. The majority of professors go by their first names in the classrooms and it helps to create an informal, comfortable atmosphere. I am proud and happy to be able to attend this incredible liberal arts college."
Junior,5,"This is a classic case of a 'little pond' school. You'll grow into a big, weird fish. Beloit is a place that people with avantgarde personality come to get a nice financial aid package and an education to rival the east coast liberal arts schools. I've never had a class larger than 10 students. Those were all fact statements. The value statement that you're looking for is this, ""Beloit is a place to go if you've always felt outside of the mainstream, and want to be celebrated for that. Its where honestly passionate and incredibly bright people go to find meaningful things to do with their lives. I'm sure if you're already indoctrinated into the name-brand big school mentality, there's little I can say or do to convince you otherwise, except to say that this school has benefits that you will never understand until you are here. That's coming from someone who's taken classes at 4 separate colleges."""
College Senior,5,"Academics here are comprehensive and rigorous. You will work hard, but it pays off."
College Senior,5,"The Liberal Arts in Practice Center helps students to find internships and jobs. They have huge amounts of money available for students wishing to do independent research projects. I've been to Washington, DC on a networking trip paid for by the LAPC, and it was awesome. Nearly all students find jobs or higher education opportunities after graduating."
College Senior,5,"I've loved just about every course that I've taken here. Beloit's quality of instruction is frequently rated very highly on national reviews, and it shows. Professors here are the best."
College Senior,5,"Special interest houses are quirky and awesome, and host a ton of cool social events. Townhouses and apartments are very comfy options for upperclassmen. Regular residence halls are good as well - relatively small, and with good community vibe. Each Res hall has its own unique kind of feel, so be sure to ask a current student which halls they've liked living in the best. I personally enjoyed Aldrich."
College Senior,5,"I'm a current student at Beloit, and it's been fantastic so far. Outstanding quality of instruction from the professors, really interesting/unique research opportunities available for students, and a huge emphasis on collaboration and putting a liberal arts education to good use. I've met many awesome and interesting people here, and definitely would choose to go here again given the opportunity."
College Senior,5,"I am positive that I was supposed to come to Beloit and that I have chosen the right school for me. I love the classes, professors, and people that I have met here. I have done everything that I imagined myself doing in college and more. I have been able to pursue my passions, goals, and dreams with the support of friends, faculty, and staff here. Going to a small liberal arts college is a great experience, and going to Beloit has been the best."
College Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my time here at Beloit. I feel like I have won the lottery in some ways, because I have been able to attend a college full of friendly, exciting, passionate people. I love that the professors here really care and want their students to succeed, and that we have lots of opportunities to do research and use all sorts of excellent resources that we have right on campus. If you come here, you will have the chance to be involved in a wide variety of clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Beloit is definitely a place where you can pursue all of your passions and all of your interests to the fullest."
College Sophomore,5,The thing I boast about the most about Beloit is the absolutely amazing professors who I see as incredible role models and mentors.
College Sophomore,5,"Beloit was a perfect fit for me personally because of the small size, beautiful campus and quirky students/professors. For me, the most important part of Beloit has been meeting creative people who are equally passionate about the world as I am. As a student, there is an emphasis on learning, rather than making grades the end all be all. I have been so lucky to have passionate, intelligent, caring professors who value students as individuals and who can incite provoking discussions and debate. On top of this, Beloit as a community tries to be aware of ways we can be more accepting and caring for one another. This past year I was involved in a program called Sustained Dialogue that focused on conversations between people with differing world experiences to try to break barriers. I am also involved in the Beloit Urban Garden as a recording secretary for staff meetings. In terms of social activities, there are many, many clubs boasting a host of activities most nights of the week. Nightlife generally consists of one or two parties around campus at varying special interest or greek houses, wonderful bands at CHaus (the on campus bar), or funny improvisational performances put on by Voodoo Barbie."
College Student,5,It's a great way of socialising here.
College Student,5,Everything isreally above and beyond as the college prepares the students for best things.
College Student,5,I really love it. It's a great start for a freshman like me and the college actually looks after you. I love it here.
College Student,5,I like the variety of choices for majors. Campus is beautiful and nice. Things are well and there's help of needed.
College Freshman,5,Academically I got amazing funding from the school. This isn't odd either
College Senior,5,Being an athlete at Beloit has been great for being able to continue participating in multiple sports and getting a great education. The coaches and professors are understanding of the time commitment for both sides of your lifestyle.
College Senior,5,"Security at Beloit is really good. Because we have an alcohol philosophy that encourages adult decision making rather than penalizes students for drinking, people are very comfortable with our security officers. Security officers are mainly around to help students and don't make it their mission to bust people. That said, the rules are enforced so if you have a really loud neighbor or need help, they are responsive."
College Senior,5,Parking is a nonissue at Beloit. Fees are $80.00/ semester and I never have any trouble finding a spot.
College Senior,5,"Beloit has a pretty mellow party scene. There is always fun stuff going on at C-Haus, there are bands there every weekend and there are usually things to do there on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. You can definitely find a party here if that's what you want to do but there is also a lot of other programming if going to a party isn't your thing. Beloit has an alcohol philosophy which is that the campus will treat you like an adult if you act like one. This means that people usually don't get busted for drinking (even if they're underage) unless they are being irresponsible."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus Security is one of the best parts about Beloit. Our Alcohol policy is not underage drinking (<21 years old). However, the philosophy is that if you can drink responsibly and act as an adult, campus security will not reprimand you. I feel this really adds to the campus culture where students are given the responsibility and the choice to use but are held to the highest expectations that they can do so without harming themselves, their academics, or others. Security is only on campus to keep the students safe, and they do a great job!"
College Sophomore,5,"The professors here have obtained the highest degree in their field. They are passionate about their students, as they are their number one focus. What I love about Beloit is I have been able to build relationships with each of my professors, even the ones outside of my majors. They always ask me in passing about my dog and how current semester is going. Office hours are an essential at Beloit and more often than not, professors are willing to meet outside of their office hours if they conflict with your other classes. In other words, it is hard not to succeed at Beloit with all of the support from professors and classmates. Especially in the sciences classes have TA's that have late-night hours if you need any assistance with homework. Individuals peer tutors can be assigned as well through your professor for every department on campus. Beloit really stresses an interdisciplinary approach to education, so there are always a variety of courses offered. This approach aims to assist you post-graduation, when you must approach a task from multiple perspectives in a career."
College Sophomore,5,"Students can choose to live in apartments, town houses, special interest houses, suites, triples, doubles or singles all at a fixed housing price. This makes room selection incredibly easy. When you are coming in as a first year, Beloit takes housing placement seriously with in-depth questionaires about your lifestyle to pair you with a similar roomate and dorm. For returning students, there's a room lottery where seniority is taken into consideration. Overall, housing is a breeze!"
College Freshman,5,Really Greek life is saving me from transferring schools.
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't have gone here hadn't it been for the scholarships.
College Junior,5,There is a variety of everything and all programs are god with good professors.
College Junior,5,I'm in a sorority and it's been a great experience. The ladies take pride in academics and are active participants in clubs/organizations and the community. All Greeks have their own housing with a varying amount of people living in the house. The outside views are scattered about the feelings.
College Junior,5,"Couldn't have gone here without all the scholarship money. Talk to the financial aid, and they'll work with you"
College Sophomore,5,Beloit is great!! Best decision of my life!
College Sophomore,5,"Academics at Beloit are incredible. There are endless opportunities, so don't pass them up! The workload keeps me busy. Professors specialize in teaching and mentorship. Anthro is the biggest major on campus. It also has the most funding of all the majors."
College Sophomore,5,"BELOIT ANTHRO ROCKS!!!!!! We pat ourselves on the back too much for being ""the best."" We like to brag. Regardless the professors are amazing teachers and mentors and I'm so glad I found a home in the dept. There are endless opportunities if you seek them! The work load is manageable (watch out for Rob Lafleur, however) and the classes are interesting. Rob's classes are thought by some to be more work-heavy than graduate courses at Princeton. Do your reading, because professors value participation highly when they grade."
College Sophomore,5,There are no obstacles with declaring. All you need to do is get a few signatures and BAM. Some departments also give gifts. Anthro gives bags.
College Junior,5,"I'm very happy with Beloit academically.  I truly feel enriched for my education here.  Not only have I learned a lot in my three years here, but I feel Beloit has succeeded in the liberal arts goal of teaching me ""how to think.""  I don't mean that in an indoctrinating, brainwashing sense--I mean that I've gained so much in critical thinking abilities, and I have a great background for approaching problems.  I'm flourishing in my studies here, and I'm really enjoying it.  It's very easy to get into the classes you want, and classes are consistently engaging and interesting.  Beloit's a great place for taking classes in fields outside your major, too.  I find all of the classroom environments to be intellectually stimulating and welcoming.  The workload is substantial, but not at all unmanageable--and quite frankly you can get by just fine without doing a lot of the assigned work (ie readings), you just won't gain as much from the class.  Class sizes are mostly quite manageable and cozy, and I've never been in a class with more than 30 students.  (Popular intro level classes are often in the 20-30 range.)  Finally, I love the professors at Beloit.  They're very smart, very knowledgeable (those are not necessarily the same), and very good professors across the board, and since we're such a small school, it's very easy to form a relationship with them.  I've had drinks with several of the faculty in my department, and I've been in a few of their houses.  Funnily enough, the professors I'd heard the most about before I came here were the ones I was least impressed with.  But in my whole time here, I've only encountered one professor I wouldn't rate highly."
College Junior,5,Beloit treats you like an adult.  You can do as you please as long as you are being responsible and not harming anyone
College Junior,5,My academic experience has been great throughout.
Alum,4,"I was in my last semester when my classes were transferred to online due the COVID-19 pandemic. It was definitely an adjustment but the professors were extremely understanding and did their best to deliver a ""normal"" class over zoom. All homework and assignments were completed as always, so it did not feel like more work."
Junior,4,I've been really happy to call Beloit College home for the past three years. The professors are incredible and there are plenty of opportunities to put my Biochemistry major into practice. Not to mention that campus is incredibly beautiful especially in the fall.
Junior,4,Overall I think Beloit College has done a great job with the switch to online learning. Professors are extremely understanding and willing to work with students that may be struggling with it.
Sophomore,4,"My first year was very exciting and eventful, I enjoy having a diverse campus and I enjoy seeing new faces. The school is nice and the professors are very professional and love doing what they do. Great amount of resources are available throughout the campus, and I'd suggest you use all of them if needed."
Junior,4,I love the culture here but the administration is greedy and doesn’t really care about the students as much as their salaries.
Sophomore,4,"Itś all about the student body that is great about the school. The majority understand that without each other, everything will fall through. There is help from some faculty members as well."
Niche User,4,"I went on a visit for the soccer and softball team and I absolutely loved it. I was there for 2 days and I wish I could've stayed longer. I thought that academics wise, each class I went to the teachers ""give the mic"" to students a lot more, giving students a voice rather than high school where teachers do all the talking. From what I saw personally and also heard from other students is that counseling helps a lot when helping pave your own specific paths for your future. I could really go on and on but, I'll close with this, I really loved the sense of community and ""family"" feeling where everyone feels welcomed and everyone including teachers, counselors, t.a.'s, students, and teammates actually care."
Freshman,4,"Beloit is a nice, small school located in southern Wisconsin. Students are really friendly here, food is decent, diversity is pretty high, and professors are great!"
Freshman,4,"As a first year, it has been hard to get used to a different atmosphere. It is very hard to find a job that fits my schedule. But other than that Beloit has been a great transition."
Sophomore,4,"Beloit College has been a great experience so far. The school itself is small and comfortable for me personally, there is not much around  it. Teacher's are very helpful and do they're best to help as best as they can. Social setting is very nice as well people associating with each other, nonjudgmental, and friendly."
Alum,4,"Beloit loves independent thinkers and independent doers. If you are independent, or wish to become independent, this is the place for you."
Freshman,4,"I love the vibe! From the moment I stepped on to campus I felt at home. It's a very inclusive, it's interactive and it gives you the tools you need to succeed."
Freshman,4,Small classes make the learning environment easier. Small classses allow for a good relationship with professors and classmates.
Niche User,4,"I just got accepted to Beloit College in December, and it is one of my top choices as of now. As far as I have researched, Beloit looks really nice and small, which is the setting I like a lot. I would rather be in a small setting where I can receive much more help from the professors rather than being 1 out of 400 students in the classroom."
Junior,4,"Beloit is a place for the individual, it's full of interesting, quirky people with a lot of interesting ideas and the faculty help to facilitate that. It is in a small town so that vibe can throw people off if that's not your thing, but if that's not a problem and you want to be somewhere with excellent people and an even more excellent faculty then Beloit is an excellent choice. beware the administration though, they can be frustrating at best to deal with."
Freshman,4,I am friends with the majority of people on campus and I love them all. It is definitely the people who I enjoy the most on campus they make it all worth it.
Senior,4,"Beloit College is a place where your professors know you and care about you as more than just a student, and I love that. I love the small class sizes as well. Lots of discussion based classes, which is great, but I do feel that professors tend to rely to heavily on them. The community is close, but can be unforgiving."
Sophomore,4,"I love Beloit, I would never dream of attending another school. However, the food in commons is awful and there has been way too little accountability for rapists and people who commit hate crimes."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere from the office workers in all buildings. What I don't like is the overfunding of sports programs and the underfunding of high achieving students.
Freshman,4,"Beloit is really good in the academic field and there are many support systems here on campus. Overall, it is a good campus however they can improve on security, also this campus isn't really a party campus so if you're really into an academic, chill place to go... This place is for you"
Junior,4,"I like the people at Beloit- it is a very liberal place. Yet the community is very white and privileged- its surrounding community is a high poverty area and students do not really like to engage with it. The content of courses and readings the college expose you to are high quality in my opinion. Beloit is just lacking on the diversity- but this can be expected from a private institution that charged 55,000 dollars a year for tuition. But I should add that their financial aid is helpful, even though it's still not enough for me to comfortably attend school here."
College Senior,4,Best parties are at the special interest houses and at the wall. There are usually parties hosted by some campus organization or house just about every weekend.
College Senior,4,"Parties are generally small but fun. The on-campus bar is usually hopping, as is the ""wall"". Downtown is extremely close, and there are a few pretty decent bars down there as well."
College Senior,4,"Lots of students from a lot of different backgrounds. This makes for an interesting campus culture and some challenging moments as well (we have students who are very liberal, and also some who are quite conservative)."
College Senior,4,"Administration is relatively lenient about alcohol usage, provided that you're drinking responsibly and acting like an adult. They're much stricter regarding drug usage."
College Senior,4,"Beloit Security is very friendly and approachable. The student RAs are well trained and responsible. Administration takes sexual assault on campus very seriously, and all incoming students are required to learn about and discuss issues surrounding sexual harassment and assault upon arriving at campus. Downtown Beloit is generally safe as well."
College Senior,4,Greek life here isn't like you'd imagine it at larger institutions. Most of their events are open to the entire campus without any cover charge or anything like that. Most organizations are very welcoming to the student body. The fraternities here are making impressive efforts to be leaders in combatting sexual assault both on our campus and across the country.
College Senior,4,"The athletic programs here are relatively small, but have really developed and become competitive in the three years that I've been here. There are usually a good amount of students attending every game. The homecoming games are quite popular. I play intramural and club sports at Beloit, which are very popular options with both students and faculty members! Sports facilities are good enough."
College Senior,4,"For me, I think that our Liberal Arts in Practice office (Career Center) is very helpful. They do a great job of helping to point  you in the right direction to find jobs and internships."
College Senior,4,"We have 37 different housing options which include special interest houses for different clubs and organizations that are actual houses, and three apartment style living choices. We also have a wide variety of different dorm style living as well, and each I like to say has their own special personality. We have buildings that were built more recently and ones built in 1964, so it's not easy to sort of rank them all the same or talk about them all together in a general sort of way."
College Senior,4,"I am in a sorority and have really enjoyed being a part of it on this campus. The experience is very different then what you would have at a larger school. We are a lot more community, campus, and academically focused here. We also have to sign a no hazing form so we can't make people do, ingest, or participate in anything that they don't want to. The ""rush"" process is pretty laid back and I would describe it as a series of open houses with different activities to see if you want to spend four years hanging out with us. The parties we throw are different than at  other schools too, because all parties have to be registered with security and are alcohol free. So they are just a really great time to go out and dance, socialize, and hang out with your friends."
College Sophomore,4,"Though campus is small, it does feel like a community. There are a variety of options for housing. The special interest houses are built around campus clubs and are cozy and numerous. Each dorm has a personality and are they differ in cleanliness. Aldrich for example could be comparable to a hotel, Peet to a grungy artist collective."
College Sophomore,4,"This year I joined Theta Pi Gamma because the girls I met who were involved with Theta were some of the most involved and engaged students I met on campus. After being on campus for one semester I realized that the students who I looked up to, 9/10 of them were in Theta. They stood apart from the rest of campus as students fighting for campus equality, sustainability and overall cooperation. As a whole, because Beloit students are so unique, Greek life is generally not your typical Greek life situation. The communities are accepting of students of all race, sexual orientation, gender identity and nationality, and there is a large emphasis on being safe regarding parties and alcohol consumption."
College Sophomore,4,"Thus far at Beloit, I have yet to have a professor that I couldn't learn from. I haven't liked all of my professors, but I have managed to learn in every class regardless. A few professors I feel very connected to and I count them among my friends. The courses themselves have challenged me, and I know that I will only be more challenged in the coming years."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe a degree from Beloit is very valuable. The school has a good academic reputation, and when I begin seriously searching for scholarships and job opportunities I expect that the college will do everything it can to help me be successful."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus. Few crimes have been committed in the past year that I've been there. We have police boxes, but there don't seem to be that many. Sexual assault is a problem to a lesser degree than it is on many college campuses, and I do find it hard to judge our administration/policies on these things because I haven't had first-hand accounts of how these crimes are handled."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the Greek life on campus has a positive affect on our college community. Greek life isn't huge here, which makes it much more comfortable for Greeks and non-Greeks to interact. Being Greek isn't a huge deal unless you make it one. I thought about joining a sorority, but I didn't want to put out the money, especially when I can go to Greek parties and have tons of Greek friends without joining."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Beloit. I have only attended for one year, but already I feel like I have learned so much, in classes for my intended major, and in other non-major classes. It wasn't my first-choice school, but I don't doubt that I can and will be successful with a Beloit education. The liberal arts atmosphere really appeals to me and the small school gives me an opportunity to play sports  and be active in other events as well."
College Student,4,Parties are a great way of socialising here.
College Student,4,"Everything is great, party or no!"
College Student,4,It's good enough and safe.
College Student,4,It's great as there are around 20 housing choices and the campus is beautiful!
College Student,4,I am not into sports but here sports seems to be very engaging and fun. It's overall pretty much dynamic!
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes tend to be small (less than 25 people, and most times, less than 20). Teachers are all different, but tend to be reasonable with their expectations. They are mostly approachable and willing to help. I've enjoyed my classes so far. However, the variety is limited but still satisfactory."
College Freshman,4,LAPC is a part of the campus that only handles internships and life after Beloit. They are very helpful. They can connect with our huge alumni network (Beloit College is the oldest school in WI) and the alums tend to reach out and be helpful. LAPC plans days in Madison and Chicago to meet alums and seek out possible job opportunities. They also give out money to fund student projects and internships. They will help you write a resume and put together your portfolio.
College Freshman,4,"The buildings are pretty old but clean. The rooms have minors spots or marks but it's not a big problem. There are substance free dorms, townhouses for seniors and plenty of special interests housing which is neat. The campus is small so everything is very close. Some dorms have rooms with sinks, other dorms are more spacious than others. Most of them have clean bathrooms and floors. I have never applied for another dorm before, so I don't know how it works. I reall like the social atmosphere. Though there may be conflicts with roommates, people tend to respect quiet hours, the dorms and such. It's pretty easy to work out a problem in a dorm. Money-wise, it's better to buy your own microwave and mini fridge; it ends up being cheaper than renting it from the dorm."
College Freshman,4,"Being Greek or non-Greek doesn't change much on campus. Though Greeks look for new recruits, there is no pressure to join. For a small campus, we still have 3 fraternities and 3 sororities. They seem like nice houses and they are all located on the same street, in the middle of campus. Greek houses tend to throw good parties. I like the Greek life on campus, even though I am not interesting in joining."
College Freshman,4,"I am satisfied with Beloit College because the student community is open-minded and eager to learn about new cultures. Academically, I have been quite happy with my classes. Though the class selection can be narrow, there is enough to not get over-whelmed when selecting classes. Moreover, there are many clubs on campus, which is surprising given Beloit's size. I find the environment there friendly, pretty safe and relaxed. The financial aid package that many of my peers received is also a big help. The cons of the campus is the size. Though you can get from one end to another in ten minutes, you can get quite bored. It's also a small student body, so you get to know everyone. Personally, I really like it. The mindset of people is compatible with mine and the academics/work environment matches my way of studying and learning. I would pick Beloit again, even though it wasn't my first choice at first."
College Freshman,4,"Security is there, when you don't need them. They pop out of nowhere anytime of day ?"
College Freshman,4,"They always come back, seriously they're graduating seniors still roaming the campus."
College Freshman,4,Everyone respects each other on our floor.
College Freshman,4,They literally sent me something in my mailbox & asked if I would join.
College Freshman,4,"So far, my experience in college has been great. I'm going to school far away from home, and everyday I am surprised to learn how many students there are that also are away from home. I feel very comfortable in the atmosphere here on campus and I continue to meet various types of people everyday."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not a huge party person and you don't have to be here. If I want to go out, I can. Drinking is usually apart of the culture, though it doesn't have to be. We believe in learning how to respectful and mature with alcohol (the school can think of us as adults). Sometimes the parties just aren't packed. It can get pretty cold in the winter and there is a lot of private room parties"
College Freshman,4,"Some of the dorms are fairly old. One of the freshman only dorms, 609 Emerson, has extremely small rooms and no AC. Special interest housing is great and you can live in any of the club houses starting second semester. The houses are also on campus."
College Junior,4,Decent number of grant and funding options additional to scholarship for research and internships.
College Junior,4,"It's fun, a lot of music concerts and open-mic nights in C-Haus."
College Junior,4,"Commons offers a lot of variety, but sometimes I wish they had more fish options. The meal plan in general is inconvenient for Sunday dinner and cafeteria have weird hours."
College Sophomore,4,"The administration isn't here to make your life choices for you. Beloit College respects the fact that you are an adult and make your own choices, especially in regards to alcohol."
College Sophomore,4,"Beloit College makes sure that it meets most of your financial aid needs, don't let the sticker price fool you. I don't even pay half the sticker price."
Junior,2,I had to take my classes online and it was hard to engage with them. Some professors were even worse online than in person.
Alum,2,"The hypocrisy of the campus community at Beloit was bad 15 years ago, but now it’s out of control.  Fair warning, if you are not liberal/left, you will be alienated and harassed by the campus community.  

I was also an educational major.  The department advisors were all dysfunctional and disliked each other, so communication was horrendous.  So bad that they forgot to make my student teaching placement for the following semester.  I was forced to drop my education major ( I was a double major) in order to graduate on time.  I ended up having to threaten legal action...two years after I graduated, I finally got my teaching certificate.

I grew up around the college and still live near by.  As an alumnus, I can’t recommend Beloit College due to my horrible experience, and the terrible campus culture."
Senior,2,"Beloit is a great academic institution - the professors are well-informed, innovative, and inspiring (even when they have detestable personal traits). The students are smart, at least those who have not been affected by the horrible campus culture. Classes are small and often quiet, a lot of people don't make it through the classes because they refuse to participate or show up. A very clique-y school. If you've been there for all four years you'll know your place, but if you arrive in the middle you just kind of float through. School likes to sell students as 'unique' and 'quirky' but a lot of people have untreated mental illnesses that are not made better by the school's lack of regard and general dour atmosphere. The administration is disorganized and unhelpful. The campus is super old. A good place to learn, a bad place to live."
Junior,2,"Beloit College has its faults, but some of the people here make it better. I feel Beloit needs to be more diverse and they need new administration. The people here are racist and they do not have proper protocols to handle hate crimes properly. Admin is very unorganized and isn't very inclusive to black students."
Alum,2,"Beloit College is in a really small town where there isn't much to do. Beloit has a somewhat toxic atmosphere where a lot of people are depressed and upset with the administration. Admin often fails to act promptly when it comes to hate crimes, dorm quality and fails to listen to the voice of the students. The food at commons is subpar. If you're looking for a party school this is not it. Beloit is a laid back school. Most parties consist of small kickbacks and occasionally there are greek life parties but they aren't huge. 

The only other great thing about Beloit are the professors. With small classes sizes, you get the chance to build a close relationship.

Overall Beloit is the place for you're ok with the following
-Small town's
-PWI
-No school spirit
-Bad food
-C+ party scene
-Ok with the occasional hate crime
-Snow
-Mediocre athletics
-Small greek presence"
College Sophomore,2,"The struggle that athletics have is how divided campus can be when it comes to sports. It can feel like there is kind of two different schools existing in the same spot at times, a school for athletes and a school for more alternative students. This can be frustrating for both sides and at times feels juvenile."
College Sophomore,2,"If you're an athlete, you will be on a throne by the administration. If you're not an athlete, be prepared to watch student-athletes get things handed to them."
College Freshman,2,"We are starting to get more restaurants each month in the posh downtown area. It is a beautiful walk along the river to get there (though you can take other ways). There has been some issues with street verbal harassment in the area though. There are really only three places Bushall and Pecks (great, organic, local), Cafe Formage (some food, great cheese and deserts, great to do homework), and the new Lucy's Burgers (chick, new, great burgers). There are some amazing ice cream shops too."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms kind of suck, mine has no air conditioning is a tiny double with a hole in the floor, totally freshman housing. On the bright side it has a nice lounge always full of people who don't spend much time in their rooms because they're so awful."
College Sophomore,2,"You need to be a part of a group of people and have your own little private parties. The party scene is pretty bad, it's boring. Personally, I don't like it. I would prefer hanging with my friends doing our own thing."
College Sophomore,2,They lost my papers. That's all I can say.
College Freshman,2,Food in DK's is a'lright
College Freshman,2,"If you want a relationship, don't come here"
College Freshman,2,I honestly don't know how the hell Beloit hasn't burned down already. The admin does hardly anything.
College Junior,2,Commons rarely has something to be excited about. Most food decent at best.
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus dining in Beloit isn't great, but off-campus dining in Janesville, WI, or Rockton or Rockford, offers a lot more choice. Student discounts abound, but it's hard to get to a lot of places without a car. Bushell and Peck's is a great local option, although somewhat pricey. There are several really good restaurants on the same street as the campus bookstore, but other than that it's a lot of chains."
College Junior,2,Academic side is within walking distance. Public transportation is nonexistent but the college offers shuttles on Wed/Sun for errands.
College Sophomore,2,"Ok, I'm hard to please because I'm vegetarian AND I can't eat carbs for medical reasons. Typically I end up scraping the cheese off pizza. I would make a sandwich, but I can't eat the bread or meat. The veggie soups are usually gross. They stopped making the specialty salads that I used to love!! Tacos EVERY Tuesday, lots of carbs and starch, etc. Not happy without my blue cheese salad and dressing!"
College Sophomore,2,"If you come here, know that it will get well below zero here in the winter! And they don't cancel class when it does!"
College Junior,2,"The food situation in Beloit itself is pretty dismal, but you can get all the basics delivered (sandwiches, pizza, Chinese, etc) and there's truly some great, authentic, and super cheap Mexican food around if you look for it!  (But I'm going to make you look for it.)  There's also a much wider variety of options if you widen your search to South Beloit, and if you have a car, there's plenty to eat in Janesville, which isn't that far away."
College Junior,2,"My experience here is skewed--there are meal plans that allow you to eat a large portion of your meals at the eateries on academic side, but I have the meal plan that limits you to Commons, the cafeteria on residential side.  Commons is okay if you don't eat there too often, but if you eat there frequently you quickly realize how abysmal it is.  There is the illusion of variety in food choices, but it's very difficult to eat healthily due to the sheer quantity of fried food and the fact that often most of the dishes they serve are carb-based.  But more importantly, the food and the service is terrible.  Beloit outsourced the food service to Bon Appetit, and we are getting corporately screwed.  The staff is so poorly compensated and so poorly managed that they clearly don't give a crap about the quality of their work, and many of them seem to outright resent us students.  (But I worked at Commons my freshman year, so I totally understand their resentment.  College students are barbarians.)  But my peers who eat regularly on academic side all report a much higher satisfaction with our food service than I have!"
College Junior,2,Not really an issue if you have a car or know someone who does.  For breaks there are vans between campus and the bus station.
College Sophomore,2,"Few students choose to live off campus, and if they do, they select from a few previously student-owned homes nearby. It is not unusual to live on campus all four years."
College Junior,2,Beloit prides itself on being one of the few schools with the highest amount of study abroad opportunities for students so students for the most part are pretty open to people of other backgrounds. But the school itself remains predominantly white. But recently the school in an attempt to become more diverse has admitted more students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. We aren't where we want to be with diversity on campus but i believe we're working towards it.
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have campus wide wi-fi and the internet is still pretty slow, though slowly but surely they've been increasing the speed each semester. Academic side has wi-fi but residential side does not so you will need to plug into the wall of buy a wireless adapter (pretty cheap, probably worth it). That's the big complaint.

There's free printing (black and white only) and scanning in the library (and anywhere else on campus with those things, like the computer labs in the basements of Pearson and Chapin) though there's a queue right before classes and one of the printers is inevitably not working so take a look at the printer before even getting on a computer, as they'll be a sign on it or a message if it's not working. You could get your own printer but unless you live off campus or like to print things at 2 am (the library is not open 24/7, does not have the best hours) it's really not worth it or necessary. Other than that, there's also computer access in the library and other computer labs on campus though it is certainly more convenient to have your own computer."
College Junior,2,"Beloit is greenwashing central, a lot more money is spent on the image of sustainability than sustainability itself. Residential Life and physical plant sometimes behave like a slumlord, not to disgusting inner city levels, but for a liberal arts college, they can seem kind of scummy."
College Junior,2,"Major: Computer Science

I came to beloit for personal development, not professional development. If I wanted to ""break into the industry"" or learn the skills needed to succeed in tech, I might not have chosen beloit, and if I had, I might have transferred. The CS department, professors, and classes are fantastically uninspiring the majority of the time, and in class, I often simply stop listening because I either already understand what is being droned on about, or I simply don't care because the subject was only applicable 10 years ago. 

Don't come to Beloit and major in computer science unless you already know how to program very well, and you just want to come to college and hang out."
College Senior,2,You are not allowed to live off campus unless you are a senior. At that point there are a large number of options for apartments and houses near the college.
College Sophomore,2,"Beloit is a cool quirky city, and still has not completely moved away from it's traditional working class roots. This means that there are fun festivals at Riverside Park when it's warm and live music and great coffee. There's a great farmer's market in the summer. It also means that you can walk through downtown in a matter of minutes. There is a perceived divide between the locals and the school but in general relations are pretty good."
College Sophomore,2,"Beloit, the city, is pretty small and isolated from the College. It's called the 'Beloit Bubble' for a reason. But other than that, it is fairly accessible to larger cities like Madison/Milwaukee/Chicago so living in such a small town is not necessarily isolated from that kind of lifestyle. There are some nice outdoors areas although I find the shopping (whether for groceries, clothes, etc.) to be lacking but Janesville and Machesney Park are both bigger cities not too far away (about 15 min). If you're used to living in a small city, it's pretty average, if you're trying to compare Beloit to a larger city, it'll naturally come up short. There is a certain charm to the area but it does have its problems much like every other city in the country. Overall, it really depends why you are in Beloit and what you are looking for, personally, as a college student who doesn't necessarily need to ever leave campus, I still like to leave campus and go into the city. The farmer's market is nice and so is the general downtown area. It's a city worth getting to know and involved with, which, unfortunately, most students don't care to do and those who do might find it hard to achieve, though not impossible."
College Junior,2,"Going places in Beloit without a car can be a challenge.  There are college-run shuttles to Walmart, the Convenient (health) Care center, etc., and most students will have at least one friends with a car, as Beloit draws a number of its students from the Midwest.  Parking can be an issue, but is never so bad that you can't find a spot within a block of the lot.  Plus, since Beloit is not a commuter campus, students do not drive to get to class."
College Junior,2,"People who play sports like them, but everybody else couldn't care less. WAY more people care about ultimate than anything else. Nobody cares about football, basketball, etc. except to rip on athletes for being clique-y."
College Freshman,2,"Each frat and sorority is known for its own personality, I'd say. I haven't personally noticed a ton of judgment passed on people for being or not being in a sorority. I'm giving Greek Life a C for people who care about Greek life because it's not really a big part of campus life here. But I like that. They host a lot of the parties though, which anyone can go to, and the houses aren't bad. I've gotten free baked goods from sorority girls talking about their sorority...of course, I wouldn't join, but the food was nice."
College Freshman,2,"There are some off-campus housing options through the school, but these can't be obtained until senior year. I think living on campus furthers your experience all-together"
College Sophomore,2,"They Exist – 3 frats and 3 sororities. Greek life exists, but they sure as hell don't control social life. They throw parties and host events, but no one will treat you differently for being non-greek."
College Freshman,2,"Everything Goes – For someone who doesn't mind drunk student puking everywhere and wants to be as drunk as possible every night of the week, Beloit is for you. The security don't care what you do, and you often see drunk people talking to them. At first, I thought I would like this, but sometimes it's overkill. Sometimes, I would like a night where I don't see people doing a naked bell run on a Tuesday at two in the morning. But hey, that's just me."
College Freshman,2,"It's not very good. There's definitely a place for whatever you're craving (almost).  There's really good soul food and Denali's has really good burgers and veggie burgers, but it's not entirely impressive."
College Sophomore,2,"Not That Important – People will show up to support their friends. For the most part, athletics are second priority to academics."
College Freshman,2,"Outside of ""The Bubble&quot – Besides a few bars, restaurants, shops, and the weekend market downtown, the surrounding area isn't all that happening.  Students mainly stay on campus because there is rarely much of anything going on close to campus.  Downtown is within a few blocks of the college and is easily accessible.  During the summer, there are more events that happen within the community and seem to be more available to students.  There have been more and more attempts recently to get students involved in the community and vise-versa.  Beloit is not a typical college town, at all."
College Senior,2,"Semi Safe – Beloit's campus usually feels safe, and the town of Beloit feels safe during the day time.

Last year a townie pulled a gun on a student, and earlier this year a student was stabbed while walking off campus at night."
Sophomore,1,"Pros about Beloit: 
Small campus, really get to know people.
Fairly large dorm rooms.
Small classes.

Cons about Beloit:
The city of Beloit is boring, need a car and to drive a while to do anything fun
Because of this most students spend free time drinking or smoking (could be pro...)
The school if having financial issues, laying off teachers and staff
If you're not part of a sport you may feel left out socially 
Really really bad food
Expensive school , especially considering location and average income of graduates 
Very singular mindset on campus, if you appear to be a little ignorance of anything you may be called not ""woke enough"" instead of being taught..."
College Sophomore,1,"The party scene at the fraternities on campus in very unsafe. Beloit has a reputation for sexual assaults and rapes at parties even though it's a ""small, friendly school"". If you're a girl, don't go. Sorority parties happen rarely and usually aren't great."
College Freshman,1,Really the party scene here is a load of crap. The girls get all dressed up just so they can pick a guy of the night at whatever party they go to. Otherwise everyone just chills and drinks.
College Junior,1,"Taxis are a great here in Beloit, however beyond that, transportation can be a challenge.  If neither you nor your friend has a car, getting to places like the movie theatre can be a challenge.  That said, there are shuttles that go from campus to Walmart and to the Convenient (health) Care clinic.  However, beware - the shuttles going to Convenient Care are few and far between, so you will have to miss class if you need to go."
College Sophomore,1,"if you are an average guy this is a great place to come and get laid, if you are an attractive girl...lower your standards. "
College Freshman,1,"Overall, there is really nothing to do at Beloit. I hear students say it all the time, I guess you have to really like the school if you're going to come here."
College Freshman,1,"Living in a Bubble – Living at Beloit College is like living in a bubble. Students very rarely leave the campus, and when they do it's always with other students from the College. The farthest away they wander is to downtown which is where our bookstore is located. If you want fresh groceries, you have to wait until a Wednesday night when the college buses students to Wal-Mart. Otherwise, you're out of luck."
College Sophomore,1,Night life kindof sucks but you can easily meet new people.
College Freshman,1,A little too much for me – People here party and drink a lot...pretty much the only thing to do on weekends is get drunk. There is a lot of recreational drug use- mostly marijuana. A certain number of kids by Rx drugs illegally
College Freshman,1,"A Lot of Drinking on Campus, Not Much Else Off Campus – People here looove to party...a little bit too much. But there's very little to do outside of campus after dark- most places in town close by 8pm, and a lot of places are closed on weekends"
College Freshman,1,"The food here is greasy and salty at best, and disgusting at worst."
College Freshman,1,There is so much alcohol on campus and parties all the time. For someone who doesn't drink I wish there was a strickter policy and that campus security would do more about it.
College Sophomore,1,"Basically a Non-Option – Off-campus housing is pretty much impossible, and hardly any students do it. Affordable housing would only be in a neighborhood unsafe for students, and decent housing is too far from campus and too expensive."

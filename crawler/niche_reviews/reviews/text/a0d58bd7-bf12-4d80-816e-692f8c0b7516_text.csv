Freshman,5,I absolutely love Texas Tech! The students are all amazing and dorm life is so much fun. I also think Tech has done a great job at having as many covid friendly activities as possible so that we can still have a somewhat normal college experience.
Sophomore,5,I am personally enrolled as an undergraduate and Texas Tech is my dream college and more. I have enjoyed and loved every moment and will continue to do so.
Sophomore,5,During the pandemic our professors have been extremely patience and helpful. Keeping us up to date on assignments and classes.
Junior,5,My online experience was great it actually gives me more time to study the material and the professors are very nice.
Alum,5,"As a Red Raider alum with a daughter currently attending TTU, I rate my experience as 5 star.  Beautiful campus, easily accessible, top-notch classes and instructors."
Junior,5,My experience being a red raider has been incredible. The student life was fantastic during my first semester and the faculty really cares for their students. I have built better relationships with my professors than the teachers I have had in high school .  Living on campus I felt safe and was close to all of my classes. The advising at my college really connected with the students and the student life was thriving before covid. Tech has really made an effort in protecting their students and staff this semester and I cant wait to be able to take classes on campus again.
Graduate Student,5,"Great University. Good chances to get a job after graduation. Texas Tech has a Great reputation on the job market. You attend a lot of cool parties and meet a lot of people. Living is pretty cheap in Lubbock and there is almost never any traffic around school. Texas Tech has an amazing Engineering program and the rating keeps going up. They provide labs for a lo of experiments. You can have a lot of scholarship opportunities. For graduate students, you can apply to be a graduate assistant or teaching assistant and that will cover most of your tuition. Great school overall."
Senior,5,I have taken a couple of classes online during the summer and this semester. It is good. We use Zoom for online classes. The connection is good and the lectures are fluid.
Sophomore,5,I am currently a student at Tech and cannot imagine being anywhere else. Student life is great. So many opportunities as a student.
Junior,5,"Texas Tech University is amazing! Very friendly people, amazing party scene, insane bang-for-your-buck, and great professors. BEAUTIFUL campus."
Alum,5,"I took 1 or 2 online classes at Tech. The delivery was awesome.  The professors were great. Overall, it was a great experience but online class can not replace in person lectures."
Alum,5,The greatest place on earth. Texas Tech University is a place where the boy become men. It provided the framework for my career and set me on a path to success.
Freshman,5,Great campus and teachers.  First semester here and I love everything about this campus so far.  The student union and rec center are very clean and nice.
Freshman,5,I have some hybrid classes that have gone very well.  The professors are prepared and the zoom calls have not had any issues.
Alum,5,Every professor knew how to use the online services. It was easy to navigate and did not glitch (even if I was turning in assignments at 11:59). No complaints.
Alum,5,"No down side really. Classes, professors, advisors, and campus were all great. Good education for the price. The rec center is top notch and there are social events for just about anyone. The food is also great, and can be found all over campus."
Freshman,5,Due to the covid 19 pandemic I had all of my classes online except for 2 face to face courses. The professors are always there to help you and are available and responds back fast. They are very helpful and  considerate with trying to understand the work and keep their students on track.
Freshman,5,"I like what Texas Tech has to offer. It is a beautiful campus and cannot wait to spend my undergraduate years at this university. I also love the quality of the academic and organization part of it, its not too large but no too small."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful with very nice facility. The engineering program I am in is higher revered and I am learning a lot in a fun a diverse environment.
Freshman,5,The learning experience has been very good with quality teachers who are passionate about the subjects they teach.
Junior,5,"The only experience I have with TTU online classes is recently last semester with the covid-19 change. We went from face-to-face in the middle of spring semester to online and specifically for my major, i found them at first very strange, but once a routine is set it is much easier to handle. The professors were amazing about how they handle online work. It wasn't anything new and just a continuation of where we left off. Although, some classes were very difficult to understand because the directions were not clear."
Junior,5,"i did have to take online classes due to the pandemic and while many teachers were worried about the shift, they were willing to make it and adapt their plans to better fit the situation.  They also kept an open dialog with the situation so that they understood what was working, what worries we had, and what all of our situations were."
Graduate Student,5,"Very student oriented, very caring about how students perform and how they are taken care of. There are so many job opportunities Tech has  for when students graduate"
Sophomore,5,I’m expecting a great year even thought it will be a lot different than what I anticipated. The precautions are top notch so far and can’t wait to see what the rest of the year holds
Sophomore,5,This will be my first year as a transfer and I’m already loving it! I will be 100% online but the proffesors have already reached out and made it so great
Senior,5,I love the traditions and the community. Everyone is so welcoming and willing to help. there is something and someone for everyone at texas tech.
Junior,5,"Great college to attend especially if you love sports, the games are packed elbow to elbow and everyone is loud and on their feet for majority of the games. A lot of places you can go to for help in any class or subject."
Junior,5,"Online learning was very new to me because I have never done it, but the professors made it really easy for us to transition from in person to online due to COVID-19."
Senior,5,"Arriving at Texas Tech was intimidating at first but the campus was absolutely beautiful. After attending just my first semester, I knew I picked the right school. The classes and professors were great, and there are so many resources available to every single student. The library was my favorite place to study in as they had tons of private rooms you could reserve. Not only that, but attending all the sport events was my favorite! It was all such a great college experience and I know if you step foot on campus you’ll immediately see what it’s all about."
Sophomore,5,"Learning online can be a very difficult thing to accumulate to, but the extra week break and the around the clock work and dedication for professors to make the transition easier was extremely amazing."
Sophomore,5,"Texas Tech has been my dream school since age eight and finally attending was a dream come true. Campus life is amazing and everyone is the nicest. Lubbock is beautiful as well, if you like West Texas."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Texas Tech! I love the diversity and inclusivity the campus has, and I also love how many majors and degrees someone can pursue here. I admire the care and drive the professors have here, and I love how understanding they have been throughout the online transition. The atmosphere of game days on campus are unbeatable, and every sport here has the respect and support from students. I do not regret my decision of choosing Texas Tech!"
Sophomore,5,I have not taken an online course with Texas Tech besides during covid. My experience was amazing and all of the professors made things very easy to use.
Sophomore,5,I love my college so much! I am so happy with how the have handled covid and made such a huge effort for the campus to be safe for all students.
Junior,5,I have had no problems so far when the classes got switched online due to COVID the Univeristy was helpful in offering aid to students that where in need. Texas Tech made the transition smooth and the professors where more than willing to offer more help after the change to online classes
Alum,5,I have had a good college experience there. Faculty members were always ready to help with anything and send you to the right person when they could not help. I also met great people there.
Sophomore,5,The art program is outstanding with top of the line studios. Most people are friendly and supportive. Great campus with clean facilities.
Sophomore,5,The communication is great with professors and they give simple instructions for classes. As long as you do the reading and watch the videos you'll do just fine.
Sophomore,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on campus and have developed some of the best relationships with other students and my professors.
Sophomore,5,"It was easy to accommodate to and I kind of enjoyed it. I think it's up to how the teachers go about it, like reminding and posting ahead of time. But it's up to you to remember what you need to do and to keep up with things. I think it was easier to deal with than lecture classes."
Sophomore,5,"Very nice and prestigious university. Students are friendly, classes are strong and many resources are provided within the school."
Alum,5,I LOVED every minute at TTU. I feel like I received a top notch education that I can pass on to my students!
Junior,5,"Taking classes in person or on online, it is like the same thing. Both ways make us feel at home, with enough instruction to understand and retain all and any information. I haven't taken to many online classes, but the one's i have taken were fabulous, and i would do it all over again."
Junior,5,"My college has made me into a wonderful young lady. Tech has brought me so many new talents than what i had before and i will be forever grateful. It makes the college experience so much better than i thought it would have been. I'm so glad i choose Tech, and if your'e considering it, please, please, please, become a Raider!"
Junior,5,I had nothing but fun when visiting Texas Tech and can not wait to move in this fall with them. I know that I have far more amazing experiences to come in the future and meet even more amazing people.
Junior,5,"I am taking online classes and it does require a lot of hard work. You must be responsible on getting your work turned in and done properly. There are no free passes so it is on the student to stay focus on the goal and to make sure that they are headed in the right direction. Nothing worth having comes easy so if you do succeed it makes it that much more worth it,"
Sophomore,5,"The transition to online learning was not as hard as I expected it to be. I had already been taking online classes before the transition which had made the experience a little easier. Of course class timelines were changed and everything felt a little rushed but the university itself has no control over professors changing due dates or pushing everything together, everything was handled quite gracefully."
Sophomore,5,"I have enjoyed my first semester-and-a-half of college at Texas Tech University.  Within just a few months, I have made good friends, bonded with professors and teachers, and most importantly, expanded my knowledge of my studies. I am a music major focusing on composition and my professors have always been able to answer any of my questions and help guide me on the road towards being a better composer and musician. When classes shifted to online due to COVID-19, learning was slightly hindered but only because online classes were fully dependent on having steady internet connection which was something I do not have at home. Even so, my teachers and professors were very understanding and I was still always able to retain something new in my online piano and composition lessons."
Sophomore,5,"I just completed my first year at Texas Tech, and it was a wonderful experience. The people there genuine and kind, and all of the professors I have met are very professional and great teachers. I was saddened that my time there was cut short due to Covid-19, and I cannot wait to return next semester!"
Junior,5,"I’ve taken 3 courses online for graduation requirement courses. The professors I’ve had are good, and I’d recommend taking your graduation required courses online since it’ll take less of your time to allow you to focus on your courses more related to your major."
Junior,5,"Texas Tech wasn’t my first option, but I’m not disappointed at all with what I’ve experienced here. It’s been a great journey so far. It’s a public university so you should not expect to have a 5 star dorm, dining staff to treat you royally, and etc but nothing is terrible about this school. All public schools are like that. They’re basically the same. It really doesn’t matter what school you pick because eventually you’ll learn that you’ve been teaching yourself everything, but your professors are there to just show you what you can teach yourself. I still kinda wish I went to TCU or A&M, but you gotta make the most out of what you’ve got. This school tries its best to do what it can just like all other schools do."
Alum,5,I loved the online program. The advisors were very good at communicating and knowledgeable over the programs they offered.
Alum,5,The teachers would grade fairly quickly and would also email back answering questions as soon as they could. They would make videos explaining their assignments.
Sophomore,5,I did take classes online I think tech handled the situation considering the circumstances very well. The school made sure to continue to provide tutoring for me while online. I have a lot of friends who struggled while taking online classes because their school abandoned them but I feel that Texas Tech continued to help me through the whole process of spring semester.
Sophomore,5,I think tech is a great university and I can't wait for fall semester! I hope that next year won't be affected by the virus so I can experience a full year at the school. I'm really excited about the new friends that I will be making this year considering that I will be rushing in the fall. I love this school and I hope the corona doesn't ruin another semester for my friends and I.
Junior,5,I love how the students are able to make connections by participating in student activities and also be able to join programs like mentor tech to help them with their connections and be able to fully enjoy their college experience.
Junior,5,Some online courses were difficult but the professors assisted us as much as they could given the circumstances with COVID-19.
Sophomore,5,I am actually engaged in my classes here. My professors make everything interesting and I make better grades because of it.
Sophomore,5,"I am in love with Texas Tech University. The professors, the students, and the working staff members are all extremely kind and welcoming. There is truly no place like Texas Tech."
Freshman,5,"I haven't had the chance, but the modules sure helped me. I found myself learning about the campus within minutes, and I've had the pleasure of meeting Many of the professors and counselors.  I am very excited for my college experience."
Freshman,4,online learning has definitely been an adjustment but Tech has made the transition from in class learning to online learning as smooth as possible. Everything is easy to find on blackboard and all of my assignments are where they should be and have reasonable deadlines. My professors are all very understanding of any technical difficulties I have had and are able to work with me and give me extensions when needed. Overall my online learning experience has been fairly easy.
Freshman,4,I love tech everyone here is sweet the classes are pretty good I did a sorority so that's also fun. the parties hear are fun I just hate how they get raided fast. there is an abundance of student organizations that you could join and make friends.
Freshman,4,I like how I'm able to go at my own pace which is why I like online classes but if you're not like this and you don't like teaching yourself then it's not for you. But I got used to teaching myself so I don't mind it.
Junior,4,I just transferred here and I believe they are trying to build the school into a top tier university.
Alum,4,"Not mine, but my kid's experience.  Good communication from upper level professors, but Blackboard can be iffy and locks down often."
Junior,4,"On average, my online classes are going well. However, I have noticed that the professors who were not media related seem to struggle adjusting at first."
Graduate Student,4,"The Texas Tech Professor are really ready to give the students extra time for them to understand the material. Most teachers have office hours, and their TA s also have office hours. The University has a tutoring center for most classes, they also have special tutoring programs for STEM students (math, engineering overall), for students with disabilities. I really believe everyone could get all the help they could need; it is just a matter of being informed. The university also has a writing center and a graduate writing center for all types of essays and English assignments. Overall, the University does their best so people can learn as much as possible."
Senior,4,"I like the programs that they offer here. It is the third best school in Texas when it comes to venturing in STEM fields. However, if there is one thing I would like to change about the school, it is the teachers. Some professors are well versed in their fields but that does not mean they can exchange their knowledge to their students, so I want them to be more accountable."
Junior,4,"Very large and a lot of activities. Professors are mostly good, but make sure to talk to others that have had them before if you can, that's the best way to know what you're in for."
Sophomore,4,I have been taking online courses since summer of 2020. I am taking some this fall due to COVID. So far it has been a good experience.
Junior,4,Online is difficult anywhere but many professors tried to make it easier. The online blackboard is very helpful and they utilize their calendar which is awesome.
Junior,4,it's a pretty good school. the environment is friendly and easy to socialize. The campus is semi pretty and uses a lot of money to plant flowers in the winter only for them to die so its a bit of wasted tuition other than that its a good place to be.
Junior,4,there was a lot of figuring out but most professors were understanding about every situation as long as communication was initiated.
Junior,4,"I like the campus. The clubs and the atmosphere. Especially my architecture program, it's very fun and I enjoy my courses. What I would to see be changed is if they added more forms of transportation to get groceries and supplies off campus for those who do not have any means to go off campus by themselves."
Junior,4,"I Have had an overall pleasant experience at Ttech however I do not live on campus so I can not talk about the dorm experience or party scene. I also do not commonly eat on campus either but have stopped by some of the restaurants on campus and have no problems or complaints. While I have no major complaints of the education that happens at Tech, I do find issues with the parking availability at Tech since there are not many parking towards the interior of campus and those that are present are restricted."
Senior,4,Online classes at TTU are challenging and engaging. The professors are willing to help and make virtual office hours available for students. They respond to emails in a timely fashion and are always generous to answer questions.
Senior,4,"They have student wellness services, loads of free tutoring and student led sessions, professors are there to help you succeed once you leave the university. Raiderland is huge and full of Raider spirit. Love it, WRECK 'EM!"
Senior,4,"Once COVID-19 hit, we converted to online learning, professors were online ready to help at any given moment. Online homework was not a hassle and they were understanding of technology issues we may have faced or limitations due to learning online."
Senior,4,"Due to Covid, I took a few courses online and it was difficult at first since it all happened so fast. However, every single one of my professors was great about making sure we were still in a comfortable learning environment. They were always available for questions or to even set up extra meeting times to make sure everyone knew the material. It ended up being a good experience, I learned everything I  was expected to, and had a lot of help on the way."
Junior,4,I've taken several online classes through Tech and professors were readily available to help me. All I had to do was ask them to do a video call or email me and they did. Professors made sure that everyone understand the information.
Junior,4,"I transferred to Tech with my AA, first going through one of Tech's branches then  moving to Lubbock. The campus is well-kept, staff truly care about your needs and education. I have been able to find great friends to study and go to events with. I can honestly say that the friends I met here will be here for life."
Junior,4,"Last semester was my first semester there but it was halted halfway due to covid, I did not get a full experience but I loved it with just a few weeks."
Junior,4,"The online classes kept me on my toes, they were filled with busy work but overall I was able to finish all the work."
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience was successful here at Texas Tech. Although having a full semester online isn't for me, my professors were very understanding and were able to adapt to their students and their different scenarios online. My professors either held live lectures and/or recorded lectures so that we could learn the material at our own convenience, in case we had to work or had other conflicts."
Junior,4,Texas Tech Is highly regarded around the world and now after transferring I can see why. The course work is bit challenging than my previous University but the Professors I have worked with so far have been the most helpful I've came cross in the college career. The Spirit of the Red Raiders is almost unmatched you feel it any where you in Lubbock and that is one of the many things that makes Tech special.
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes. There is not much I can say about it, but I assume the professors will make themselves  available to their students."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience has been great. I had a few bad experiences, with two bad teachers, but other than that it has been fine. Nice places to eat, quiet spaces, and nice people around."
Sophomore,4,Online learning with Texas Tech was a smooth experience. Classes felt normal and the class workload was very manageable. It is a different feel than the classroom but overall a very nice experience.
Alum,4,Any online experience at TTU was easy to complete. Blackboard and other platforms made online learning efficient.
Alum,4,"I honestly enjoyed living in Texas Tech. The fact that my classes were near me made it all seem of greater importance. As oppose to living outside of campus. The amount of help centers there are overwhelming. There is free tutoring, private tutoring, subject specific tutoring, resume critiques, and load more. Not to mention Professor's office hours, and places to study independently. including being able to reserve rooms for group projects. The dining areas were spectacular. Each one offering their own uniqueness to them. Certain types of food were only available in one particular place for example, or certain places were known for the best of a certain type of food."
Sophomore,4,"Texas Tech University is how I imagined any other university to be. The have adequate resources for their students in order to ensure their success, and I love the school pride that radiates throughout campus all day. However getting stuck with a somewhat rude advisor that I was scared to approach made the experience less than valuable as well as several occurrences of discrimination on campus and around campus. However the other great people I've met in classes and in organizations make my experience at Texas Tech worthwhile and I believe the university is constantly striving and taking the steps to be a better environment for its students and faculty."
Sophomore,4,"I had to take classes online during the second half of the second semester due to increasing cases of COVID-19. Professors and teachers were very understanding when my internet connection fluctuated at home. When I did have stable internet, I was still able to learn and my teachers were always able to get their points across."
Junior,4,"My experience with online learning with TTU has been mostly from Covid - adaptations, but, overall, most professors adapted well enough into balancing our academic load, new stressors, and volatile circumstances."
Junior,4,"Texas Tech offers excellent Fine Arts facilities and professors who are experienced and knowledgeable in their subjects, across all general subjects offered."
Freshman,4,Texas Tech has made it easy to see what we need to do and by when. Their websites are always very organized and easy to navigate.
Freshman,4,"Texas Tech has been very supportive of me and my upcoming year at Lubbock. Even with this pandemic, their staff have always been open and available to help students in need. Texas Tech is a wonderful campus and their sports are amazing. Studying in Accounting is worth the work because I am sure Texas Tech will prepare me for my career after my four years at Texas Tech."
Graduate Student,4,"I haven't taken classes yet since I start in the Fall of 2020, but the process to register and the guidance I have been given so far has been helpful and resourceful."
Graduate Student,4,I applied to graduate school online and I got accepted.  The application process was straightforward and very smooth.  The information I was given after being accepted was very clear and concise and I am looking forward to starting the graduate level program online in the fall.
Junior,4,"All of my classes ended up being put online(and in a short time), and personally, my professors handled it very well. At first, it was hard to get used to, but my professors wanted us to succeed and therefore were always there to help and guide us. Although I feel like I did not learn quite as much as I could have if I went to class, it was not the worst experience of my life."
Senior,4,Texas Tech has given me the opportunity to study Architecture from my home town seeing as they are making a huge effort to change demographic percentages in the architectural field.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy attending Texas Tech. Everyone is very nice and accepting, allowing for making friends be a breeze. The school spirit is the most I have ever seen from any other school. All the professors I have had have been wonderful so far and it is clear that they are passionate."
Junior,4,I have taken online classes at Tech. The ones I have been enrolled in were easy to follow and gave a clear and concise schedule. The professors I had made it easy to contact them with any questions and concerns I had.
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the area where the school is located. Everyone here is very friendly and it's just a good environment to be around.
Freshman,4,The transition to online classes was very smooth but it just wasn't the same because I had my classes on a computer instead of in person so I feel I didn't get the learning experience I needed.
Senior,4,I really enjoyed the academics in most of my classes that I have attended at Texas Tech University. The faculty can be difficult to communicate and plan my future schedules with but they have helped in some situations.
Freshman,4,All of my professors used blackboard and other online services that are easy to learn.  It helps you keep track of all of your grades so you know more or less how you are doing in the class.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the instructors we great. So much so that it made of for the one who wasn't. The campus is great and has plenty to do if you have down time. Unfortunately, the offices and websites aren't great. When trying to fix and issue or find out information, you'll find yourself either spending an hour or two to find the right website and that website may or may not have what you're looking for. When talking to somebody over the phone, it's very 50/50 whether or not you'll get somebody actually niceand helpful or somebody who just genuinely doesn't want to be there."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes I think was overall a good transition, and the professors and admin did the best they could for the most part. Some professors weren't the best at communicating throughout the process, but overall I think they handled it the best they could given the circumstances."
Freshman,4,"Although these events were unforeseen, the faculty reacted as if they had been preparing for a great length of time. They all put forward their best efforts to deliver instruction and tried their best to accommodate to our needs."
Freshman,4,"As a incoming transfer student during the time of COVID-19 its difficult to process applications and such, however the school is doing an amazing job when keeping students connected. I am excited to attend in the fall."
Junior,4,At Texas Tech University you can look forward to knowing you are getting a high quality of education. The University spends millions of dollars a year on research and new construction. The football team is not too bad either! The only thing I would like to see change is the academic advising culture at Texas Tech. I personally believe attending the university that all advising staff should strive to help any student regardless of their intended major.
Junior,4,"My experience so far at Texas Tech has been great. As a student who transferred from a community college to a university, it can be a challenge getting adjusted to the larger population. As soon as I started at Tech, I immediately felt welcomed as if I came to Tech as a freshman."
Sophomore,4,Texas Tech has allowed me to become a more independent individual while also giving me the tools and assistance I need to be successful in the classroom.
Freshman,4,"It has been a very great experience considering that it is my first year there. I really enjoy it, I've made friends that I won't ever forget. Architecture has been a bit difficult but I would recommend that anyone looking for an education in Architecture to come to Texas Tech it is an eye opening experience. I absolutely love going to the football games, there's a throwing tortilla tradition and it is so funny and unexpected when you go for the first time!"
Freshman,4,"As a n incoming freshmen, the faculty and campus of Texas Tech University has been very open and helpful to helping me adjust for the fall of 2020 amidst of all of the changes happening in our world they have been doing everything that they can to help make this adjusment as easy as possible."
Freshman,4,"Student organizations really put a lot of effort into engaging students and creating fun activities for them. Campus is slightly older, and several buildings could use updates. Lubbock doesn't have much to do."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment that has been established at Texas Tech. The faculty and staff are very helpful in making sure that you get the help that you need. I also love the school spirit and pride that is on campus. Once you step on campus, you can truly feel that you are part of a family that is loving and supportive. I also love how many organizations there are to get involved in. One thing I would change is how some of the resources for students are ran."
Niche User,4,"In all honesty, I came to Lubbock not knowing anything about Texas Tech University. Little did I know I made the best decision possible for me. Texas Tech has something for everyone that gives you that feeling of a home away from home. The campus is beautiful, the student life is amazing, the academics are  challenging but doable and the professors are eager to help you learn. The only thing I would change is the price, but that comes with every college in the United States."
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus and wonderful members of the community that attend here. I love how interesting the professors can keep you even in classes of over a hundred people. However, there is a lot more focus on athletics throughout the entire school which causes a lack of focus on other activities."
Freshman,4,"Texas Tech University has been an absolute dream for me. The professors truly care about their students and advisors go out of their way to calm your nerves when your schedule isn't adding up. Lubbock is an extremely well built college town. The residents of Lubbock are so concerned with creating job opportunities and helping students succeed in life. I cannot say enough positive things about TTU, I never want to leave!"
Sophomore,2,I am taking four classes online/hybrid and it has gone horribly. 2 of my classes do not even do zoom or talk to us but posted videos at the beginning of the year and said good luck. The other two utilize zoom and other platforms but it is very difficult to navigate through the sites without issues because so many people are on the sit at once. This has made it hard and untimely to do my homework and/or listen to lecture videos online. I have also had serious issues with online testing platforms and have had to start several tests over. Overall I am not enjoying online school and do not think that Texas Tech made the teachers do the best they could. The students were often left to hang and dry without their help. The communication between advisors is also very slow and often you won't get a response on important information until after the third email.
Works Here,2,"Overrated. It is definitely just a diploma mill and you will not see a significant return on investment. Academics are atrocious and school pride is incredibly low. If you want a school that takes your money and turns it into public art projects instead of meaningful learning experiences, this is your place."
Senior,2,"You will be left to drown if you are not from the suburbs of Dallas, Houston, or Austin. While I love the friends I've made here dearly, most students here have no idea what it is like to struggle to look for a job or have limited opportunity leaving them to think ""you are simply just lazy and deserve what is coming to you""; they know nothing of life other than partying and studying. Academic wise, they do not care to what extent you succeed, only that you graduate, even if that means there is no opportunity after graduation."
Junior,2,"The school's faculty is advertised as caring and supportive, but in all honesty they don't give good recommendations and barely advise. The text books are customized by the professors for Texas Tech for some reason making them 300 times more expensive than regular text books. Outside of the school itself, the area is awful; there is nothing to do in  Lubbock except bar hop, so if you aren't 21 or don't look it, I wouldn't recommend this school. Nice people, terrible school service though."
Junior,2,"I have always dreamed of going to Texas Tech. As a first generation college student it was very exciting for me. I was awarded enough money in grants to pursue my dream of attending for the last two years. Until a few weeks ago, I was informed that I would not be able to completely afford tuition and housing because I only received less than half of the cost for both fall and spring semester. Financial Aid office was of no help to me in figuring this out as they normally are eager to help. I've enjoyed my time here, but if I would have been informed earlier that I would not be able to afford the cost to attend that I would get in grants, I would not have re-enrolled this year. Very sad that a dream of mine is currently being taken away from me."
College Junior,2,The dorms are way too small and way too old. They need new buildings with upgraded amenities.
College Junior,2,I am not interested in the greek life in this school but frats hate GDI's and GDI's hate frats. The greek life in this school is always messing up. Every single year there are at least 3 major scandals because they did something they were not supposed to.
College Junior,2,"Most of the students are respectable to you're beliefs. But I was roomed with religious roommate my first year, who was sometimes racist."
College Junior,2,"Everyone drinks, and the drug problem is rampent in fraternities. Not all but some people have been known to do hard drugs in the frats."
College Junior,2,student housing can be very bad at times.
College Sophomore,2,"If I can be honest here, pretty much everyone drinks here. I mean, I don't because I'm underage and its against the law, but the majority of the underage students here tend to ignore that fact. Most of this drinking does tend to go down at tailgates and parties, so if you choose to avoid that then you probably won't be directly exposed to it. I do, however, hear people talking about drinking and drugs a lot of the time, but that unavoidable."
College Junior,2,"Safety on campus at Texas Tech is a growing concern. Just recently there have been car jacking at gun point and multiple random attacks, mostly all at night time."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman, you are required to live on campus your first year. For the price, this is not a good deal. The dorm rooms are incredibly small and with a roommate, things get packed. I would not recommend living on campus if given the choice."
College Sophomore,2,I would not choose this school if I had to do it all over again. I got accepted to all 4 colleges I applied but chose Texas Tech because I thought I would get a bigger scholarship. All others offered me between $20k-40k. After being accepted waited for college to award me more than the measely  $2000. Never got a dime more. Went to financial aid but did not get any help. I am a first generation Hispanic college student. I was flunked the fall and spring semester. Took my finals and could not get my exam grades due to didn't know where to go to get them. Turned in all my homework but never got grades back from every clas. Put on suspension with an academic hold. Don't know what to do anymore.
College Freshman,2,There are many many campus crimes this year including a kidnapping
College Freshman,2,Greek girls are kind of mean and all they do is party and drink
College Sophomore,2,The African American greek life is tragic and weak
College Sophomore,2,"I see underage drinking everywhere. I personally don't drink, but coming from a 3rd person viewpoint I can see that it's a bit bad. Peer pressure isn't too bad though, most people just choose to drink/drugs on their own."
College Freshman,2,"Very outdated and a lot of issues, things never get fixed."
College Junior,2,"Except for a few professors in the engineering school most professors do not seem to care about their students or how much they know or learn, nor how well they do."
College Junior,2,"While Good, the engineering school doesn't seem to care about their students. They seem to care about their name rather then teaching or helping their students."
College Senior,2,"The school is 80% white, so there are some tension and racial issues that we still have a problem with. I would think due to the fact these students are young, will still have this as a problem."
College Junior,2,Its been a headache to deal with the financial aid people and they aren't really willing to help out. Best tip I have is apply as early you can for scholarships both through the school and outside.
College Sophomore,2,"There are consistent smell of weed somewhere in the dorms, and the chances of having a jackass frat roommate is relatively high. You can literally find anything that can possibly come out of human body in the bathrooms. So, overall, it is an average college campus housing."
College Sophomore,2,"Not sure how there school are, but I have not gotten any contacts about financial aid after turning in my FASFA about 6 months ago."
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any scholarships
College Sophomore,2,"It was like living in a closet. Sink was too small, no temperature control, bathrooms hardly every fully-operational. Terrifying elevators (I was late to class after being stuck in one once). Fantastic RAs, though."
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life here at Tech is pretty huge in my opinion! Everywhere you look, you can spot out a Greek frat/sorority on campus. Greek life kinda has a negative affect on the social atmosphere because a lot of the parties here lately have resulted poorly. We have had kids die from hazing that takes place and coming back drunk from parties."
College Freshman,2,the rules sometimes are to much but they do keep us safe
College Freshman,2,i did not get financial aid because i did not qualify for it and the process was so much trouble and long
College Freshman,2,The janitors could not care less about the cleanliness of the dorms making it very gross. The more expensive dorms to be in the cleaner it seems to be but I leave in the cheapest dorm because I cannot afford anything else and I realize it could be worse but it could definitely be a lot better.
College Sophomore,2,Gaining scholarships was extremely stressful and inconvenient because paper work on Texas Tech's side was not completed in time.
College Sophomore,2,Rampant vandalism and noisy atmosphere.
College Freshman,2,"I don't really go to parties here at Tech, but I guess the places to be at a party are in the Frat & Sorority houses. Maybe even some of the apartments off-campus."
College Junior,2,The lines in the financial aid officer are atrocious. It is very difficult to receive any aid.
College Senior,2,"Off campus housing is expensive, and has many break ins."
College Senior,2,Not very much going on
College Student,2,"If you don't get a dorm in school, the apartments outside of the university are pricey and small"
College Junior,2,I think our greek life students don't take college seriously
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are ok-ish, but highly overpriced for what you get especially if you opt to live in a standard dorm. There needs to be a ton of remolding on the older dorms"
College Freshman,2,"Lubbock is very boring, not much to do and very dry."
College Freshman,2,"Ask Greek life about Greek life. You'll understand. 

It's just not for me."
College Freshman,2,It's actually really dirty and it's unbelievable that I'm paying tons of money a semester just to live in the dorms. They are nasty and need to be renovated badly.
College Freshman,2,It seems really run down.
College Freshman,2,"The courses are fine, but some of the staff and professors are unreliable and unprofessional. The overall student body aren't that friendly if you're not a white girl or boy. Diversity isn't really welcomed here."
College Sophomore,2,My chem professor had a language barrier and everybody in the class said they never learned anything from the professor
College Freshman,2,The police on campus are very strict on little things. I feel like they are always looking for an excuse to get people in trouble.
College Freshman,2,"Texas Tech is a party school. Every weekend there is no shortage of houses to ""raid"". If you're part of greek life, you will have plenty of parties both greek and non-greek to choose from. Everyone else under the age of 21, goes to house parties that by midnight are packed full like a Japanese commuter train. I mean literally, I've seen girls get up on tables to get across the room. By 1am most parties get shut down by the apathetic LPD who show up and ask everyone to leave. In 2013 the police were not as strict as they were in 2014. Maybe because of the non-stop noise complaints from the same house or just because they got sick of showing up and busting college kids to make a living. Drinking and drunkenness is a disease that plagues the little town of Lubbock. There is a drinking culture that immortalizes people who consume copious amounts of alcohol and get ""fucked up"". Alcohol abuse is accepted as the norm as there is little else to stimulate the brain with."
College Freshman,2,Financial Aid advisers do not really tend to the need of the students.
College Senior,2,Very anxiety inducing. Quite stressful. Would not want to do again.
College Junior,2,The greek life on tech has gotten a lot of bad rep this year
College Senior,2,They take a long time and sometimes they drop you from classes if you don't pay. but its hard because the point of getting aid is because i cant pay
College Senior,2,I don't like the segregation it causes
College Junior,2,If it is football that's all anyone cares about.
College Sophomore,2,I prefer off campus options
College Junior,2,Local Atmosphere is not that great but just make a lot of friends and you will have a good time.
College Sophomore,2,I have had friends who have had scholarships and grants go to financial aid and came back with no answers. I have personally gone in there and tried to get a question answered and came back more confused.
College Junior,2,Prices aren't that great so most people I know choose a small meal plan while making/buying food elsewhere.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much tolerance for students who aren't conservative and religious.
College Sophomore,2,"parking is strictly enforced, late night security bus available, emergency stations available.  But nothing else is monitored as far as alcohol, drugs"
Works Here,1,"Good luck finding any help with your online classes. Your professors won't answer emails and they will put in the minimal amount of effort to publish classes. If it doesn't make sense, it'll be made out to be your fault."
Freshman,1,The process of starting classes after you are admitted is ridiculous. They have obligatory orientation (which they'll charge you $60 for). To choose your classes you have to have a meeting with an academic advisor who will see the schedule you want and change it without consulting you. Finally they charge an INSANE amount of fees. They will charge a ton for any service they offer even if its one you never plan using. Even if its a service you want to use they will charge you WAY too much. I have two separate library fees which total to over $250. Also two Info Technology fees which total over $300. There are also a ton of fees that the description of the fee is in an in-understandable code so you don't know what you are being charged for. Basically its a business that looks to suck every penny it can out of it's students.
Senior,1,"I am about to graduate in electrical engineering so I know what it is like to be a red raider and honestly I wish I had gone to TAMU or a school that is closer to a big city. Since Tech is so far out in the middle of nowhere there's hardly anything to do. The dust storms and high wind days during the springtime are just awful and give people the worst allergies. I had a terrible experience with the EE advisor Jennifer Maddox. Registration never went smooth, Jennifer never, not one semester was able to put the correct permits for me to register. Now don't even get me started on the financial aid. It never went smooth I would have to go and speak to a representative every single time a semester would start. As far as jobs, most of the companies hiring through the engineering career center are local with very limited high-end companies. Overall, the experience I've had here in Lubbock has been awful and I am so happy that I'm graduating in two months to get the heck out of this town."
Works Here,1,The most racist campus I have ever experienced. And it isn't just the fraternities either.  I have heard senior administrators at the university use repulsive and racist language on multiple occasions - especially when referring to international students.
College Sophomore,1,I personally do not like the greek life because they are mostly stuck up.
College Senior,1,"GDI (Gosh Damn Independents) cannot stand Greeks. Greeks lack direction, common sense, and diversity. There are a few Greeks that stand for great morals but are rarely recognized. In fact, the school's All-Black fraternities are the most diverse fraternity in the school. Being in Texas, girls and guys in Greek life all dress same. In the summer, girls wear their oversize t-shirts and nikes shorts with face full of makeup, while in the winter, they all dress like Han Solo. Guys wear the typical ""hit me but my dad's a lawyer and I will sue you"" atire. Even though joining is a terrible idea, they raise money for their charities they stand for (I don't know how) and will help you with connection after college, depending on major. Overall, they suck."
College Freshman,1,"I never really wanted to stay in Texas in the first place, nor go to such a large school. I feel lost and alone here and i don't like it. I haven't joined any clubs or made any friends, and I don't like how massive and impersonal the school is. I would definitely not choose this school again. I have been depressed and had many anxiety attacks since being here."
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid always screws up what has been updated and what has not been updated. Trying to reach them before classes start is impossible. The fact that they don't bill you for your fall classes until the week right before classes start is the worst! Then they expect you to come up with $1000 to pay for the first payment in two weeks! Some of us (including me) do not receive help from our parents and do not have that kind of money!
College Freshman,1,ts annoying and a complete hassle trying to get your stuff turned in and they lose a lot of your forms.
College Freshman,1,"The deadlines are hard to find, the scholarships and the scholarship office are unflexible, and its really not geared towards the student's best interest."
College Freshman,1,If you aren't a genius or horribly poor texas tech will not help at all with the financial process and leave it all to yourself
College Freshman,1,I think I will be on campus for the rest of my life.
College Freshman,1,Don't expect any aid unless you are valedictorian.
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid even though I applied and felt that my family needed the help.
College Freshman,1,The people who are Greek at this school are very snobbish and arrogant. They won't really give you any attention if you're not a Greek.
College Sophomore,1,Rooms are very small and there are community bathrooms
College Sophomore,1,i havent been able to get any financial aid
College Freshman,1,"Let me put things in perspective for anyone thinking of attending Texas Tech. During my Freshman year, one girl was raped in the parking lot of our dorm (Hulen/Clement) and there were rumors that the trees behind of dorms were cut down because someone was raped there. Police would show up every night, without fail to patrol our parking lot. There were dozens of dealers on every floor selling everything from coke to adderall out of the dorms. People used to smoke weed in the parking lot of the dorms either in their cars or out in public, until the cops started showing up. There were many cases of vandalism. Drinking was endemic, not just in our dorm, but in every other dorm. The trash room would be full of beer cans everyday in spite of the fact that Texas Tech is a dry campus. Weed and alcohol abused is considered normal, harder drugs are not so kindly looked upon but they are ever present."
College Freshman,1,Fast food joints are littered about the town and there is little to no appreciation of a diverse palette among the student body.
College Freshman,1,"It's simple. If you're not white there's little place for you in the frats and sororities that matter. Greek life dominates all of Texas Tech from their parties to the social life. Frat daddies and Sorostitues are the lifeblood of Texas Tech. Just recently President Nellis has create a task force to crack down on illegal Fraternity activities and abuses of power. One Fraternity, has already been suspended (Phi Delta Theta), google it. If you are white, drive a truck, love drinking beer, and degrade women on a daily basis, you can be sure there is a place for you at Texas Tech."
College Senior,1,No real internship opportunities. Felt like I was squandering my talents.
College Senior,1,Very clean (apart from the harrowing duststorm) and open campus.
College Senior,1,Long lines. Expensive drinks. Little variety. Regrettable experience.
College Freshman,1,"I am a middle class white female so it was very difficult to receive any grants. I did receive some, but not as much as I hoped for."
College Junior,1,"People will defend rape jokes with things like ""its just a joke!"". Also if you try to be healthy, you will not have very many friends who will support you."
College Junior,1,"Just google ""Texas Tech Fraternities"" and check the news section. It will tell you all about greek like at Tech."
College Senior,1,"Lubbock has horrible Nightlife. The bars are small, and the parties get busted a lot!"
College Freshman,1,"The weather changes more than anything else. One day it will be snowing and then the next day it will 80 degrees, and the wind is horrible, same with dust storms."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Housing at Texas Tech HAHAHA. It's a joke because the dorms were built in the 17th century and have not been renovated since then. The rooms are small and you do not get your own bathroom. Do not even let me start with how disgusting the bathrooms are. I do not want to embarrass the school so I will not say how bad they are. But, the room is small and it is less than 500 square feet and you have to pay $4,000 + PER SEMESTER for it. Not $4,000 for the school year $4,000 per semester. Just imagine paying $8,000 a year for 300 square feet of space and a bathroom full of someone else's diarrhea and vomit on the toilet seat."
College Sophomore,1,If you do not have a car on campus or you do not have friends with cars good luck trying to get around campus.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid department is full of incompetent individuals who need more to gain people skills.
College Sophomore,1,The homes and apartments are crazy expensive and they are small.
College Sophomore,1,Every one in the school is grouped by race. When you come to Texas Tech its like going back to Jim Crow times.
College Sophomore,1,"As much as I love going to Texas Tech, the weather can really kill any good day you are having. For instance, we had finally been having a constant couple of weeks where the weather was just beautiful and warm (keep in mind we did have dust storms a few times though, but mini ones) and then all of the sudden we are now having freezing weather, and we even had a little snow. It's extremely frustrating. I think what I dislike most is the wind though, because if we didn't have the wind I don't think the weather would be as extreme."
College Junior,1,If I could do it all over again I would have tried to get in my other grad school apps in time so i could have never came to this godforsaken dump
College Junior,1,I am not interesting in judging people as sexual objects.
College Junior,1,"One day its snowing. Four days later its 90 degrees, later that night its 35 degrees. The next day its 75 degrees but 25 mile per hour winds. You decide if that's what you want to deal with."
College Junior,1,People visibly drink for events like tailgates for the football games
College Freshman,1,The weather in Lubbock got voted the worst in the country if that tells you anything.
College Freshman,1,"I've never lived in a place where the weather was this bipolar. One day, it could be freezing cold and the next, it's warm and you can wear shorts. It's RIDICULOUS! The weather is never consistent enough to plan out your whole week. When its cold, its COLD and when its hot, its HOT. You can't win."
College Junior,1,Health and Saftey do not seem to be the concern of the officials of TTU.
College Junior,1,Lots of money will be spent on gas and oil changes when you move here. Also a healthy amount will be spent on tires as this city has the worst infrastructure I've seen out of the 50+ cities I have been to.
College Junior,1,"The most depressing place I have ever been in. I actually fought a battle with depression when I first moved here. And its not due to being homesick, I have moved over 10 times in my life. This place is just that awful."
College Junior,1,They have never won a conference championship in any meaningful sport since ever.
College Junior,1,"Standing outside in the cold to get into one of the worst bars I've ever been to. Overcharged drinks, bad music, and bad local attitudes."
College Junior,1,Typical Texas racist cops. Been pulled over twice. Each time did absolutely nothing wrong. Each stop took 45+ minutes and resulted in nothing.
College Student,1,"I am not involved in Greek life, but I do not like the people in them. Always rude no matter what."
College Student,1,"One day, we will have every season. It will be freezing then hot then super windy all in one day. It makes walking to class miserable."
College Junior,1,The cold and the absolute heat make it so hard to go to school and especially with the wind.
College Freshman,1,you never know what its going to be like
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life plays a pretty big role in what you do on the weekends but is not as involving as it is in most other campuses. There is a pretty big bar scene both by the university and in the depot district as well as there being a fairly descent number of house parties thrown by non-greek (dare i say GDI?) students. There is no on campus fraternity housing and Greek circle/row is literally miles away from the main areas of campus. It is not integrated into campus well at all and honestly promotes drunk driving more than anything. There are a handful of fraternity lodges that allow drinking (technically on campus because the campus includes about 3 square miles of mostly nothing) but many do not. I do not know what those fraternities do for social activities but the majority do not party at their lodge. Living in a fraternity is a huge part of Greek life and you will likely miss this. Because of this, there is little to no value in going Greek. In other schools you may pay about the same amount of money but also get room and board, a place to party whenever, and it will all be within walking distance of you're campus center. Unfortunately because of tech's Greek life restrictions, it is not worth it to go Greek unless you truly are from an upper class family with $100,000 to blow each semester on a group of friends and a place to hang out at a couple miles away from where you live."
College Junior,1,Majority Caucasian students who enjoy partying and football.
College Junior,1,Crazy weather. One second is freezing the next it's 100 degrees.
College Junior,1,"Parking is an absolute mess. Other schools have simple to follow parking maps and where you are and are not allowed to park but here it is so confusing, I have been here 2 years and still it's hard to make sure to not get a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,Lubbock weather is the worst. 
College Sophomore,1,I don't why you guys asked me about other guys....
College Sophomore,1,"The school is the most beautiful campus known, but the local scenery surrounding it is very trashy looking."
College Junior,1,I do not party. I think students need to concentrate on their work
College Freshman,1,There are very few fruits or vegetable options. There are no vegetarian meal options. The meat is unhealthy. Dining halls are not open for long enough hours. 
College Freshman,1,Lubbock is a very small town in the middle of nowhere in Texas.

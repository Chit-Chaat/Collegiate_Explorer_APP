Freshman,5,"I  am a freshman here at Ball State and have some very proud things to say. Ball State is one of the most diverse campuses I  have been on. It s accepting, caring, loyal, and dedicated to get its students the education they deserve. All of my professors work hard day in and day out to get me the best education they can give and I am incredibly grateful. During this time of COVID-19 my college has also been one of the most hard working to keep its campus clean and safe. There are people monitoring tables for limits of people, everyone wears masks, the tables and door handles and food stations are cleaned 24/7 and the rules for housing residents have been a huge success. Even though we are in hard times Ball State has still been able to give me the education I  need and the best experiences. I could not be more impressed."
Freshman,5,"I  am currently in a mix of in person, online and hybrid classes. I have had to learn a new way of learning and Ball State has made that very easy. I have no issue with Zoom usage and I my professors use it 24/7. Just because we are online doesn't mean the professors slack either. They are still providing everything they can for us and have been giving me a great experience."
Freshman,5,"Ball State is everything I hoped for it to be. Great school, decent location, and awesome opportunities on campus."
Alum,5,Ball state is a mid-sized college that is perfect size. There is no need to take a bus to get to class because everything is within walking distance. There are many activities to keep you busy in between classes.
Freshman,5,I love the community and how inviting the other students are. The campus is beautiful throughout the year. They are updating policies to help deal with the covid issue as it grows to help stop it from spreading.
Freshman,5,The university is doing an excellent job at adapting to the needs of students and staff to help keep physical meetings to a minimum.
Freshman,5,the teachers are doing very well through this unfortunate timeframe. they are very understanding and very caring of us.
Junior,5,My favorite things about Ball State would have to be the opportunities that come at an affordable price. It provides the resources needed to reach your goals and to explore interests that you had no idea you were interested in before.
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoyed the student life on campus. It was small enough that you could easily walk from one side of campus to the other in time for classes. The professors were also kind and understandable.
Junior,5,"I haven't yet officially begun study at Ball state, but my experiences so far with registry and communication with the college has been amazing, with helpful and kind staff and prompt responses to questions, problems and the like."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy online classes, it frees up a lot of my time. Most of my online lasses do not have set lecture times, there are just weekly assignments. So far the professors have been great, even though you do not meet with them face to face they are ready to help you with any issues."
Junior,5,I absolutely love Ball State. The campus is beautiful and there are so many opportunities. I have loved all my professors and classes.
Sophomore,5,The people are so kind and helpful. The professors really care about their students and helping then learn.
Junior,5,I have taken several classes online through various universities and Ball State is by far the best! They're engaging and you really do learn a lot.
Junior,5,Ball State is a fantastic university that offers a variety of opportunities for every person. They put in an effort to put their students first.
Sophomore,5,"While this was a new experience for everyone, Ball State's transition to online was an amazing one. While I missed going to classes, I was always in contact with my teachers, still able to pass all of my classes and compromise on assignments that wouldn't work online. While I do love being on campus, the online experience was the best that it possible could have been."
Sophomore,5,"As a sophomore in college I now know that Ball State was the correct choice for me. The campus is so welcoming, with the perfect student to faculty ratio, amazing class offerings and availability, and programs that cater to everyone's needs. I love the Muncie environment and all of my professors, and can't wait to continue my education at BSU."
Sophomore,5,The class I had online was very active and the professor took time to help us with our work.  Although he was a little slow with responses he tried to keep up with the students.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the school life, it felt like I could be my self for the first time.  Between making new friends and meeting people at school clubs like is great.  The school even takes online security pretty seriously to help make shure we dont get hacked.  Professors are very understanding and accommodating for students, most if the time you just need to ask.  All in all a great experience and a fun campus to be on."
Sophomore,5,I have had several online courses in which the professors were in touch whenever it was needed. Every professor in these courses made it challenging but doable with a busy schedule!
Junior,5,"I love this school so much. It is small enough to get to know your professors if you want to, and it is so easy to get used to the campus."
Sophomore,5,Ball State University is a great college with excellent professors and staff. The services for disabilities are great and easy to access. The campus is beautiful and the environment is friendly.
Sophomore,5,"I loved the atmosphere of Ball State University! It is a smaller campus, but it isn't too small; it's cozy. For me personally I chose Ball State for the CAP program, which is amazing.  I love the classes at Ball State, but one thing I would change is some of the required courses because they aren't they most fun. I would recommend Ball State University to anybody who seems interested, or even to those who aren't! I love the school and I'm glad I can be a Cardinal."
Senior,5,"For me, my online experience has been great for the most part. I always make sure to stay in touch with all my professors and know that things are moving forward. I think I have had a great experience and try my best to stay on top of assignments, quizzes, and tests. My professors are usually very quick to respond to emails and so helpful with me when I need extra accommodations on my assignments."
Junior,5,I personally really enjoy online learning and Ball State did a good job of making sure everyone got the education they still deserved. Some professors had trouble with the technology while teaching online but others excelled and made the classes more fun.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy the professors, my classmates, and the overall healthy environment on campus. I truly do enjoy going to classes and learning everything I can!"
Senior,5,"Professors and overall classmates have been amazing, friendly, and life changing. There are thousands of experiences to venture to. Classes are taught well both virtually and in class, with caring individuals to help every step of the way. You truly do get an authentic and personal experience at Ball State!"
Sophomore,5,"I have not had online classes. I did, however, have several lessons and assignments to do online for my ASL class which was a pretty good experience."
Sophomore,5,An overall amazing school with a great environment and atmosphere. I do wish there were more aid opportunities for minority students who lack financial stability.
Graduate Student,5,It’s been an easy transition for me. Everyone is hands on and willing to help. They also so have many resources that help with studies and connecting.
Freshman,5,"I loved my time at ball state University. The professors helped out with the students when questions were asked. The lessons were interactive and it made it fun and easy to learn, making it easy to pass quizzes and tests. I rate this college full stars because of how involving the teachers are and how easy everything seems to be. It isn't always easy, of course, but the professors made sure the students were getting all of the information being said and made sure they passed, but only if they put in the work for it."
Freshman,5,I liked the professors at Ball State. They truly care about you and want to see you succeed. The food is prepared fresh everyday and the ladies working in the dining halls seem to really care and want to help you use as much dining credit per swipe so that you can get the most for your money.
Niche User,5,From my visits I've loved all the people and the campus. It also has a great party scene which makes it really easy to find new acquaintances. The overall layout of Muncie has a great home town feel to it.
Alum,5,An amazing Architecture program. Some of the greatest learning I have done. Spent many hours on campus learning from some of the greatest minds around. Always a program to get involved in at Ball State. Lots of great friends made and future colleges.
Sophomore,5,"Ball State has caught my attention because out of all the schools that have reached out to me, this school has been the most welcoming and appreciative. I also love how diverse the entire school is and how the school is so connected, almost like a community. I would love to go to a school where I would feel welcome to volunteer and participate in clubs and activities. I think love and friendships in school would be a key value for my college career and so that’s why I would love to go to Ball State University. I have also realized that this school provides excellent academics with an overall lower net price than other universities. This was amazingly shocking to me. This school offers the right academics for the business administration major I would like to take and it would cost me fair amount of education dollars. This school has all the right qualities and provides top quality academics as well. That is why Ball State has really stood out to me."
Sophomore,5,"Great experience so far. Getting a great education, one of the best places for music education. Lots of food options, and forms are really nice. Most professors are great, but some get kind of annoying with their extreme left-wing bias. That’s one of the only downsides."
Niche User,5,I have interacted with professors and other workers of Ball State University and I can not say enough great things. Even the students there are helpful and interactive.
Freshman,5,I have really enjoyed living on campus and attending classes and learning in a safe environment. I have only really taken core classes but I still have found that all of the professors I have come in contact with to be very good teachers. The staff really seems to care about my overall well-being.
Freshman,5,Ball State feels like being back in high school. It is a wonderful campus if you want a place that feels like home!
Freshman,5,"BSU is an accepting school with professors that are ready to help whenever necessary. It is a warm environment with many clubs or organizations that one can be apart of to improve the years spent at the university. It is easy to make friends if you are an outgoing person and it is also easy to have your own alone times and have set boundaries if needed, also. It is inclusive and if anything, extremely friendly. The only thing I do hope will be improved in the future is the food. I hope that there will be healthier options besides the salad bars and fruits that they have as much of it is more of processed food. Besides, that Ball State University is a great school with lots of places to jog around or take walks if you enjoy nature. They also have Filmworks, a museum, Late-Nite, and other fun activities that you can enjoy with a partner or just a group of friends."
Freshman,5,"I have always loved Ball State. My parents went there, and I can't wait to start. My family as always been a Ball State family, and it has always been my number one choice. I have close family to help me out if I ever need anything."
Freshman,5,I love BSU. The campus is the perfect size! Not too big and not too small. The faculty are all there to help you succeed and it shows. The class sizes are great and I have made lifelong friends here and have learned so much already.
Sophomore,5,There are some great professors here at Ball State. It is a great environment rather you commute or live on campus. I would definitely recommend Ball State to a friend as an option for college.
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful.  The architecture is unique and the buildings are personally named with influential people to the university.  The campus is big but not too big.  I live off campus and my furthest walk was 15 minutes.  The professors are also amazing.  I haven't had one professor who didn't care about their students.  I'm not saying some classes/professors weren't extremely hard, because they were, but not one professor didn't care about my grade personally."
Freshman,5,"Ball State seems to truly care about your education and that you're getting what you need out of your time on campus. Their programs are amazing, inclusive, and built for your individual needs"
Freshman,5,"I love the way that Ball State is like a family. No matter what, someone is always there for you. Whenever I need help, someone is always willing to lend a helping hand which is amazing. One of the big pluses is that there is a Chick-fil-a on campus!"
Freshman,5,"Everything is very easy to get to and the advisor’s are always very accessible to help.         Changes might be, no parking fees for commuters."
Graduate Student,5,"I would like to continue seeing the growth in diversity on campus and student life. Overall, amazing university."
Freshman,5,Experienced and know how to help. Willing do to whatever is needed to have you prepared for your first day.
Freshman,5,Only my first semester at Ball State and I have met soo many nice and welcoming people. The campus is a nice place to walk around and the classes are very engaging. There were soo many clubs to join I had to choose only a couple to commit to.
Freshman,5,It's a beautiful campus with a wide variety of Majors and Minors. Transportation is student-friendly with wonderful faculty and staff. Lots of different areas to go eat food and hang out with friends and study.
Freshman,5,"Ball State University is an amazing school located in Muncie, Indiana. The campus is very beautiful and easy to navigate. The environment on campus is also very peaceful and diverse. The classes and curriculum challenge students in the best way. Overall, it is a great school for all."
Alum,5,"I honestly loved my undergrad experience at BSU. I learned so much, met SO MANY amazing people and made great connections with them, and I always felt like I had endless opportunities.

I found a job right outside of college in my field of study, so I know BSU prepared me properly. I'm planning on going back to BSU in a few years to pursue an M.A. as well.
I could honestly say so much about my time at Ball State, but I don't even know where to start. So, I'll just say this: BSU was a great fit for me, and even though I've only just graduated, I already miss my college days."
Senior,5,"This campus was the perfect fit for me! It is not so big that you will feel alone, but it is not so small that you will know everybody. It is the perfect fit for anyone who is looking for that perfect medium. There is always different opportunities for recreational, volunteer, and educational activities. Every where you look there will always be something new."
Freshman,5,LOVEEEEE IT!!!!! BSU is such an amazing campus that is so open to its students. The resources the staff of BSU offers to its students is so helpful. They really do want the best for their students. The other students on the campus are so positive.
Freshman,5,"Everything about Ball State University is perfectly suited to me and many others. everything from the campus life, to the food, to the size of the campus and classrooms. everything is perfect here"
Niche User,5,"I went to Ball State University for a camp during the summer of 2018 and 2019 and I fell in love with it. It was open and small, and it was inviting. It wasn't complicated and the dorms were of high quality. I knew I wanted to attend as soon as I set foot on campus the first time."
Senior,5,"Professors and lectures genuinely value their students as people, and not just as numbers. Within my programs specifically, each professor has taken the time to get to know their students on a personal level, and really invest in them both academically, personally, and professionally. The amount of resources Ball State offers is fantastic. There are helpful resources here available for literally everything anyone could think of from the counseling center, to general advising, to administrator support, to the university police department. Each of these individuals have a true passion for, and desire to continue, providing help and advice many wish they had been able to seek in their younger years."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour of Ball State last week and loved the community and scenery I saw the minute I stepped foot onto campus. Although the weather was cold and dreary, the students seemed happy and determined to be there. It was overall a very inviting experience and I hope to attend there in the future."
Junior,5,"Ball State University is absolutely been a blast since I have come here. I have honestly received an amazing education from talks with my friends from different colleges who wished they made the choice to come to Ball State. The faculty and staff here truly do care about your well-being and want to see you succeed. The campus culture is so very supportive. Plus, there are so many opportunities to get involved on or around campus with over 500 clubs to join. They are preparing me for the outside world and I can honestly say that I think I am ready."
Alum,4,I didn't attend online classes. I cannot give an honest review on the online classes at Ball State University.
Junior,4,"When students were first sent home, teachers were forced to resort to online classes. They had lectures in video format and welcomed emails if students had any trouble."
Junior,4,"At Ball State, I've made some great friends and met some amazing faculty members. needless to say, like any other college the food could be better. The approach to COVID-19 was slow and unorganized, but containment was controlled. Despite having classes online and in person, I feel like I'm getting a good learning experience."
Sophomore,4,It’s like a one in a lifetime experience to have because some thing new always happen on campus every day. Students work together well no matter what  race you are.
Sophomore,4,"Taking online classes especially hard courses are definitely a challenge. Everyone is coming together to try their best to retain the information as they would in class, but on Zoom instead. Being online is safer than going to an actual lecture because of Covid-19.  The down side of online classes are technical issues that may occur on your laptop from time to time."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman and so far my overall experience with Ball State has been pretty good, especially considering the circumstances with COVID-19"
Freshman,4,I am here during covid-19 so it is a little wonky. overall everyone is nice and the food is great! teachers are very understandable and considerate!
Junior,4,"Went fully online last semester, and it was a pleasant experience. The teachers were efficient at coming up with new course outlines to accommodate remote learning. Some teachers needed to communicate more however and put in more effort at grading on time. There were a few times where a teacher's lack of communication ended up in a docking of my grade."
Alum,4,They recently switched to Canvas for their online learning platform. It has a clean and easy to use interface. Most professors know how to set it up to be organized. Although I did have a few that didn't use it too well.
Alum,4,"I graduated in December of 2019. The school has a lot of great programs to offer and many are  nationally ranked. The campus is incredible and is always improving/growing in size. The dorms and food were much better than other schools that I visited. Ball State is always building new buildings. They have many extra curricular activities to get involved with, where you can make life-long friends. Many people look down on Muncie, but the downtown area is very well kept, as they recently redid all the sidewalks and streets. There are plenty of bars and restaurants to visit. There is also a nice hotel (Courtyard by Marriott) downtown. I recommend it for visiting family. The rest of Muncie is in rough shape. The further away from campus the worse it gets.  The streets in Muncie are poorly designed and in rough shape. Hopefully it will improve in the coming years."
Junior,4,"I have yet to begin classes, but I anticipate their being informational and practical. Their communication with me up to this point has been stellar. Clear directions and methods for everything, with information, if not provided, easy to find once you ask for it."
Sophomore,4,My time at ball state is good. It is a very good school . And until i graduate i will enjoy my tome there
Sophomore,4,i don't really take any online classes bit this semester i am so i'm hoping it goes well. Bit the time i did it went well
Freshman,4,"Over all Ball State University is an amazing school. I was thrilled with the variety of clubs, sports, and extra activities there were. The campus itself is beautiful with a lot of environments to meet new people and having some relaxing areas to study in. They work hard to make sure that students feel safe and at home while living on campus or even near it. I did like most of my professors, some who really invested in their students and wanted to get to know and help them grow which was great."
Freshman,4,"When the pandemic hit and we switched to online it was okay. Some of my teachers where still there for the students. Others created useless work to keep us occupied. Canvas is really easy to work and would tell us the upcoming assignments which was great incase I did not pay attention to the syllabus, dates where changed, and/or teachers did not send reminders. But over all it was still a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I had six classes online because of COVID and 4/6 professors actually were helpful and made videos/voiceovers about the class material. The others just made us read the book and do online assignments. If you use your time wisely and just get the assignments over with, it's not too overwhelming."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Ball State was fun for the most part. My professors were willing to help 4/5 times (also depends on the prof). I definitely recommend going to parties or just some campus organization gatherings, it helps your mind take a break from only school. Great Teachers College with amazing ElEd professors. I can't say much about the Spring semester because it was cancelled due to COVID, but I ready to go back!"
Sophomore,4,I never took classes online. I am not sure what to say because I never took online classes. I have heard they are easy.
Junior,4,"The online learning experience I had was satisfactory. Some classes do not always work well with an online platform, but some do. And for busy college students, having some classes be online provides them with more flexibility in organizing/dispersing their workload."
Junior,4,"I personally enjoy attending Ball State. It has rich art programs, pleasant dining halls/food options, and I've made friends there I can't imagine living without now. There is also plenty of fun activities to do to get involved with people on campus or just to unwind. If I were to criticize anything though, It'd have to be the availability of some of the teachers after class hours. They do have scheduled office hours, but not very frequent ones. And at times some of the professors can't be bothered to answer their emails. Of course this does not go for all of the instructors, but it has definitely been an issue in a few of my classes. Other than that though, it has been a pleasant college experience!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love campus its not to big and not to small. I fits me perfectly! Everything you need is within a good distance and learning campus didn't take me long at all."
Sophomore,4,"I haven't personally taken any classes online, but I know people that have and they have loved their experiences and said it was an easy process!"
Sophomore,4,This school has given me an opportunity to branch out beyond my comfort zone with curriculum that makes me push myself. In addition has given me the opportunity to meet people who are on the same path as me!
Sophomore,4,"Ball State has become a home for me. Getting involved in extra-curricular activities moved me from feeling like I was visiting to making it feel like home. The professors care so much about your personal success. Also, if it is at all possible for you, do the Honors College! That is the best experience I have ever had in a class!"
Sophomore,4,I thought the online experience was pretty good. I thought the profs and teachers adjusted well to having to switch to online learning. I felt like I was able to learn at an appropriate pace for me but I still prefer in class learning.
Sophomore,4,"For the duration of the COVID-19 shutdowns, I had to transition from all in-person classes to all online. Some of the courses I was enrolled in were challenging online, but this is because it was a hands on studio course. The lack of materials and resources at home made it a challenge to complete models for my CAP classes. However, my elective classes transitioned into online very well. Professors made sure to communicate with all students for all necessary aspects of the course. Exams online were also simple and easy to complete."
Senior,4,"I personally really enjoy Ball State. In terms of size I think it is just perfect! it isn't too big or too small and it is pretty easy to get around. I enjoy the dorms and how much accessibility there is for all students. I also am a student with disabilities and the office of disabilities is very helpful for me and other students and it helps me academically. 

Something that I think that needs to change is that there needs to be a number of things that get focused on with diversity on campus. I feel like there are just a number of things that don't show enough diversity of the things that students are involved with. I also think that there should be more options for scholarships for students as well."
Junior,4,"Campus is absolutely beautiful. There are lots of fun places to go (i. e. Brothers, The Chug, theater performances, etc). There are also nice, cheap apartment complexes near campus. There are always lots of dogs on campus."
Junior,4,It has been a great experience at Ball State. I have met some of my closest friends here and have been able to work towards graduating to go to graduate school.
Freshman,4,"ball state is a school that helps you make your mark on the school. obviously the occasional naive people are there but the teachers care about your wellbeing and care about your education. the majors and minors vary to fit anyone’s profession. there are dozens of events that happen Everyday including a movie night every Friday. The campus is vast but easily fitting for people who like a closeness. everything is nearby and it feels more like home. overall the school has a mass diversity of people for a predominantly white school, there are people of all shapes and sizes and ethnicities. the school is home to me, and it can be for you too."
Freshman,4,"On campus is amazing, classes are great, Professors are nice, funny, and relatable. Overall a great experience going there. Everyone is super social so it’s easy to make friends. Dorms are good other than some minor inconveniences in a few select dorms. My only complaint is when we stitched to online many professors didn’t make learning very user friendly, when taking for example a math test online the professor didn’t give extra time for the student to be able to type out the equations on canvas. If we have to continue online classes professors should work on making the classes more compatible for every student. Other than that Ball State is an amazing university and I made the right choice when I chose this school."
Senior,4,The classes are fantastic but some of the administration sucks. They take forever to respond to issues and even when they do their responses are lackluster.
Graduate Student,4,"I like the environment and most of the people around are friendly. The academics is very good. However, some students and professors are not racially friendly."
Freshman,4,"I didn't have any classes online, personally, so I wouldn't know how well the online class aspect would work"
Junior,4,"I love the classes I've taken and are taking for my anthropology major. My professors have been nothing but amazing and make the classes more enjoyable. I've also had the opportunity to gain experience working in an anthropology lab on campus and doing actual fieldwork, something that I strive to do after I graduate. As for the campus itself, I like it. It's easy to get from one place to another in a reasonable amount of time. My favorite thing about the campus is the food. There is also an area off-campus called the Village and I like going there to the little shops and restaurants just to get away from campus for a little bit."
Graduate Student,4,"Great experience. For students who like to push the envelope and really chase their dreams, Ball State bends over backwards to help students accomplish their wildest desires. I know this as someone who double-majored, double-minored, and studied abroad."
Freshman,4,I like how accepting Ball state is and how it tries to make you feel at home. I would like to see better parking at Ball state. You have to fight to get any type of parking.
Freshman,4,My experience here has been nice there are some flaws that comes with it like there not many things to do in the city of Muncie but overall the academics is awesome.
Freshman,4,"Ball State University became my home away from home, and made me feel important and cared for. I just wish I had been eligible for more scholarships."
Alum,4,Ball State is a great university with amazing professors who prepare you for working in the real world.  I also got the feeling that the professors really truly cared about the students and raising them to be the best that they can be.
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of the campus is strongly comforting and everyone is welcoming to those who are there. My experiences there so far have been very good!
Freshman,4,Ball State University has many amazing academic programs including mine - social studies teaching major. There are so many opportunities to get involved as well.
Freshman,4,"I love the vast amount of diversity when it comes to the student body, available courses, and student-run programs and organizations."
Niche User,4,"Ball State I actually had a tour there it was wonderful and I had a blast the food, dorms, professors everything there is excellent. Ball State is still on my list of colleges that I want to go to!"
Freshman,4,I like that they have a lot of opportunities if you go out and look for them and they are a campus that is concerned with your experience and grades. I just wish I had more help with the work and more people to talk too here about college as a whole.
Sophomore,4,"When I was picking colleges, I'm not going to lie, Ball State was not my first choice. However, they are very accommodating with scholarships and financial aid. The teachers actually care about their students (most of the time) and so do the upper advising division. Although Ball State was not my first choice, I would not change a thing because I love it here."
Freshman,4,"A good college for it's relatively low cost. Don't fall for premium plan 2-year housing, off campus housing is thousands of dollars cheaper so by sophomore year, you're way better off living off campus."
Alum,4,"Ball State was great academically, I felt like I had a good mix of class options and time options for my schedule. I was able to work full time while being a full time student. I at times had issues with the blackboard platform, however professors were generally helpful. I recently had a call with veterans affairs who gave very clear direction on my next steps in order to receive the correct benefits. I currently have employment in my chosen field and have elected to return for my masters."
Junior,4,"Initially when I came to Ball State I wasn't convinced that I was going to stay. It was far away from my parents and I didn't know anyone on campus given that maybe five kids from my graduating class are enrolled here. After a semester I was still tentative about staying, but slowly started to realize that I was setting up roots here on campus. I was making friends, I was making connections with Professors in my department, and most importantly I was successful as a student. The atmosphere here allowed me to flourish as a student and to produce some pieces of work that I am quite proud of, pieces I am not convinced I would have been able to produce without the encouragement and help of the professors here on campus. I overall very much enjoy Ball State and plan on attending Graduate School here as long as they will have me."
Sophomore,4,I like Ball State as a whole but they don't do much to help out people who are in need of financial aid
Freshman,4,"Ball State is a place where I've found great friends and and community, as well as I've been given the opportunity to learn more about music in a really great program."
Freshman,4,I love the campus. It's a great size and looks beautiful. It gives me a very home-like feeling. The students I have come in contact with here have all been nice. Most of the professors are wonderful. Some aren't very good.
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus and the many opportunities it gives. Also its not to far from home but far enough to get the whole college experience. I also liked how diverse and different it was. It wasn't to big but not small either, its a good size."
Freshman,4,Ball State has been a great school for me so far. There are a lot of great course options and all of my professors have been amazing.
Sophomore,4,"Great school, and I like that the classes feel like you are having a conversation.  You don't feel like it is a lecture.  However, some teachers will up and change the syllabus in the middle of the semester without notice to the students."
Sophomore,4,"Ball State University is kind of an average school. The campus is beautiful, the classes can be hard but they can also be really easy, and how nice or good the professor is just depends. I just like it because it's not hard to make friends and then during orientation they'll continuously say that it's a big campus with a small town feel or whatever which is honestly the most accurate description of Ball State. The only thing I hate is parking, how much parking tickets are, how frequently your account can be put on hold, and their outrageous persistence to strangle more money out of you."
Sophomore,4,"I like that Ball State has a small town feel to the campus, yet there are over 22,000 students, so you are not simply seeing the same students everyday. One improvement that could be made to campus is the amount of food options. Although the current options are outstanding, there is not much variety outside of the few dining facilities."
Junior,4,Ball State really makes it worth your money to attend. There are always free activities for students going on. Having smaller class sizes is also wonderful as you get the 1:1 student/teacher ratio that is crucial to a student's education. The campus is also beautiful in all seasons and incredibly safe.
Sophomore,4,It's a good school but everything often feels impersonal. There's not a lot to do unless you want to party.
Niche User,4,"I like ball state because its close to home, and some of my other family members have gone there in the past. And they gave it great reviews and said it was a great college. I went their myself for a college visit it was stunning the grand view of everything. The tour guide was very nice to us. They had massive dorms for their students to live in. The food court was really nice they had a assortment of everything. And their's a lot of interesting history behind the place. That's why i want to go to ball state university."
Sophomore,2,I had to finish my freshman year of ball state online due to a global pandemic. Yes it was new and not a lot of people understood what was going but it was very stressful. I only had one professor who made a schedule and stuck to it. some of my professors never answered my emails or did not have online lectures or any wording on how things were going to work. They would post stuff and basically it would be to figure it out yourself.
Graduate Student,2,"The programs are great but the university is dirty and there are a ton of hidden costs that the university does not tell students about,"
Junior,2,"Ball State offers a lot of choices as far as majors/minors are concerned and there are a ton of clubs you can join. However, Ball State seems to rarely give you a four year graduation plan so they can make more money, and I have personally noticed that no matter the subject of the courses you are taking, the professors will push their political agenda on you. Make sure your college has the best program for you, and to also find a place that aligns with your own politics. Otherwise you will be hearing the opposite constantly. 
Strangely enough, look at the transportation system. If you don't have your car by your dorm (which costs hundreds to do), then you will need to catch a bus to a far away parking lot. BSU will have you waiting at least a half hour for the bus you need or they will not have enough busses running so they're too full. 
Be careful and look at everything before you apply to Ball State University."
Junior,2,I am not a huge fan of Ball State. They will scam you out of certain scholarships and I do not feel as if there are many job or internship opportunities outside of Indiana for most majors. There is not good parking on campus and the food is not very good. The one thing I can say I enjoy about Ball State is the friends I've meet here.  But other than that there is not much to do on campus or in Muncie.
Junior,2,"We have some amazing professors, and dining is good (if very expensive.) I cannot give BSU 5 stars is because I have very  little reason to feel like I am valued as a student by the administration. Parking on campus is a nightmare for anyone who is not faculty because BSU will constantly give events and affairs priority over us. We have buildings with leaking roofs, most of our residence halls do not have air conditioning and the furniture is old, and there's an entire road on campus which is 99% potholes, but somehow BSU found the money to launch a re-branding, and buy a  $500,000 bus, build a new nursing building. The biggest slap in the face, I think, for me, is that they also gave away our foreign language lab to athletes to study in without even consulting the language department, and then immediately turned around and told us that ""The hallways are always open for studying."" 

If it were not for my professors, I would not be continuing my education here."
Freshman,2,"The campus is beautiful you cant deny that but i cant seem to be able to cal ball state home. Most of the students here are very cliquey and unfriendly, the brand new dorm I live in is already falling part to the point where nothing works and the education provided seem lack luster."
Niche User,2,"The university at the upper levels doesn't really care too much about its students.  You'll get a few decent teachers in your time there, but it's not a wholly good experience."
College Sophomore,2,"We aren't the best at the major sports so many people disregard them. They try to get people to come to the football, basketball, baseball, volleyball and other sports but we just aren't too notch. I would say we do have good school spirit and mabye is we get more attention to the sports we could be better."
College Sophomore,2,It costs a lot of money. It depends on what dorm you get whether or not you will have a nice area to live or a bad one. The bathrooms are not up to date and you have to shower in them every day so that is not fun. There are not many amenities. The social atmosphere can be fun if you are exposed to the right people.
College Sophomore,2,The sports are not good here. All of the sports are sub par and no one ever makes it really big and goes far. Students are involved in during football season and I'm pretty sure that's only for the tailgating. There is not much school spirit because no one ever wins much. The facilities are well kept up with and they look nice however.
College Junior,2,"The advisers do not always give good advice.  Most of the buildings look as if they have not been updated in over 20 years.  There are tables that look like they are falling apart.  The dining is AWFUL.  They are very greedy. Most of the ""grocery"" items they sell such as boxed mac&cheese costs at least 3 times as much as it does at the actual grocery.  Also, if you happen to be vegetarian or vegan GOOD LUCK finding a good meal.  Basically your options every day will be: pasta, pizza, salad, and SOMETIMES they will have a vegetarian soup out (how hard is it to have a vegetarian soup???)."
College Freshman,2,They dont have what I'm interested in and none of the predominately black frats have houses so I'm completely uninterested.
College Sophomore,2,The greek life at Ball State is huge and they treat the non-Greeks like they are boring and lazy. Some non-Greeks have to work for a living and support themselves. The Greek members don't understand this considering the fact that most of them have their parents to pay for everything.
Recent Alumnus,2,I personally don't like Greek life. The people who participate are all about drinking and partying and are extremely exclusive. I can always tell if a person is involved in Greek life because they tend to be snooty and materialistic.
College Sophomore,2,"Ball State was my last choice for what school I wanted to attend, but I chose to go because it was the best financial decision for me. I do not enjoy coming to campus and I can not wait to be finished with my degree."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of aid for out of state students.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the oldest, furthest housing complex on campus and do not get along well with the majority of girls on my floor so I am a bit bias but I am excited to move out with a new roommate into a more updated hall next year!"
College Sophomore,2,People do not attend games very often
College Freshman,2,"We are not a winning or placing team, however we have a mass amount of school spirit. Sporting events are usually fun to attend, and tailgating is strongly encouraged."
College Freshman,2,"Definitely not as good as I expected. Everything is BYOB, and a lot of parties are exclusive."
College Freshman,2,I received some but not enough financial aid from this school.
College Sophomore,2,"When it comes to Ball State, the only thing that matters is money. When I went to the office of Scholarships and Financial aid, the lady at the desk said to me, and I quote, ""You're gonna have to come up with some money."" Totally unhelpful."
College Freshman,2,Its bad because of the visitation. Other campuses ive been to anyone can walk into any other dorm without having someone who lives there with them
College Junior,2,"There are a few decent apartment complexes and two deluxe ones, but you pay an exorbitant amount for those. The other housing options are older houses that are behind in their upkeep."
College Junior,2,I think current administrators care more about the paycheck than the students.
College Junior,2,"The food that I have had on campus has been dreadful, but I know there are some people that really like it. I imagine they don't have taste buds."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is absolutely atrocious and makes me angry all the time. If they spent half the time they spent giving out tickets on enforcing the no alcohol policy campus would be much safer and people would be much more willing to pay citations when they actually did something wrong.
College Freshman,2,"My university is located in Muncie, Indiana and it's a small city about 45 minutes away from Indianapolis, Indiana. There isn't really much to do here but there are a lot of fast food and restaurants 5 minutes from campus and a Walmart 5 minutes from campus too. It's almost as if they placed all of the attractions and stores based on where the university is place. There isn't really much to do in Muncie and it's quite boring at times and the mall is pretty small and the city ins't nearly diverse from where I am from but it's tolerable."
College Freshman,2,"Muncie is a scary town. The locals are very strange, but it is a college town so they have a lot of pride."
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares about Ball State athletics which is very annoying. This school lacks so much school pride, it's so disappointing. The facilities are nice and the athletes are good, though."
College Senior,2,"For me personally, it is so difficult to actually talk to someone regarding financial aid. The office always has their phones busy and when I do get to discuss it, they are very short with me."
College Junior,2,"I chose BSU because I understood they had one of the best TCOM programs and it was validated by David Letterman graduating from there. I transferred over having already earned my Associate degree and a Certificate of General Studies, yet I still had to take a math, science, history, English, physical education, a foreign language. All of my credits transferred, but because I took Art History, American History, and US History, none of which were World History, I had to waste more time and money to take World History. I wasted a whole year taking additional courses in order to satisfy the degree requirements for BSU, when I had already earned my Associates. I thought going to a 2 year college first would put me ahead, and it actually put me behind as a 5th year senior. The programs are set up based on faculty needs and not the students. The TCOM path only allows you to take certain classes and certain times, and you have to take them all in order. For me (being a transfer student), this messed things up. I was forced to take unnecessary courses in order to stay full time because I had already taken the general courses (of course not including the ones BSU requires you to retake just because it was a different history, they should all count for the humanities credit), and I couldn't take more TCOM courses to fill my schedule because you ""can't take this, until you take that...but you can't take that, until you take this"". In the end, it will take me over 2 years, AFTER HAVING AN ASSOCIATES just because the way the TCOM program is set up at BSU and the other nonsense requirements that BSU has."
College Freshman,2,"Not too much to do downtown, just in the village."
College Freshman,2,Ball State doesn't really make a big deal about home games except football games.
College Freshman,2,"I feel most of the people here, freshman at least, have little clue what they are doing for the most part. They seem uninspired and unfocused."
College Junior,2,Students are all about getting into sororities and fraternities but then they expected to not associate with anyone who is not in a sorority or fraternity. They're socially segregating students without even realizing it. They're paying for popularity.
College Junior,2,"The athletics facilities are great. What they don't tell you is that the athletes get first priority when it comes to registration. I'm a junior and I don't play sports. I have many other responsibilities and organizations that I work my schedule around. That doesn't make me any less important. The fair thing to do would be registering by the number of credit hours completed, not the athletes first just because they schedule around practice. We all have a life outside of school that needs to be accommodated."
College Freshman,2,If I could move Ball State out of Muncie I would. I love Ball State but the city only has shops and the transportation is nice. The MITS bus is free for students. The city does not have a lot of events.
College Sophomore,2,The parties are okay but most of the time they are trashy and so are the people who attend them. They best ones to go to are the laid back parties with close friends.
College Senior,2,everything is done on our own there isn't much guidance or help from the school.
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to get to dining without a car.
College Senior,2,I hated living on campus.
College Senior,2,Every year there is an issue with my financial aid.
College Senior,2,The city of Muncie only survives because of Ball State.  Ball State is what keeps the city a float.  There isn't much to do as far as fun for students. We have to create our own fun which can be bad after awhile.
College Sophomore,2,The area is bad to say the least. The locals are usually not too friendly or approachable.
College Freshman,2,"The variety in food is currently not great, however some newer local food places are opening up along with some additional chain restaurants so it might improve in the future."
College Freshman,2,The campus has very little intermingling of different ethnic groups. The groups that do form are very clique and are not usually open to accepting others from differing backgrounds into their groups.
College Junior,2,The parking services are far from a service.
College Freshman,2,This past winter literally couldn't have been worse. They even cancelled classes for 2 days. We also had to make the days up like little high school kids which was completely stupid. No other school in the area had to make up cancelled day. That was B.S.
College Junior,2,"Parking can be quite a pain in the butt unless you have connections or a parking pass. When I lived on campus, I used to park at a friends house. Once I moved off campus, I decided to just suck it up and pay for the commuter parking pass. Whether or not if you own a parking pass, there is never a guarantee on finding parking."
College Sophomore,2,Campus Police are always looking to give out tickets. It's not safe to leave your car anywhere unattended for even 5 minutes. It's really annoying; especially if you just need to unload your car after leaving home or going shopping.
College Sophomore,2,Campus parking is terrible. The school makes it impossible to find a spot anytime of the regular week and constantly patrol to give out parking tickets. The only redeeming quality is the fact these rules are lifted on the weekend.
College Freshman,2,"I hate walking in the rain, everything is soaking wet. Campus is like prime flooding zone. The snow doesn't really matter anymore because they are going to make us go to class no matter what. The rain is what bothers me most."
College Sophomore,2,"People party a lot at night, but that's definitely not the scene for me. I hangout on campus with friends and play wallyball at the rec center and order pizza."
College Freshman,2,The windiest and coldest place I have ever lived... Im from freaking Chicago..
College Freshman,2,The reason why there is so much underage drinking at BSU is because this school is so inconvenient for students.
College Freshman,2,"For all of Ball States Illustrious Alumni, not one of em has contributed to the ease of student life here."
College Senior,2,"Since I did my undergraduate work at Indiana University, Ball State is very lacking in this area compared to IU."
College Sophomore,2,Muncie weather is just bad... and classes have been canceled a lot so far
College Sophomore,2,Parking is expensive and its extremely hard to get a good permit that is close to campus. Also they are really strict about ticketing especially in the red lots.
Alum,1,"Ball State University did not prepare me for a job in my field of study.  Not only that, but much of their campus is strictly progressive."
College Senior,1,I got no scholarships even though I have about a 3.48/3.5 out of a 4.0 GPA! I couldn't believe it! Im constantly broke and can't go out with friends or do anything fun!
College Freshman,1,"I did not receive any financial aid because I do not qualify, so it is very frustrating and hard to find scholarships as a college freshman."
College Senior,1,Hated living on campus. Overpriced and horrible.
College Freshman,1,It's an outgoing process that I've been dealing with for months now and my school is very strict and ask for tons of documents and papers to fill out for financial aid yet take forever to complete and notify me that everything has been submitted and misplace documents easily.
College Freshman,1,"Ball state doesn't seem to have many scholarship opportunities. This is disappointin because I come from a middle class family and although I apoly for all the finanfinancial aid I can find, I have not received any. It's hard to work part time and have my parents pay for my full time schooling. It's a lot to handle fresh out of high school and it's unfair."
College Freshman,1,I hate parties and I hate the attitude of the people who party; college should not be a place for these events.
College Junior,1,Internships are almost impossible to find in my major.  They are hard to apply for as well.
College Sophomore,1,"This is honestly the only bad thing that I can say about the school. It is very expensive and for someone who doesn't receive financial aid it makes a big burden on my family. I receive no pell grant money and i have both stafford loans as well as the parent plus loan and thats only enough money specifically for my tuition. I had to pay 11,000 dollars out of my mothers savings account for housing last semester and can't do that this semester so I'm stuck."
College Junior,1,WORST PART OF BALL STATE
College Freshman,1,"Muncie funcie! That's the biggest lie. Muncie sucks. If Ball State wasn't there, this town would not even be a spot on the map. There is nothing to do there except drink and party, so if you are underage, it's pretty boring. But hanging out ON campus is fun. Oh, and the mall (which is one of the only fun things to do besides going to Walmart) is a terrible mall."
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Ball State is absolutely absurd. The lack of spots is stressful enough, and it's even worse that the campus police are so strict about the time slots when we can park on campus. I had a friend park and go inside her room to grab something and went right back out and had received a ticket because it wasn't 7:00 yet. We should be able to park our cars for five minutes without the fear of getting a ticket. Ball State already scams us for our money in multiple ways, and I feel that ticketing us for every god-given parking mistake is outrageous. I almost got a ticket on a Sunday where I was parked in front of Stu West after the weekend and I was unloading my car. I walked out to my car a little after 7:00 and a lady was about to give me a ticket. There is no reasons I should not be able to unload my car on the weekend without the fear of getting a ticket."
College Freshman,1,the most inconvenient housing I have ever lived in.
College Freshman,1,Greek life and all the people in it at BSU are a bunch of elitists and are a useless waste of space.
College Freshman,1,"By far, Muncie is the most dysfunctional city I have ever lived in.  The traffic is unbearably annoying, nobody in this city likes Ball State students, it is hands down the worst town possible to have a University in."
College Freshman,1,I didn't receive any money from Ball State.
College Freshman,1,the weather sometimes makes it hard for me to get to  class on time and sometimes I get sick just walking from one class to the next.
College Sophomore,1,I pay nearly $200 to park my car about a mile away from my dorm and I travel frequently and I sometimes don't have somewhere to park my car while putting my stuff in it because I might get a ticket. It's absolutely insane. The BSU parking services is like their own little bank with hidden fees.
College Sophomore,1,You won't know if people are into drugs unless you know them personally
College Senior,1,"I have receive a number of student loans through Ball State, but I've never had any luck receiving any scholarships. I've applied many times to many scholarships and I have never heard back from any of the programs. I guess you just have to be extra special, and not only in dire need of funds."
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful, the price is more here than at any University I have visited.  The parking is also not convenient, the most convenient spaces re metered and most students would rather use a parking spot rather than a parking meter.  Also, if any situation occurs that requires your car to be in an ""unauthorized"" spot i.e., not where your parking pass allows, you will receive a $95 ticket, which is also more expensive than other Universities I have visited.  If you come here, ALWAYS follow parking rules, they will drain your bank account otherwise."
College Freshman,1,There was a lot of alcohol and pressure to drink.  There was also a lot of drug use in the dorms.  It didn't seem like anyone cared about the drug use or alcohol abuse when  I went to school there.
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. Not only are commuters forced to park at the farthest points on campus, but most of them are covered in pot holes, or unpaved entirely!"
College Senior,1,The cost of the parking permits are too high. Parking locations are not that bad. If you live in a dorm you may get a chance to park near it but spaces are very limited.
College Sophomore,1,The parking is expensive and it is way far out and good luck getting a spot near your dorm because as a freshman you get the farthest parking.
College Freshman,1,They are very snappy when it comes to finaid and a lot of students despise the bursar office as well as the academic office in Lucina hall. They have awful customer service and very seldom do they actually help you
College Sophomore,1,"Police are completely intolerant of underage drinking, and difficult with drinking in general unless you are at the bars. My third day at Ball State (classes hadn't started yet) I got hit with a minor consumption and only blew a 0.001. Ball State is a dry campus so don't try that. Some dorms are 21+ though. Although its very strict here, just mind your own business and don't be obnoxious and don't get in a care if you've been drinking. Even with a sober driver. Lots of K-9 in the village too."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking permits are reasonable in cost. Yet, the parking is mostly designated off campus and on the streets of Muncie. Parking anywhere that is not designated for you, or overdue for the meter for more thn three minutes and you get a ticket. Hard to park anywhere unless you are in your personal parking lot."
College Freshman,1,Campus life kind of feels like a prison. You have to check in all the time and have to sign guests in if you want to have a friend stay the night. I think we are adults and can decide if we want to have a friend spend the night.
College Freshman,1,The police are very strict on policies. Students should follow the policies perfectly if they do not want a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,Muncie seems like a college town; everything is mostly geared to appeal to young adults. The other residents of the town seem to be low on an economic scale.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is very stressful. There are never open spots and being a freshman, I experience the worst parking places. I think Ball State should add another parking garage that costs a minimal amount of money that any student on campus can use. The longer the student intends to park there, the more they pay. It would be a great idea and the University could benefit from this investment."
College Freshman,1,"Many Muncie residents are happy to have Ball State in town, but there are few attractions outside of Ball State.  The campus has a lot to do on it."
College Freshman,1,"I received a scholarship that payed for a third of my tuition. I received little financial aid money, and I'm still in the process of paying for first semester's tuition. This has caused problems for me because I can't register for second semester courses until the rest of this money is paid. I suggest you apply for scholarships and financial aid way before it comes time to go to college."
College Freshman,1,Drugs and Alcohol possesion will get you kicked off campus immediately
College Freshman,1,"People generally stick with their friends from back home and don't really go out of that group to meet new people.  If you know no one and get stuck with a roommate you don't get along with when you come here, it's really hard to make friends."
College Freshman,1,"The transportation around campus and the surrounding neighborhood is good.  However, there's no inexpensive way to get home.  I come from out of state and live 4 hours away.  I don't have a car.  Total roundtrip for me to come home would be a little over $100, and that's taking the cheapest transportation."
College Sophomore,1,Transfers Take Forever – I get a decent amount of fin-aid but the process to get them into you're account takes forever! I didn't even get mine till 2 weeks after school started! what's worse is that the fin-aid office always has a 2 hour line just after school starts.
College Sophomore,1,I have been on a waiting list for 2 years to try to get on campus parking. I have to park out in the boonies of the stadium and it is terrible
College Student,1,The transportation is awful and expensive. You have to park at the football field and take a bus to your dorm which takes forever and is crowded and too much money for what you get
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is fine if you have a pass. Oh and if you have money to pay for that pass. Not having said pass will result in hefty fines and a disgruntled student :(
College Sophomore,1,Money Money – The only negative thing about my school is the financial aid process. I am really struggling to pay for college and my parents are only helping a certain degree but because my dad makes X amount of dollars my school gives me NOTHING. I am a Deans Honor roll student and work really hard at applying for scholarships but never get anything. They could change things a bit.
College Freshman,1,"My School Experience – If I could do it all over again, I would not choose Ball State. It is not very diverse and there is rarely anything to do. The Bursar employees don't try to work with the students as far as paying bills and I didn't feel a connection to that school. My favorite experience was Homecoming Weekend."
College Freshman,1,Grab an Umbrella – Muncie Indiana is KNOWN for rain. It is gloomy here almost all the time. If you come to campus without an umbrella you are going to be out of luck. It makes it hard to get out and motivated sometimes.
College Freshman,1,"The police and staff here at Ball State are notorious at Ball state for popping out of nowhere when you think you are safe from a parking ticket. Whether it is 5 minutes, or 5 hours, you will need at least a quarter readily available for a parking meter here at Ball State. The best way to describe the parking is ""first come, first serve."" There are many spots, but just about twice as many cars. The transportation office is very strict to the rules, and although new incoming freshman get ""Oops tickets"" they only count towards certain types of tickets. I quickly learned this when I was 10 minutes late to move my car from the stadium on a Friday before a game and recieved a tow ticket, which is where the freshman park their cars. This is if they are lucky and can park it in the main lot closest to the stadium and do not need to use the two huge overflow lots located across the road from the stadium. It seems like Ball State needs an overflow lot for the overflow lot. The Stadium is also a far distance from any residence hall, so many students take the shuttle buses to get to their parked cars. Commuters get their own special parking passes, and lots that are available to park in from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Of coarse there are staff parking, and the usual handicapped parking for accessible vehicles."
College Freshman,1,"The police at Ball State are always readily available...especially when you need to park your car in a metored spot for a total of two minutes but can not find 45 cents. They take care of the parking infractions immediately. There are also a lot of undercover police officers ready to catch the students at parties nursing beers. In Short, they are moderately strict here. Underage drinking is not something they mess around with. Getting caught drinking in the dorm can lead to expulsion or being kicked out of the residence halls. Tips on how to not get caught, avoid yelling about the Vodka Bottle you've stached in your 2 foot tall mini fridge, because the rooms do get searched."
College Sophomore,1,"During the fall and Spring, it rains like cats and dogs! Sometimes I think I'm going to have to take a cruise to get to my classes the next morning. The winter is cold and we often have slick sidewalks so you may want to leave for class early. The summer has lovely, nice weather!"
College Senior,1,"Tickets Galore – My freshman year I got almost $500 in parking tickets.  This is not rare.  Parking Services is a bit of a devil on campus - ask anyone.  They are hard to reason with and do nothing all day but drive around giving as many tickets as possible.  Parking is usually far from any academic buildings, and metered parking by the buildings is available for 45 minutes when classes last for 50 minutes - and it is guaranteed that Parking Services will give you at least one ticket during those five minutes."
College Senior,1,I don't know of anyone who received adequate financial aid from Ball State.  Apply for plenty of outside scholarships and be from Indiana to get in-state tuition or else it is really not worth it.
College Senior,1,"Alcohol Is Everywhere – Most people I know who attend Ball State come in sober.  At least five of my friends have had breakdowns due to drugs and alcohol and are now addicts to both.  Everyone drinks every single weekend, and if you try and drive any day after ten, you will have to avoid hitting drunk people.  Smoking pot is everywhere on campus, and drunk people - even drunk drivers - are frequently seen at any time of day during the entire week."
College Senior,1,"Not Worth What You Pay – Apartments around Muncie are reasonably priced - if they were in a big town like Indy instead of tiny little Muncie.  For the price you pay, you get a rundown apartment with plenty of problems that you can rarely convince your landlord to fix.  Much easier to just suck it up and live on campus.  You end up spending a lot more money for a lot less in return."
College Freshman,1,"Most incoming freshman seem to think that they need to bring a car to school, especially if they had one in high school. But the hassle of having a car at school is not worth it. Most freshman are forced to park in the lot by the football feild, which is on the north side of campus away from all the dorms and academic buildings. The cars also have to be moved on nights of a football game. The community provides a bus service that travels all around town and is free to students, so why hassle with the car permit and the walk to and from your car if you can just hop on the bus?"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dependent Housing – Housing for married students or students with families is not affordably priced. The apartments are priced based on the idea that each bedroom will pay a portion of the rent. If you have children, the full cost falls on the parent, and the prices are not very reasonable."
College Student,1,"Not Much Racially – There aren't that many minorities on campus. For example, African-Americans made up on 6% of the overall population. The University is trying to become more diverse racially. However, I'm not confident that it will ever happen."
College Junior,1,"No School Spirit – I won most school spirited in High School. I may have chosen the least spirited school at Ball State. Sure people like to say ""Chirp, Chirp"" for their Cardinals, but attendance at games is pathetic. I love cheering but, it is a chore to go to a game here."
College Sophomore,1,This Is Not Okay – Transportation SUCKS! The buses are always overcrowded and take forever especially when you need them.
College Freshman,1,Freshmen who live on campus are basically forced to park at the stadium which is a mile or more from the Residence Halls. This and the horribly unreliable shuttle system force students to stay on campus as opposed to exploring the city. Going home over breaks is absolutely a hassle as well.
College Senior,1,"Permit or Ticket!! Around here if you don't have a parking pass to park on campus, you will get a ticket! It's usually a $80 fine, and don't make them have to tow your vehicle, because that's another additional $75. There's pretty much not talking your way out of a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at Ball state is terrible, their is a lack of parking spaces and the parking enforcement officers are very strict and are good at finding violators."
College Senior,1,"DO NOT Park on Campus – Ball State University parking services brought in over $300,000 last year with parking tickets alone.  Ball State University has the worst on campus parking set up I have ever seen.  In the 4 years I have been at Ball State, I have received more then 20 parking tickets.  I never drive to class and I rarely park on campus in general and I have still managed to rack up these debts.  It almost seems as if they are hunting to tickets.  And if you're considering parking in a parking lot of in the village for over an hour, you better think again.  The tow trucks are always busy and looking for violators."

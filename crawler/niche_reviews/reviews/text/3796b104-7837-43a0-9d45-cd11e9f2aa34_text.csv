Sophomore,5,"I like it! The registrar workers are often hard to work with, they are not interested in helping you to find the resources you need. The professors are AMAZING. It is an all inclusive school with plenty of diversity and mutual respect. It is also a cute, comfortable school where I feel very safe and I feel like I can grow. The amount of security that Saint Rose has is also very comforting to say the least. Saint Rose definitely feels like home. 
A comfy, cozy, accepting school where there is lots to see and experience nearby in the city. The staff are helpful and kind. They do whatever they can to help you which is one reason I love this school. It is a very dependable school. It is also very expensive. But I have not encountered any problems while attending this school and do not expect to for the rest of my time here. I plan on staying all four years. I am excited to see where the College of Saint Rose takes me!"
Niche User,5,Amazing staff to help you out especially when transferring or being a non-traditional student. People are very friendly as well and everyone makes you feel welcomed. The classes are fairly small so if you are struggling the professor can help you a lot compared to a big campus or seminar-style classes at bigger colleges.
Junior,5,A fantastic environment and small classroom sizes which allows for a more personalized learning experience.
Freshman,5,I cant wait to see what my future brings me  at the college. Im so excited to be takeing my higher educattion here

Sophomore,5,"The College of Saint Rose is a place for any student that wants to feel like they are part of a tight knit community. From athletics to clubs to class, the college provides a connection between the students that makes for a family like environment! The faculty and staff are extremely helpful and kind. Each professional on the campus is there to see you succeed and grow as you continue your education!"

The food is pretty good, the staff is friendly and happy, and the dorms are homey. I received a fantastic education at Saint Rose, and there are plenty of avenues to do so."
Alum,5,"I spent 6 years at Saint Rose as an out of state student, 4 years for undergrad and 2 for grad school. Plenty of opportunities to get involved in student life, athletics and academic groups. I was a secondary education major and I felt very confident going into the teaching profession after my education. The professors were great and most of them genuinely wanted to help you any way they could. The level of knowledge I received for my career at this school is above any I’ve seen in my home state or from state school. I’m so happy I got both my degrees from saint rose! I loved the campus and the off campus life around the area. Definitely a fun party scene if that’s your thing. If not, still a great area! I always felt safe on campus and in dorms."
Alum,5,"Great College, has been expanding in all areas.  Sports - academics- student life all enjoyable.  The culture of each student has a lot of skill.  Music performances are a great time,  student perform throughout the week.  Keep building your education - check out a great experience come to St Rose."
Junior,5,Professors and administration are always so helpful and understanding. I never have an unanswered question and someone is always willing to assist the students in any way they can.
Sophomore,5,This campus is a excellent place to be because there is no place like saint rose. It has full academic programs that are available that fits the students needs. It brings out attention and plenty of activities and sports and etc to do in this campus
Freshman,5,"The professors are absolutely great! People that I have met there are so helpful and friendly. The dorms are okay, not the best. Campus is amazing and has a lot of activities to offer. Small class sizes make the education experience inside the classroom personalized. The education department is outstanding! I would highly recommend this school to perspective students!"
Freshman,5,"the college of saint rose is a welcoming and exciting place to go to college, with a wide selecting of activities to choose from as well as professors that take the time to actually help you both in class and 1 on 1."
Graduate Student,5,What I liked about the College of Saint Rose is the quality of education.  It is challenging but prepares you for your field.  The class sizes are small and the teachers are dedicated.  Employers that are aware of Saint Rose know that if they hire a graduate from school they are getting someone who will soon become a leader in their field.
Freshman,5,I think Saint Rose college is an Phenomenal school for all different walks of like . Saint Rose is very big on different types of support academically. Lastly I think Saint Rose is a great school to attend .
Sophomore,5,"The College of Saint Rose is home. Small class sizes allow for a more personalized educational experience. There's so much to do in the capital, you will never be bored."
Sophomore,5,"The staff and students  are so welcoming. The campus is small, which makes the classes smaller and more one on one with the professors which makes learning much more enjoyable"
Freshman,5,The College of Saint Rose is a great 4 year college that creates a local small town feel while still being in a huge city. The atmosphere of the college is excellent and all of the people on campus are nice and pleasant. It is a college for everybody. There is a large party scene due to U Albany so this is something to take into consideration. Overall it is a great school with a great return on your investment. Highly recommend.
Alum,5,Perfect small college with lots of growing opportunities. Professors were phenomenal and always willing to work with you. Lots of things to do and eat in surrounding areas.
Senior,5,"I liked the small class ratio. The professors were available rapidly, and had many office hours. There were facilities that had computer access 24/7. Usually freshman dorming is not always the best, but by my junior year, I lived comfortably in an apartment with 3 of my other friends. Maintenance was very reliable with either snow removal or fixing complications. Security walked me back to my room if needed, helped me jump start my car and unlocked my room door various times. Midnight madness was my favorite part of saint rose. It was a pep rally for the students and every year it was packed and enthusiastic. What I would like to see on campus is more diversity."
Freshman,5,"The college of Saint Rose is a amazing school to attend. The professors are really great, the campus is Great and the living conditions are great as well. The only thing that i can say is that this college is really really expensive and I would have to apply for a lot of scholarships due to the tuition, room and board and meal plan."
Niche User,5,What I like about of the college of Saint Rose was the culture that they have for there students . Also the programs that they have set for students who need help academically such as the AOE program . Also Saint Rose has a diversity rate that fits in with my requirements for college campus
Junior,5,"The professors are always willing to help, I love the educational experiences I have had. My major is Communication Sciences and Disorders, and I truly have nothing bad to say against the program or the professors that are there helping me achieve my goals. This semester I have the chance to travel abroad with one of my classes and I am thrilled to be a part of this experience!"
Freshman,5,"I really like it here! Lots of really nice people and a very good learning environment. Small class sizes and lots of opportunities, plus a very central location!"
Niche User,5,"Went on a college visit, and absolutely fell in love with this college. the atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for."
Senior,5,I enjoy the club and athletic opportunities along with the small class sizes.  I would just change the food options.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and full of nice and supportive students and staff. I have received all the help I need throughout the process of selecting this college and a major. The faculty is very quick to answer emails asking for help and support. I enjoy the many opportunities I have on campus to have a fulfilling college life and career.
Freshman,5,"I love the environment at Saint Rose. It is a small, comforting, warm community. The classes are small which is great."
College Freshman,5,great staff and faulty. amazing backgrounds and education.
College Freshman,5,It's a very warm and welcoming school! They do their best to give you the housing you want and the roommate you want. Their professors and outstanding and actually get to know their students on a personal base.
College Freshman,5,I haven't yet started but I can already tell that this is an institute where they care more about your comprehension of your major than just you passing the tests and getting a good grade. Professors actually take the time to get to know you personally and are more than willing to give you what you need. This in addition to all the campus life that the school has really gives you an at home feeling.
College Sophomore,5,Student career center is a big help!
College Sophomore,5,"I really love this school, and the professors are so nice and really help understand the subject they passionately care about teaching"
College Freshman,5,Saint Rose is a great school.  Their women's soccer team is amazing and their other sports are good too.  Very friendly professor that care about you succeeding and understanding the subject.  I love it.
College Junior,5,The education program here is easily among the best anywhere.
College Junior,5,"Love my major, and all of my professors. Really appreciate smaller sized classes because of the one on one attention you can receive to succeed."
College Sophomore,5,if you know people or you can find a party(fairly easy) its really awesome but you need to be careful because things can go bad in an instant.
College Sophomore,5,albany honestly is the best place to try food. theres a vartiey of different cruisines and most deliver until about 2am some later. albany pizza is the best
Recent Alumnus,5,"Lima Hall, 908 Madison (McCarthy Hall),and Maginn Hall are great! The people in the Res Life office are awesome!"
College Freshman,5,Ualbany greek life is lit
College Freshman,5,The facilities are above average.
College Freshman,5,Chicken joes and the pizza around are great
College Freshman,5,I got a lot of money and only had an 81 weighted high school avg
College Freshman,5,"Delicious food, especially at the Washington Tavern."
College Freshman,5,Followed through on everything they said they would do
College Freshman,5,"I love all of the halls, especially since they have an ""at home"" atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,Ruby's (sushi)  and Chicken Joes! Both places are very cheap and tasty!!
College Freshman,5,Huge financial aid/scholar packets given up front!
College Student,5,"Their are so many opportunities for students here.  I am in the CSD program, and all of the faculty is so helpful.  I haven't had any problems.  They challenge students, but are always there to help."
College Senior,5,Many different scenes and options available. Either a short walk or bus ride a way depending on where you like to go. Very strict about proper identification and age.
College Senior,5,"Always circling campus, on watch.. Will help you with any questions. Most are very friendly and helpful."
College Senior,5,Always things to do on or off campus. Many other higher ed. schools around to interact with
College Sophomore,5,it's Albany! It's a city you'll bond to find something to do
College Sophomore,5,"The college does whatever they can to make sure you enjoy your major, the professors are reasonable and love what they do and starting your Junior year you'll get an internship for your major so you'll be able to get some experience."
College Senior,5,there are RAs in every building. as freshmen guest have to sign in. its best to live off campus and do whatever u want. too many rules.
College Senior,5,campus it very safe. sometimes we have lockdowns. practice fire drills regularly. safety courses in the beginning of the semester
Recent Alumnus,5,I received a great Transfer Scholarship and a lot of Federal and State financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The campus is pretty lenient when it comes to school policies. As long as your arent making a lot of noise in your dorm, the RA's dont really bother you. Saint Rose is a wet campus so technically if youre over 21 youre allowed to have alcohol in your room."
Sophomore,4,"The College of Saint Rose is an amazing school for education. Although this school has a very open campus, with it being divided onto two main roads, security tries to make it as safe as possible for students."
Junior,4,"Over all it’s a very nice school with a big sense of community. Class sizes are decent and professors are willing to answer questions both in and out of a classroom setting. The school could be more diverse when it comes to the professors, but all in all it’s a diverse campus."
Junior,4,"Being a biology major is hard but the College of Saint Rose made it challenging, but in the right way for my future endeavors."
Junior,4,The online experience at the College of Saint Rose is very straight forward and interactive. Being able to have the online experience also helps for much more than school it can help with computer skills for the future.
Freshman,4,"I love The College of Saint Rose! I am a Forensic Psychology major, and the classes in St Rose are amazing. All my professors made it easy for me to communicate with them if I had any trouble, and they made learning so much fun."
Freshman,4,"Due to the COVID-19, I had to take online classes for the last 2 and a half months left of the Spring semester. My professors made taking these classes extremely easy by keeping in contact with their students and being available all the time."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors were great but social life was not great.                                                                         
Food was okay but could have been better
Res life is annoying and takes there jobs too seriously. Some play favorites."
Graduate Student,4,Online classes were a lot easier and professors were more lenient. Harder to learn from but overall they were okay
Alum,4,"At the College of Saint Rose, the class sizes are no greater than around 40/50 students which is something that I really liked. I was able to gain a relationship with my professors and felt comfortable with all of them."
Junior,4,The faculty are incredible. They care so much about their work and their students. There are plenty of opportunities for personal and academic growth.  The campus area is lovely and there's a lot to do.
Alum,4,The professors were great! The school had a lot of vast resources and always answered any questions or concerns that I had. The dorms were good and the campus was always clean. I always felt safe on campus. The professors handed back assignments on time.
Junior,4,The school is very helpful when I applied. The are quick to answer any questions and they are very supportive. Plus they give many gifts to you through your journey on becoming a knight. They make it hard to transfer credits but you can easily fight them on it and a few signatures and you will be all set.
Junior,4,Faculty advisors are not as educated on the advising process as they should be. There are lots of spaces to spend time on campus and it doesn’t feel like being in the center of a capital city. The campus food is good and abundant. Professors are kind and care about student outcomes while remaining firm.
Junior,4,"I transferred to The College of Saint Rose last fall and overall, I've had nothing but positive things to say! The professors are so genuine, and because the class sizes are small it is fairly easy to make an effort to get to know your professors on a personal level. I have found that to be extremely important in order to truly succeed and it makes the college experience that much better."
Freshman,4,I visited the campus and felt like home. It's a small campus but everyone is so kind and feels like family.
Freshman,4,"The teachers are always willing to help us and they make themselves available to us. Being on campus is nice and there is so many things for us to do from concerts, to shows and events."
Niche User,4,"I will be attending the college of Saint Rose this coming fall of 2019 and so far it's been a great experience. The amount of communication between students and faculty is staggering, there is always help with everything you need and you are always helped with guides on how to navigate school, it also provides very detailed information about it's courses giving you many opportunities as an incoming student to get to know the school staff as well as the classes you would be studying. An overall great experience."
Freshman,4,It's a very small school so it's a close community and you alway feel cared for. They do what they can to help you cover costs and keep you enrolled in the school as well.
Sophomore,4,The college of st. Rose is a beautiful small college that doesn’t have crowed class rooms.  The food could be a lot better.  You get to meet alit great people and here.
Junior,4,"The College of Saint Rose is a very comfortable, helpful, accepting school. I love it here. I recommend my friends from high school come to Saint Rose because it’s great. I have heard some unsettling things about majors being cut, but other than that, the professors and students and even the other people who work here are great. Perry and Annie are both amazing people who work at Saint Rose and make everyone’s day better just by seeing them! The variety of food is a plus as well. This school is great and I’m glad to be getting my education here. I feel like I’m learning from the best, my professors are great. It’s so much more diverse than my high school and I appreciate that so much. All of the events including sports and club events are so fun and inspiring! The campus is so beautiful and welcoming, I feel safe and at home here."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Rose is a small school but the sense of home and community consume you when you walk onto campus. It is the perfect school for students who love being involved and making a difference. The classes are great and the teachers really care. The amount of resources are endless, as long as you take advantage of it. Not every school is perfect, Saint Rose still has it's way to go in order approve but I enjoy the time that I have when I am there."
Junior,4,"The campus is pretty in the spring and fall, but is tiny. You can walk around the whole school in 20 minutes. Professors are good"
Alum,4,"As a daily commuter, I wish that I became more envolved in school to have the college experience. I really made no friends at all, but I did love that the class size was so small. Since it is so small, you normally have the same students in classes as you, so it was nice to see familiar and friendly people. The teachers for the most part were awesome, too. Expensive though."
Freshman,4,"I love it there! Everyone is so nice and helpful. The only thing is the price but they still give you butt loads of money. Overall, it's a great college."
Senior,4,"The College of Saint Rose has taught me more about the world and my own life than I had ever dreamed of knowing. The professors are wholly devoted to educating students to the best of their abilities, and prepares alumni to enter the work force or continue on to graduate school. The administration has been tumultuous over the past couple of years, but the students are not affected much by these changes. The education is solid, and thorough. The dorms are clean and big, and the atmosphere is homey."
Junior,4,The facility is like no other. The small school atmosphere allows for a deeper student teacher connection that sets Saint Rose apart from many other academic institutions.
Niche User,4,Saint Rose is a very great college. For many different reasons. First of which is how everyone just welcomes you when on a campus tour or just visiting. For this Im very excited to attend here next fall.
Sophomore,4,"I have never toured The College of Saint Rose before my first day as an official undergraduate Freshman. On my first day I was very nervous but as I started moving into my dorm, I felt very welcomed by a group of upperclassman, who gave a helping hand when moving in, along with the security, Resident assistance and the Resident coordinator. All my anxious feeling have been thrown out the window and I was ready to start off my day as a Freshman at The College of Saint Rose. I started my freshman year as a ""undecided"" major. Staff and professors became very helping in guiding me to where I would declare my major in the future and I am now a Biology major and absolutely enjoy it. Professors are great, helpful and answer any questions you may have. I would recommend this school to friends, family and anyone who is seeking options when applying."
Junior,4,"I like the small classes that we do have here, you get to have one-on-one discussions with your professor. Professors are willing to learn with the students and expand on other topics. My experience so far has be good."
Senior,4,"At The College of Saint Rose I have had an amazing experience. My classes are so small that I am allowed to created relationships with all the students as well as the teacher. I have never been to a huge public school so the transition into college was very easy for me. Your advisors are also very attentive and want to make sure you do graduate within 4 years. Although the cost of attendance may be high, the schools financial aid office will work with you to make this the best experience possible. The campus is very small but since it is placed in the middle of downtown Albany it creates a metro feel as if I was still in New York City. This college is whatever you make it. It can be the best 4 years of your life or the most boring. I am glad I picked this college to gain an immense amount of education, friends, and life experiences."
Freshman,4,So I'm a first year Freshmen. The presentations they have at the school is welcoming. They have open arms and work hard to have students want to come to their college. Financial Aid is a little difficult but if you know what you are doing and talk to the right people that you know can help you. It's all worth it.
Junior,4,"Expensive, but the campus is beautiful and the community is incredible. It feels like everyone is friends with everyone at Saint Rose. The faculty are always willing to help, even if they aren't your professors! Saint Rose is worth the money, and it will always feel like home to me."
Sophomore,4,"I just transferred from a  local community college in the area to St Rose. I have not yet attended but since I've applied  and been accepted into the college I have interacted with only kind hearted, nice, and caring people. I am very excited to start this new journey in my life this coming fall, and I can't wait to meet ev I am very excited to start this new journey in my life this coming fall, and I can't wait to meet new people."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the College of Saint Rose this past fall and spring semester was a good/stressful/ different experience for me. The students and the faculty were very friendly and inviting. The classes were good I learned a lot. Of course when the semesters were ending it was a little stressful because of all of the final papers and final exams I had to take but God got me through it. I am a student athlete, I am on the women's track and field team and the coaches are very friendly and fun to be around and so are my  teammates .The reason that I gave four stars instead of five is because I feel like the food could be better."
Freshman,4,"The college of Saint Rose is a private school that is small, with little class size of about 20 students. the place or the campus has nice scenery with grass and the benches around the grass where students hang out and relax. Their library are also nice and quiet a great place to study. As for the teachers they are different and bring certain things to the table but they all teach you about life and elements to it so they aren't bad. What I like about Saint Rose is the diversity of students who you get to interact with they also have a weekender that tells you what you can do over their. The only thing I don't like about Saint    Rose is the cafeteria food its decent but theyu need to step their game up."
Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes and the location. It's so nice being right in the middle of Albany everything is so close. All the falculty is very approachable and they actually care about your success.
Freshman,4,"The College of Saint Rose is a great and warming school. Everyone and everything is inspired by coming together and being a family. There are endless support systems on campus to help you both academically and emotionally. The College of Saint Rose is generally small and so is its classes, I generally feel at home knowing that my professors know me as an individual and are more than open to helping me with whatever goals I challenge myself with."
Freshman,4,"The College of Saint Rose has done a lot for me and my education. The professors teach in a hands-on style, which makes getting assignments done much easier. The Student teacher ratio is 16-1, resulting in the formation of relationships between students and their professors. The price of the college is the only downfall, at more than $50,000 a year wiith room, meal plan and tuition it is very expensive."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love this school. The small community is perfect for me and the teachers are fantastic. 
College Freshman,4,The school thus far is good.
College Freshman,4,"The school has a nice area to live in, many jobs."
College Freshman,4,The professors seem like they really want to help out and push their students to do their best.
College Freshman,4,"small classes, so more focus on you and your education. small campus, great staff and surroundings."
College Freshman,4,so far the faculty has made adjusting to college way way way easier than others. very small campus which is a plus for everyone.
College Freshman,4,"I love the environment on campus, it looks like a town instead of a university and it makes me feel at home."
Recent Alumnus,4,Support of all athletes is encouraged by the student association but the current president and the board have decided to end all athletic scholarships at St. Rose.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One great advantage of choosing a small private college like St. Rose, is the small class size.  The students have the opportunity to get to know their professors and vice versa.  This is a great thing when students need recommendations or help with anything such as applying for grad school.  Another advantage of a small school is always seeing a familiar friendly face.  A trip to the library,cafeteria or Starbucks will always include running into a friend with a smile."
College Freshman,4,"my experience is going just great with the interactions i have had so far. Between dorming, classes, the teachers, other fellow students saint rose is an overall really good school if you want a place that makes you feel wanted and known."
College Freshman,4,"one of the biggest things in saint rose is the accessiblity to the internships and how they really do try to get you one in your field of study. Actually for a lot of fields it is a requirement to have at least one to graduate. As for the alumni network, just this past December before i was accepted there was a chance for invited students to meet with alumni who have graduated from the past 50 years of saint rose. It gave me a chance to network and get the real as to not only this current generation felt about saint rose but how previous generations did and how has it changed and transformed for fit needs such as my own."
College Freshman,4,saint rose is in Albany so there are a few things may go on in or around campus but they do have emergency post for if you don't feel safe you press the button and a security guard will arrive and walk you to your dorm during the late nights. there is also a bus/van that drives around the campus i believe.
College Freshman,4,"At Saint Rose they give you many different options for where and how you want to live. Without a doubt i can say that you will stay comfortably at any place you stay for all have roughly the same amount of  pros. whether it is closeness to class, access to computer labs, 24/7 security watch. They all have something to offer. and all give that homey feel."
College Freshman,4,The school has many different sports and events that are surrounded by the schools teams. However you don't have to be on a team in order to play the sport we have clubs and smaller groups for fitness to take care of any sport like needs. we don't have a football team so that whole part is missing but the school gives an equal amount of attention to both the teams and the other campus choices around.
College Sophomore,4,everyone and everything is great
College Sophomore,4,Its great. experienced new things
College Sophomore,4,Very athletic and team spirited
College Sophomore,4,the community is very friendly
College Sophomore,4,"There are many internships the professors help students get, and its great job experience!"
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is supportive and very helpful in such situations
College Sophomore,4,"All of the dorms are great, really accommodating!"
College Sophomore,4,"I think the athletics here are great, They have many PE options"
Sophomore,2,"Academics are okay. Kind of a waste of time because most of the classes are repeats of high school. Faculty in the classrooms are great as well as the dining staff. Residents life could be nicer. The nurse's office is terrible and, after an interaction with them during my first semester there, had me in tears wanting to transfer. Overall, the college doesn't really seem to care about the students well being. Definitely money hogs."
Junior,2,Staff is horrible and rude. Professors are cool and classes are small so everyone knows everybody. Party scene is exciting and there are a lot of things you'll remember for the rest of your life.
College Freshman,2,The building has three floors and there is no elevators so it can be hard when commuting back and forth.
College Sophomore,2,I don't really like the housing
College Senior,2,"A lot of focus aimed towards the athletics department especially soccer and basketball, leaving other departments ignored and forgotten."
College Freshman,2,I struggle with my major courses and to no prevail seem to ever really grasp the material
College Freshman,2,We dont really have greek life. We only have one frat and its not even an official frat on campus. Its considered a club.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't feel I'm receiving a decent experience for the amount of money I'm paying. A lot of professors aren't very good at teaching even though they are passoniate about the subject. Food is very bad. Forced to pay a meal plan like I'm a child that doesn't know how to cook for myself. Very expensive. Dorms are strict, can barely decorate. Not a lot of opportunities or events going on, and if there are events you barely hear about them."
Recent Alumnus,2,Do not walk around alone!
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much fun. Nothing on campus. House parties are boring too.
College Freshman,2,A lot of the time most of the food was cold or the last of it was at the bottom of the pan. So we'd all wait for a staff member to come out of the kitchen and switch it. So we're in the way of people trying to get to the other food as well as those waiting in the grill line.
College Freshman,2,I have a terrible experience with campus food. Its hard for me to find food because I am a vegetarian and lactose-intolerant.
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall food is absolutely disgusting. The POD has unhealthy choices and Camelot is good but they took away crispy chicken at the sandwich section
College Freshman,2,Fire safety policies really strict and annoying
Recent Alumnus,2,"The city of Albany is a very dangerous city and it is very important to stay safe and not walk alone on the street, especially at night. The police do absolutely nothing to protect the college students in Albany. Albany's nightlife is very fun as long as you find the right places to go. SUNY albany is right next door so there is always something going on on the weekends."
College Senior,2,The food is expensive and for vegetarians or those with food allergies there is not a great deal of variety.
College Sophomore,2,"At first, I loved the dining hall. Unlimited food for one meal swipe?! It seemed too good to be true.

Over the course of the year, the quality of the food declined. It got to be repetitive, too. There was typical food, nothing special for a college dining hall. A few students got food poisioning in March/April 2014 from undercooked chicken parmesan. In several instances, there was not enough food to serve the number of students in the dining hall. The dining hall seemed very unprepared. Its cooks were mostly careless. There were few who came to work with smiles.

Good things about the dining hall: the cookies. They're not even homemade, though; they're store-bought.

My dorming decision was heavily influenced by the lack of requirement of a meal plan. There is only one dorm building on campus that does not require a meal plan -- needless to say, that is where I'm living next year."
College Junior,2,Underage nightlife is terrible. I have a late birthday so I am 20 years old. I understand that it is a liability to let underage people into bars but a simple X on their hands should be enough to tell the bartenders not to serve them. House parties get old quickly and there aren't many things to do.
College Junior,2,"Even though I am exceeding my scholarship expectations, I am not allowed to receive any more money from the school."
College Junior,2,Our school spirit lacks pep. There is little fan support for most teams.
College Junior,2,Most people are in long distance relationships with people from home. This sometimes interrupts ability to make friends.
College Senior,2,Streaming Netflix in the dorm is almost impossible. The wireless network is really slow and stops a lot. The Internet often shuts down too.
College Freshman,2,"I don't see many people other than straight white people in the middle class. The college's tuition doesn't allow it to be other than that honestly. With the rising prices each year, they are limiting their diversity which they take such pride in having. "
College Junior,2,Expensive and the food is gross. 
College Junior,2,"Off campus housing is awful, expensive, and very unsafe. I wouldn't reccomend it. "
College Freshman,2,The biggest struggle for the college is getting interest in our sports.
College Senior,2,"Parking permits cost a lot per year, but are the best way to ensure a good spot. Otherwise there are plenty of side roads to park on, just be sure to read the signs. Parking violation tickets cost a small fortune and the spots are pretty full in the middle of the day."
College Sophomore,2,People occasionally go to girls' soccer games.  That's abou it.
College Sophomore,2,"Albany is gray.  It's cold from about early November to late March.  During the winter, the sun rarely shines."
College Sophomore,2,The Events and Athletic Center is small and needs updating.
College Sophomore,2,Campus housing is difficult to obtain unless your lottery number happens to be high.  Many people move off campus because of the lack of housing and poor quality of the ancient houses that the school uses as dorms.
College Sophomore,2,"If you do not have any allergies to food, or are not picky about food, then the dining hall should not be an issue.  For me, I am gluten free, and it was hard to find food that I could eat.  Most of the staff had no idea what gluten free even was, so most of the time I needed to wait until the manager got here.  And by that time, all of my friends had already eaten and it was time for me to get to class."
College Junior,2,Drugs are a problem because there's not much to do on campus late at night. We also have a no smoking policy on campus yet people smoke all the time. I haven't seen it enforced.
College Junior,2,"there are not many scholarships other than the standard incoming GPA, portfolio, and SAT/ACT score scholarships."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is fine in the warmer months, but during the winter, being in New York, it is quite cold. The College very rarely cancels classes even during severe snowstorms, which is frankly unsafe for students and staff alike."
College Senior,2,Parking costs increased but parking spots were not increased?!?!?!  Simply doesn't add up.
College Freshman,2,There is a very small Greek presence on campus and I've only seen one sorority advertising.
College Sophomore,2,"Has just a bunch of pizza restaurants nothing else really, so its pretty lame."
College Freshman,2,"An Adventure Every Time. Albany uses CDTA which is a public transportation system. Most of the time, the posted times on line do not agree with the times that the busses actually arrive. Also, the buses are generally not as clean as one would like. But they are free for Saint Rose students as of spring 2012, so they are the cheapest and easiest way to get around."
College Freshman,2,"Sports.. .Eh – St. Rose emphasizes how great their women's basketball and women's soccer are. They just developed a men's lacrosse team, but basically the only people who actually go to these games are other Athletes from other teams who go because they are forced to by their coaches."
Alum,1,"These people don’t give a shit about you. You are just another tuition payment to them. It’s way overpriced for an average education, horrible community, and awful living environment. I think prisons are better kept than their dorms. I left Saint Rose after only one year because it truly sucked. For real, just don’t go here."
Graduate Student,1,"The college administration is very careless about the issues students are facing. Be careful with the International Office they put you in critical troubles and they try to escape their mistakes, try to cover their mistakes and  they don't help you . People at Registrars office are so bad that they make you wait for 1 week to register you to a course no matter how deep you are in troubles with the deadlines.  Me and my friends felt we have wasted a lot of money  and got into troubles because of this college."
Freshman,1,"This is by far the worst administration I have ever encountered in my entire life! the academics are really good but the administration is terrible. My finances came in late quite late actually and I had assured the college I will pay them immediately not only did they refuse to work with me, they even asked me to leave the dorms even though I was disabled. To top it off when I did pay them and asked them to waive the fee I was flat out told no. This is a for profit degree mill!"
Freshman,1,Horrible omg don’t go here I’ve been here for a semester and am transferring back home. The campus life is horrible. The clubs are pretty wack. The food is horrible. The dorms are ok . Past 8:30 there is barely food on campus because there is only one DIning Hall . The teachers are lazy and very disorganized. There’s just no order on campus
Freshman,1,"Saint rose is horrible. There is only ONE dining hall and everything closes early, so if you do not eat.. you're starving for the rest of the night. The dining hall closes at 6:30 on weekends and camelot doesn't even open on weekends. If you're coming in as a freshman you will most likely be living in Bru. Bru does not have a kitchen which mean you cannot cook and it's a 10 min walk just to campus. The school does not have school parties, so the parties are off campus and they're trash. ALL are house parties which mean it gets shut down or the music is horrible. SAVE YOURSELF AND DO NOT COME HERE."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is a Prison Cell, I had more freedom at home and moved off campus after the first year."
Recent Alumnus,1,"For those thinking about attending, please read carefully. I would entice you to do your research well before making a decision. In my opinion, after attending for two years and then transferring, I did not feel as though the school provided a value education. Meaning, the cost was high for the instruction and education that I took away. Check the school academic ratings, this is very important to employers and graduate schools especially if you don't plan to stay in the area after college.

The school is primarily for those that want to become teachers and for that I would say it is expensive. If you have money to waste and want to become a school teacher one day this could be the place for you.

Further, the school is nestled in the middle of a small city where students can get attacked, robbed, hit by a car, or even worse...just check the local news over the past several years. It is even rated very unstable financially.

Worst and Best Part: Don't live on campus if you do go since they are strict...I am sure you had more freedom at home. The best part for me, which I would not trade was the friends I made.

Most of all I wish you good luck it is a big decision. I just wanted to provide my opinion, as I wish someone did for me. There are many options available, hopefully you choose the most valuable in the long-run."
College Sophomore,1,i love school so much its the best school ever and Im so happy I went there
College Freshman,1,"No parties run by St Rose, but UAlbany is right by"
Recent Alumnus,1,We did not have any.
Recent Alumnus,1,What sports and what facilities? It is in the middle of a city so there is no room for them.
Recent Alumnus,1,Had more freedom at home.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not bad when I was there
Recent Alumnus,1,"Better parties in high school, saint rose does not like parties."
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't get a meal plan
College Sophomore,1,we're a division 2 school but it feels like we're a division 3 school no one seems to care about the sports and the field is far from campus so not that many people go to watch games and we do not have a football team it just really sucks
College Junior,1,"Seeing as so many people last year got food poisoning,  something has got to change with the dining hall."
Recent Alumnus,1,The campus dining hall is horrible. the quality of the food is horrible and the variety of the food is horrible.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I feel extremely unsafe in albany. On the campus i feel fairly safe but it is important to stay with a group, especially at night."
College Senior,1,"I am a transfer student and although I had a cumulative 4.0 after a year and a half at Saint Rose, I still was only eligible for the transfer scholarship which is roughly half of the award that the academic scholarship is for four-year students. I struggle greatly with paying tuition because this is a private school."
College Senior,1,No Greek life at the college.
College Senior,1,I hated living in the dorms. Maybe it was just me but I felt like I was treated like a child. Security guards were stationed at the front of the freshman dorms and you had to swipe in every time you walked in. Guests also had to sign in and leave their ID. You could not enter the dorm after a certain time at night with a guest. It sucked. The girls I lived with were also very immature for their age. They would run around the hall screaming and causing commotion. They also did not go out very much. 
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful!!!! A year pass is $100 which is tight for a college student living on their own. Even if you have a pass, there are never any spots! You have to circle the parking lot a million times. I chose not to buy one this year and I still cannot find any parking on the street. It's a bad situation all the way around. "
College Sophomore,1,Would not do it again.  
College Sophomore,1,"The school is strict about the wrong things.  Don't question the offices about things, they won't help you.  Park in the wrong lot and they'll fine you, but feel free to drink in your hallway."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a joke.  You either get fined by security or by Albany Police. Pick your poison.
College Sophomore,1,"This is literally the worst part of the school. The food cooked in the dining hall, for the most part, shouldn't be served to dogs, let alone people.  The school charges $3000 for a meal plan, making each meal worth $10-$14.  I've frequently walked out of the dining hall after using a swipe, just to spend money order food from somewhere off campus.  The food is atrocious here.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  "
College Junior,1,Finding a parking space in this school is a big pain.
College Senior,1,When I was in school there were no upper classman dorms and the dorms available for the lower classman dorms were astronimcal costs and did not deem a valuable investment in my education.
College Sophomore,1,I don't really like Financial Aid at Saint Rose. I barely received anything and my mother barely makes any money. It is just unfair because I have seen many students have to drop out because of lack of Financial Aid.
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking at The College of Saint Rose is extremely hard to find after 8am and parking on the street is very risky due to the fact that Albany Police officers love to write tickets to students
College Senior,1,"You pay at least 100 dollars for the year, but this doesn't guarantee you a spot in any of the on campus parking. The only time there is ever open spots is on the weekends other than that you have to park on the street."
College Freshman,1,"The dining hall prides itself in offering a variety of disgusting food. Most of the time, the food is unidentifiable and kind of gross. Every once and a while, they have something that comes out good and then by the time I get to it, it is gone. But, Camelot which is a grill/cafe and takes dining points is a good alternative, but it doesn't accept meal swipes."
College Freshman,1,Registration Process – The registration process at the College of Saint Rose is poor. They give a lottery time  to register which isn't fair to some students because some classes they need could fill up quickly and they can't register for those classes.
College Freshman,1,I feel bad for the commuters that go to Saint Rose.  They have to get to school much earlier than their classes and hunt for a parking spot.  I hear even teachers complaining about parking.
College Sophomore,1,school is located in center of city. parking is on main street in city. heavy traffic!!! very limited off street parking
College Sophomore,1,"Dining Hall – the menu is bland and not very exciting

its not good at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"No longer existent on campus and at bars, sputtering to survive at off-campus parties"
College Freshman,1,"Saint Rose has a decent basketball team. Nothing much other than that. There are a few ""wannabe"" sports players that roam the campus, but they are lame."
College Freshman,1,Team Performance – Saint Rose is not good at most sports. Our girls soccer team was good.

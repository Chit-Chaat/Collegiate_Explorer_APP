Sophomore,5,The transition from in-class learning to online went very smoothly for me. All my professors were extremely understanding when it came to deadlines and grading. My professors responded to emails quickly and at the start of every week would send an email to the class laying out what to do for that week.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my first year at FPU, unfortunately, it was cut short due to Covid-19.  The environment is super welcoming and I became involved on campus quickly and had no trouble finding where I belong."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed FPU. They allowed me to grow into the person I wanted to be. The campus is a community, everyone is so happy and welcoming. You will always walk by other students/faculty and get a warm greeting. I call FPU home. They have unbelievable professors that are willing to work with you no matter what. They encourage students to get involved in the campus and culture that is there if you do not, then it does become hard to make valued friendships. There are SO MANY opportunities to get involved; from student government to clubs, to community service to work on and off-campus. I think the one thing I would change is housing. Freshman dorms are very rough, but I guess that is anywhere."
Niche User,5,"I absolute loved the community at FPU, everyone I met was so nice and welcoming. They also have an overnight program for incoming freshman which is awesome and well organized, it helped me and many others decide on the school."
Sophomore,5,If you are looking for a  small school where people actually care about students this is the place. Classes are small and allow you to really get to know your professors and fellow students. The campus is beautiful and although there is not a ton to do in the area Keene is just 20 minutes away.  They try and provide a lot of fun opportunities on campus as well. I love FPU and encourage you to visit.
Sophomore,5,"I really like how the professors make themselves available to you, they go above and beyond to make sure they stay connected with their students. For example, I once facetimed a professor at 9pm one night because I needed help with a paper that was due that night. They sat in their living room with their family and helped me until I was able to complete the assignment."
Freshman,5,"The Rindge Campus is so beautiful. There is so much to do on campus you won't ever be bored. The community is wonderful, everybody is friends, we all love each other."
Senior,5,The school is a great place to attend if you like a school in the middle of no where and looks like its very own town.
Freshman,5,"really great school, and staff. The professors really treat their students like students than just a  number and try to help you pass the best they can."
Freshman,5,"As a first year student, I can say that everyone at Franklin Pierce has welcomed me with warm arms. I really loved that I had 2 classes that had all of the same kids in the first semester."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, I would not complain about my experience here so far and i am currently a second year"
Freshman,5,"Absolutely love Franklin Pierce University! Beautiful campus, amazing professors, great academics, and wide variety of athletics. It's very clear that you are seen as more than a number- everyone takes the time to know each other and go out of their way to be friendly. Such a positive atmosphere!"
Alum,5,"FPU is a great school if you're looking for a full college experience without going to a huge Univeristy. Class sizes are small and instructors do care what you have to say. It's not a full blown""party school"" like the surrounding universities but there are still plenty of parties on the weekends. I'm happy to be an FPU graduate"
Alum,5,"This is a small school that gives you the BEST fun college experience! D2 for sports so theres always sporting events to attend busy campus with lots going on and friendly people everwhere. Everyone I met was so nice and it felt like a big ""family"" and home away from home! Really fun parties and being in the middle of nowhere is really relaxing. BEAUTIFUL campus! Would recommend to someone who lives in a busy aera and wants to go somewhere quiet to a really fun school!"
Freshman,5,this school is a huge family and everyone is always there to support you. The environment here is just amazing and being in the middle of nowhere is very relaxing.
Freshman,5,"I visited Franklin Pierce University and their campus is beautiful. There is a great view of the mountains and there is also Pearly Pond right next to the campus. There are only about 2,000 students that attend. I grew up in a small town and went to a small school so to me Franklin Pierce seemed like a perfect fit to me."
Freshman,5,Franklin Pierce is such an amazing school and it was the best decision I have made to attend. The classes are amazing and the people are all so welcoming. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. People go canoeing and paddling boarding when the weather is nice and goes ice skating when the pond is frozen over. Franklin Pierce is just like my home and I'm always so excited to come back and enjoy my time with all my good friends
Freshman,5,It is a great school with a lot of opportunities the environment is a calm and friendly environment with lots of friendly people
Freshman,5,Franklin Pierce University is in its own area and it is very pretty. There is a mountain where we can hike and there is also a lake where we can go canoeing. The campus is nice and small and you can get to know many people. Also freshmen are allowed to bring cars so that gives students opportunities to go out of the campus to hang out as well!
College Freshman,5,We need a track for our uprising track and field team
College Freshman,5,Saftey is great on campus. Our campus does a good job of monitoring and making sure everything is going well.
College Freshman,5,The courses teach you enough to be successful. The classes are small so it is easy to learn and be comfortable with your classmates. The professors take the time to know you and help with any accommodations needed.
College Freshman,5,There are lots of activities to get involved in. This school has great view we are by a mountains so they do trips to the mountain to climb it. I really love that there are events they bring you to such as skiing and Boston Bruins games. Everyone at my school if very friendly its a small number of students so you recognize everyone you see. Its easy to talk to everyone. Professors recognize who you are. It a good environment to feel like home. I would choose this school again if I could do it all over again because its small and I like that. It a comfortable environment with friendly people and they really make you feel like home for people who are far away. Classes are small so its easier to learn.
College Freshman,5,"I love living at Franklin Pierce University, my roommate is amazing and we got the opportunity to choose each other before coming to school whichI also love. Our room is nice but the actual look of the building are not the best. The food here isn't the best but I guess you can't expect amazing food for a college. Living here is great and I have the best floor with great people on it. I love this school I wish they still had dance and that it had early childhood education and i would be staying here."
College Sophomore,5,"Very small town but very ""homey""."
College Sophomore,5,I had an easy time with getting financial aid. I wish I could have received a little more but am still not upset about the money I received.
College Sophomore,5,THe parties that I have been to have been very fun and very safe.
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy my major. I think I have had the best time in my major so far, and I cant wait to be able to find an internship and etc. The only problem would have to be is that they took away a lot of majors which causes the school to loose a lot of people."
College Sophomore,5,The student life is great
College Sophomore,5,I have had a great time here!
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very accepting
College Sophomore,5,Teachers are always ready to help
College Sophomore,5,The workload is heavy but the teachers are always there to help.
College Sophomore,5,I was in the Kitty Rescue program with the school and I loved it!
College Sophomore,5,Admission is great! They are always helpful!
College Sophomore,5,I have to put in a lot of time into my major because it is very work heavy
College Sophomore,5,I didn't have any problems
College Junior,5,"I take an online course and it's extremely easy. I thought it would be a lot harder academically but the professors really work with their students to ensure success. Even though we don't get the face to face communication, the professors are always available for my needs."
College Freshman,5,There is nothing wrong with the amount of support given from students
College Freshman,5,Ringe (FPU) is the perfect college for me
College Sophomore,5,Can do whatever you want in the medical field with my major.
College Sophomore,5,Right on the pond and by a mountain
College Sophomore,5,Perfect for someone wanting a small school with a great sense of community. Its really easy to make friends too!
College Freshman,5,"The technology in my school is excellent, the IT support is very helpful and wireless is in every room. "
College Freshman,5,I love skiing and since we are in New England it is the best for me. I love snow and cold frigid weather so I get excited when winter roles around. And when it gets hot in the spring we have a lake right on campus so everyone goes swimming and its great!
College Freshman,5,Athletics make this school. We have some of the best athletic teams in division two nation wide. We are always a threat in our conference. Baseball is our top sport and currently we are ranked 9th in the country before the season starts. Our basketball teams are very good and every one of our facilities are very well maintained. 
College Junior,5,"The campus housing is very nice. Each year the housing that is provided is much better than the year before. As freshmen you are just in normal dorms. Sophomores have the option of living in suites. Junior housing is apartment style, and the seniors live in townhouses."
College Junior,5,"I have received a lot of financial aid and scholarships from Franklin Pierce, without such, it would be very hard for me to afford school."
College Sophomore,5,School offers a good amount for financial aid.      
College Sophomore,5,If you engage with your professors and tell them that your struggling they'll assist you in every way. You would always see me be the last person to leave the class room b/c i was also asking the professor a question or discussing  an issue. Being a student athlete you should build a strong relationship with them because they are the ones who'll be giving you your final grade.
College Freshman,5,Very esay to enter into any major. We also make it easy to change you major if you realize you're into something different.
College Freshman,5,I think they are all fantastic compared to bigger schools. We make sure they are up to date and cleaned before and after people move in or out.
College Freshman,5,I love New Hampshire weather. You get a little bit of everything!
College Freshman,5,Just about everyone receives a scholarship. If you have the opportunity to apply for others on campus I suggest you do so. Your application to the college is also your application for most of the scholarships offered.
College Freshman,5,We have the bubble! You can go and work out in there when it's open and is very convenient and cool! We also provide a lot of tutoring and academic programs for every subject and anything you could think of really.
College Junior,5,Sports practically dictate FPU. I think most FPU students are athletes.
College Sophomore,5,We have a great range of people here. Definitely diverse.
College Sophomore,5,The class selection is wonderful and the teachers really care about each one of their students.  Very small class sizes and small student to teach ratio.  Great internships too!
College Junior,5,Special Study Options – FPU offers an excellent Professional Studies option
Recent Alumnus,5,Top Notch – Franklin Pierce like any college knows how to spend there money to get kids to want to spend student loans there. That meaning there class rooms suck and computers are outdated but athletic facilities are up to date and great.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the sense of community that surrounds FPU. Every faculty member or student always greets with a warm smile and sets you up for success. The campus is beautiful, with an astonishing view of Mount Monadnock that can be seen from the common areas of campus."
Freshman,4,"Right now I am fully online for the fall semester due to Covid-19. The online experience has been difficult to adjust to but once you everyone is there to support you and work with you, so it's very easy to become adjusted."
Junior,4,"Besides the common transition to online classes due to Covid-19, I've taken three online classes with Franklin Pierce. All three have been fantastic and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. Professors are a mix between those we see on campus and those who are part of our online school, but both go above and beyond to make sure your needs are met."
Junior,4,"The best part about FPU, for sure, is the community. Everyone on campus is welcoming, loving, and personable. The support and positivity that run through campus are unmatchable. Another great aspect is the classroom. The class sizes are reasonably small which allows students to create a professional relationship with their professors. All the professors care about the well-being of their students and are deeply invested in quality education. Campus food might not be the selling point, but the people who make and serve it definitely are! Many of our staff also create bonds with students, such as the dining hall staff. Some of them even go as far as joining sports events to cheer on students or catch lunch with them at our local diner. Dorming is better than the food but not as good as some state schools I've seen. Although each year you advance, your housing is improved. Therefore, senior year housing is definitely the best on campus. In the end, I'll definitely be sad when I leave."
Senior,4,Teachers are wonderful and have a vast knowledge of the subjects they teach. The instructors really care that you do well in the classes and learn something.
Senior,4,Teachers are wonderful and have a vast knowledge of the subjects they teach. The instructors really care that you do well in the classes and learn something.
Freshman,4,"There's definitely a part life on campus and it's hard to avoid. Alot of campus safety doesnt care about drinking or drugs which can lead to some unsavory people making it on campus. When it comes to parties, the ones on campus are loud and constent. They're okay at lakeveiw. Stay on campus though, the off campus parties are drug and drunkfests. People then drive back to campus and because it's in the middle of nowhere, they don't always make it back okay. But if you avoid that it's actually very nice. The mountain is right there and there's almost always something to do. Right after a snowstorm they placed tubes down for people to go down the hill. Classes are small too which is good because your professor gets to know you."
Sophomore,4,"They are constantly renovating/improving the area, expanding on buildings, and improving student life."
Freshman,4,I love this school so much! Everyone on campus is so friendly and open. Professors are always willing to help you improve and there are always people on campus willing to talk about anything. The campus is small and I love that because everything is within walking distance.
Alum,4,Franklin Pierce gave me life long friends. It gave me a great education and prepared me for my future. The professors were extremely helpful and if I need anything to this day they still will help me with any of my needs. They prepared me for the future and allowed me to grow up throughout the four years.
Freshman,4,It’s a really great community setting. Everyone cares about each other and the classes are pretty good too.
Senior,4,"I have learned numerous great ideas and life lessons while attending Franklin Pierce. Coming in as a freshmen it was a major culture shock because I had been raised in an urban setting for my entire life prior. This school has an isolated rural setting that allows for a peaceful experience. There are an immense amount of academic help opportunities, and this proves that this school takes great pride in their work. Athletics is a big aspect of FPU because almost half of the student population is affiliated with a sports team on campus. the food in the cafeteria is the one aspect that the school must update, and many of the students have requested new options. Ultimately, this school takes great pride in every aspect of its campus life."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Franklin Pierce University has been great, thus far. I've met many people who have taught me valuable life lessons on this small campus. It's easy to walk from class to class, as it only takes a couple of minutes to get to each building. There are a number of different clubs that host events each weekend to encourage student involvement and socialization. The scenery is beautiful, with a great view of Mount Monadnock and Pearly Pond. However, the cafeteria food is average, and could improve with better funding. I would like to see an improvement as far as the cafeteria providing alternative food options for those who are on special diets."
Freshman,4,"Teachers are good, resources are good, very compact and diverse campus. Food sucks. Party scene is fun. Dorms are pretty broken down for the freshman buildings."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed attending Franklin Pierce for 4 years. The campus is small but there is enough students to make lasting friendships. A few of their policies are a bit out dated, and the campus needs a refresher"
Junior,4,"This campus is small, and quickly becomes like home. We are a community that stands together. The area is beautiful and even if you can not get off campus, campus its self is beautiful. The staff and professors that work here are all great people who want to help you achieve all of your goals."
Graduate Student,4,"Franklin Pierce University is an excellent university. I am a student in the physical therapy graduate program and have been very impressed with the resources we have been provided with as well as the excellence of our professors. Although the graduate program is still expensive, it is a more affordable option compared to other schools in New England."
Niche User,4,"I love the campus very much, it is a diverse community and very close knit. I feel like I could succeed here all four years. I have been accepted already and I am looking forward in moving forward."
Sophomore,4,"Great friends and amazing professors.  Overall my professors have been available whenever needed.  Learning Centers offer much tutoring.  I chose Franklin Pierce University because of the Environmental Science program.  I love the fact that the University is nestled in the mountains and has a lot of hiking, fishing and other outdoor activities."
Sophomore,4,"It's all about what you make of it. FPU as a lot of free things to go to, which is essential to the life of a college student. They have movie showings, popcorn and soda; comedy acts; and bingo where they give away cash prizes, all free"
Freshman,4,"The faculty and students are very welcoming and happy! Professors are very enthusiastic with what they teach. A few things that can be improved are the living spaces, specifically freshman communal restrooms, and the cafe food."
Freshman,4,"I love my school, we have the best school spirit. Every one is so friendly it is very easy to make friends here, everyone knows everyone. It has its ups and its downs like any other place. Location wise it is beautiful campus, gets very cold in the winter. Don't worry about the weather because the classrooms are the best temperature. As for the faculty they are welcoming always willing to help you and they know you on a personal basis."
Freshman,4,Franklin Pirce in a small diverse liberal arts college. They offer many clubs and activities through out the week. Small class sizes make it easy to communicate with your professors.
College Junior,4,The school is like a real community. Its small so the class sizes are perfect and the professors are there to help and watch you succeed.
College Junior,4,Andy Card changed everything and gave this school its reputation back.
College Junior,4,love Franklin Pierce and I have met the best people here.
College Junior,4,Sometimes the non athlete students get pushed to the side of rate athlete students but having a sports culture is important and valuable to the school.
College Junior,4,I love this school. It gets a bad rep but the professors truly care and the president Andy Card who just stepped down made so many changes. This school has really turned around.
College Student,4,I was having trouble selling into the new routine. The processor were very helpful
College Freshman,4,Security and safety is a major concern for the administration here
College Freshman,4,I like the small class size and many of the professors are great
College Freshman,4,It was easy to find colleges through fairs
College Sophomore,4,As a member of the Women's soccer team here at Franklin Pierce University I know firsthand about the athletics at school. The athletes make up a large part of the population and every team is close within it and with the other teams. Athletics at Franklin Pierce is a community within a community. Pierce Pride is great on campus. Most home games are heavily attended. I know I look forward to playing at home because I know that my friends as well as a bunch of others will be there supporting us and that makes the game seem so much easier for us.
College Sophomore,4,"Franklin Pierce University is a small college. Therefore it has a very tight-knit campus. Everybody on campus knows everybody else. this makes the experience much more personal and allows greater friendships and relationships to evolve. People are closer on this campus. Also, because it is a smaller school, most classes have small numbers as well. This allows the professors to teach all students equally as well as develop closer relationships to their students. I feel as if I have made more substantial relationships with my professors at Franklin Pierce than I would have if I chose a larger school."
College Freshman,4,The beginning of the year there were a couple crimes of vandalism on campus and they were all handled well and security cameras were put in place to prevent further circumstances.
College Freshman,4,I have only met with a couple of the professors on campus and every experience has been comfortable and enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are a huge part of everyday life on campus. There isn't a day that passes where something is going on. I have gone to only a couple of games, but from what I have seen the students are very supportive of our teams. When a team does well there is usually some sort of notification that says what happened and who was recognized in the game if there was anyone."
College Freshman,4,"When I first walked on campus I loved it and immediately felt welcomed. I was still nervous for move in day, but once I started I knew that I wanted to stay at this school and get my bachelor's of science. My first intentions was to transfer after two years, but after awhile I knew that I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
College Freshman,4,There are lots of jobs on campus for students. The career center helps us with internships.
College Freshman,4,Lots of students go to the games that are on campus. During intermission they do activities to get the fans involved. Everyone that goes has school spirit cheers for our team. The team uniforms are very presentable. The players have good sportsmanship. The teams here are like family. The facilities are nice fields are keep up and in excellent shape the gym is in excellent shape. We have a indoor field facility so players can practice all year around.
College Freshman,4,The school has recently put in cameras and alarm systems to ensure students safety.
College Freshman,4,I am really enjoying my first year at Franklin Pierce University!
College Freshman,4,"After graduation, I am sure I will get a job in my career field."
College Freshman,4,"My school is a small, tight knit community. All students are very friendly and there are plenty of options for sports and activities on campus. The Center of Academic Excellence is very helpful with tutoring and other student service needs. The food could be better, but overall, I am very satisfied with my school."
College Sophomore,4,I came to Franklin Pierce partially because of the class size. I can say that all of my professors are approachable and I have no problem getting help after or before class.
College Sophomore,4,Franklin Pierce offers a community like experience for all. It's located on a beautiful campus and has some of the greatest professors.
College Sophomore,4,I play intramurals and they are always fun and not too competitive. The varsity sports are quite good and create something enjoyable to do on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Great environment if you like small communities. Teachers are helpful and the education is worth it.
Recent Alumnus,4,The baseball and soccer games are very popular on campus. The campus gym is really nice.
College Senior,4,"I think this school has a lot to offer. there are many opportunities for on and off campus activities, the lake is a plus. and the new president is going to be great for this school! I would choose to play a sport and get more involved in activities."
College Sophomore,4,"One of the great things about my school is that it is small. I am a better learner when classes are smaller and professors are able to personally help you if need be. In bigger schools, you go to a 200+ seat lecture hall ands the professor won't know your name. Also, the fact that it is close enough to one to go home for the holidays but far enough away so that I'm not able to easily go home every weekend. My school choice has helped me grow up a lot and, honestly, I really don't know if I'd pick this school again if I had to. It'll be clearer once all four years are complete, but as of right now, I'm confident with my choice."
College Sophomore,4,"There only trying to protect us, but they can be rude and take things to seriously"
College Sophomore,4,"The scholarships have helped me out a lot, but I'm having a hard time now."
College Junior,4,The Social Work program is a great one. The professors are extremely helpful and they teach you so much about all of the different types of social work that a person can go into.
College Junior,4,"There are many different cultural groups at FPU. There are a lot of people from different religious and political views, the LGBT community, races, and economic backgrounds.  No one is treated differently because of what thy believe or who they love."
College Junior,4,"Being a Social Work major there are plenty of classes offered but it is hard to find extra help (tutors) for some classes. As a dance minor, the school does not do much for the arts so it is a struggle to get the support needed."
College Junior,4,I love Franklin Pierce. I feel comfortable there.
College Junior,4,"This school has a very welcoming, family-like quality all around campus. Everyone knows just about everyone. The faulty does their best to keep you happy and on track with things you need to do. It is a great place to feel accepted. It is my home away from home."
College Freshman,4,"Each housing level is set up different and would be rated differently, the freshman housing is the lowest ranking of all the options. Every year you move up a class level housing, the better the housing gets."
College Freshman,4,There are quite a few options so i think it is good
Freshman,2,There is not much around and not much to do. There are some who love it and some who do not. I do not think it is the school for me.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel very safe on campus, but the bathrooms are usually treated poorly by fellow students, which in return is unhealthy to everyone."
College Student,2,"Due to the rural area, it would be more expensive then it would be worth. Most people stay on campus from freshmen to seniors."
College Junior,2,Little to no options for off campus dining.
College Junior,2,The campus is located in the middle of nowhere and there is very little to do.
College Junior,2,I'm a graduate assistant so my degree is paid for except I have to pay for my books out of pocket and it's extremely difficult. The stipend I get on a monthly basis isn't enough to support my rent so I need a second job just to make rent. I can't pay for my textbooks with the very small amount of money I receive on a monthly basis.
College Junior,2,"Being a CJ major is not all it's cracked up to be. The classes offer basic knowledge, and most of the participants are interested in one aspect of the system. Legal classes are not offered, and the focus is on upcoming corrections and police officers. Not a wide range of opportunities for internships, better to find one on your own."
College Freshman,2,"There have been quite a few occasions where the wireless internet does not work for students, and it takes longer than it should to get the network back up and running.  Also when the network is up and running, it runs very slow and disconnects and reconnects at inconvenient times."
College Freshman,2,no greek life nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
College Freshman,2,With the amount of money this school expects students to pay for to attend they should upgrade on the housing department. Yes its fairly nice but I know of a handful of other schools that you pay half of what you go here and they have brand new up to date housing facilities.
College Sophomore,2,"I live off-campus in the same house I have since I was 11, with my parents, so I never had trouble finding off-campus housing, but I've heard from other students, and I'm aware that there are limited places for students to live other than on campus. The quality of apartments and housing in the area is poor."
College Freshman,2,People like to brag about partying 
College Freshman,2,We are in the middle of the woods with a shuttle bus to very few places. BRING A CAR OR FIND A FRIEND THAT HAS ONE!
College Freshman,2,"Because there is basically nothing around Rindge, the campus life is very dull. Best to find some friends you enjoy hanging around."
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part, anything that should be considered an offense is allowed, with the exception of sexual harrassment, sexual assault, and the fact that freshmen must check in on weekends with a Front Desk Monitor to ensure that they are not too drunk that they can't make it back to their room."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm okay with my program, but I wish it would allow me to choose more classes that I am interested in. If I could do it over again, I would not attend Franklin Pierce just because it is a mediocre school in general."
College Sophomore,2,"Weather in NH is cold, with lots of snow, and FPU rarely cancels school. This isn't a problem with students that live on campus, but for those that commute, this can lead to difficult driving conditions. Roads are usually kept clean on the school campus, but driving around in the winter can be dangerous at times if someone doesn't know how to drive in New England weather."
College Sophomore,2,"Alcohol is a large part of Franklin Pierce. Being a rural school, most students travel to the senior apartments that are located on campus and drink for most of the night. Peer pressure can be high from some students, and most students drink at least somewhat regularly. Drugs are less common, although pot, mushrooms, and ecstasy are easy to find if you want them. Parties tend to be broken up by 1 or 2 am, and students caught drinking are usually given a slap on the wrist, although recently drug offenses have been reported to the police."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are okay, if not slightly boring to look at. The lawns are well-maintained, and the library is a good place to study. We offer Trick-or-Treating right before each Halloween to the young residents of neighboring towns, and we give them small tours of the school. Most students tend to stay in their dorms and drink and party however, so many school facilities are not used frequently."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors: There are some very good and talented professors, but there are also some that are quick to judge students, and claim to give students opportunities, but when asked to participate, they turn them down for one reason or another. They're willing to help, but some teachers will get frustrated if you ask them to explain a concept that you don't understand. Again, not all teachers are like this, but those that are truly ruin the experience.

Curriculum: While many people consider college to be a place to explore their passions or to discover them, Franklin Pierce crushes that idea in a sense. As a liberal arts school, they toss classes at you that you must take, regardless of whether you are interested in humanities, art, and science or not. If you want to solely focus on your interests, FPU is not for you.

Registration: The process itself is painless, however underclassmen tend to get the shaft on this. Registration is done with the senior athletes getting the first pick, followed by senior honor's students, followed by the rest of the seniors, and then this pattern continues down the line for the rest of the classes, with ""average"" freshmen getting the last picks out of anyone. 

Workload: Surprisingly easy, although biology courses tend to assign many lab reports. Other than that, it's easier than my high school courseload, which can either be a good thing or a bad thing."
College Sophomore,2,"Rooms are fairly small.  However, the social atmosphere among them is pretty great."
College Sophomore,2,"Since It's a small-sized school it feels like High School, just with more of a college-type atmosphere among students."
College Sophomore,2,"Being in New England, the weather can often change on a dime.  You'll experience all four seasons.  The winters are often quite cold."
College Sophomore,2,"This is a mostly white school, everyone is very accepting and kind to everyone, including people who are gay. That being said, there are people that have made racist remarks to me and people seem to form cliques depending on their ethnicity."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a fairly strict  private institution. Parties get shut down quickly if they aren't registered, and if they are it's extremely difficult to get in them if you don;t know the person who's house it is. You can get written up pretty easily for the simplest things example ""Having more then 6 people in your 2 minutes past quite hour."" I was amazed when I was written up that day."
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene at Franklin Pierce University is sort of high but it also depends who you surround yourself with. Some students smoke very little students try other stronger drugs. Alcohol is common.
College Freshman,2,the only computer labs available are in the library. connecticity to the internet is unreliable. the internet tends to be slow; i know youtube videos rarely load while on campus. you can get wireless access in any building accept the towers. there is no wifi there.  it is very useful and a lot more accommodating if you have your own computer/laptop.
College Freshman,2,"There's not much in Rindge. Obviously there is Keene, which is about 25 minutes away and has much more of an attractive atmosphere/range of options of things to do. Rindge really only has walmart, Foggs, and Market Basket."
College Freshman,2,"Walking through the dorms you can often smell marijuana. The only security is Campus Safety and with only two vehicles, they aren't always around to catch people. There have been a few arrests made for drugs, and they will make you empty an open container of alcohol if you go outside, but the drug scene is heavy here."
College Student,2,Off campus there are not many restaurants. There is a McDonalds in Jaffery and some sub shops
College Freshman,2,"You get tired of eating at the dining hall., but it is very convenient when you need something to eat between classes. The food in the dining hall isn't all that bad, but is very repetitive."
College Freshman,2,Its been a very rainy season so far. Waiting for the snow and for classes to get cancelled.
College Freshman,2,"Baseball is the biggest sport on campus. There isn't a real football team, its just flag football. There are sport clubs, rugby is pretty big. Track and soccer are played too. Girl's hockey is popular among some. But--it's known that kids get hurt, and baseball coaches go hard."
College Freshman,2,"It is not strict at all compared to other schools, from other schools FPU is known as a party school. There are no bag checks, and people rarely get in trouble for alcohol."
College Freshman,2,Kids smoke marijuana like it's nobody's business. The only way students get caught is it the CA smells it.
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene at Franklin Pierce University is pretty large, It seems to be quite a big party school. Although it depends greatly on who you hangout with, and where you hangout. If you associate yourself with the right students, drugs and alcohol are not a problem."
College Freshman,2,"It is up and down with the weather, some days it gets really cold, and some days it is super super hot. Once the winter comes it will be freezing."
College Freshman,2,"The freshmen dorms at Franklin Pierce University are awful in my opinion, but the options for the upperclassmen are much better. The dorms are dirty, and not up to date. Unfortunately I have to deal with it for the remainder of the year. Normally the boys play lacrosse in the hallway with fruit and there is mashed up fruit on the walls. As you gain seniority on campus the dorms get much better. The bathrooms in freshmen dorms are normally filthy because people don't know how to clean up after themselves, but the cleaning services do a great job! The dorms are very convenient in relevance to all the classrooms, building, and dining hall. The cost is very overpriced in my opinion considering the living situation and the serves and amenities provided to the students."
College Sophomore,2,"Average. The weather is beautiful during the early fall and spring.  During the winter, the wind is brutal because youre up in the mountains.  The ice and snow can get out of control but classes do get cancelled."
College Freshman,2,The people here are average and it is easy to create a click of your own because there aren't many people and we must all stick together in this depressing environment.
Senior,1,"I liked that some professors actually took the time to help students understand material that they knew would be difficult. I didn’t like the administration, the retention rate, the housing, that there was no surrounding city, etc."
Sophomore,1,"Let start off by saying this school is essentially a community college for people who like to get away from home. First of all the people on campus are extremely selfish, they do not have a moral compass. I don't know, its like they treat visitors and outsiders like gods. But once your there, they don't give a crap about you. I came here to study environmental science because of the beautiful scenery and wilderness study areas on and off campus which is nice. The campus food I believe is C or D grade food (C grade is prison food standards), so already know what kind of food your getting. The school treats athletes like they are gods, and they can get away with anything. The baseball players can walk into class high or drunk and the professor won't even mind. Also, just recently the school just cut like several major sports teams that were keeping people here. So overall this place is fun for a good semester or two, but other than that everything else at this school is very limited."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life on campus. I am glad to say so because I believe it's a distraction from everything else.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek Life on this campus, sadly. I think having Greek Life would bring fun to the campus."
College Junior,1,"No regulation what so ever. Students come to classes high, and nothing is done even when they speak about it to the professor."
College Junior,1,"Horrible. Any student who doesn't drink or use drugs is forced to put up with the noise, and inconvenience of being surrounded by drunk people constantly."
College Junior,1,"Don't play baseball? Don't go to FPU. Every other sport is ignored, baseball players are treated like royalty, and the education falls short. Unless you're trying to be a major league athlete, don't come to FPU."
College Junior,1,"Too much drug use and underage drinking. The baseball players are seemingly invincible to staff and police. Those who are at Franklin Pierce for strictly an education and not to get drunk and high every weekend fall between the cracks, and are forced to deal with the close quarters and drunk fools every weekend and every night."
College Junior,1,"Professors are uninterested in their classes, horrible at using the online system, and do not consistently email students back. The teachers that care and are happy in their jobs, are awesome, but they are few and far between."
College Junior,1,"Not much available, high prices."
College Junior,1,A car is necessary unless you stay on campus all the time.
College Junior,1,"The main purpose of campus security is to bust parties, and give parking tickets to undeserving students. They're a joke!"
College Junior,1,Fast food and a bar...
College Junior,1,"Unless you like cold winters, FPU is not for you."
College Freshman,1,greasygreasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy greasy
College Freshman,1,"They are horrible, unresponsive, and barley help"
College Freshman,1,Probably the coldest school in new england... Usually around 0 in the winter
College Freshman,1,At times it can be very good but most days it is the same thing over and over again. Some days I walk in and just walk out. It would be easier if I had access to a kitchen so I could make my own food.
College Junior,1,"The weather in Rindge is really cold and it's often pretty windy, making it much colder. While this is annoying at times, the fact that the campus is so small makes it more bearable. "
College Sophomore,1,"For clubbing, there are no options. Parties on campus are a frequent thing however, and most larger parties occur from Thursday to Sunday, while smaller parties in individual dorms are nightly.
"
College Sophomore,1,"Simply put, Rindge New Hampshire has absolutely nothing to offer. There are one or two restaurants if you have the money for them, but other than that, you can drive to a McDonald's in Jaffrey (which isn't a 24/7 option) or Dunkin Donuts (again, not 24/7). The latest someone could eat would be 11 pm, and then most things are closed."
College Sophomore,1,"Not much to do locally.  Takes at least 30 minutes to go to Keene, NH; Fitchburg, MA; etc.  if you want to do anything in terms of activities."
College Sophomore,1,Not much off-campus housing at least in terms of apartments or housing through the school.
College Sophomore,1,"There is a shuttle that can drive you up campus from the lower house styled dorms, or to Walmart, but it is frequently late or will not show up. Franklin Pierce is also in an extremely rural area so getting off campus is hard without your own car."
College Sophomore,1,So depending on where your dorms are parking can be really good or just a pain.  parking behind the freshman is like a game. If you leave to 5 min you'll never get back your parking spot. Getting prime parking is equivalent to a christmas day. I 'm serious. There are student and faculty parking and sometimes faculty parking is in the mix of mass student parking and you'll forget one day and you'll get a ticket for 25 dollars. During the winter finding a parking spot is the worst. The school blocks of one of the most important student parking spots on campus and use it to place snow banks when the winter begins. Even if it isn't snowing it is prohibited to park there.
College Freshman,1,housing options at franklin pierce university are few. almost every dorm is completely out of date and needs serious remodeling. housing is also over priced.
College Freshman,1,"Parking, especially for freshmen, is terrible. If you move your car, you're probably going to have to take 2-3 trips around campus to find a close spot. During the winter, they prohibit parking in some areas, cutting down on available spots even more."
College Freshman,1,"In Rindge, there isn't much to do. I haven't seen much interaction between students and locals. For shopping, you're better off going to Keene because there's more stores and a shopping center, whereas Rindge has just a Walmart that isn't 24 hours."
College Freshman,1,"There's the shuttle. It's pick-ups times are never on time. They picked me up and hour and a half late from Walmart, and that was the last time I used the shuttle. There's also the drunk bus that runs on the weekends. It just goes from the apartments down below to the dorms up top."
College Freshman,1,"I am in my second and last semester at FPU. I hate this place. The students here are inconsiderate, obnoxious, and truthfully just stupid. There is absolutely nothing to do here whether your on a team or not. Half of the professors I have had don't even know how to run their class or teach. My high school teachers were smarter. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. The caf food sucks. The gym sucks. You don't get anything for what you pay to go here, not even a challenging class. 3/4 of the freshman I have talked to hate it here too and want to transfer. A bunch have already transferred after the 1st semester. I wanted to, but didn't feel there was enough time to get the paper work done. This place is just overall a s*** hole. Oh, and don't leave your laundry for one second it will either be stolen or thrown all over the floor. I feel sorry for any incoming freshman. I understand now why they are going bankrupt. 70% of the freshman transfer out cause it is so awful and the staff that tell you it is great are just a bunch of liars and get paid to lie to you! By far worse decision of my life."
College Freshman,1,Pleast Do Not Come Here. You will come to regret this place after a few months. The majority of people I know are transferring after this first semester and on weekends that we cannot go home we just drink and wallow in depression.
College Freshman,1,There is a shuttle that takes you around the school but if you want to go to any surrounding town then you must find someone with a car or drive yourself.
College Sophomore,1,"Disgustingly Greasy, Low Quality Food. You can smell the grease form the cafe anywhere on campus, and after going in there you need a shower because you stink of the low quality cooking grease.  The ham has hard, inedible portions, the water has what appears to be rust in it, and everything else is just as low quality."
College Sophomore,1,"Slow, Unreliable, Full of Problems – Consistent errors that prevent you from logging on, printing papers, spell checking and so on.  They're also very, very slow."
Recent Alumnus,1,Crowded and Printers Dont Work at Times – Very crowded during the week but the weekends are a nice time to get work done. Printers need fixing all the time. Too many kids not enough printers
College Freshman,1,"The shuttles don't show up on time and sometimes not at all, bring your phone if your going to the store because they might not come back to pick you up....BRING YOUR OWN VEHICLE!!!"
College Freshman,1,"If You Could See for Yourself....You'd Probably Want to Shut This Place Down – Our CA actually told us that getting drunk and drugged up was okay as long as we didn't get him caught...  Yeah, so expect to see a lot of trouble in this area.  Especially behind the tennis courts... its just plain disgusting."
College Freshman,1,"Safety?   Ummm.......No? For starters, the CA told us it was A-OKAY if we smoked and got drunk, as long as we didn't get caught...Great influence!  There are never any police inside the buildings, where drunk freshman haunt the halls, campus is almost always full of skunks, baseball bats are allowed indoors, I've also seen hunting and butcher knives, ""cap guns"" aren't even checked..."
College Sophomore,1,"SUCKS! Really bad, especially during the winter."

Niche User,5,It was a great experience at this college. As soon as I touch the campus I felt at home. It is just the right size for me.
Niche User,5,"The one thing I truly enjoy the most about Mississippi Valley State University is the community within the university! Everyone is so welcoming and joyful, moreover in the STEM department. I haven't met anyone different."
Freshman,5,I had a great experience at valley around orientation. It took some getting used to at first coming from home but there were a lot of undergraduate that chose valley due to family connections and probably the cost at the time. they actually have some really great instructors who didn't mind working with us to make sure we understood concepts and ideologies and it seemed as if they had some  faculty/staff that liked to have fun and party with as well. I met some really good people there and the good outweighed the bad for me. Im ready for Freshman Year.
Sophomore,5,I love the school! It’s the culture shock I needed especially because I’m from California and it was amazing! Everyone needs to experience something like that!
Sophomore,5,There is no other school that is as special as Mississippi Valley State University. It's a home away from home. The faculty and staff are great. Everyone is like a huge family.
Alum,5,"Mississippi Valley State University offered me the opportunity to learn in an environment that was fun, friendly, and most importantly educational. I met professor's at the university that went of their way to ensure that I had every tool I would need before stepping into the real world. I was able to meet a lot of new people, some who are associates, some who became friends for a lifetime, and learn the proper way of networking with businesses. My overall experience was a informative, fulfilling, and memorable for every moment I experienced on their campus."
Freshman,5,"My experience at had been great and exciting. I love the university because it's closer to my home. I am a computer science major and Mississippi Valley have the best computer science department  in the delta, So I would recommend Valley State to anyone."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience with Mississippi Valley State University is wonderful. I love the campus because it’s close to home for me and it’s small while I still get the experience and credentials of a 4 year college. The community and environment are welcoming and friendly. The difference that I would like to see made at Mississippi Valley State University is an improvement in our athletics & better campus food."
Freshman,5,I like the the teaching environment in Mississippi valley state university. the teachers make sure the students have a clear understanding of the topic of the subject. The students in this school are also friendly and social. The best part is that they accept international students and even offer them full academic scholarship based on their SAT and high school scores
Junior,5,"MVSU is literally what you make it. Coming from the city life of Oakland CA, Mississippi Valley was the perfect place for me to find myself as a student and as a person. Its a very quiet campus, and they are equipped with all the basic resources one may need to succeed at an institution."

Junior,5,Mississippi valley state university has gave me an excellent experience that has allowed me to achieve great opportunities.
Senior,5,I am a student now at Mississippi Valley State University. The campus life is great. I’ve never had any problems while attending the university. The professors are very helpful in any way. There personalities are very uplifting.
Freshman,5,My first experience at the Mississippi Valley State University was an great experience. The professor make sure you understand everything they’re going over and makes sure you have it before you leave the class. The professor can be strict sometimes but you just got to go in there and handle your business and get out.
Freshman,5,"Overall, Mississippi Valley State is a great school. The classes are small, so that helps students and professors relationships grow. The people are very nice and helpful. The only change would be the dorms and the living conditions for the students. The food is good on most days, and the other days it could be better. They always insure that the students are safe before anything. They have very nice southern hospitality. The classes aren't designed for you to fail and the faculty will always make sure you're ahead and in class on time."
Freshman,5,"Well I'm still a student currently, but everything is pretty good just the food is not too decent for most people. I recommend this school because it's affordable and it does not have a huge student capacity which is good for only one reason: being too crowded in classroom and also it's more peaceful.  The thing about lack of students is lack of activities people may be interested in and which makes it kind of dull. The main is that we have a local college where there not much people in the city which makes it easier to drive, the only problem there are a lack of stores on campus and off campus so student could have a wider variety on what they want. These are my thoughts as an existing student there."
Junior,5,"Everything is good. The environment is boring but thats because the school is located inthe country. Athletics at MVSU is something that you would want to be apart of simply because it’ll make your experience much better. Academic wise the teachers are here willing to help you pass and find what you want to do in life. Overall college i about how you look at it, it is also a good thing to get away from home and see what the world has to offer thats one of my reasons for coming to this school."
Senior,5,"It really is a home away from home. U might get homesick, but there are many other activities to support your boredom. Classes are about communication between you and the professors. Trust me, there are tutors that are willing to help you. A closed mouth don't get feed."

The environment is very cozy and it gives you that since of home. The staff is nice. The students are respectful and friendly. The atomosphere overall is loving. Everyone looks out for on another. You will make lots of new friends. The campus is a nice size. Not too big but not too small, Just right. Game night and homecoming are very exciting times. Thats when you get to see the professors and student relax and have a lot of fun as the watch the football teams and bands battle for the win. I would recommend Mississippi Valley State University to everyone."
Freshman,5,I've felt very welcomed my first year attending. The environment was very nice. I plan to attend in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"Being an international student, experience so far has been amazing. Everybody, students and teachers, are extremely helpful in every problem"
Sophomore,5,"I'm blessed to be in such College where all the teachers, professors, and instructors are helpful in every way I need."

College Sophomore,5,"well for me i don't really like the Greek thing in general but other seem to like Greek, when the Greek affects the atmosphere on campus everyone that like Greek become really hyper and ready to party but that is my opinion. Most people in the band are in Greek fraternity and sorority. so at my school they like their Greek and i don't really know anything about Greek housing."
College Sophomore,5,what makes this school unique is that you can get help with a lot of things like classes and sometimes personal stuff. and also the really good thing about this campus is that is not too spread out like most colleges that i had seen. They have fun activities during the week that involves a holiday. And everyone here on campus come from different places and you get to meet new people from different countries.
Recent Alumnus,5,The school is very helpful.
College Freshman,5,"Mississippi Valley State believes in educating the whole student. Educational, cultural, social, well, service, and support is all there. As a freshman starting out my journey in the fall of 2015, Mississippi Valley's faculty and student mentors of Student Support Services have made sure to encourage me when the work had gotten a little tough.It is an amazing and safe campus. Although, personally I think the band has it going on. Throughout all of my great experiences I've encountered with my university, the Mean Green Marching Machine is my favorite of them all. I love dancing to the sound of the sweet melodies. I wouldn't trade being a dancer at Mississippi Valley for anything in the world. It wasn't my first choice to attend this university, but I'm there for a reason and I have grown to love my HBCU. When I graduate in May of 2019, I will be a proud alumni of Mississippi Valley State University. Valley is for me and if I could; I would love to do it again- Simply because Valley is THE road map where I can make my dreams reality. It is where I can Dream. Explore. Succeed! As we always say, ""One Team. One Goal. One Valley!"""
College Freshman,5,Whichever I choose is ok. Mostly at night after caféteria closes.
College Freshman,5,"All parties given on or off are heavily security, weapons free, and drug free. Zero tolerance for wrong behaviors."
College Freshman,5,Like home away from home. I hadn't found any flaws.
College Freshman,5,Campus life at MVSU is very initiative to learning and just experience as a whole. You're granted labs for studying and extensive tutorial if needed. All departments offer chances to be enriched or to get ahead in whatever you're struggling with or just needs extras on. It's very costly because they waive out of state fees and offer scholarships to all students that applies at any levels. Dorms are being renovated and updated. This school and campus is convenient and is becoming more convenient during each renovation completed and started. It was my best option and I'm quite sure someone else would enjoy there choice/option here at Mississippi Valley State University.
College Student,5,The teachers push you to be all that you can be.
College Student,5,The security makes it safe and makes sure drugs take no part on campus.
College Freshman,5,The apartments behind campus are beautiful and are beyond cheaper than stay on campus. You only have to pay rent and one bill and everything else is free including furniture.They are very lenient. The school doesn't help at all it's all depending on you.
College Freshman,5,Getting into the institution was easy. They will accept anyone.

Most professors look out for their students and make sure that they are understanding the classes.  Some innovations could be made to the laundry room, and the cafeteria food.  The new gym has several new innovations with a great weight room.  Some of the staff comes off as rude (i.e.: financial aid office).  If you are looking for a small university to attend but still be exposed to new things, Mississippi Valley State University is the place to be. "

Sophomore,2,"If you want a small, simple or quiet life, then you might want to consider Valley. Located is a small rural area, the institution gives you the opportunity to discover your inner self. But that discovery will also be made over eating terrible cafeteria food XD. The financial aid office is filled with amateurs and rude people. The school as an entity is below standard but the Mathematics, Computer and Information Sciences department there is awesome!!!"
College Sophomore,2,There were numerous issues with rooms and cars getting broken into in the past year. The campus isn't lit enough behind buildings or on walk ways to the back of the campus. They should really build in emergency poles around those areas just in case something does happen and need to be alerted.
College Freshman,2,the parties on campus are boring af. people just standing around while frats and sorors stroll to trash music. these people need to turn tf up.
College Freshman,2,i stayed in university/ratcliff and it is the worst dorm on campus.
College Senior,2,There aren't any nearby towns. You actually have to drive everywhere.
College Sophomore,2,Fix the damn dorms !
College Freshman,2,All we have are the typical fast food restaurants. They're all located about 20 minutes up the road which is bad for students like me with no car.
College Freshman,2,"Being a student-athlete at my school, I did not have such a great experience I hoped for when I became a college-athlete. Students loved to watch our games and support us, but as a team, we were putting on a show. Our athletic facilities were horrible. Middle school and high school gyms have nicer facilities than we do. Our wooden bleachers were ready to fall apart, our weight room was old and messed up. It didn't look like the type of gym any athlete would want to be in."
College Freshman,2,consistently not impressed with any of the teachers or work. The curriculum does not allow for progress at your own rate. several classes are pointless but required
College Freshman,2,The teachers do not know what they are doing. I rarely have any homework and don't feel challenged in any of my classes. Im a biology major
College Sophomore,2,This past year at MVSU campus strictness has become a problem. they are starting to treat us more like students at a communty college or rather as high school students. if they were to ease up off of some of the new rules then maybe things would be as good as they were this past year.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is the one thing that I wish this institution would improve. My freshman year I didn't have a car and even though classes wasn't far or may have been side by side I still needed transportation to get to different building so that I could check on certain things. Plus on rainy days, students like I would have to walk in the rain and it wasn't fun nor motivating me to walk to class. Valley at one point of time did have a shuttle going around but the timing was all bad and there where no bus schedules available."
College Sophomore,2,"I came to MVSU because it has a great Public Policy program, the campus is just 50 minute away from where I work which make it convience for me to attend. The instructor are always available to answer any question you may have with the assignment.  Class participation are encourage and is very informative. The discussion alone help you get a better understanding of the course being offered."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The drug scene at MVSU was a little out of hand. The police did what they could to prevent it, but the police always seemed one step behind the offenders."
College Sophomore,2,"Boy O-Boy! Good breakfasts, but lunch and dinner, the same food is served sometimes and food is okay!"
College Sophomore,2,"The guys are very friendly, but that may be because they want to be more than friends : /.  But, for the most part they're pretty cool and fun sometimes!"
College Sophomore,2,The internet seems to be down alot not all of the computers work properly and not all of the computers print
College Sophomore,2,Dont Indulge – parties are priced at a good price and all of them walking distance. However some may be free but i am not focus on parties and the night life i am more focus on my education right now.
College Freshman,2,"When it rains puddles of water form around campus, they usually hang around form a while and leave the grass mushy."
College Freshman,2,"Very live and sometimes wild parties, but you will need a car because they are along the highway."
Niche User,1,"I was there as a high school student for a program. The staff were unprofessional and irresponsible. At one point, I had nowhere to sit in the cafeteria and when I asked my guide for help she just shrugged it off and provided no assistance. This would have been okay to get past if I was allowed to go to my dorm, which I was not and was forced to just stand there foolishly for a long time. Then, some teachers introduced themselves to us and they were very rude and aggressive; telling the students that they did not want us to receive the funds that the program promised and that they could treat us however they wanted because of it. I felt ridiculed and belittled. I did not feel safe or welcomed there, so I decided, that same day, that I wanted to leave. Unless you are the type of person that is okay with being treated like this, I would not recommend anyone to attend this school. Those few hours that I was there was enough for me to decide that I wanted nothing to do with it."
College Sophomore,1,Can't apply for FAFSA because I'm international Student. But American student do get Aid
College Sophomore,1,They should have buses that take us into town. There's nothing to help students w no cars.
College Freshman,1,"Luckily I'm able to live in a new dorm, but it's still not the best. Other dorms look filthy and horrendous. Only perk about living in the new dorm is having our own bathroom."
College Freshman,1,People walk around smoking and drinking. Sometimes even the smell of smoke goes through the air vents and into other rooms. Broken alcohol bottles are found all over campus.
College Freshman,1,"I have never been so miserable in my life. I did not fit in, I didn't get along with a long of people, teachers didn't take class seriously, admissions were always slow when we needed something dealing with financial aid, transferring, student records etc. The campus itself was ready to fall apart. Worst experience of my life."
College Freshman,1,"The school is literally in the middle of nowhere. The closest town near by is about twenty minutes away. There is no type of public transportation, so having a car here is necessary or else you'll be stuck on campus all the time ."
College Freshman,1,SECURITY DOES NOT PROVIDE A SECURE PLACE
College Sophomore,1,"there are not really that many english education majors at my school,so you have to search for the few that there are. there are however alot of early childhood education majors,but that is in no way beneficial since we have different cirriculum after a year or two. with this type of set up it is hard to find study buddies and what not,"
College Sophomore,1,the food in the cafe is horrible!!!! the only place that we have as a second option is checkers and that can get pretty boring. there isn't much to offer if you are looking for something healthy to eat. the only good thing is that every wednesday is chicken wednesday.
College Sophomore,1,There is no transportation other than your friends!!! You have to walk to class!!
College Junior,1,There are no parties through the week. Most students sit outside and get bitten by mosquitoes.
College Freshman,1,No Transport – There is no transportation. You better have a car.
College Junior,1,We don't have any transportation. The only kind you would have is if your or a friend drives.
College Junior,1,I would say that our computer system at MVSU is horrible. We do not have wireless in some dorms and then sometimes the connect will not come up.  Then if we go to the computer lab in our dorm those computers are so out of date.  Then they run so slow.  We do not have printing in our lab in the dorm so we either have to have our own or go somewhere else and print where we have to pay all that money.
College Freshman,1,"Athletic Centers – The athletic facilities at Valley State are horrible. There is only one weight room and it is only open eight hours a day and none on weekends. There are two gyms, the old and new gym, but only one is open to none basketball players. The old gym is occupied by track and softball players most of the day and it leaves no time for free play."
College Sophomore,1,"Itta Bena – Itta Bena is a very small city. There is not much to do there.The are not any attractions, shopping stores, or anything else."
College Senior,1,Process Is Not Good – I receive a little financial aid. This pass year i didnt have enough to pay for school I had a balance. They are very slow and not fair I believe. I have not been awared for the 2011-2012 school year yet and school starts soon. I went the other day now I have to go back over.
College Sophomore,1,Popular Smoking on a No-Smoking Campus – The idea of a no-smoking campus is obvious not enforced enough when you have students smoking at times throughout the campus.
College Junior,1,"Not Very Much to Do – My Campus is basically in the middle of nowhere so, it is very hard to have a good time other than on campus. And that includes food, entertainment, shopping, car troubles, electronics etc."

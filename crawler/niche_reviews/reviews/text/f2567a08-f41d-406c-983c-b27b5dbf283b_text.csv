Sophomore,5,"My favorite thing about Becker is the atmosphere. The class sizes are small which gives Professors the opportunity to bond with students. Two campuses is double the fun, and there is space to do everything from studying to napping. I also love the snacking opportunities on campus and take full advantage of my Becker Bucks that are included in tuition. My major is nursing, but I have also taken interesting classes about animal science and psychology. Everyone is welcomed at Becker, I feel very at home in Worcester and Leicester. Although the classes are challenging, they are gratifying. I am very happy with my decision to attend Becker College."
Sophomore,5,"Unfortunately, our campuses were closed due to COVID-19. The transition was not easy, but Professors were very understanding. Most of my classes removed deadlines to lift stress and final exams turned into essays. I was sad to miss out on sports games and other spring events but appreciate that Becker cared about our health and safety. The College gave updates almost daily on all things COVID-19 and news about the college. I would prefer to return to campus in the fall but online learning is not that bad. Zoom classes are convenient and I still felt connected to my Professors and friends."
Alum,5,"Great community, great support and there’s a lot of resources to succeed. They were very flexible with allowing me to double major and I learned the perfect combination of skills. Some people complain about the school, but you get what you put in honestly. There were a lot of gamers who didn’t do work, but I just ignored them and always did well. There were a few bad apple professors mixed in, but the good ones made it worth it and really contributed towards my success. They actually cared and you aren’t just a number. The tutoring center was great and helped me a lot to succeed. They have some job/internship opportunities that helped boost my resume. I got an interview immediately after graduating and got an amazing, high paying job at a company. When applying to colleges 4 years ago, I was rejected to WPI and was disappointed. Now I’m grateful for it because I wouldn’t be where I am today if I didn’t go to Becker."
Alum,5,I believe they need to work a lot harder on representing diversity at the school. Especially based on where the school is located.
Freshman,5,"I transferred to Becker College in the spring semester of 2019, I never have or will regret my decision because Becker College is an amazing school that I look forward to attending every day. During my transfer process, the team of people that helped me through the process in Becker's offices were remarkable and made sure I would be all set and covered for attending in the spring. All of the staff is friendly and willing to help out the students in any way possible. 100% an amazing school that I recommend attending."
Freshman,5,I haven't been at becker very long but I absolutely love it here. I am attending becker for their game design program and all of the teachers have a solid background in the gaming industry. The Worcester campus is also a gorgeous mix of newly designed buildings and gorgeous Victorian dorms.
Senior,5,"Becker is like no other college. The second you walk onto campus you instantly get this sense of belonging and family. The small classroom sizes make for a more intimate learning experience and the professors remember your name even semesters after you’ve had their class and that honestly makes such a big difference when you’re walking down the hall and your core professor from 3 semesters ago stops you to ask “Hey Caitlyn, how are things going?” Not only are the faculty amazing, but in the classroom, we are taught so much more than calculus and Anatomy and physiology."
Junior,5,"Becker College is a place that has helped me find out who I am as a person. I have gained connections and have been exposed to situations that I would have never thought I'd be a part of before. Not only has it provided me with lifelong friendships, it has provided me an unwavering level of support that has allowed me to take chances, try new things and become the man that I am today. I most certainly not be where I am at today without the help of Becker College."
Niche User,5,"I like the animal hospital that is at the campus!  The whole campus is nice, but something I might want to change are the dorms."
Freshman,5,What I really like about Becker college is that everyone is so nice and helpful. I play soccer there and the people are always looking out for each other and I feel safe here. The nursing program is a lot of fun and teaches me great amount of information I will need to be successful.
Freshman,5,"Became a student in the spring semester of 2018. Started in January and been loving it ever since. Professors,education,people,campus,food, all great. The residence halls on the Worcester campus could go for some improvement."
Sophomore,5,"I don't think people give Becker College enough credit. As far as the academics go, the professors are very approachable, the classes are easy to register for, and the advising staff is impeccable. Any time there was an issue with my schedule, or there were problems with my classes or concerns about internships my advisor was there to help immediately. The nursing staff specifically has really helped me understand the job, the life, and the tasks of a nurse. I transferred here and would't choose to go anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman, but I've been on campus a few times these past months. The professors are incredibly helpful with helping me adjust seeing that I'm not from here or the area. They have a wide variety of foods, all heathey and delicious. They even have options for vegans and vegetarians which is great because nobody likes eating plain salad everyday! The dorms are comfortable and it seems like everyone here is super open minded. I have yet to meet someone who discriminates against me or my equals."
Sophomore,5,I love my school. I have made the most amazing friends and love the area. The classes are challenging but I take advantage of the free tutoring that is offered.I  think that this is the best school for me to prepare to apply to veterinary school.
College Sophomore,5,The courses are great and most of the professor are kind and helpful to students.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe and secure on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school and it's diversity not just with the people and majors but with their two campuses
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus. Campus security is constantly making rounds to make sure that we are protected.
College Sophomore,5,"I have only had one professor I didn't like that was difficult, overall my experience with professors and courses has been great."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus officers are constantly patrolling the area around campus. Though the Worcester campus is not in a great section of the city, I always feel safe on campus due to the vigilance of Becker PD."
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of recognition when you play sports and there are a fair amount of students that go to the sport events. There is a lot of school spirit which is good to see when you play a sport.
College Student,5,"Campus police are easy to call, and believe reports of threats, as happened down the street at another hall earlier in the fall semester. They patrol regularly and get to know the students so as to quickly differentiate between students and outsiders in any situation. There was a sexual assault on a student earlier in the year, and without revealing information about the student, the word was out about the vehicle and manner of kidnapping used, to keep the rest of us relatively safer."
College Student,5,"We live in Victorian Mansions, with easily reachable, personable RAs. We walk to classes on our campus and have rotating shuttles to the other campus that are driven by safe drivers. Conflicts are dealt with swiftly and bias/racism/sexism is almost not an issue."
College Student,5,"Becker College has an amazing graphic design and gaming program. The technology is all up-to-date and comparable to technical schools in the area. The professors are experts, and the other students are focused as well on their success."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience so far has been great. The students there are open, welcoming, and very friendly. Finding new friends was very easy. The teachers are all very nice and incredibly smart in their areas of study. They will always be able to find a way to teach you everything you need to know. The area is very relaxing as it is in a quiet residential neighborhood."
College Freshman,5,Near Shrewsbury Street in Worcester. So many places with food!
College Senior,5,"I am in the animal sciences program. Everyone enjoys the classes, they are very difficult, but you learn everything you need too, including hands-on work. Some of the classes are overly tough, and have a bad success rate such as: anatomy & physiology and clinical experience. These two courses are notorious for more than half the class failing."
College Senior,5,"Specifically on the Leicester campus, it is very safe. The Becker police are extremely polite and helpful. I have not heard any occurrences of sexual assault."
College Junior,5,"The workload is insane and you tend to be burned out by the time finals come around, but the program itself is mostly fun. Most classes are game related, and all the labs have the current software needed to complete our assignments. You definitely have to always keep your eyes out for internships or work opportunities. The school provides us with opportunities to network and get our work seen by people in the industry, however it is up to us to make sure that our work is good enough to be considered."
College Freshman,5,"You will see people of all races, sexual orientation, as well as belief backgrounds all over. No one should feel like a minority here. period."
College Freshman,5,"I play Soccer and Lacrosse and I must say I am in love with the things they have to offer for athletes. There are trainers, gyms, special coaches, and more."
College Freshman,5,Some people may not like the winter because of the snow but I think my campus looks beautiful when covered in snow and during fall its just amazing with all the different colors surrounding the campus.
College Freshman,5,We have plenty of computer labs available on campus at almost all hours of the day and most of the night.
College Freshman,5,A lot of parties are going on between Friday and Sunday nights. There are also a few clubs in town if parties aren't your scene. Some tickets are available for certain bands and shows throughout the semesters too.
College Sophomore,5,Worcester is awful but Leicester is beautiful
College Sophomore,5,Random majors but pre vet is life 
College Sophomore,5,Teachers are old but we have clinical
College Sophomore,5,Love campus pd they give me rides when I'm on crutches
College Sophomore,5,I love the old Victorian houses. 
College Freshman,5,"The shuttles at Becker are great. They coincied with class schedules and are always on time.  They travel between the two campuses, so if you have class  on the other campus you don't need a car, and they are free"
College Junior,5,"I feel extremely safe, especially on the Leicester campus. Both campuses have 24/7 campus police on campus (duh). If there are any issues, they'll be there in no time. 

Worcester is like any other city, you should always have someone with you when walking around, especially at night. There's plenty of shady areas in Worcester. Generally the campus is a very nice and safe area."
College Junior,5,There's a shuttle that goes between each campus and is generally very punctual. A car isn't needed as there is a shuttle every week that brings the student to the local Walmart to get any necessities.
College Sophomore,5,It is very easy to find parking on either campus.  Most dorms have a parking lot and there is also street parking on both campuses.
College Sophomore,5,Campus police are always patrolling the area.  I have never felt unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Food is amazing. Chartwells does a great job in not only making good food but everything LOOKS SO GOOD.
College Senior,5,"Worcester gets boat loads of snow. If you don't like classes canceled or walking to campus in cold, slippery conditions, this school is not for you."
Recent Alumnus,5,It is a beautiful campus as is the surrounding area. I love the feel of the community and I can see myself living here for a while.
College Freshman,5,The Animal Science program is the only one of its kind for a small school environment. The clinic is woven into our curriculum and all the students and faculty are completely animal crazy. Missing your pet more then your parents is totally normal here.
College Sophomore,5,I feel the academics at Becker College are outstanding. They really provide me with some useful knowledge.
College Sophomore,5,The weather does not really affect my campus experience.
College Freshman,5,"The campus just got a brand new student center with state of the art equipment including a gym, new cafeteria, and so on. The place is beautiful."
College Freshman,5,"I am in the Game Design major and am extremely satisfied with the program so far.  While there are general education requirements to fulfill, there is plenty of room in the schedule to take major related classes starting the first semester.  Unlike large universities, there is never a problem to register for a class.  Sections will be added as needed to meet each student's requirements.  Dr. Cotnoir, Director of the Design Program, is very familiar with this industry and has the necessary vision to keep the program evolving with the rapid changes in the game industry.  All of my professors have been accessible and, because of small class size, they get to know the students.  This semester my classes range in size from 18 - 26 students.  The smaller class size works best for me and getting to know the professors better will help later on when I need recommendations for internships, jobs or further education."
College Freshman,5,"My major is Interactive Media - Game Design and I really believe that Becker College is the perfect place to earn this degree.  The program is the largest on the East Coast and the selection of courses is impressive.  They have broken the program into multiple specializations - so you can work on Game Design or Development/Programming and choose a specialization in 3D Modeling/Animation, Game Audio, Creative Writing, Japanese Culture, Game Programming or Art and Design.  More courses are added each year as the program continues to expand.  Becker is affiliated with MassDigi (located on the Becker campus) and this provides opportunities for student internships and interaction with professionals from the Game industry.  My goal is to become a Game Designer and I am sure this association with MassDigi will help when it comes time to look for a job.  I looked at many of the East Coast schools with Game programs and Becker was definitely the best fit for me.  Other schools had small game programs (taking as few as 35 kids a year), while the game students make up a sixth of the entire Becker College population.  The professors ""get"" gaming students and that says alot.  It is also important to note that Becker College is the only East Coast school that has ranked in the Top Ten Game Design programs by the Princeton Reivew for all three years.  We are ranked 23rd in the world by Animation Review in their Top 100 Schools for Animation, Gaming, and Design.  Having a degree from a school with this sort of Game Industry recognition will help the students when it is time to look for a job."
College Freshman,5,"Becker College is one of the top colleges in the United States for Animal Sciences, due to the fact that there is a vet clinic on campus. This gives you hands-on experience with live animals, rather than just lecture material and textbooks."
College Freshman,5,Campus police are around 24/7 and are super friendly. The Leicester campus is in the middle of no where so nothing happens EVER to make one feel unsafe. The school was also in the top 20 Sober list of 2012 by the Princeton Review so we don thave too much drinking or partying that interfers with college life.
College Freshman,5,"I am Brazilian, and while I have found few other brazilians on campus, I found students from just about everywhere else. I have gotten different political opinions from different viewpoints, and since it has no religious affliction, there have been students from everywhere. GSA is popular on campus and do several different events throughout the year."
Recent Alumnus,5,Campus police usually solve the problem before most of the students hear about it
College Junior,5,"Wide Variety – There are many places to go, no matter the time of day."
College Senior,5,"The Woo Crowd – The Becker College diversity is tremendous. I feel that theres no dominant race on this campus. Whites, Blacks, hispanics and a good percentage of international backgrounds. I have been on this campus for about three years now and i see many different types of groups hanging together. I feel that everyone is accepted, well at least for personalities and not by gender or ethnicity."
College Freshman,5,"Career Goals – I am very happy with everything I have been learning in the program. It is well worth the money and my future goals of becoming a veterinarian, are extremely real and reachable. I do not have any concerns with finding a job after college. They give all the necessary tools needed, to achieve your goals."
Junior,4,The professors and staff are great and very supportive in helping you exceed to the best of your abilities.
Junior,4,"Most of the classes I took were either in class or hybrid but for the online portions, the professors use academic sources and engage you through projects and online discussions."
Freshman,4,I like the small classes and the athletic community. The food is not very good and the housing isn't either. I enjoy my athletic team and facilities. I am a pre-vet major and so far have enjoyed the program. I wish there were more opportunities to be involved with the vet clinic.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Becker is that they offer great supports to students. There are tutors, advisors, and counselors who help students when they are struggling. However, the school would benefit from being more ethnically and culturally diverse."
Niche User,4,"I went to an open house at Becker and have since applied.  They gave me over 30k, basically half of my tuition.  I want to study their Interactive Media design program with a concentration in Game Arts.  I was impressed with this program because it encompassed different elements of game design, from development to production, instead of just one small major."
Sophomore,4,Small intimate class setting. If building a relationship with your professors is important then Becker is a great place to obtain that educational quality.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my time so far at Becker has been great. The professors are wonderful, and the academic programs are great. My only complaint would be the pricey tuition. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here and look forward to returning in the fall."
Freshman,4,"Becker College is a great school for any animal science major. They have a lot of programs and clubs to help students gain experience. Plus, the school is close to many shops like a Super Walmart. The community is small, but everyone is friendly and close-knit."
Sophomore,4,"Becker is an amazing school for those looking for leadership roles and learning a whole new way of thinking. Becker teaches us a way of thinking that will help us in the future. The professors are amazing and always there to help. Becker feels like a community, a good one to be a part of. It's expensive, but it's worth it."
Niche User,4,"Overall, my experience with Becker has been great. They have answered all of my questions and I love how they work. The atmosphere of the school was fantastic."
Junior,4,"Becker is a small school, so it is a great opportunity to get involved and have professors get to know you to. The class sizes are great. Around becker also has a variety of things to do, if you ever do not know what to do"
Senior,4,"Great school. Still working out the 4 year BSN program, but with each semester that passes it gets better and better."
Senior,4,"Becker has been very kind to me. I took a leave of absents from the school of nursing for over a year, then I was welcomed back with much  generosity  and necessary guidance when I chose to return."
Alum,4,"nursing program is a hot mess organizational wise. 
but we all became nurses so

areas in worcester was ok, some weird people that walk around but didnt totally feel unsafe.  

very expensive school but can't complain because everyone is now"
Sophomore,4,"Simply, Becker College is what you make of it. It provides students everything they need in order to succeed in any field they so desire. However, there is no hand holding here. Students need to show initiative in pursuing their degree, and work beyond just the classroom. It sounds harsh, but with all the opportunities Becker College offers it would be hard NOT to get involved."
Freshman,4,It has a very nice environment and good learning atmosphere. The campus is kept up to date and there are many activities for you to do.
Junior,4,"Becker College is very small, and the classrooms are normally less than 20 students, which is very helpful for one on one help and making lasting friendships as well as getting extra help when needed."
Sophomore,4,I like the community and that it was close to home but there not much to do for commuters because the activities on and around campus are late at night and I would have huge gaps in between classes. I liked how the had a vet clinic on campus that allows hands on learning with real animals and vets.
College Senior,4,I feel safe and if i ever had a problem there is people to go to
College Senior,4,A lot of students attend the games and cheer on their school. The facilities are nice and always clean.
College Junior,4,"Becker requires all of your information to be uploaded to them via the computer. I have had a hard time with that. I would rather just be able to hand deliver it, but that is not an option. Other than that, my transition has been pretty smmoth thus far."
College Sophomore,4,The classes are geared toward us graduated and being prepared for a career.
College Sophomore,4,I really don't know much about the athletic system.
College Sophomore,4,The curriculum is the best part of Becker College it helps us be prepared for life after college.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of chances for internships and jobs during and after you are done with school.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the sports and actively go watch them
College Sophomore,4,The professors are there to help you with whatever you need. Just ask for help and they will help you to the best of their ability.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms were clean and the campus always felt safe. Easy walk to class in the morning 5 minutes tops.
College Sophomore,4,The school provides numerous sources of support and has safety awareness activities to educate students.
College Sophomore,4,Sports at Becker are great but I just have no interest in them.
College Sophomore,4,The Becker name carries a lot of weight in the Worcester community. I feel that a degree from Becker will help me obtain better employment opportunities than other area colleges may.
College Sophomore,4,"I love Becker. I am in the adult accelerated program and feel that, for the most part, I am getting my money's worth. My professors are knowledgeable, and are often formidable forces in their fields (one of my professors is the VP of Accounts for a prominent local business, and another is in upper management in the Risk Management Department at a large local insurance company). I enjoy knowing that the professors I'm learning from have taken what they are teaching, applied it in their lives and were successful. Also, I love the fact that I have lots options for both online and in-person classes. The tuition is a bit high and the buildings do need some remodeling (especially the parking areas!), but overall I am enjoying my experience at Becker quite a bit!"
College Sophomore,4,"The sports programs are well-promoted at Becker, and though I do not participate in sports through Becker I've heard very good things from any of the athletes I've spoken with."
College Freshman,4,"I would choose my school all over again because, it is very accepting and helping community. It is a very home like school and the teachers are very helpful when you need them, and they care about your education."
College Freshman,4,I HAVE GREAT INTERACTION WITH THE PROFESSORS AT THE SCHOOL.
College Freshman,4,BASED ON PRIOR HISTORY MY JOB PLACEMENT PROSPECTS IN NURSING ARE EXCELLENT
College Freshman,4,I AM VERY HAPPY WHERE I LIVE ON CAMPUS AND MY ROOMMATE HAS BEEN GREAT ALSO
College Freshman,4,I PLAY FOR THE WOMENS HOCKEY TEAM AND HAVE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE COLLEGE ATHLETIC EXPERIENCE
College Freshman,4,I HAVE ENJOYED BECKER COLLEGE SINCE THE MOMENT I CAME HERE AND VERY HAPPY WITH MY COLLEGE CHOICE
College Student,4,"The career center helps us to research internships, which are often required in junior and/or senior years. Beyond that, the student more or less needs to rely on their own connections, which is to be expected."
College Student,4,"The career center helps us to research internships, which are often required in junior and/or senior years. Beyond that, the student more or less needs to rely on their own connections, which is to be expected."
College Student,4,"The gyms are accessible for all students, and are up-to-date on equipment and clean. The sports themselves are not all-encompassing, however athletes are not left out."
College Freshman,4,My major has been very easy to get all the classes I needed without issue. Friends are in other majors all getting itno their classes with ease. Most popular is Gaming and Vetrinarian
College Freshman,4,Campus police and community police work hand in hand and they are always present. Feel very safe have not had any issues
College Freshman,4,"All of my professors are approachable, fair and understanding"
College Freshman,4,There are always events. Your choice how involved you are
College Freshman,4,Becker has taught me a lot and has given me the chance to make many new friends. The general class are basic and I can't wait to get to more classes related to my major. I did well on my first semester and a good start gives me a lot of hope that I can continue to do well.
College Junior,4,"The school is very professional, although you may have to go there in person and schedule meetings to get the most out of it. Internship opportunities and competitions give students great chances to both meet and gain employment during &/or after attending."
College Freshman,4,"It's more of a community, everyone is friendly. I just have financial issues which makes it difficult to pay for my schooling."
College Sophomore,4,I have made some amazing friends. We have different movies that play every Friday night that is awesome about our school. We also have two campuses that makes us stand out compared to some others. I am happy to be on the equestrian team and my major is a great one!! I would choose this school again because of all the animal science majors and the fact it has an equestrian team.
College Freshman,4,Becker has been nothing but helpful with the transition from high school to college. Any questions I've had they've been able to answer and in a timely manner. Orientation was a lot of fun and a great experience. We did a community service project and got free frozen yogurt. Everyone on campus seems very nice
College Junior,4,"The people at my college are very nice. The upper classmen help the under classmen around if they cant find their class. Its definately unique because it offers majors that most community colleges, like animal science. The students are also involved in the community because the college has programs that connect the students to programs outside of the college for their major."
College Sophomore,4,"I find my school to be the perfect school for Animal studies. The curriculum for my major is pretty rigorous and I can't wait to see what the rest of my time here brings me. Although the school might be good educationally it could use a few upgrades as far as housing. It provided me a good Freshman year experience and I know it wouldn't have been the same had I not joined the Field Hockey team. Joining the team forced me into meeting other athletes like myself, and helped me form a lot of friendships throughout the campus."
College Freshman,4,It's very close to Union Station which is good for me as a commuter.
College Freshman,4,I received a good scholarship automatically with my financial aid.
College Freshman,4,"You are required to do a twenty hour internship at the YWCA childcare (It's worth a credit and connected to assignments) for the class Principals of Education. Other classes have similar. It's unpaid, but it doesn't take a lot of your time and does give hands on experience working with preschoolers. (They're so cute!)"
College Freshman,4,"I like the Early Childhood Education program at Becker, because the have relationships with a variety of schools in the area and give you the opportunity to try observations, internships, practicum hours, etc. is a variety of environments."
College Senior,4,"If you go into Worcester, there are plenty of different options to choose from, as long as you have a car."
College Senior,4,"For the most part, everyone knows everyone at this school, so people are pretty lenient until a complaint is made."
College Junior,4,"I enjoy the shuttles, I get to save my gas.

I just wish there were better times for the shuttle, they sometimes interfere with my classes"
Senior,2,Last spring because of covid everything was online and most of the time it was ok at least when the professor showed up. They had many problems getting organized. Maybe this year will be better.
Sophomore,2,"It’s alright, education wayyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced don’t do any hands on, people who work in the vet clinic are complete assholes, they are extremely difficult to contact and don’t care if you need accommodations, along with not telling you what you need for accommodations until you have a day or two left to do it. Food is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING I lost 25 pounds on campus cuz I could not keep any of it down. If you need accommodations don’t come here they don’t care about you or what accommodations you need. Way over priced for everything. Also if you have an ESA people will judge you for one outbreak your animal has. Also don’t let their dogs in the vet clinic outside more than once or twice most students train them while they are inside their kennels still unbelievable!"
Sophomore,2,Online is the most draining thing you’ll ever do I was on my computer 7-8 hrs a day every single day it was 10000x more stressful online and so much harder to learn I barely scraped by passing
Senior,2,Improving but still way expensive. Only game design is worth it and even then you better be at the head of the class. E-sports is getting going so that is good also.
Niche User,2,"Not good for anyone with mental illness problems. They ask for a ton of expensive testing in order to give you accomidations. People are imature and it's hard to make friends if you aren't super social. Pretty much no party scene, pretty damn boring. Professors don't seem to care much, at least for the required classes.  "
College Junior,2,The curriculum and workload are average but the professors seem to hate their jobs.
College Junior,2,The area is pretty unsafe. It's probably safer to live on campus.
College Junior,2,The campus is in a bad neighborhood. I feel unsafe most of the time.
College Junior,2,There are not a lot of different types of people at my school.
College Junior,2,"It is so COLD in new england!! It makes walking a nightmare, not to mention the constant snowing during winter. It's nice to occasionally get out of class, but when you have a class that only happens once a week and it gets cancelled twice because of the weather, it's awful."
College Freshman,2,In Leicester it is much easier to find parking because the area is more rural. However in Worcester it is very complicated because you are right in the city.
College Freshman,2,It's always windy as f***. Snow stacks up in mountains on this hill and the asswipes of maintenance workers can't plow for shit leaving ice everywhere leaving you susceptible to being mayor of crash city.
College Freshman,2,"It is noticeable that people use drugs and drink alcohol but they are mostly used off of campus.  Also, people are not pressured that much at all."
College Freshman,2,"The facilities are good. But Becker is a division three school, we don't have many fans coming out to support our teams. We also don't have much seating for fans that do come. Becker does have participation in sports from the students though. You see students from all over the country on some kind of scholarship to play sports for this school."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't too many activities that go on, but when they do it's all during the week. On weekends it's completely dead at Becker. Everybody goes home. It gets kind of boring, and the dining hall doesn't bother to make new food on weekends. Kind of gross."
College Freshman,2,"You either get a great apartment or a really bad one. If you get one in Leicester, chances are it's one of the safer ones. Worcester has a history of crime, so it may not be wise to get an apartment there."
College Freshman,2,There are two small campuses located 15 minutes away from each other. I thought it was a cool idea but now I realize how utterly inconvenient it is since my boyfriend lives on the other campus. Yes there are frequent shuttles but then you have to plan and all that stuff. Also both campuses are somewhat different. one is kind of like a regular college campus the other is in the middle of a 'city'.
College Freshman,2,"Sniff Sniff – It's easy to gets weed around campus as stupid as that may seem. However don't get caught even smelling like it because Becker policy if they smell it on you you are guilty and they charge you a 100 dollar fine.As dumb as that may seem it's true. So if you don't want to get caught don't hang around your pot head friends. But not many people get caught often and you dont get into much trouble besides the fine. Oh and they mail a bill to your house with the ""disciplinary fine"" highlighted."
Niche User,1,"If I could rate this school 0 stars I would. The nursing program is a joke. Many of the professors do not care if you pass or fail. The tutor center is no help. They are overpriced for the appalling education. You would get a better education at home doing your own reading and classwork because that is essentially the kind of education you are getting. They do not care to teach their students. The nursing program is cliquey so it's not easy finding nonjudgemental, caring friends. I am so glad I left. Worst experience of my life."
Niche User,1,"They are very disrespectful. I was emailing the financial aid office in regards to whether or not I would be able to receive financial aid because I am an independent. The woman was rude the entire conversation and proceeded to say, ""If you have nobody to help you financially pay for college, then you wouldn’t be able to afford to come to Becker."" as though I could not afford to pay for it myself. Now don't get me wrong the price of Becker is quite a lotconsidering you'd think it would show in their academics but of course that isn't something that they hold to high value. After that I ended up switching to another college that was less costly and a lot better academically. Would not recommend."
Senior,1,They will rob you of any money they can possibly get. The staff are useless. The classes set you up for failure. Worst mistake of my life.
Senior,1,"Professors play favorites , the school budgets horribly, and have very little diversity. The previous advisors fail to do their job resulting in people being forced to stay a year or more past anticipated graduation. Resident Life is so strict you feel like you’re in prison, if you laugh to loud someone is knocking on your door talking about “courtesy hours”. There are way better options than this glorified high school. Don’t enroll and save your mental health and pocket health."
College Freshman,1,WE DO NOT HAVE GREEK LIFE SO I CANNOT COMMENT ON IT AT ALL
College Senior,1,"Rarely any parties, if any, they are in Worcester and end early."
College Freshman,1,"Campus housing is all in small, old, run down houses and dorms. They are poorly looked after and are very ugly and old."
College Sophomore,1,They promise money then never give it to you. 
College Senior,1,multiple times I have had to contact campus police and they have been un-reachable. Once was an emergency!
College Junior,1,"It's full of rich white kids. There is little in the way of diversity, and there is unintended segregation in the programs. Nursing and Animal care is full of women; Game Design, Business, and Sports Management is full of men. There are a number of Asians but not much beyond whites."
College Freshman,1,well last week some kids got arrested outside of a party because they had weed or something. house parties always get broken up and they were always at the same place. the football house. but they got evicted so now there is no where to party. few clubs in the city but they are whack.
College Freshman,1,Residence Staffholes – The residence life staff are all A-holes. Their investigation of write ups is that you are guilty until you talk your way to innocence or blame your roommates. They forget that you are paying them and to take care of you. I hate it and I am not even enrolled in another school yet but I for damn sure not coming here next semester.
College Freshman,1,They are mediocre and this school sucks. Haet Becker I'm transferring
College Freshman,1,"Football Sucks – Best team on campus is definitely the Mens basketball. They made it to the national playoffs or something like that. However football the other big sport on campus SUCKS. They recruit people to go here to be let down. A lot of the football players are talented and come here mainly becasue their grades weren't good enough to get into their top choice even though they go t football scholarships. The coaches give them hope that their class will bring change to our awful loosing streak. At my orientation the freshman football players were so hyped up about changing things at Becker but as soon as the season started they met their fate. A team destined to loose. Again it's not like the athletes aren't talented its just that for some reason they do not have good chemistry on the field and loose, a lot. Most football players talk of transferring or wish they could. If you want to be on a fun team I wouldn't come to Becker people also have no faith in the team ."
College Sophomore,1,"I am going to transfer from this school, and I have to take an extra year due to the classes I was told to take. I was about to quit the school after being there for three months due to the stress I was under form the school itself and the time they take to take care of a critical condition. I was not happy with the school. I had a lot of housing problems as well as class problems. "

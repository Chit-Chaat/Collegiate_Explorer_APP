Junior,5,"To me, Alfred University is a wonderful school. I am an art and design student who focuses a lot on ceramics, so with all the resources around that that Alfred holds makes me excited to wake up early every morning to get started on my work. I have made a lot of new friends through my classes. Also an additional bonus I never thought I would appreciate is the hills the campus is on the classes are at almost the lowest points and my dorm room is at a higher point so I have never been in better shape than at Alfred! The professors are understanding and are will to work with students as well, you really get the feeling someone has your back at Alfred University! Go Saxons!"
Alum,5,Pretty straightforward and an easy way to rack up credits during winter/summertime. I also ended up taking a lot of community college credit hours that were really easy to transfer over back to Alfred. I highly recommend making your semesters lighter by taking online classes during winter/summer.
Sophomore,5,"Personally loved it. I walked onto an athletic team and found a wonderful, supportive community that helped make the college adjustment period a lot easier. The food is also not as bad as everyone says it is, just a little repetitive sometimes. The winter weather can be brutal though."
Niche User,5,"You won't find a closer knit community than Alfred University. All the people are friendly, most of the professors are amazing and truly care about your education. I transferred to a larger school (UB) after 2 years, mainly due to the isolation and having to drive half an hour to get anything from the stores, but I honestly regret it. It's a great school, close-nit community, with breathtaking scenery."
Senior,5,"I love Alfred. The flexibility of your education allows you to easily double major, or add minors between the schools. The campus is tucked away, allowing for beautiful studying views and the ability to take in nature. Class sizes are small and the teachers know you by name. Almost every professor is willing to take time outside of class to really help you understand the material. They also provide the ability for real world experiences during your education, putting you above the competition upon graduation. I'm lucky I went to Alfred University."
Sophomore,5,"Alfred is a place where I felt at home and was able to expand my vision with the support of the professors and community members. Every faculty here welcomes you regardless of who you are and where you're from. As a matter of fact, where you're from is very much cherished at Alfred University, and that's what stood up to me most. To me, I wouldn't suggest any changes but just encouragement to the professors, faculty, and staff at Alfred University, to keep doing what they're doing. Also lots of thanks to them for their matchless kindness and care."
Works Here,5,Great place to both attend as a student and work as a graduate!  There is definitely something special about this place.  Job placement rate is 98%!
Senior,5,Everyone is very friendly and I made a bunch of friends! I feel like this is a second home to me. I live in an apartment on campus and I make my own food. Alfred made me learn to live independently.
Niche User,5,Alfred from what I've seen is a very good college and I'm ready to spend my next four years at this college.
Graduate Student,5,"Alfred was an exceptionally friendly college campus. The overall atmosphere was rather warm, even in the cold months with the absurd levels of snow. Activities were ever abundant, and when it was time to work, there were numerous study groups and 24 hour resources available to students, regardless of major. The majority of my professors were not only exceptionally helpful, but also available and flexible when it came to making time for students. Obviously, no place is perfect, and there were some minor butting of heads between the different schools of study within Alfred, which at times would carry into the students perceptions, but overall everyone managed to get along fairly well, regardless of major, race, gender, orientation and the such. It should be noted that the school has an excellent exchange program for those coming from overseas."
Freshman,5,The community environment and the amount of attention that the professors are able to give to each student.
Sophomore,5,I love Alfred it was always my top pick in colleges. I love the close knit atmosphere of the college and town. It allows you to get to know your professors and fellow students more. If you like party schools this college isn't really for you. It's quiet and friendly. I actually met my two best friends here.
Sophomore,5,"My first year was a blast. Just the atmosphere of the place is phenomenal and the people are great. There are always fun event at the school from I've cream on hot days to comedians visiting the school and putting on a show. And the dorms never take you too fast away for your friends. Everything is just a walk away. You really get to work your muscles, especially up there hills."
Junior,5,An experience like no other. Alfred University has given me a new and positive outlook on my life and future.
College Sophomore,5,The CDC does a phenomenal job providing prospects to students and graduates alike.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love where I live on campus, and have lived in several different dorms and living spaces. I have also lived off campus, and can say that there is a lot of places available, but they are more expensive than staying on campus."
College Junior,5,I couldn't be happier to have been accepted into The New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University. I transferred to Alfred from Suffolk Community College on Long Island and I watched myself change drastically. Alfred is a small town buzzing with college students. Growing up on Long Island and going to a large community college you find yourself to be not more than just a number. The longer your in Alfred you become much more than that. You become part of a larger community. Although it was a difficult transition the more time I've spent there the more it feels like home. Every professor I've had the pleasure to work with will put in as much effort as you do. If your dedicated and hard working the professors will do everything in their power to help and push you beyond your own expectation of your abilities. Alfred has a large community of successful alumni. I wouldn't trade my acceptance to Alfred for anything.
College Sophomore,5,"I've had such wonderful encouraging professors. In general, they've stimulated my academic interests and helped continue my hard work ethic."
College Sophomore,5,It is the best because we don't have it.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school and take much pride in being a Saxon. From everything from our athletics to our academics. I just wish I got more financial aid from them. I still have to pay over ten thousand after loans a year, which is very hard for my family to do. My mother has taken out a parent loan which I am afraid is going to be very hard for her to pay off."
College Sophomore,5,"Crime is very low on campus. I feel very safe on my campus, even when walking a lone in the dark. We have a texting alert system even if we do feel unsafe. This makes public safety come to us and assist whomever needs it. Our Wellness center is also very easy to make appointments with a doctor and is free."
College Sophomore,5,"When it comes to Alfred University, it's like a second home to me. When I first started off I wasn't sure with how well I was going to like living away from home and having to start all over. Just like most first year students, the first month was hard. I missed my family and friends so much. At first, I didn't take advantage of all the club opportunities, which I feel would have helped in the long run. I did, however, join the cheer club and instantly felt better about spending the next four years of my life in this community. I have met some of the best people as the months passed and became very involved in my schools community. I have had the opportunity to give back in the nearby towns with community service and have also been able to participate in my first 5k. Although Alfred is a one-stop-light town and seems very little from an outside standpoint, I have had more opportunities here than I have ever had before.

My work study is already helping me prepare for my future career. I work at the business office where I am in charge of scanning invoices, that are sent through the school, and review budget sheets making sure that everything is correct. This job, even though it may not seem like much, has opened my eyes to the financial world and how things work at a university. For me, it's very exciting to learn more about what job fields are offered to me after I graduate. 

When it comes to opportunities in the class room, I would say AU excels in the School of Business. As a freshman I have been given so many opportunities to build up my experience in my future field. I have already created my own business as well as given a presentation on a stock for the Investment Club. I have also been given the opportunity to to attend a conference in NYC as well as meet the head of this conference afterwords.The Career and Development Center will always be there for it's students as well, helping them find jobs, even years after they graduate."
College Junior,5,"Alfred is relatively quite. There are the occasional incidents but they are responded to quickly and strongly. The student body often responds in outrage when these crimes occur and the administration does everything they can to stop it from happening again. The only weekend where there seems to be a problem is Hot Dog Day weekend, and a lot of that is vandalism."
College Junior,5,The professors are here because they want to be here and that shows in their enthusiasm in the classroom. They are passionate and they make learning from them easy because they make it interesting. They are readily available to help students and even take on a lot of extra projects out of interest. They are intelligent and the top in their field. The courses themselves are always being updated to keep up with the changing times and to keep the classroom interesting.
College Sophomore,5,I'm am completely satisfied with the education I'm getting.
College Sophomore,5,I love Alfred University! It's definitely become home.
College Sophomore,5,"The degree value is amazing, tell anyone in the art world that you went to Alfred University and they will immediately be interested."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Alfred University! I've really found myself there, and I've found the best friends and future colleagues I believe I'll ever have. I've grown so much as an artist and as a person since starting at AU, and I'm always eager to get back to continue learning everything AU has to offer when I'm not there. The facilities are amazing, the professors truly care about their students, and the location is remote but beautiful. People often ask me if I mind being at a school that's so isolated, and I always tell them that I don't because I'm in Alfred to learn and become a better artist, the fewer distractions the better."
College Freshman,5,"Alfred is a great sxhool to go to in general, but especially so for art. The foundations program that all freshman in the School of Art and Design take is rigorous; challenging the students by forcing them to work in mediums and with ideas that are far beyond the reaches of their comfort zone. The professors are always caring of performance, especially if yhey recognize that the student cares deeply about learning new skills even if they are incredibly uncomfortable doing so. This extends outside the art program as well; I've yet to meet a teacher that was not enthralled by the classes they teach or the students they had."
College Freshman,5,I have enjoyed ans excelled in most classes. It is not easy but I am learning.
College Freshman,5,"I would recommend Barresi to all freshman. Don't live in oppenheim, Teft, or Rimer if you can help it. Cannon and the brick are very nice, and so are the suites if you have good suite mates."
College Freshman,5,"I'm not personally involved in sports, I don't really know."
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about the school. If you choose to get involved, opportunities are endless. The honors program is great. And where else can you take a midnight class in astronomy at an observatory? Or one where you work in a sugar bush making maple syrup?"
College Senior,5,"The professors are amazing. They are enthusiastic and incredible. I have learned more from them than just the material, they have passion for both the students and their work and it shows in everything they do. They go above and beyond for us every day and I love them for it! The campus is beautiful and I love how small and intimate it is."
College Senior,5,"They are great and very helpful, even when you are late with forms...which I always am!"
College Junior,5,"I love Alfred, but with that said people often say Alfred is what you make out of it. I co-founded the quidditch, joined the student senate, and the honors program. I have also traveled with the environmental studies department to the Bahamas to spend a week at a research center. There is a great sense of community at Alfred, you will get lots of hellos as you walk to class. With that said if all you do is stay in your dorm room then you won't enjoy Alfred."
College Sophomore,5,"Personally I think it's just enough. There is Japanese, Chinese, a diner, Italian, a coffee shop, and a more formal restaurant. The Japanese restaurant has a meal plan you can purchase yourself. Prices are nice and low and very convenient because there is only one street running through school, and it's right there. Nana's is the definitely the place to go!"
College Sophomore,5,"I truly love Alfred University. I'm a geology major with a environmental science and music minors. From professors, classes, and peers I feel that I can explore every aspect of every interest I could ever have. I wouldn't trade my time here for anything. Everyone is really helpful, kind, and open to ideas. If you want to get creative you can."
College Freshman,5,"From the pizza places to the sushi bars, it's great for diversity."
College Sophomore,5,The financial aid at Alfred is awesome. It provides a lot of financial aid to students.
College Senior,5,"Everything is very diverse, accept for the political views. I would definitely say that most of the students are liberal. Which is funny, because the campus is located in a very conservative part of New York."
College Senior,5,"So long as you're not obnoxious about it and force them to take action, the authorities are really chill. You just have to be discrete and respectful. After a while, you learn all the ins and outs: when you can park in certain restricted places without getting in trouble, what time of day you can have alcohol in the buildings without anyone noticing, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"Do your part, and they will do theirs."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Never participated in study options, but the best areas of study were the libraries, half because they were quiet (sound proofed walls sometimes) and half because sometimes you could find your professors there as well, and would be more than happy to help. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"I ended up switching majors part way through, but both schools were amazing in teachers and teaching methods. the teachers always had a sense of humor and barely ever really hated on students, and were generally too down to earth (cared about teaching not grades) to even care about favorites. As long as you did your homework, did it well and maybe made it a bit thought provoking, you were going places and could always rely on the teachers, as well as some of the local businesses who kept in touch with the school. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"it was a really amazing place with equally amazing professors and students. It had is calm quietness, but equally was fun and exciting. Generally the professors knew how to make a lesson fun to boot. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"Ironically, the least accepted group was the bigot grade over zealous religious types. If you were  homophobic or hatefully racist, you were gonna have a bad time, the main ""rulling"" clubs were LGBT and the international club. Everyone was pretty much ok with everyone, they even had a meeting hall that would do religious meetings, like mass and the such, on every floor. So you would have Judaic Christians and Muslims leaving the same building about the same time, just smiling and laughing away about what their respective religious leader had taught them that day. "
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are a few fast food places at the State college but in town there are a couple places that are very inexpensive and diverse. The best pizza in town can be found in the local bar Alex's. Nana's Cafe has amazing Japanese cuisine that is all vegetarian unless you want chicken instead of tofu. The Chinese place, Panda, caters to drunk people mostly, it's cheap and the perfect portion for someone who has a hangover or is in fact drunk. Not the best but pretty good. And Terra Cotta has good coffee and pastries, as well as some sandwiches. The Jet is basic diner food. There are others but these are the local staples."
College Senior,5,I love it. The CEMS professors are extremely knowledgeable.
College Senior,5,"Couldn't ask for better professors. Always willing to help. A few stragglers, but what school doesn't have them?"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Really, they come in all sizes, all shapes, all different! There are athletic kids (though ALL extremely nice), art kids (a little odd, but still kind), and geeks."
College Freshman,5,"Teachers here are great. The can only receive Tenure if they get consistent good student reviews. Every student for each class has to fill out a survey about their teacher and they can't receive tenure unless they get good reviews. These teachers are all really smart, they love what they teach, and they are great at teaching. There are some classes where I don't have to study as much as other classes because I know the material the first time it's taught, or we review a lot in class."
College Sophomore,5,"The safety is amazing. You never have to worry, even if you're alone at night. We're 10 minutes from the nearest town, and about 40 minutes from a big town. It's nice because we have isolation and nature without having to be bogged down by city life. The local attitude towards students is fantastic! Everyone smiles at you and is incredibly nice whether they know you or not."
College Student,5,As a student in the Engineering department there are a ton of internship opportunities and almost all are paid.
College Sophomore,5,"Business School Isnt Boring – I am a marketing major, the school of business is always put off as an ""easy"" or ""boring"" sector but it is instead neither. With the combination of computer, old school chalk board lectures and group projects (and books of course) everything that you need to learn to pass tests and be successful is learned through different techniques so every piece of information from all of your classes sticks in your head. My goal is to work in advertising; becoming an innovator of worldwide well know adds for companies like Pepsi or Target. I believe you need to dream big to achieve big, along with working hard.There is always a concern for a future job, but being positive and relentlessly working hard to stand out pays off. I will not blend in with rest of the students, I strive to stand out and i know i can."
College Senior,5,Pretty Great! I have always had a really good relationship with financial aid. I have gotten very good packages every year and they are always willing to help when I am in a pinch with needing more aid!
College Senior,5,"Alfred is a small rural town in WNY, on the surface it may look boring, or like there are not enough things to do in town, DON'T BE FOOLED!! Alfred is a place about community and making friends with new people and having fun doing whatever!"
College Senior,5,"At Alfred University we've got a lot of diversity. Not only are our American students diverse, we've got a lot of international students as well. People from all over the country come to this school, so we've got a lot of differences in economic backgrounds, we've got a lot of diversity in ethnicity and race, we've got people who don't have the same religious beliefs, we've got gays, lesbians, and transgender students, and we're still one big family. We're huge on acceptance. We've got a club/organization called Drawn to Diversity where they work with all different types of students to come up with solutions that involve acceptance."
College Junior,5,"AU is a great community where you know most of your peers, your professors know you by name, and everyone is always looking out for each other."
College Sophomore,5,"Theatre Major – Getting involved as a theatre major at Alfred University is one of the easiest things you can do. Alfred's theatre program is very accepting of new students, and encourage for anyone who is interested in getting involved. The professors are really accessible, and are extremely focused on you and what you are concentrated in."
Junior,4,"Great community, friendly people, invested professors, safe and Cozy Campus. Love it there. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else"
Junior,4,Alfred University is an enjoyable and memorable college experience. I liked how the faculty and staff are open to help students succeed in life. The quality of food and the different food options is what I would like to see a change in the future.
Sophomore,4,"I took the online class, it was very good. The professors try their best to make it as painless as possible."
Sophomore,4,"I truly do enjoy my experience at Alfred University. everyone is very nice here, the dorms are great and the professors are able to be more than just detached professors."
Sophomore,4,I would overall say that I enjoy going to Alfred University and that it is a good school. There are a lot of great professors and interesting class options. I love the individualized small school feel. If I could give half stars the school would receive 3.5 as the administration is pretty terrible to work with and the food is also pretty bad. Another big issue is there is a major shortage on parking. All in all though as far as small schools go it is pretty nice.
Junior,4,Alfred University fosters a very welcoming and community based environment. The professors are welcoming and have so much amazing life experience to share with students. The downside is that it is a small town and you will need a car or know someone with a car if you want to escape for an hour or two. Residence life is not helpful and they drag their feet on every decision they make and every issue you may have.
Freshman,4,"I like how invested my professors are in my education, and I think it's really easy to fit in and feel comfortable at Alfred. I think there can be a lot of miscommunication from the university towards the student, and sometimes understanding what is needed of students can be very confusing."
Freshman,4,I love the environment of Alfred and the majors and activities it offers. its a beautiful location and area and allows me to peruse many of my interests.
Sophomore,4,"Alfred University is a small school in a small neighborhood, on top of a big hill. Even though the student body is less around 2,000 students, our campus can make a significant impact. Being known for its excellent art program and fantastic scenery, Alfred has an eye for beauty.  However, with beauty comes the frosty winter. The shock of the freezing weather comes as an alarm as you didn't realize those first two months was a just a teaser for the real power of winter. Even though the weather could be the party pooper in any function, the facility that works at Alfred University are genuinely fantastic. They strive to make such a small town as Alfred to be known; while allowing students to be as free-spirited, open, and creative. This open atmosphere is an ultimate judgment-free zone, as advisors and student assistance push to open the door many students never knew could've been open."
Sophomore,4,"Alfred University is a great school. The professors do care about how you are doing and want to see you succeed in not only your academic life, but also your personal life. The campus is beautiful and everyone is very friendly and helpful. The biggest downfall would be the food on campus, which is not good at all. Also Alfred is in the middle of no where so if you like going out and doing things it can be hard."
Senior,4,The opportunities are numerous for anyone who is willing to better themselves as a future professional
Graduate Student,4,There is a quick response time regarding email inquiries. The staff members are friendly/ cordial and make themselves available.
Sophomore,4,Alfred University is a good educational school. The tuition is high but they try their best to accommodate to your academic needs. The campus is very nice and small so gives good opportunities for social interactions. There is not much to do around so its good for focusing on school work.
Junior,4,I like Alfred University. Most of the professors are really great and help you whenever you need it. The campus scene is very nice and peaceful.
Freshman,4,"Alfred University is a beautiful, small, safe and welcoming campus where students are treated as individuals, professors know their students, and there is plenty of support offered to help students succeed. It is a small university which makes for a less hectic atmosphere, more personal attention, and easier access to academic facilities and resources. Financial aid is generous. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in clubs and organizations. I'm really happy I chose Alfred Univ."
Sophomore,4,"Alfred University is surrounded by rolling country side hills and friendly smiles.  I love the atmosphere there.  It can be underwhelming at times, but I have found that being active and participating helps."
Freshman,4,"Alfred University is an amazing college. They have a very diverse set of majors and very successful athletic sports teams. The campus is small which is very nice for having all your classes in the same area (Academic Alley), getting to know people from all different majors, and having a small town around us makes it feel as if we are in our own little world. Although our main street may not be big, there are still some pretty delicious places to eat."
Freshman,4,I loved that the students for the most part at alfred university are kind and full of energy and so are the professors. I love the quiet environment and how safe I feel at the school. If I could change one thing about the school it would be the transportation for students who need to go to the airport and don't have their own car. There should be more buses and cab access to and from the school.
Freshman,4,"Over all Alfred University is a pretty good school. It's very secluded and there isn't much to do if u don't have a car, so joining clubs is a must. It's a fairly small campus so it isn't much of a hassle getting to classes other than the hills, if you live in openhym like I do. The food is ok at one of the dinning halls and the other is pretty good. But the food is very repetitive and isn't worth the amount of money we pay for our meal plans. The weather is beautiful in the fall but miserable in the winter. Openhym is a very nice dorm but is on the other side of campus, about half mile from the regular dinning Hall. It also has a weird wooden divider in the room which helps give roommates some privacy that the other dorms don't have."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are absolutely incredible. Many of them are most obviously have genius level intelligence.
College Sophomore,4,Alfred is a very very safe campus. You'll encounter your drunk and drugged out idiots from time to time but it is always dealt with quickly.
College Sophomore,4,"Alfred University is a great school, it is small and you get a lot of personalized attention from the professors."
Recent Alumnus,4,Our CDC works closely with graduated students to help them find jobs in their area of study and where they live.
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you don't feel safe at night, you can call public safety and they will transport you safely from on location to the other."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I can't speak much about the teams, as I am not an athlete, but I do know the teams are very close and education is still a high priority for couches."
Recent Alumnus,4,I love going to Alfred! The town and the two colleges within the town are amazing and very close knit.
College Junior,4,"I love Alfred University. During my visit I fell in love with the atmosphere the school provided. Originally I wanted to go to a large school but I am glad I didn't. I met so many great people not just at Alfred University but at our sister school across the street. With these two school together we contribute so much to the town of Alfred. It's nice to say this is a college town and not for the reason everyone thinks. It makes you feel so connected with everyone you meet because you have something amazing and unique in common. It's small enough where you can stay close to everyone but yet it is so diverse you are meeting great new people everywhere you go. Personally, I would not come back for Grad School because I'd like to spread my wings and be able to leave the school that allowed me to grow into a mature, wise woman. This was one stepping stone of my life and graduate school should be a new one."
College Sophomore,4,There were a few issues I heard about; someone was stabbed this year but I think that was the worst.
College Sophomore,4,"I love it; I love the people, the classes, and the professors. There's this weird thing going on in the village of Alfred- everyone is kind and thoughtful. The only negative things I can bring up about my experience are the hills, the food (haha), and the level of academics. I knew it wouldn't be as challenging as some other universities, but sometimes I don't feel like I'm being pushed enough in my academics. The art program is wonderful, but as I'm a double major I wish the academics were tougher."
College Sophomore,4,Getting a internship is very easy because the school stays on top of getting these opportunity for its students. There are so many work studies for the school year available that finding one in your degree is very easy and is great experience for your future.
College Sophomore,4,"As a cheerleader, of course I'm going to have a lot of school spirit. I love my school and am very involved in the sports on campus. My cheer team is not considered a sport so we aren't as held as high of standard as we all would like. But we do get to cheer for whatever teams we want. We cheer for the typical varsity sports (Men's Basketball and Football) as well as the not so usual like Women's basketball as well as club sports, like rugby. 

I think the amount of  fans we have at every game is awesome and every student is very involved with supporting all teams."
College Junior,4,"The only real problem here is that Students aren't always told about all the networking opportunities this campus has. Luckily, there are seminars students can (and sometimes have to) take which explain all the resources available to students. The CDC is amazing and helpful - students just need to be taught more about it so they will know to go there."
College Junior,4,"Alfred is unique in a lot of aspects. The campus generally has a friendly atmosphere and a lot of times students become close friends with their professors. Sometimes I feel like the school encourages us to compete heavily with the others in our majors instead of encouraging us to work together to attain our goal but that competition often helps create a strong learning atmosphere. There isn't a lot to do around in Alfred, however, and for some students that seems to be a problem. However, we have an excellent equestrian center and lots of hiking trails for those who enjoy outdoor activities (like myself.) Alfred also has a rich history and lots of different courses a student can take. The one main problem I have with this school, however, is that the food is terrible."
College Sophomore,4,I never feel unsafe walking on my campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I live in the suites with my friends, its nice to have a space to cook and a private bathroom. Its better than living in Openhym, the mostly freshman residence hall, but that's a right of passage."
College Freshman,4,There are no fraternituea nor sororities on campus. But I'm a fan of not having any
College Freshman,4,There isn't much crime or danger on campus. They are currently improving their system to make the campus even more safe.
College Freshman,4,"Academics here are great. Alfred University was rated as far up on the list as Princeton. Academics are taken very seriously here which is great. Professors help you out as much as they can, and you always have lots of support."
College Freshman,4,General class sizes are small which is great because it gives you a chance to really connect to your professors. Your professors are also always willing to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,"The faculty work extremely hard to help the students succeed. They push you to do your best, and help you out whenever you need it. There are also a lot of great extra curricular activities available on campus. These activities give students a chance to go out of their comfort zone and try new things, and also make great new friends that will last a lifetime."
College Junior,4,"Alfred University is one of the most student-friendly campuses.  Everyone is very nice and the classes are taught at the high level and there is an opportunity to meet with your professors every week, if not every day.  The atmosphere for homecoming is amazing and there seems to be something new to learn about this school everyday."
College Freshman,4,"Alfred University has been an amazing experiance for me so far. Attending a school that truly cares for my success is really important to me. They are constantly pushing me to work harder and continue to challenge myself not just accademally, but also socially."
College Sophomore,4,"I chose this school because it is suppose to be the best ceramics school in the country. While here, I have been worked to death in the art studios but I must admit that I have improved greatly. The food kind of sucks, I would suggest that any incoming students try to get off the meal plan as quickly as possible and start cooking their own food. I have also meet many great friends here and even a boyfriend, I cant imagine life without going to Alfred University."
College Sophomore,4,I have not lived off campus but everyone who does seems very pleased with it. It can be cheaper if you find the right house/apartment and you don't have to deal with RA/RD's.
College Sophomore,4,When you enter as a freshman you are given a scholarship based on your high school GPA. You keep it all four years as long as you keep your GPA above a minimum requirement.
College Freshman,4,"GJs is fun to dance at, off campus parties and the frat houses from Alfred state (the college across the street) are also fun."
College Freshman,4,The RAs and the RDs are really awesome. They are more of like a mentor then an authority figure.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of spots off campus that are great to live in. They have more parking and there really arent any rules when it comes to guests.
College Freshman,4,There are a few really great spots that are cheap and friendly. Its right next to campus and they offer some discounts.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of parties around town at the bars and graduate houses. They seem to be really great.
College Freshman,4,"The strictness isnt that bad. They enforce basic rules that shouldnt be broken, especially if its against the law. If its a small rule that was broken you wont really get in any trouble as long as nobody was hurt."
College Freshman,4,My financial aid process went very smoothly and I had no problems at all. just be sure to get it in early. Dont wait until a week before the deadline.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are fine. Some are small and others are divided with this strange half wall but other than that it's very functional. They can be rather expensive though especially for a single. The housing process is simple and most of the residence halls are right on academic alley so classes are right outside your door.
College Sophomore,4,I can usually find something I am in the mood for whenever I want to.
College Senior,4,"I live off-campus and have for two years and I love it. It is so much cheaper than on-campus! Apartments above the bar/ pizza place are super nice. Houses are ok, but you have to look early to get a nice one"
College Senior,4,"There's quite a few places you can walk to and get food including a coffeehouse, pizza place, sub place, chinese place, and small restaurant. Or you can take a drive and get pizza hut, applebees, McDonalds, BK, italian restaurant, club 57 restaurant ,etc"
College Senior,4,"Easy to deal with. Don't cheat/plagerize, dont get caught drinking or doing drugs....thats about it"
College Senior,4,"Best time I ever had was freshman year in the dorm rooms (Shhh ;) !!) but the house parties are always crazy and packed, and lots of fun if you don't mind a short walk. Alex's bar is great for mug nights and GJ's for fishbowls, otherwise GJ's is crazy crowded. You always end up seeing all of your friends when you go out because most parties are confined to a certain few houses."
College Senior,4,"Dorm buildings are old, but the atmosphere is always great. I met some of my closest friends freshman year in my dorm. RAs and RDs are generally very nice, but keep up with the very strict rules regarding quiet hours, no alcohol, no drugs, etc."
College Senior,4,"It is a small town, so there aren't any crazy ragers, but there is definitely a party culture"
Junior,2,"I didn’t sign up to take any classes online, but because of the coronavirus outbreak, we had to move everything online. I understand it all happened very fast, and no one was really ready for it, but they did not handle it well. I’m an art student so I lost out on all my hands on experience and in the few classes that weren’t art related, such as intro to religion, I got loaded with so many pages of textbooks to read. I personally don’t learn very well this way and I can confidently say that my grade was negatively impacted by losing out on the love lectures. I just wish we had more video classes."
Sophomore,2,"A few professors just gave up. There was only one class where we met over Zoom, most other professors just assigned work without actually teaching. I'm glad I was taking mostly Gen Eds at the time, because although doing well in the classes was fairly easy for me, I didn't really learn all that much."
Sophomore,2,"All of teachers either forgot about teaching or gave you way too much work to do during a pandemic. Most art classes became a joke, and any liberal arts class became a waste of time and money. Some teachers were really understanding but most didn't care. On the bright side, the university never communicates, so most students have absolutely no idea whats going on."
Sophomore,2,"The reason I applied and am still continuing at Alfred University is due to its outstanding and versatile Art Studio possibilities. They have many components that others schools do not have such as the National Casting Center for metal work, and their Glass Blowing studio. However their freshmen Foundations Program in art was in my opinion, very unfortunately, a large waste of my time and money. I am a College senior who transferred to Alfred after obtaining a previous degree in a different area of study. This is was led me to be incorrectly placed into a program for freshmen straight out of high school who were not on my level of work ethic, care, and ambition. This was very disappointed to have to endure for months. However I've gotten through this awful course and will be soon taking my real studios. I am very hopeful of Alfred from this point onward."
Freshman,2,"Alfred U is a very very mediocre school. The teachers have biases and there is nothing to do since some of the clubs are too small to be enjoyable. For example club soccer got cancelled because there weren't enough people. Party scene is trash, ITS blows, and the dorms are gross."
College Junior,2,"Living on campus could definitely be a lot better. Many of the dorms and suites are out dated, and the food is awful many students have gotten sick/ food poising from AVI and they blame the large percent of students sick/ hospital bound on a ""stomach bug"" although its only found in students eating from the ade dining hall"
College Freshman,2,Not many of my freinds really care about the sports; except those on sports teams or the ones who want to be.
College Sophomore,2,"Basically just a more specified high school, not really a step up in quality or difficulty"
College Sophomore,2,It's normally fairly crowded and sloppy at the town houses. The parties also tend to get busted quickly.
College Sophomore,2,It is worth buying your own food and cooking in the dorms. The food at Midknight is one of the better options but it is only open at night
College Freshman,2,The food is really bad at Alfred university. I know they are trying to improve it and the staff is doing a good job but it is still pretty terrible. My aunt went to college years ago and when she came to visit me she was shocked that the food was worse now in modern time then when she went to SUNY New Paltz so many years ago.
College Sophomore,2,The food is bland and often repetitious. For what we are paying for our meal plans the food should be held to a much higher standard.  I do not pay that much to eat salad that is practically brown and meat that is completely under cooked and a health risk.  They try too hard to make these disgusting gourmet dishes.
College Sophomore,2,"Our school administration may not be strict, but they are very unorganized"
College Sophomore,2,"Usually there isn't much going on at all, but you can always count on a good fishbowl night at GJ's!"
College Sophomore,2,"There is a problem with a lack of healthy food options offered. They need to have a better mix of healthy food, and slightly less healthy food for those who prefer that kind of food"
College Senior,2,"I have always hated the food here and when I was on the meal plan I generally ate salads or pizza all the time. The food isn't great tasting and often is not cooked how it should be. I love AU, but I got off the meal plan ASAP. They need to change companies!"
College Sophomore,2,"They totally changed the dinning plan, and not it's extremely confusing and difficult to eat where you want to eat. I'm not even going to try to explain since I am now off the meal plan, but it is a hassle."
College Freshman,2,WiFi sucks in dorms and pretty much everywhere on campus unless you sit right next to a server or buy your own router
College Senior,2,"The saying goes ""The Alfred Sun only comes out once a week"". It refers to the town newspaper, ""The Alfred Sun"", that only comes out on Sundays, but the saying is true in relation to the weather too. Winters are very cold. It's always snowing, but never accumulating. In the spring, it rains more than you ever though possible. The autumn is gorgeous and perfect though!"
College Sophomore,2,"Last year I was unable to get a job because I had no car and there is no public transportation of any sort offered from school to the bigger town of Hornell. Just to save money on school stuff and to go shopping for food and supplies without going broke in town required paying another classmate gas money and having them pile a bunch of us in the car so we could all shop for the week.The lack of an occasional ""citibus"" into Hornell or anywhere gave me this sense of being trapped and hopeless. Not being dramatic."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the college year is very cold and usually snowy. It is beautiful but it does limit my outside experiences because I am not a winter sport kind of person.
College Freshman,2,foundation program is unlike any other. not necessarily in a good way
College Freshman,2,Oh goodness gracious the Wi-Fi is always freaking out or just doesn't work.
College Freshman,2,"I have to walk everywhere because I don't own a car and the roads aren't good enough to longboard or bike ride. I'm sure it's good for me, but it can get annoying"
College Freshman,2,"the shuttles are inconvenient, and walmart and wegmans are about 20 mins away"
College Freshman,2,hard to find a parking spot. i never move my car because ill never get a spot if i do
College Freshman,2,not very diverse. the vast majority of kids come from upstate new york and from that area
College Freshman,2,"a lot of parties every weekend, but they are all the same. boring and full of guys."
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning services are not as good as they should be. Most of the time lines are crowded and it takes awhile to get food, which there will be awful selection of food. Some days the food is excellent but most of the tiem it isnt."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only a few girls that are very attractive, most are average. They all like to party and have a good time though so it still is fun. There are a lot of athletic girls."
College Sophomore,2,"At my university there is no Greek life, I have heard it is because of past issues that has happened with deaths. I am not fully sure why we do not have greek life"
College Sophomore,2,During the end of fall semester and most of the spring semester it is freezing tempetures and snows almost everyday. When the weather is like this there is not much to do on campus and it is hard to go out and do any thing around the area. When the weather does warm up it is very pleasent on campus.
College Senior,2,"Alfred is in the middle of nowhere, with one little main street down the center and Alfred State College across the street.  There are activities that the schools put on; they bring in bands, comedians, hypnotists.  There are also shows put on by the students, like acapella groups, improv, theatre, dance.  And there is usually a movie playing on friday nights in the student center."
College Senior,2,"Early fall and late spring can be really nice, but once winter hits, you better bundle up.  It can be really cold and really snowy; it has snowed on graduation in may before..."
College Senior,2,"If you stay on campus, you dont really need a car, everything is within walking distance.  However, if you want to go grocery shopping, or to walmart, or bowling, or to see a movie, you need a car or a friend with a car."
College Senior,2,"The dorms are all really old, windows falling out and thin walls.  They do have suites, apartments, doubles and single rooms, which is nice.  Most dorms are close to classes, unless you live in Anne's or Joel's House, or the apartments.  And last I knew, the laundry was free!"
College Junior,2,"Public safety and the police are super helpful, but I tripped and got stitches because of their unsafe conditions and such. Also we get reports all the time about students being attacked by alfred state students."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people drink, and a lot of people smoke cigarettes and weed. However, if you don't want to and that's not your scene there's still plenty to do, and a good portion of the student body that doesn't. I also have never been peer pressured into anything here."
College Student,2,"When compared to other colleges I've eaten at Alfred isn't the best by any means, however the food is very edible and they offer a decent variety given the relatively small size of the school. The small cafes they have on campus are pretty good on the other hand and there are a few nice places to eat within walking distance."
College Senior,2,"Pretty Lousy – Not gonna lie, most of the on-campus housing is mediocre. The showers have little privacy, the halls are bleak, and some of the housing was meant to be temporary but has lasted several years past its sell-by. The best on-campus housing option is The Brick - a beautiful old building which still sports grotesque showers, but has all wood floors, wide halls and large, high-ceilinged rooms.
The worst part about on-campus housing is that unless you get a waiver, you have to stay on-campus for at least 3 years."
Sophomore,1,"During this COVID-19 crisis, Alfred University and moreover, President Zupan have been absolutely terrible at communicating properly and professionally with students. President Zupan decided it would be more valuable of his time to make tiktoks, I am not kidding, instead of helping his students, or even letting more than the Art school what is going on. 

Admissions and everyone they pay, screams about how diverse the campus population is when in reality, it is not diverse at all. The campus is majority white, and a sprinkle of culture here and there. Most of the teachers are a bit racist, and fail to help students of color with their needs. This is true for all of the schools, I am a liberal arts student and have friends in each school, and none of them feel properly supported as a POC. Diversity is an absolute fat lie, it doesn't exist here."
Sophomore,1,"This place is awful. The campus is a tiny, cramped area that is only bearable to look at or live in during the first month of the school year (you are required to live in their horrendous overpriced dorms for 3 years by the way) and there is virtually nothing to do in town or on campus unless you are on a sports team or part of one of the painfully annoying and cliquey student union  groups. The party scene is practically non-existent, there is not enough parking, and to top it all off, the food is so bad that people regularly get food poisoning. Also, the year I left, there were students dressing up in makeshift KKK costumes and running around. In short, this place is a hell hole filled with unpleasant people, horrible weather, high cost of living, and mediocre staff and curriculum. You might as well burn your tuition in cash rather than spend it at this dump."
College Junior,1,"We want Greek Life. They forbid Greek Life at Alfred University and I think that is a huge mistake. There will always be parties and there will always be those people who drink too much. But pointing fingers at a student organization that brings the community together, a life time full of friendships, and key skills and assets that companies look for in a employer is just damaging their own reputation. They tried controlling college drinking by abandoning the Greek Life, yet that still hasn't work. It just limits the amount of people who want to attend the school and only a specific group of people that look down on the organization. People that do not support a strong active student organization that develops a honoring reputation with the town and the school. I do believe there could have been better precautions are controlling the drinking situations instead of forbidding Greek Life."
College Sophomore,1,"It was abolished in the 90s because too many kids were harmed in hazing events put on by fraternities. The college across the street, Alfred State College, has them though, so its still a part of Alfred, just not of Alfred University."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,More a drug scene than a party scene
College Sophomore,1,It's a normal thing to do cocaine
College Senior,1,"used to be sort of acceptable, but through my four years here it's just gotten worse and worse and worse."
College Freshman,1,"grrr. all the food on campus really does suck. lack of variety, quality, and value."
College Freshman,1,it's always so cold. it stays cold for MONTHS. summer doesn't exist
College Freshman,1,SO SMALL. NOTHING TO DO. SO ALONE. it can get real depressing
College Freshman,1,there are very few pickings
College Freshman,1,"the food is absolutely horrible. there are 2 dining halls on campus, and both serve absolutely horrible food."
College Freshman,1,"in the middle of no where, people are different, theres nothing to do, the weather is horrible."
College Freshman,1,"it's very boring, nothing to do and theres almost nothing in driving distance"
College Freshman,1,"it's horrible. you never see the sun, its freezing cold and its always raining or snowing"
College Freshman,1,"every restaurant i've eaten at off campus, is absolutely horrible. i have not found a decent place to eat off campus. the best place is the Chinese food. and thats pretty bad when the best place is a Chinese restaurant"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The University had an indecent where a Greek group got someone killed via alcohol poisoning in the back of their trunk, so greeks are outlawed save for one which is the school owned one, in a fairly run down house. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's $90 (last I heard) for a parking permit. Which if you are struggling to make ends meet is a bit pricy. But for those who have a permit you have to compete for parking. Most people get a spot and never move, if you commute good luck, there is one street for commuters to park without getting a ticket and you can only park there for a maximum amount of 3 hours. Campus Security are real jerks in regards to handing out tickets (which are $30 a ticket)... I once parked in a loading zone, for 10 minutes at 1:50 AM and got a ticket in that short time. They also ticket people in the Senior dorm that is near the top of the hill and has no sign saying you must have a permit to park there. If it snows and you can't see the lines, so everyone is parked strange, CONGRATULATIONS you've won a ticket. Also they aren't suppose to ticket on weekends, but they do.... Your best bet is the free parking which is up at the top of a hill where deer will stalk you."
College Freshman,1,"Awful food, but two dining halls for less than 2,000 students so at least the awful food is within a convenient distance."
College Freshman,1,"There is literally no local atmosphere and if you're under 21 and can't get into the bar, you're sunk. The townies are mostly friendly (although some are sort of racist) and having Alfred State across the street adds to the parties on the weekends. Otherwise, there is literally nothing to do in Alfred. The university is pretty good about offering campus events to make up for this though."
College Freshman,1,"It's very small here. I personally don't like, but if you like small towns it couldn't be more perfect. There's one of everything. Coffee house, restaurant, subway, gas station, pharmacy, bar, club, post office, uni-mart, unique gift shops and three pizza places."
Recent Alumnus,1,The dining hall food is awful. None of the food tastes any good and it seems like it gets worse every year. There is rarely any variety.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Mostly White, Non-Religious – mostly white, difficult for a moderately religious student"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Very few things to do in town, a drive to nearest city, means bored rowdy college students"
College Freshman,1,Totally Useless – All they do is give you aspirin and never schedule appointments at nearby clinics!
College Freshman,1,Far Far Away – The only spots even remotely convenient are reserved for faculty and RA's
College Freshman,1,One Club and Lame Parties – The only clubs and bar in town are filled with drunk bums
College Senior,1,Local Bus – There is a bus that runs to the closest town every now and then. There is also a bus that runs to NYC like once a day. No one really uses it and its costly
College Freshman,1,"Everybody here just wants to get drunk to the point of death, smoke like crazy and the parties are lame, repetitive and boring."
College Freshman,1,"The Food Is Disgusting – The food is just bad, no variety, unhealthy, old, my body just cannot function on the dining hall food, there are one or two decent restaurants around, but that's it."
College Freshman,1,"Boring and Sad – There is nothing here, it is so isolated, boring, empty and just depressing. This place sucks"
College Freshman,1,"So, I come here, expecting an academic facility and academic enrichment... Well, it didn't turn out that way.  If you like to be a swinger (relationship wise), have nothing to do other than sit on your computer and type reviews like myself, and like to hear your food singing to you in your stomach after you eat at the caff, then this is the number one place for you.  I will mention though that some of the professors are exceptional.  Granted, some people might like this institution and this could just be my preference, but when I pay as much as I pay here to attend I would hope that there would be more money going into upgrading academic facilities rather than supplying people with the latest lube and condoms.  It's whatever though... And alfred... If your listening, please do something to make LIFE INTERESTING!!!  I find myself walking aimlessly down the only street hoping that there would be something college like to do.
 "
College Freshman,1,"you'll want to get outta here – Unless you're a local, I don't see a reason to come here (unless you're an engineer or art student). It's way to isolated, the weather sucks, the people get old and boring and seem to forget they're in ""college"". If you like small environment, football, drinking and hooking up, this is the place for you. It has a good program oriented towards engineering, but even that can't make me stay here for another year. I hate it here, but it might be different for you, I think going to a state school is the better option. It is what it is."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Used to be a well balanced, fun school. Now its lame. Yes, if  you look, I went to Alfred way back in the late 80's and early 90's. Some things have not changed:
- The weather still SUCKS 90% of the year
- The hilly terrain will keep you in shape, if it doesn't kill you first
- Its still in the middle of NOwhere, with nothing much nearby except Hornell (woo hoo) a half hour drive away.
- Townies still regularly get cranky at the students
- Alex's bar is still there :-) (Wait, thats a good thing)

But many other things that used to make the above tolerable (and even make them worth joking about) have changed:

- AU has become a two-major school, with little diversity outside Engineering (always has been big) and Art. 
- With the decline and elimination of the Greek system at AU there is literally NO real social life anymore. The greeks added diversity and dare I say FUN to an otherwise dreary school. (and to be clear, I was not a greek myself, but knew many students who were. It was far more fun and INclusive back then... believe it or not.)
- AU has lost it's way in terms of allowing students to grow, learn, and expand their social and personal horizons. Too much handholding from the student life office now a days. It's OK to make some bad choices while in college, not everything has to be preplanned and prepared for. Geez, let kids be kids for 4 years. They generally will learn to grow up.

In summary, if you like being isolated, are a big artie/hippie or engineer, and really like being out in the middle of nowhere, go for it. My kids (all three) won't be attending my alma matter. It's too bad really, I had a GOOD time, but I can see for myself (and have heard from recent students) why its just not the same anymore."
College Senior,1,"The weather at Alfred is atrocious. It rains nonstop. There always seems to be a cloud over the town...when you leave, it's seemingly always sunny in neighboring towns, but not here. The valley makes for atrocious, cold winters and rainy autumn and springtimes."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Strict Enough – Lately it seems that drinking has gotten out of hand, especially with the freshmen. I can't believe the number of students who are passed out and yet are still aloud to go to classes on Monday. Maybe the fines should be higher for being caught with alcohol while under age. I'm not so much against drinking but these kids need to learn responsibility."
College Freshman,1,Coming from Los Angeles I'm accustomed to dining at amazing restaurants. I love food international  cuisines are my favorite. Alfred extremely lacks places to eat. You really have to hunt down if you want anything fancy and even then you have to drive miles away.
College Senior,1,"I think...maybe, just maybe...there are more Asians from overseas here than black people."
College Senior,1,"You're gonna be cold, man. Some freshmen come to this school excited for snow and can't wait until the first snowfall. They will leave this place with a very different opinion.

Admissions will tell you not to worry about the snow because there are heated sidewalks. This is mostly a lie. Only certain sidewalks are heated, and they're probably not where you live.

If you aren't somewhat fond of winter, you probably shouldn't come here. It's not a happy place."

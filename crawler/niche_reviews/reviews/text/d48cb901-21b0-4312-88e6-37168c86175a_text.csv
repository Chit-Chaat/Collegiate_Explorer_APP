Freshman,5,"They have done a great job doing a hybrid mode, and really adapting to all the changes with an open mind."
Freshman,5,"Incredible campus, small class environments with great professors make it incredibly easy to feel welcome and to have intense personal learning."
Alum,5,"Though this was back in 2015, I did take an online course for my major. I really enjoyed the experience!"
Sophomore,5,Davidson is an amazing place with amazing people. There is always something to do and new people to meet. Professors really care and there is a culture of trust and kindness at Davidson
Freshman,5,"The professors are involved and care about our lives. The campus is beautiful and can a really therapeutic place. No one gets left behind in crucifies because everyone looks out for each other. Like all places there are cliques, but at Davidson friend groups seem more fluid and accepting to new people and ideas"
Freshman,5,"The most amazing college in the world!  Everything about Davidson is special.  The community, the faculty, the students and the administration are all deeply connected to the college.  It's as inclusive of a school as I have ever seen.   Davidson College is second to none."
Freshman,5,I really like the vibe here! i felt very welcomed by the upper class and i love the team spirit. the honor code is what i value most.
Niche User,5,My daughter is a freshman and I cannot say enough positive things about her experience so far. The community is supportive and available - she is happy and thriving and loving her courses and meeting individually with her professors. And having so much fun. I am nothing but happy for her and her school choice.
Niche User,5,Great small community feel of a campus. Student tour guides are one of the friendliest people you will meet from all your other campus tours. The aroma and people are what make Davidson what it is. It sticks to its reputations and never will let you down!
Alum,5,"The people who attend Davidson are a special breed.  Plenty of schools are packed with smart and hardworking students and faculty.  Plenty of schools have  students and faculty that are supportive of each other and dedicated to making positive impact on their friends and the world.  Few have both. Davidson is one of those few. 
Too small? Probably. But you'll have wider, deeper, lifelong relationships with classmates and faculty for the rest of your life."
Freshman,5,"I was nervous about coming to Davidson because it is a smaller school, but I absolutely love it. Davidson hand picks the best people all over the world. There are so many international students, and students from all over the US. I also love the Honor Code they have at Davidson. It holds the students to a higher standard than at state schools. Davidson has an amazing community that I am proud to be a part of. The academics are very challenging though."
Senior,5,"Small, close-knit college community with great academics and D1 sports. Location is in a cozy small town but close to Charlotte with activities and a major airport. College town is not great for late night options though."
Alum,5,"The hype is true. Amazing place. School built on Christian values, but with an actual commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. D-1 status makes a big difference in terms of quality of athletic facilities for a school of this size (particularly post Steph Curry). Most compelling reason by far to attend though is the faculty-- classes are amazing. I still reference my undergrad coursework many years later. Beautiful campus. Good luck getting in!"
Freshman,5,"Smart, involved, students focused on a bright future in an idyllic setting. In many ways, it feels bigger than it is with so much to offer and competitive D1 sports yet with small focused an interactive classes."
Freshman,5,"Davidson is definitely a small school. By that, I mean that it's smaller than my high school. To be quite honest, there really isn't much to do within the town of Davidson, and without a car, Charlotte isn't exactly accessible. I knew all too well of this, but I still decided to come here because Davidson genuinely is an amazing school. Professors are very engaged with their students and I can definitely see how passionate they are about the courses they teach. Class sizes are great as well, with several of my classes having fewer than 15 students and none over ~30. While diversity of the student population leaves something to be desired, Davidson is slowly improving."
Freshman,5,"My first year at Davidson has been a great experience.  The new science building is incredible, and I've received a lot of support and encouragement from my professors.  Although Davidson is a small campus, there is always something to do. The eating houses are a great way to meet people.  Whether you want to get involved academically or socially, there is something for everybody. The quality of life at Davidson is superb.  The town has shops and restaurants within walking distance.  But if you need to go a little further, the campus has free bicycles that you can borrow through a phone app."
Sophomore,5,"Davidson is an excellent school that prepares you well for your future career. The professors are brilliant, helpful, and genuine. The classes are relevant, engaging, and well-taught, and there are many opportunities for involvement on campus. It's hard not to like this place."
Junior,5,"An amazing education, professors that go above and beyond, and a student body that care about one another."
Niche User,5,"Obviously, the school has incredible academics as well as athletics.  The campus is gorgeous, and facilities are impressive.  However, what Davidson is best known for is the overall environment and people there.  When you step on campus, you will automatically feel welcome and comfortable.  You will not meet nicer people anywhere else.  It is highly competitive academic school, but promotes a more cooperative atmosphere than other schools in a similar category."
Junior,5,"Davidson is an absolutely phenomenal school, but it is definitely a school meant to work you very hard. While you typically only take four classes a semester, these classes will keep you up busier than you could imagine. One of the most important factors of the college is the quality of professors. Davidson is consistently ranked one of the top colleges for professor qualifications and experience. All the professors you will be taught by are extraordinarily distinguished in their field with numerous connections that they are willing to pass on to students for their own success. They will push you hard academically, but studying and learning from them is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have. Also, prominent professors are larger institutes that care about graduate students and their research more, you will have their undivided attention at Davidson. The professors genuinely care about their students and are always willing to help you succeed."
Niche User,5,"Quite an artistical masterpiece. This college has given much of an interesting trip for me. I remember going the summer of 2016 and I remember it quite well. I expected it to be not naturally comfortable for me in the slightest, but this results in much a masterpiece as of now."
Sophomore,5,"Love it here. Students are dedicated to their work,  but they also know how to have a good time. I've met so many fun, bright, well-rounded people here who I know I will be friends with for life."
College Freshman,5,I personally love Davidson College. It has been a great experience and has build me with a lot of useful knowledge.
College Freshman,5,"It is fairly easy to get into a program at Davidson, most of the people do it here. It is a big opportunity."
College Freshman,5,Feel very secure in Davidson's campus. The campus police is at close range.
College Freshman,5,Greek life in Davidson is pretty big. I'm considering in joining a frat on Spring 2017.
College Freshman,5,Davidson College is very has a very competitive environment that gets the best out of you. It makes you want to succeed and be a responsible student.
College Freshman,5,Very nice facilities and faculty.
College Freshman,5,Davidson is absolutely perfect. I could not think of anything more they could do to improve the student experience.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is very safe, especially with the honor code. People can leave their things anywhere, leave their doors unlocked, and no problems occur."
College Freshman,5,It's a top 10 liberal arts college. You get a phenonemal education here.
College Freshman,5,Davidson is an incredibly diverse school for its size. There are tons of people from different places with different backgrounds!
College Freshman,5,"Davidson is a world-class school. It's a little unknown still so sometimes name recognition value isn't there, but the academic value of spending four years here prepares people so well to succeed in the real world."
College Freshman,5,"I have loved my time at Davidson. There are certainly some small things I would change, but comprehensively, it was been the best school I could ask for. The people, facilities, activities, sports, and academics are all top notch and combine into a wonderful medley."
College Freshman,5,Davidson is a college unlike any other. I love it!
College Freshman,5,Professors are great and most courses are challenging
College Freshman,5,I lucked out and got a large room freshman year. Some of the dorms are very small but they all have a sink in the room. Most people get to know the people on their halls very well and my hall counselor is great! Roommate and halls are selected after taking the Myers-Briggs and most people get along with their roommate. Underclassman dorms are close to classes and food.
College Freshman,5,Davidson is unique because it is a school full of smart people who work together and don't brag about themselves.
College Junior,5,Great school and a wonderful experience overall
College Sophomore,5,"The school does not require students to take out loans, they match unmet need with grants from the school to replace loans.  I have had no problems and I was awarded several outside scholarships."
College Junior,5,"The town of Davidson is a hidden gem with regards to food. With great options like Toast, Summit, The Soda Shop, The Egg, Flat Iron and Restaurant X, if you are craving something different, you won't be disappointed!"
College Junior,5,"As mentioned before, the Psychology program is very rewarding. While one of the more difficult majors at Davidson, the psych departments boasts wonderful professors, nice facilities, research opportunities and a plethora of resources for post-Davidson."
College Junior,5,"Davidson students are immensely proud of our D1 athletic teams. Most students are very active in Freshman Flickerball, intramural sports and attending the basketball games."
College Junior,5,"The town of Davidson is the epitome of charm with its scenic main street, inviting shoppes and kind townspeople. Additionally, if you crave city-life, North Davidson and Downtown Charlotte is only a short ride away!"
College Junior,5,"Professors at Davidson really take the time to get to know their students. They offer office hours and are always available by appointment. Additionally, our small class sizes foster an intimate learning environment."
College Junior,5,"All of Davidson's facilities are breathtakingly beautiful, pristine and well-suited for the subjects and activities they house. All buildings are within a seven minute walk from each other, connected by lovely brick pathways and luscious green space. Such structure foster the wonderful community of Davidson College."
College Junior,5,"Davidson College's ""Greek Life"" consists of eating houses, fraternities, and historically black fraternities and sororities. However, due to our unique offering of eating houses, the collective of these organizations is referred to as Patterson Court. Each of these organizations provide students with the opportunities for personal growth, community service, leadership and fellowship.

Membership in Patterson Court is open to all students, however, sixty-three percent of Davidson women and forty-five percent of Davidson men participate in our Greek life. Overall, the difference between Patterson Court and non-Patterson Court students is simply where you eat some of your meals. There is no animosity, exclusion, or any negativity between members of Patterson Court or non-members. Unless specified, all events are open to all students, and interaction between organizations and students is encouraged. 

One highlight of the eating house option for women is that it is 'self-selected.' This means that women hoping to join an eating house simply list their order of preference for the four houses, and a computer algorithm determines your placement. The majority of women are placed into their top choice or second choice selection. As a member of an eating house, I am a big advocator for the process and the organization itself. However, I have friends on both sides and neither is limited socially by their status."
College Freshman,5,There have been a couple cases of reported crime and a couple cases of possible sexual assault but it really is a incredibly safe campus. As a female I feel safe walking alone at night.
College Senior,5,"great food, but not always open late"
College Freshman,5,"Spacious, sub free is awesome"
College Junior,5,"No loans! It's wonderful, and they consider what you say when you think you deserve more."
College Freshman,5,"The campus police enforce the rules, if anything happens on campus an investigation ensues"
College Freshman,5,The basketball team is a must see event for any student
College Freshman,5,The professors really get to know you and are all dedicated to helping students
College Freshman,5,Computers are available all over campus and easy to access
College Freshman,5,Go to the meetings offered when applicable and meet as many people as possible
College Freshman,5,"Really looks out for the students, but I am still in need of some aid"
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of organizations and clubs on campus regarding LGBT and race
College Freshman,5,Davidson off campus housing is affordable and easy to use
College Freshman,5,"My personal preference is to bring a computer because it is more convenient, however, if you are willing to go somewhere on campus to do your work, you technically don't NEED a lap top. There are dual boot computers everywhere. The printing and copying is free, which is REALLY nice. There are student tech helpers available until 11pm every night in the library. At the beginning of freshman year, every student receives Microsoft Office for free. The network is generally fast, but printing does crash sometimes. The wireless kind of sucks at times. The connection drops once every few days, but it connects right back up. The biggest issue is that some places in Belk and most places outside do not have good wifi."
Alum,4,This does not apply to me so I am writing a generic review hoping I hit the 100 mark it must be close there we go.
Alum,4,"It is hard to write a review of a college, let alone Davidson, that takes into account all of the information and auras one wants to convey. And plenty have yet to settle for most alums, for whom Davidson remains a lifelong quest to define. That alone speaks to the effect the school has. A good place to start is alum involvement. Davidson has one of the most committed collection of alumni in the world. For those like me 2 years or so out, I think relaying that statistic is huge. Odds are we will  follow suite. 
          Career services are better, but the 2020 economy, especially if you want to do finance, is tough. Davidson pulls no punches about continued severe grading, so while the academics are remarkable, you may leave smarter yet less ""qualified"" than weaker peers who went to worse schools and learned less. No interviewer wants to hear or will believe excuses about a school he/she might not know. Alums do amazing things beyond that. I'm in that annoying in between phase!"
Alum,4,"When I went to Davidson, it was my dream school. I loved it so much, and I was SO excited to attend. I still feel that way a lot of the time, but my undergraduate education at Davidson was interrupted by health crises that made it hard for me to really experience the school. Davidson does NOT have adequate mental health resources for students. Thankfully, nearly every professor I spoke to about my circumstances was accommodating and kind. I wish I had been healthier when I went to Davidson; I think I could've gotten a lot out of it. Still, I think about it fondly and I'm proud of my alma mater :)"
Alum,4,I believe college is what you make of it. I was very active on campus and involved in everything from Dance Ensemble to eating houses. Being overworked and very active in campus life is a common trait of many Davidson students. The campus has a work hard and party harder mentality. There are great professors and other ones that are not so great. I would make sure you do your research before taking a class. Overall Davidson is 4 stars. I would definitely say it is the best liberal arts college but there is always work to be done to make it better.
Sophomore,4,"Academics, campus life and athletics are overall really good. We have some issues with tenured professors though who are stuck in their old ways."
Senior,4,I took classes online last semester because of Corona. The classes were fine. In fact they were more laid back than regular in person classes.
Senior,4,I like the school overall but I have been screwed over by Financial AId a couple of times. It's a good school academically but for African Americans the social life and party scene isn't that great.
Junior,4,"Davidson cares really deeply about their students. Their financial aid packages have always been remarkably generous, supported by many supportive alumni. Davidson has a great networking system. It is a small campus, but it allows you to really shine through, be who you want to be, and make the changes you want to see. Professors are the most caring individuals you'll ever meet."
Alum,4,"Davidson is an excellent school, providing a rigorous education and numerous opportunities to students. Davidson students strive for excellence rather than just passing the course. As with any upper-tier college or university, there tends to be a fair amount of stress among the student body, but unlike Ivy-League schools, students turn the stress toward mutual support rather than competition. Furthermore, despite the challenges of the coursework, most students still find time to participate in the extra-curricular activities they love."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my first year at Davidson College. I have enjoyed the small class size and the openness of the faculty. My professors have been helpful during office hours and always know my name. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate since it is small. I'd like to see Davidson become more diverse.
Sophomore,4,"Davidson College is a small liberal arts institution with only two thousand students, give or take, on campus at a time. One thing I would like to change about Davidson is the size of the campus and the student body. The rigor of the academics here at this school was a few levels up from my high school AP courses that I took. My small pool of classmates makes me along with other feel like a big fish in a small pond."
Junior,4,"Davidson is very challenging, but equally rewarding. Professors are wonderful and truly invested in helping their students succeed. The undergrad research opportunities that are available are unique to Davidson and prepare students for life after college (grad school/med school/workforce)."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere and feeling of the campus and student body, but the academics are a bit cutthroat and the tuition is very overpriced, even with a large amount of financial aid."
College Freshman,4,I live in a double bed dorm and it's been great. Everyone here is very clean and gives a good feeling.
College Freshman,4,The athletics facilities here at Davidson are good. I'm planning on playing varsity soccer.
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is convenient and quality.
College Freshman,4,"I love Davidson. Many aspects of the school could be improved upon, but overall the experience is great."
College Freshman,4,"Depends on which dorm you get. I've had an overall good experience in Belk, which is the largest of the freshmen dorms."
College Freshman,4,"Davidson College is a unique schooling environment. Courses are rigorous, but professors will always put student success at top priority. The social scene is lacking in some departments, but there are a lot of ways to spend your time, whether it be volunteering, joining one of the many clubs/organizations, or being a part of greek like."
College Freshman,4,"While there are always people (professors included) that one does not like, generally the professors are super engaging, great teachers and want to help their students! Most classes are challenging and professors always offer their help."
College Freshman,4,I am a big fan of men's basketball and am involved in several intramural teams myself. I wish the women's basketball was more supported.
College Freshman,4,"The first semester was somewhat stressful, but now that I am more settled I really like it."
College Freshman,4,"Davidson is a very safe place to go to school. Between the Honor Code and a really great community of students, it's a secure place to spend 4 years. Serious crimes are very rare and it's a really diligently policed community, both by observant students and a dedicated campus police."
College Freshman,4,"There are a few drawbacks - mostly financial - but I'm very glad to be in the fraternity that I'm in. It's not a crucial part of the social scene, but I'm really grateful for my family in my fraternity and have had lots of great times with them, not just partying!"
College Freshman,4,Facilities and sports are a great part of Davidson!
College Freshman,4,I have not experienced any pressure to drink or judgement for choosing not to drink but alcohol is available if you want it.
College Freshman,4,Crime on campus is very low because of the honor code. My interactions with the campus police have been positive and I feel safe here.
College Freshman,4,"Professors really care about you and in all classes you are expcected to attend regularly. considering the size of the school there are a lot of different courses offered and class sizes are small which I appreciate. Not everyone gets A's. You have to put in the work to get good grades here but it is not impossible to get good grades, be involved and have a social life."
College Freshman,4,The statistics are very good. The career center reviews every students resume.
College Freshman,4,Women have eating houses which most women join. The eating houses are great because they are very inclusive. You are placed into your eating house by an algorithm that tries to match you with the one you want the most. I don't know much about the fraternities but they are not participate in as much or as much of a Davidson Tradition as the eating houses
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Davidson College. I feel like this is the place I need to be. When I first got here, I had doubts about whether or not I should've chosen to go to the state school everyone from my high school went to, but I quickly realized that Davidson is the place for me."
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the athletics at Davidson.
College Sophomore,4,The school works very hard in assuring the students feel safe and protected.
College Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed the two years staying on campus in the dorms.  I really love the fact that Davidson guarantees on campus housing all four years.  Overall, its a very great experience."
College Junior,4,"The Psychology department at Davidson offers a wide variety of courses within the major. The way the major is structured, each student must dip his or her toe in all of the areas, including developmental psychology, cognitive, organizational...and so on. This ensures maximum exposure and understanding of the field."
College Junior,4,"Thus far, I have been very pleased with Davidson's housing options. My freshman year I resided in Cannon Hall, and my sophomore year I lived in Sentelle. Both dorms are centrally located and provide residents with spacious rooms, pristine facilities and wonderful staff. First years are encouraged to interact with other floors and dorms through mixer activities, however, the dorm environment lends itself well to social engagements."
College Junior,4,"Davidson College offers a variety of dining options on campus. If one elects to have a meal plan, you can dine at Vail Commons Dining Hall, Union Cafe or The Den. The food and service in each of these options is absolutely superb. The food is fresh and the menu provides yummy staples and varied dishes often. Each option provides vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options as well. 

If one chooses to take part in Patterson Court, one can choose to eat meals at their organization, each of which has its own chef and dining area. 

A rising star in the food options at Davidson is New Summit. This is a coffee-shop and multi-purpose space offering delicious drinks, meals, and freshly baked items daily."
College Freshman,4,"Honestly I have no idea how they calculated my aid, but it is good."
College Freshman,4,"Although there is currently some controversy between the administration and students involving meal plan, I would say that the college is actually very good about considering the opinions of students."
College Freshman,4,I am currently considering a Hispanic studies or Latin American studies major. As a freshman I do not know much about them but they seem to be enjoyed albeit small departments.
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman in a LAC I am undecided and do not have to declare until the end of my sophomore year. I do not find the distribution requirements to be a hassle, and you seldom here people complain about fulfilling them. I am currently taking classes in 4 different departments and enjoy them all."
College Senior,4,"The Honor Code is a wonderful asset that makes Davidson a safe place, but there are transgressions that are harmful to others"
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of varsity teams, so a large portion of the student body are athletes, who interact very well with the non-athlete student body"
College Senior,4,"It's a wonderful small town- not terribly exciting, but great."
College Junior,4,"I have always felt very very safe on campus. And with the rise of lawsuits with different colleges' sexual assault policies, Davidson is making effort to make theirs better."
College Junior,4,People are super put together most of the time. Very friendly and willing to help others. But also super obsessed with how much work they have to do.
College Junior,4,I think it is 50 for the entire year. It's never too hard to find parking.
College Junior,4,"Campus police just want you to be safe! They try to avoid writing anyone up unless they are truly disturbing others around them. Drugs are taken much more seriously than drinking, though."
College Junior,4,Most of the freshman dorms are superb with spacious rooms. Very clean!
College Junior,4,"It's difficult but worth it. You get what you put in - with effort comes an excellent education and life-long, fulfilling friendships!"
College Junior,4,"It is really chill. It is pretty easy to find alcohol down the hill. There are always police officers hanging around, but they aren't out to get you. If you have an obvious container they will write you up, but if it's in a solo cup, they will just ask you to pour it out. They just want you to be safe. The drinking scene is much larger than the drug scene. Very few people are hard-core into drugs and if they do anything, they smoke pot. If you are not into drinking, signing up for a sub-free dorm is a great option for meeting other people who don't want to. If you do or don't, either way there isn't peer pressure. People will not judge you for not drinking if you do not judge them for drinking."
College Freshman,4,"I am used to the weather, so it is typical and fair"
College Freshman,4,"Drugs are absolutely not allowed on campus, will result in expulsion if discovered"
College Freshman,4,The people living nearby will interact with the students and offer internships/jobs
College Freshman,4,I am still a freshman so I have time to explore the different departments before committing
College Freshman,4,"Not the biggest thing on campus, generally eating houses are bigger"
College Freshman,4,"The freshmen dorms vary according to preference (sub-free or not) and size. They are all close to Chambers, which helps a lot"
College Freshman,4,"The health center is very easily accessible and free, but the quality of the doctors is a little disappointing. They are all very nice, but the doctors are not superb. On the other hand, the counseling services offered are phenomenal. The counselors are kind and available, and most students frequent the counseling center. Overall, campus is extremely safe, and I've only ever felt scared one or two nights. "
College Freshman,4,"For the girls, the most widely available option are eating houses, which are nice because they take dangerous initiation practices out of the equation because of self-selection. For the boys, they still have secretive initiation practices."
College Freshman,4,"The facilities are nice, and students have access to three gyms."
Alum,2,President Quillen has made leftist political activism her quest. If you want your children to be turned into political activists instead of scholars this may be the place. It's a shame that balance in thought and deed has gone out of style there.
Niche User,2,Davidson could certainly do a better job of using online resources and technology in classes. The majority of classes are PowerPoint slide guided lectures.
College Freshman,2,"The Drug Safety policy is pretty draconian to be honest, but the culture in general isn't bad at all."
College Junior,2,"Not very many people choose to live off campus, because there's guaranteed on campus housing all 4 years."
College Freshman,2,"I have only met a couple people who live off-campus. Most are because they want to own a pet. I have never inquired why/how living off-campus works, but the norm is that majority of people just live on campus because the facilities are great and nearby, and the college requires it (unless you petition to live off-campus)."
College Freshman,2,"There is no transportation to or from Davidson except for taxis, which are extremely expensive.  There is, however, a shuttle to and from the airport during breaks, which are very convenient and significantly less expensive than taxis."
College Freshman,2,"I Hate the Wireless Network. DavidsonSecure is my enemy.  The wireless internet is extremely slow and inconsistent for all of the ""upgrades"" that IT has said they've undergone.  It stops working at least twice a day.  The set-up process is also a huge pain in the butt.  I do, however, like the PawPrinter system, where you can press print from any computer, simply send it to ""PawPrint"" and swipe your CatCard at any printer on campus to retrieve your documents."
College Freshman,2,"Off campus housing and parties are just really sketchy. With the new on-campus apartments and dorms in addition to the new renovations, it is so much better to just live on campus! Because on-campus housing is so great, the college isn't too fond of students trying to live off campus either."
College Sophomore,2,"Less Diverse Than It Thinks It Is – Davidson is more diverse than the schools that most of its students are coming from, but that's not saying much. What different ethnicities there are hang out in cliques and don't have a lot of interaction with the white students."
College Junior,2,"Not Enough Spaces – There aren't a lot of parking spaces. There are a good amount of faculty spaces that don't get used though. If you want to go to the grocery store, walmart, or get off-campus at all you need a car."
College Junior,2,Fast Food – Very few dining options within walking distance and they're pricey for college students to go to frequently. There is no fast food or cheap food within walking distance.
College Junior,2,"Davidson College does have some diversity, although often time diversity seems to be focused on the usual buzzwords of race, sexual orientation, and gender, and economic background is not taken into account.  People here are all unique individuals, but often times some groups end up falling in together and don't really break outside of their comfort zones.  For example, the S.T.R.I.D.E. program brings minority students onto campus a week early so that they may bond with each other and feel more secure at Davidson.  It has led to a rise in the number of minorities who stay all four years here, but often it leads to the STRIDE groups essentially hanging out with each other and not blending with the rest of campus"
Niche User,1,"Pulled my daughter out of Davidson after her freshman year. She was a recruited athlete and (like most of the students there) a high achiever. My biggest disappointment was lack of support for the athletes. Unlike other D1 schools, Davidson athletes register through the same random assignment system as the non-athletes and have to take at least 4 units (16 credits), making it difficult to get courses needed to stay on track for degree plan while having a class schedule that allows flexibility around practice and tournaments. My kid struggled to balance the academic load with the demands of two a day practices and travel every other week during competition season. And the counselors, tutors, and related support staff that other D1 schools have? Nope, not Davidson. Combine that HUGE deficit with below average housing, average teaching quality, and well above average cost, and I came to the conclusion that we were better off somewhere else. It’s a good school but it’s not amazing."
College Freshman,1,"The food is decent at commons but Union is the best, very good food. But not everything is on meal plan which makes no sense. Have to use dining dollars for some items so wtf"
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife at Davidson College gets a little stale after awhile. There is only one central place to party and it gets old quick. Go out in moderation. Davidson is in a small town and there isn't much to do at night.
College Sophomore,1,"There are a few good buildings on campus (like Duke, Cannon, Sentelle and Tomlinson) but getting into them either requires a ridulous amount of luck or willingness to pay more. The lottery system by which you get a dorm is horribly put together. Most upperclassmen housing sucks. At least housing is guaranteed."
College Sophomore,1,"Any clubs you might go to are all the way in downtown Charlotte and sketchy. The campus party scene is okay but really repetitive. If your nightlife experience is important to you, look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,"Generally Overhyped – The athletics scene was one of the biggest disappointmens I had my freshman year while coming to Davidson. While traditionally football has remained relatively popular among students here, the games are pretty poorly attended despite the schools effort to provide a tailgate. After the Basketball Teams '08 Tournament run, the team has been mediocre the past few seasons, and although the games are generally fun to go to, their is not as much spirit and hype around the program as there has been in the past. Asides from those two, baseball games and tennis matches are fun to go to, as at both there are pretty good showings by rowdy fans. However, our athletics do NOT come close to stacking up against bigger schools"

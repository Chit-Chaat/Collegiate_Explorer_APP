Senior,5,"Currently, UCR is almost entirely online, and it has been a completely seamless transition! Every professor has done their best to provide the best learning experience possible for all students, and they are all willing to work around potential problems with students, rather than simply brushing them all aside."
Senior,5,"UCR has an incredibly welcoming atmosphere. The campus is very beautiful and the students and faculty are kind, and understanding. Not once in my experience at UCR did I ever feel excluded, or shunned for any reason. There is always something to do, and friends to do it with. I enjoyed my time here, and I know you will too!"
Freshman,5,"Overall, UCR is a great and alert school that takes all necessary protocols to keep everyone safe on and off campus. The professors are more than happy to help as long you ask."
Freshman,5,All my professors are understanding and welcoming on zoom. It's more like they are talking to you directly through zoom because they are so willing to listen about your confusion.
Junior,5,"Uc Riverside is one of the good schools to get a bachelors degree in whatever major you choose, they make sure you learn everything that you need to learn before graduating."
Alum,5,"UCR was great, overall. The professors are great, and the teaching assistants were also knowledgable. There were plenty of research opportunities, and the campus was huge. The events were always fun. Typically, most students were eligible for aid. The only negative thing I have to say is regarding registration. You receive a registration date and time, and more often than not, classes are impacted and you are unable to get into the class of your choice. You are then left with classes that do not match your interest, which you have to enroll in, in order to be enrolled full-time."
Junior,5,The professors are very supportive and helpful and are very clear on the assignments and are very flexible as they know the difficulty when connecting to an online class.
Graduate Student,5,"I had learn a lot and gain great experiences while attending the school. I was able to get quality education from each of my professors, and they had really help me to be more of critical thinker. The one thing I regarded while attending the school was that did not took the chance to get an internship."
Graduate Student,5,I have not taken any online courses. All of my classes were in person. This fall I will be taking online courses for my MBA.
Freshman,5,"Not only is the school very centered around helping students succeed, it feels like family and the student life is ideal."
Sophomore,5,"UCR is an amazing school with amazing staff, beautiful campus, and diverse students. The campus has an amazing variety of food places that are both affordable delicious. Students are serious in their studies,kind and welcoming all in one."
Freshman,5,Despite everything being online this year I can genuinely say that this school is so welcoming to their incoming freshman. I had the most beautiful experience during orientation and I already felt at home without having to physically be at the school. The staff is very helpful and nice including their students. I feel as though they care for all the people attending UCR which I love.
Freshman,5,I have not had classes online yet but I have attended orientation and it was online due to coronavirus but it was still very informative. One thing that I believe helped keep many students focused and on track during orientation were the student to student zoom calls where we spoke about college with a student from our college who has experience at the University of California- Riverside already. There were no technical difficulties and I believe that if my positive experience at online orientation has any correlation to my online classes then I believe my education will still be a good experience online.
Freshman,5,I love that they are so welcoming and that the population is so diverse. I appreciate that all questions and concerns are answered.
Freshman,5,"They have gotten back to me very fast through all of this. Tests have been easier due to personal things going on at home. It has been hard, but teachers are trying their best to accommodate students."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the community and the student life at UCR. The students were overall very welcoming and there is a diverse group of students from all backgrounds! I loved the inclusivity of the school.
Graduate Student,5,Overall the classes that I took online were really flexible especially due to covid-19 which I really appreciate during these hard times. The professors were understanding and cared about each student.
Junior,5,"Online classes are not the same as in person, but the professors try their best to accommodate the students as they understand that during times like these are not the best to study under. There is a lot of work though. However, they help with books by making it optional to buy textbooks. Although the class is online the professors try their best to make a conversation flow throughout class by talking to each other, everyone having their turn to talk."
Freshman,5,"There is a conflict between the students and administration and ASUCR. However, the school provides helpful resources, such as R'pantry and the Well, and programs/clubs/communities that highlight diversity. Since this school is part of the UC system, it is fairly easy to participate in Research programs/studies. Overall the professors and teacher assistants are accommodating and understanding, especially in light of this pandemic."
Freshman,5,"Although the change of environment was hard, the professors and teacher assistants were accommodating to the situation. Although they were accommodating to our grades, the quality of education was significantly decreased. It seemed more as if online courses were a grade inflation since the way tests were administered was a lot easier compared to in-person tests."
Sophomore,5,Ucr has been great! I love all my professors so far. I think that they are all passionate about what they teach and generally want you to succeed.
Alum,5,I didn't do much online besides pick classes and that was simple easy and smooth. just a blast on campus.
Alum,5,My experience was great. I was not in campus long but the time I stayed on campus there was always something to do even relaxing in the library. Took me 7 years to finish school at UCR but I loved it and miss campus alot.
Freshman,5,"The online experience has been excellent, all professors are very understanding of the situation and always keeping us updated."
Freshman,5,"It isn't the ideal learning situation, but it wasn't so bad because there were good professors and understanding staff."
Freshman,5,Going to UCR had always been my goal. Now that I am here I know that I made the right choice in completing my goals.
Senior,5,"As a transfer student I was nervous and anxious about transferring to a four year university but I have to admit that it has been a life changing experience. UCR is an awesome school in the sense if how they care for students, including transfer students. There are also plenty of resources that have helped and guided me through my time there and  I really appreciate it."
Freshman,5,"I currently go to University of California, Riverside, and it has been one of the best experiences of my life.  Honestly, UC Riverside has such a diverse, and cultural student population that you feel like you belong to everyone and anyone. I have so many opportunities to connect with individuals and fully pursue all the important causes I am willing to fight for. The school pushes you to better yourself and achieve all your dreams. The student life is phenomenal, involving students in every part of what is going on in campus. I have so resources and tools to put my life on track from good-academic advisors, student government, professors, a gym to keep healthy, and so much more.  As for education, you are receiving so much powerful knowledge and lessons that you can't get from other professors and mentors who care and understand your aspirations for a beneficial future. UC Riverside was the place for me to grow, achieve, and learn as a student and individual, I am glad to be here."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience UCR has been great! The education the university provides helps me feel like everything has been handed out to me for success. In order for me to obtain it is to work very hard. The professors I’ve had this past year has been one of my best teachers I’ve had in education, and I’ve had no complaints about them. One of the best things about UCR is it’s campus and it’s students. The campus renovations and students make me feel like UCR is really home and is a college that is expanding to further boast its success."
Niche User,5,"I haven't even completely made up my mind to attend UCR. However, after getting in contact with the Chinese Union Organization at UCR, I have been set on my decision! The members were so enthusiastic and friendly. They answered my questions with patience and made me feel comfortable. It was absolutely amazing to meet them and I even plan to audition in order to work with them this fall!"
Niche User,5,i absolutely love uc riverside i’m a prospective student and the school is so welcoming so accommodating and over a great school
Sophomore,5,"The University of California, Riverside is not only a campus for student life, but it also has good professors who are willing to help through your struggles if you ask for help. The TAs are also very helpful as well, often times more so than the professors since they grade most of your work. Overall, even though I’m a second year, I’ve enjoyed every aspect that the campus has to offer."
Freshman,5,I love the hyper feeling at school and how the campus looks and how I always spend my time in campus to do everything for the day.
Junior,5,"The number of resources at your disposal to help you succeed in your academic career is astounding. You can get help with your studies by going to see a tutor at the Academic Resource Center, visit the Career Center for help with your resume or interview preparation, or join one of the hundreds of school organizations that best fit your interests."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at UCR. I feel like they really want to see you succeed and have so many resources to help you out. I would like for there to be more professors to break up the large classrooms.
Alum,5,"UCR is such a diverse and helpful campus. The professors are knowledgable and passionate about their studies, willing to go the extra mile to make sure students understand the materials. There are many, many different organizations on campus that provide a sense of community and unity. The campus is serene and open, the students are engaged and multi-faceted, I truly enjoyed my 4 years at UCR."
Niche User,5,"Although I have not yet attended University of California - Riverside -- I have been admitted and will be attending in the fall of 2020 -- the amount of information that I have read through a myriad of resources online and through the mail has me able to confidently say that this is a great school and that this school is devoted to their students and the environment that they are in. UCR is highly involved in making sure that incoming students, such as first years and transfers, are informed of all aspects in why you should choose UCR to further your education after high school and to prepare you for future professions."
Niche User,5,"I'm a prospective student, and so far I believe UCR is a very good school for the cost. the facilities and living situation is very good and I am excited to attend there this fall."
Junior,5,"it's the most diverse campus out of all the UC campuses, we are rising in #s and ranking; students are super friend and always involved with school spirit; events are always bringing in new experiences with friends; professors are the best here!"
Freshman,5,"It is a very diverse school full of great opportunities. The campus is beautiful and very peaceful. They offer many services and their organizations are great. The dorms are pretty good, not too bad. The staff everywhere is very generous and humble, which I love. I feel at home and I feel like I could ask anyone for help without being scared. I simply love this school!"
Junior,5,I love UCR! It is an amazing school with beautiful facilities and a welcoming environment. The teachers there are very passionate and it is a very student oriented college. Great environment for learning and teaching!
Sophomore,5,My experience is great here!  University of California Riverside is a very diversed school and it made me feel more welcome.
Freshman,5,I like the diversity of the university. I like being a part of a learning community because it gives me a better understand difficult subjects such as chemistry or precalculus much better.
Niche User,5,"As incoming Freshman I really enjoyed the sense of community. With it being a very diverse school in which everyone feels included. I am nothing but satisfied with this school and its courses. I got the opportunity to talk to some staff and  they are by far the nicest and educated i have ever talked to, They had amazing advice which i will cherish from this day on."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere of the campus as well as how well I was able to transition into college life. UCR has great programs such as learning communities which help make friends and obtain guaranteed schedules. I would love to attend more events that are hosted by the school and wish that it is more publicized.
Niche User,5,"There's always something going on and sometimes I feel like a kid in a candy store with all the choices that are available on and off campus. Though, sometimes I have to put my studies first as opposed to going out with friends, but there are so many events always going on that is isn't that big of a deal if you can't always make it. Because out school is known for its diversity, there are constantly different cultural events and holidays going on that it is really cool to be in a situation that I can experience these events in which some of them I have never even heard of."
Niche User,5,"University of California Riverside was such an amazing campus to visit. The campus was very clean and it was very aesthetically pleasing to look at. The smell was what caught my attention the most, the aroma of the flowers was found almost everywhere on the campus. The smell of the oranges are very strong near the orange trees and you can even eat them. The campus was clean and it was my greatest pleasure to be there. The professors seem nice and helpful as well. The students there are diverse as well, on top of that, they are some of the nicest people that I have ever met. This campus pleases me in every way imaginable and I highly suggest that you go to visit this campus or even go to school here. You will find that this campus is great in every way imaginable, but the price is kind of a lot."
Sophomore,5,"I love how my University is growing in the sense that we are academically jumping new records of success each year with new majors, higher GPAs, affluence to communities/companies post-graduation, and discoveries. I hope to see one day that my university becomes well known for its fast-growing academic ability, and possibly a football team in the future!"
Junior,5,I think it is a great university. I think the people are smart. The food and books are kind of expensive but I think it is worth coming. I think there is alot of people. I do think that it is annoying dealing with the idiots cruising on their bikes and electric boards.
Niche User,5,This University is one of the most diverse and most beautiful I have seen. I genuinely enjoyed visiting this campus. There was a lot of love and happiness around the campus. This campus felt like home and everyone seemed happy to be there.
Senior,5,"My experience at UCR is memorable. I've made so many friends from different ethnic backgrounds. I would, however, make it more affordable because even though I did make friends, most had to take a year or a quarter off because of their financial situations."
Senior,5,"I transferred to UCR last Fall and I would say I'm glad I made the decision to do so. Our campus is one of the most diverse campus I've seen so far. There's a lot of support network for transfer as well as an amicable college environment. Everyone is respectful and friendly. The only downside is since we're a smaller UC there's a lack of certain classes that are offered every quarter as well as vocational program opportunities for certification or license in different career paths like emt, cpr training, phlebotomy etc."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at UCR has been enjoyable thus far. As an honor student, I have been introduced to a myriad of opportunities for personal and career advancement. The Intro to Business course is somewhat discombobulated, as rotating professors prove difficult to ascertain each professor's classroom expectations, teaching styles, and assignment expectations."
Freshman,5,UC Riverside has been a great school for me. The professors and staff are well-trained employees who genuinely care about the performances of their students. On-campus housing is very nice!
Alum,5,"I liked my experience at the University of California, Riverside. It had a very diverse community with a wide array of student organizations with ample career and networking opportunities. I made a lot of friends who share similar interests as me and took classes from top tier professors who challenged me to exceed my academic potential and prepare me for graduate school."
Freshman,5,UCR is a big and beautiful campus with excellent people working here. All of them are just so nice and care so much about your education. The students here are also very friendly and supportive.
Freshman,5,"So far as a freshman, I enjoy the flexibility that the university offers. I am both able to manage my classes and work part time within the university. I also enjoy the school spirit and how engaged the university is with providing fun events for all students. One thing I would like to see change would be to provide more opportunities for incoming and current students to obtain scholarships and reduce their amount of debt."
Freshman,5,"The campus always have something going on everyday, it is fun to be getting involve. Rpantry is a big help for all the poor college students, so don't worry if you are a student without financial support. There is always some staffs to help you, it is such of a friendly environment. I really like it."
Niche User,5,"I went on a campus visit to the University of California Riverside in September, and everything was very idyllic. From the students to the campus guide, everyone was very nice, informative, and welcoming. I personally feel that UCR would be a very good school for me."
Niche User,5,Loved the campus and the only thing I would change would be the student interaction with one another as well as with the staff.
Junior,4,"Since all classes are being held online right now, my learning experience is pretty good, I tend to do better on online classes compared to in person classes. But I still would like to have some in person classes"
Alum,4,"I only took one course online and it was fairly easy. There was more work than in an on-campus class, but it was manageable. There was more reading and video-watching, and assignments were plentiful. This class was a breath course so it wasn't necessarily of my liking, but I still got an A."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience for my first year of college here was very rewarding! One thing that I wished was different however, was access to information regarding extracurricular activities, internships, and ways to get involved on campus."
Freshman,4,There is some sort of negative stigma that UCR gets which isn't deserved. UCR has been rising up the ranks to show how good of an actual school it is.
Freshman,4,"So far the overall experience of online learning is good. At first, it was very hectic and lots of issues were trying to get ironed out."
Freshman,4,"I haven't started yet but, look forward to it. Everything is online so I am not sure how it will play out. However I will remain hopeful."
Freshman,4,"Everything is online as of Fall 2020. I haven't started yet but, I look forward to it with very much excitement."
Junior,4,"UCR is just as great as any other UC, but one thing that really mattered to me was how diverse it is. UCR is known for being the most diverse UC and having a really great Ethnic Studies department. Because UCR is so diverse, it offers many different resources for any student regardless of background. Public transportation via the buses are free for students, which was very useful and convenient pre-pandemic."
Junior,4,Online learning at UCR so far has been going pretty well. Professors I've had are really accommodating and use many different modes to educate students. They have been creative with how they share their material and also understanding of students' situations during this pandemic. I tend to do better with scheduled Zoom lectures rather than asynchronous lectures. The professors do really well with creating a learning environment online.
Junior,4,I like the overall atmosphere even though I not as small as a community college where everyone knows each other there are more opportunities available ar UCR. Where you can adjust your schedule with activities that are great to help you with your classes and relaxing your stressed mind during your breaks between classes. I would like the parking issue to be fixed as many students arrive over an hour before in order to find parking.
Senior,4,"My online experience at UCR has been quite interesting. As I have always been learning through direct interactions it has been hard to convert to online platforms such as zoom. The online learning experience at UCR has turned out successful however, as the professors has diligently converted to using digital platforms as they are becoming more and more educated about digital usage as the school also helps them as well. The online learning experience isn't as comfortable as learning in person, but it works as long as we give the upmost effort and sincerity we give."
Senior,4,"UCR has been such an interesting journey for me as a student, person, and individual. As I have been going through the highlander path, I have come to appreciate the smallest things about going to a school in the middle of a desert. I understand why people may look down on Riverside because it is considered a UC reject school, but in actuality the school isn't bad. The faculty is great, the atmosphere is also very diverse and supportive, and the students are very friendly and caring towards each other. I think current and prospective students that will enter into UCR will really enjoy it because college shouldn't be about going to the best college, but going to a place where you'll fit in and enjoy your experience. UCR will provide many with the perfect place to settle in and grow, while for others it may be otherwise. UCR has been great and I don't regret committing here!"
Freshman,4,Professors are very understanding and don’t stress because there are always accommodations. I loved how everyone would also do personal zooms to do study sessions.
Freshman,4,"I have not yet experienced doing online classes officially yet, however I can say that the process of registering for classes is pretty smooth. You can ask for help by talking to your academic advisor and whatever you need help with they will assist you. Your academic advisor is always willing to help if you have trouble or questions about classes."
Freshman,4,I find UCR's campus really enjoyable to walk around and just a nice place to hang with friends and enjoy California's weather.
Senior,4,"Overall my experience as an undergraduate has been excellent. I have consistently been supported and offered many opportunities. My issue, however, is that the university needs to take better care in addressing controversy over diversity and Title IX-related cases."
Senior,4,"The online learning experience has been an adjustment, and it is nowhere near perfect. But I believe that much of my positive experience is due to my professors who have consistently been flexible and understanding of the current situation."
Sophomore,4,"I am learning a lot about the real world with a very friendly and diverse group of people, and I could not be more thankful for my time at this institution."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at the University of California- Riverside and although I do not start my actual classes until October first, I can say that I have had a very positive experience with this college. Not only was our orientation very helpful with many information about the school but also about general knowledge on college and becoming independent adults. I will say that I am having difficulty receiving my financial aid and I have not had classes yet to judge what they are like which is why I am giving the school a four out of five stars. So far I am very proud of being a highlander and I cannot wait to see what else the University of California- Riverside has to offer me."
Junior,4,"Not the best but suffices. It is definitely more convenient especially during the summer. It is a bit difficult to keep the ""spirit"" up with online learning and people being less enthusiastic."
Junior,4,"Not the best but suffices. It is definitely more convenient especially during the summer. It is a bit difficult to keep the ""spirit"" up with online learning and people being less enthusiastic."
Freshman,4,The university and its professors are very accommodating. I appreciate that all classes have the option to be taken online.
Freshman,4,"The staff and faculty get back as soon as they can, they offer a lot of help so far despite the pandemic. Very welcoming."
Freshman,4,"As repeated before, UCR does a good job of helping students and linking it to other people that could potentially help."
Freshman,4,The professors were very helpful in the process of changing to all online studies and were very flexible with the students.
Freshman,4,"I am on the soccer team for UC Riverside and I would say my experience has been incredible. I could not have picked a better fit school for me. The diversity here is amazing and the respect every student has for each other is astounding. Every one of my professors has taught me more than I could have asked for, not only teaching me about the material of the subject at hand, but also life advice."
Senior,4,Online classes were ok. It is a learning experience for everyone. It does make it better that the professors are very understanding of the online experience and COVID. If you have any questions they are more than happy to set up a zoom meeting with you privately.
Freshman,4,"I love the instructors, the campus, the facilities! Everyone is excited to learn and there are tons of opportunities to get invovled."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the community that UCR has. The fact that the school is small means that you can bond with people easily and you can meet new people everyday. However, sometimes there needs to be improvement regarding the security."
Sophomore,4,I like the close knit community that I get to be a part of.  The programs most definitely help me in the long run for my future goals and teachers are easily approachable.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning was hard to adapt to but I eventually got used to it.  Some professors required us to go on an online lecture but the other pre-recorded their lecture.  Online tests were just like written tests so it was fair.  However, I have some friends who took finals and midterms internationally which meant different time zones.  I can see how difficult that may be"
Freshman,4,Something that I like is that everyone at UCR is very kind and welcoming. The dorms are also clean and bathrooms. Something I would like to see change is to stop the fire alarms.
Freshman,4,No but they do offer online courses. They also offer classes during the summer for incoming freshman. Which is very good because you can get started on your credits and it will help you.
Junior,4,The environment of this school is very calm. Doesn't seem as diverse as I would like it to be. Some professors are kind and understanding. Others just go by their agenda without much input from the students. Expensive overall.
Sophomore,4,"The changes made due to the virus have been difficult for everyone, but the professors have done well in accommodating. When on campus, the environment was present, and there is a large amount of diversity. That said, there are issues with registering for classes and the lack of parking. Plus, commuter students are more isolated due to the many clubs being held at inconvenient times. The professors are friendly, and everyone is very willing to help out students."
Freshman,4,"I was apprehensive of UCR at first as the stereotype associated with the university is that it's one of the lower-tier universities. However, as I spent time making friends, attending classes, and joining extracurricular activities I started to enjoy my time here. An issue that I think should be addressed is the limited amount of housing for incoming freshmen. About 25% of UCR students live off-campus and I feel as though it creates a sense of disconnect in the student body. I also know that parking is a major issue for those who are commuters. Overall, I am enjoying my time here but I definitely think improvements can and should be made."
Sophomore,4,"School is really good. Really easy to talk to counselors about future career plans and goals. Going to study abroad soon and super excited, the process was fairly easy and had a lot of help from different counselors and staff members."
Sophomore,4,"Taking classes online makes it a bit easier since I’ve found that the professors are more likely to give things like equation sheets for tests, but overall the lack of in person interaction and ability to talk to your professor face to face makes it a worse experience overall."
Freshman,4,I really like the campus and it is a very good soothing vibe especially with all the tress and plants and things just feel calm. My first two quarters there I loved it I had a good experience for my first year.
Freshman,4,I would say this school has some good professors and their facilities are top notch. I also like their support services to help students with whatever you need.
Senior,4,"For incoming freshmen (especially living on campus):
1. get ready for lonely weekends. Many students tend to go home because Riverside life is not fun on weekends like UCLA, USC, Berkeley, etc. but it makes sense because it’s a school reaching the potential of other bigger schools. 
2. LIVE IN AI. It is the more low quality dorm but has the tendency to be very social. A lot of people that get involved in social groups and organizations come from AI. 
3. Life off campus if you have the chance. Sometimes living on campus has drawbacks like costs, regulations, and a bunch of other things that living off campus may not entail. Get an apartment, rent a house with friends, it’s a great experience to undertake if you can financially allow it."
Freshman,4,UCR is a very good school. I love it there. The professors are really good and the school has so many opportunities for all students. It's a great place for education and learning.
Freshman,4,The campus was full of friendly and welcoming people who assisted those in need. It was also very culturally diverse and accepting.
Freshman,4,"As a student currently enrolled, UCR offers access to many resources which students can use to further their academic endeavors. I do have friends who go to UCLA and, from what I hear, UCR offers just slightly less in terms of assistance to students. The campus is beautiful but the dorms are sub-par in my opinion. The student body is incredibly diverse, the professors, from what I have experienced, are very good at what they do, and the TA's are very friendly and understanding. I would, however, critique the dining halls as the food is very hit or miss. If you are someone who goes to the gym, the REC center is very nice, spacious and well equipped with a million and one machines as well as a beautiful view from the second story. All in all, the campus is very unique and has a special vibe that is not for everyone but I cannot imagine myself at a place like UCLA or USC over UCR."
Freshman,4,"I had a great freshman year here. I was in a learning community for my major and it made my transition to college classes so much easier. I definitely recommend joining a learning community. I lived on campus in the AI dorms, and the food was pretty good. Also, the University Village was a quick 5-10 minute walk away. I would go there on the weekend with my roommates to watch a movie at the theater, eat breakfast, and every get pedicures. Moreover, campus has a lot of free useful resources for students on campus and the gym is actually really nice."
Alum,4,"Overall it was a fantastic experience! I believe UCR is constantly improving. While the cost is extreme (what believe to be due to student services), I can't complain. I loved the activities and I definitely made the most of it. UCR is a fantastic community with great potential."
Freshman,4,"I love UCR. I'm not saying that it is the best school ever but I am very happy to go here. I have school spirit and the diversity at this school is simply amazing. They are very inclusive of all sexualities, races, religions, and gender. The professors really love their job and seem happy to wake up everyday to come lecture to a class. The campus is decent and clean. I love walking around and admiring the trees and scenery."
Junior,4,"I've attended UCR for the last three years. I've met some amazing people here and created unforgettable memories! I'm satisfied with the academics and have met some pretty cool professors. UCR is also known for its diversity and inclusiveness. Despite it being a commuter college, UCR has a pretty active student life and party scene. I don't particularly like Riverside as a city which is where UCR is located, but I love that it is close to LA and San Diego."
Senior,4,"What I loved about UCR was the amount of resources offered and the people I met. However, during a pandemic crisis, UCR failed to show their empathy towards their students who are struggling financially."
Freshman,4,"This school has opened me up to such great people. Everyone I have ever talked to is so kind and I have made my best friends there. It is only my first year, so I am still trying to figure things out. But I do feel like I have a good idea of what I am talking about. The academics are good and are as difficult as you make it. I have had really good professors, but only ok TAs. Lecture halls are big, so they have a discussion for more of that classroom feel. Take advantage of your professor's office hours they are very helpful. Now Riverside is in the middle of nowhere, but it isn't impossible to get to places. Take advantage of the busses, Lyft, and Zipcar. With the right people, you will have a good time there."
Freshman,4,I visited the University and the environment there is pretty good. I am really interested to start a year there.
Alum,4,"I was here for 2 years before I transferred to UCSD so I have a point of reference for comparisom. The campus and students are very friendly, and the organizations were led by dedicated, welcoming people. I've made lifelong friends and professional contacts. That said, the academics are lacking, particularly in Computer Science. Some of the professors I had were not even professors, they were TAs because there wasn't anyone else qualified to teach the courses. The same goes for the overall curriculum and academics. It is not nearly as challenging, rigorous, or up to date compared to UCSD. Many top companies do not come to UCR to recruit and will not think much of your school if you graduate from here. Again, this is from a CS perspective, so if you're in another major that UCR is more renowned for this shouldn't apply to you. Overall the experience was great, but if you want to learn a lot or get a job from a big company in tech here it will be more difficult here."
Niche User,4,"I liked the nature that was on campus, from botanical gardens to the mountain views. I enjoyed the support towards food insecurity. They provided resources to help students not only receive health food options but to also donate food. As well as period products, supplies for students that are parents as well. I didn't like how isolated I felt. I lived on campus and though their were lots of activities I found that my RA never pushed us to go to any of them, and it was easy to walk past someone that was advertising events."
Freshman,4,"UCR is a great college. There is always something going on for students. The campus is really big and pretty. There are so many nice, quiet places to go and study. In addition, there is a lot of diversity so it is easy to find people like you. The campus and students are very inclusive. In terms of education, the classes offered are rigorous courses every quarter.  All of the professors I have had so far seem very invested in their student's education."
Niche User,4,The school itself is very nice and relaxing with many diverse students. The staff is very helpful and will guide you through your way. The school is also very clean with a lot of aesthetics.
Junior,4,"This university has a really diverse campus, which is great. It will only expose you to the workforce that requires you to work with people from different backgrounds. In addition to that, this university had a good business school. Most of the business professors have some sort of experience or knowledge about the industry or are even experts in it."
Freshman,4,"So far it's been a mostly positive experience, if you're living on campus make sure to make friends because it does tend to get a little lonely especially if you are far away from home"
Sophomore,4,"I would say that the education department is a little bit lacking, but the student life and the athletics are amazing."
Niche User,4,University of California Riverside is a great campus. I like the fact that it is not to far from home and I can come visit home whenever. They have great education opportunities and a open doorway for me to become an Aerospace Engineer.
Freshman,4,"I love UCR, overall a really great experience if you are thinking of becoming a Highlander. The campus is honestly beautiful and they're even adding new buildings to the campus.  The people here are so kind and sweet haven't ever really had a problem with anyone. The professors are kinds and some really do care about their students. Mostly friendly and approachable which makes it easy to be able to go to their office hours and ask for help. Really great school. It wasn't my first choice but honestly I feel like this was the right choice for me and many of my friends agree with this."
Sophomore,2,"Communication was not ideal...perhaps due to the sudden change in class structure. Hopefully this upcoming quarter, professors are more prepared for virtual coursework."
Sophomore,2,"The online experience at UCR has been subpar when compared to their superb work with on campus learning; however, the school still remains to being committed to teaching and provides students an opportunity to do so from the safety of their home."
Senior,2,"Excellent faculty. Amazing professors. Very poorly resourced institution. Other than the amazing faculty, the institution itself has no benefits. It does not provide the same resources than that of UCLA, Berkley, or other UC's. The resource inequality is strikingly evident."
Alum,2,"The school itself is really beautiful, but if you're looking for professors that actually likes teaching and are not there for research and could care less about students I would choose a different school. This may not pertain to others, but there are maybe 3 bars in the entire city and overall it is not a city. Just not a fun place to be if you like both academics and a livable city. Moving from San Diego to Riverside was a huge shock. I definitely do not recommend UC Riverside because not only of the lack of resources such as getting an internship, but not enough credibility when you graduate and have to compete with USC and UCLA kids and UCSD kids if you want to stay local."
Senior,2,"The school is very short on number of staff. Academic advisors' drop-in hours always full, an hour or longer hold on the phone with financial aid office, 30 minute wait in line at Glen Mor Starbucks, and so on. Most of the buildings are very old and their restrooms are gross. The instruments provided in physical science labs are as old as they could be in the museum. The thing that I hated the most about Riverside is that some of the classes are held at a theater in University Village, located about 10-20 minute walk from the campus, because the school doesn't have enough classrooms. Yes, a theater. I actually took philosophy and pchem lecture there. So carefully check the class time before you register. If it's at University Village in the MORNING, don't even bother. We don't have much choice when it comes to food in Riverside, unlike Irvine or LA. It's either pho, popcorn chicken, or boba. You would have more options if you drive, though."
Junior,2,"The Humanities Academic Advisors when I was a freshman did not help on giving me valuable advice on changing major. In fact, they were really discouraging. I had to do the research myself and used up a lot of time to find a different academic advisor from a different department. It really set off a really bad start for me and ruined the first half of my college experience. I recently switched majors and it is better now. The professors are not that good, since most of them have trouble speaking English in general. I believe they should not be teaching whatsoever if they can't speak English well because it impairs our understanding of the subject, especially if it is a hard course. I only had a couple of professors that I can think of that was good. The TA is not much of a difference. In fact, the TA is probably better at teaching than most of the professors here."
Sophomore,2,"The Engineering and Science colleges within the school are amazing, however, outside of the those, the school does not care much. The humanities/social science buildings are leaking, falling apart, and look like they are from the 70s."
Junior,2,"What I love about my school is how diverse the campus is. However, the professors for upper division classes are not the best at making sure the students understand material. The school is too much of a party school. There are too many drugs, parties, and alcohol. The area itself is also horrible. There are many homeless people screaming and crimes being committed on a daily basis. The campus police hardly ever catches the criminals. The environment of this school sucks. I would never suggest someone to come here unless they like to party."
Junior,2,"Only an average university. Bad location, horrible counselors and staffs. This University has nothing much to offer! And to make things worst, there isn’t a football team. I cannot believe I chose this university over NAU in Flagstaff. I highly recommend you to not go here, I’m trying to transfer myself. Just because it is diverse, doesn’t mean it’s a good thing! For example, you might have a professor with a thick accent that u can’t understand, and that’s not a good thing at all."
Freshman,2,its nice and the academics are good. the dorms are nice and arent too old or musty i like the way the clubs are oganized and all students feel welcomed and are open to try nrw htings
College Freshman,2,I am dealing with it.
College Freshman,2,"It was okay, wasn't fun though."
College Freshman,2,"I am not really into athletics. So, I didn't pay attention to it."
College Sophomore,2,"Students mainly hear only about their parties that they throw. What about their accomplishments in the differences that they are supposed to make? Too many students join only with the intention to attend parties rather than with an attitude for opportunity. Now there may be some that do make a difference but for the most part, Greek life does not put itself in a positive light for the most part"
College Sophomore,2,The student social environment makes it tough to feel motivation. There needs to be a stronger push to encourage all students to get active in programs and in the community to create a movement that could change the school atmosphere for the better. UCR makes it tough to feel at home with so many students not taking their education seriously. It needs energy for academics rather than a party attitude with nothing to really celebrate over.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is very under-emphasized.
College Junior,2,Too little jobs. Scotjob system is not effective
College Junior,2,Why do crimes literally happen across from the police station
College Junior,2,No one pays attention to them.
College Sophomore,2,I'm a part of greek life and everyone hates greek life except for the parties.
College Freshman,2,"Living in the dorms has been a terrible experience. Living in Lothian's dorm building has been a bad experience overall due to the old building and low ventilation. The building is overall dirty and very old. My building has no air conditioning in the hot riverside heat. The social atmosphere was very friendly, but the payment for the room and bad amenities was not worth the cost."
College Junior,2,People are not as friendly as I had hoped.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is quite low on most students' priorities. Not a big Greek life scene.
College Freshman,2,It's unsettling to hear about the frequency of crimes that happen around campus.
College Freshman,2,I don't think anyone here is particularly thrilled about the athletic program
College Sophomore,2,"Riverside is not really the safest area in the world. We have atleast 3 crimes on campus every week, usually at the edge of campus. I personally do feel safe on campus because I have yet to witness anything but there are always constant reports of robberies or sexual assault."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of burglaries and UCPD always sends out an email alerting students of what has happened. However, all their emails end the same way stating they are doing what they can to find the culprit but he/she is never found. It is ridiculous how many times burglaries or crimes have happened but they were not able to find the person who did it."
College Junior,2,"There are people availble at late hours to walk people back from the campus to residence halls. In spite of the aid already provided, sexual assault cases are frequent on campus. I often get text alerts informing me of a recent incident."
College Junior,2,"My first quarter, I was fortunate to have a very amicable roommatte, although, the inconveniece of such a small living space for two people created a claustrophobic environment. When she got sick, I got sick. If one of us woke, so would the other. It limited some of our liberties. Abve our dorm floor, we're constantly hear people running back and forth and stomping at odd hours in the night. Our entire floor was consistently discomforted by the unmonitored racket going on above us. Even after filing in complains and reports, there's was nothing done. The cost of living was absolutely absurd and I was forced to request a cancellation contract, and pull out two loans, just so I'd be able to stay enrolled and have a place to live meanwhile. Most of my stress first quarter was based on financial problems. I'm fortunate to have done well at all in my academics."
College Junior,2,"Inspite of the wonderful diverse environment at this campus. Through my tedious experience in trying to recieve helpful advice and resources for my educational endeavor. I was often redirected to someone who couldn't seem to help me. There is an evident lack of interest in the well-being of students on campus, and it makes it much harder for the student to adapt."
College Sophomore,2,There has been a few crimes around campus lately and I feel the local and school police lack in preventing this.
Recent Alumnus,2,Meh. It is really cliquey and only good for partying
College Sophomore,2,"Since there is no Greek housing, carpooling is suggested to parties although it is pretty far to go to these parties which can result as a dangerous thing if you are not aware or know the location to where you are going."
College Sophomore,2,"It is pretty difficult to get some of the classes you want, especially if it is a required general course. It is pretty difficult to get into the class especially if you do not have priority in signing up for classes, are not on Dean's list, or are a first/second year with one of the very last sign up dates available. Another thing that makes it more difficult to get the class is if it is only offered once a year."
College Sophomore,2,UCR is boring. If you want a real college experience go somewhere else.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am really concerned with rank, so UC Riverside hit hard when I found out that's the place I had to go. I really want to transfer and hope I can. My school does have upsides, however. It has one of the best engineering, as well as etymology departments, and some of the finest research labs. I would definitely go to a more local university if I could."
College Junior,2,Riverside is not exactly the culinary capital of California. The food choices are pretty poor around the university.
College Junior,2,The food options on campus are very limited and mostly unhealthy.
College Freshman,2,"It's a common thing for people to be doing hard drugs, like cocaine."
College Sophomore,2,The party scene at UCR is very exclusive. The Greek community is very exclusive and superficial. Usually only the greek frats throw parties that are any good and those are hard to get into mostly due to the fact that you have to know someone to get an invite/address and you need a car to get to the party.
College Junior,2,NOT open for student school hours.  Closed for when students need to eat.
College Sophomore,2,"STOCK CALL FINANCIAL AID. I had a breakdown when they wouldnt read my emails and tell me that what i was doing was wrong, that i hadn't filled out the FASFA when i know i did...its just terrible. I had to call them and they put me on hold for an hour and they approved my fin aid in a second."
College Junior,2,"If you're looking for a school with a large party scene, this is not it. Freshman year my friends and I often sat in the dorm wishing we had somewhere to go. If you don't have a car or friends with a car you are out of look."
College Freshman,2,Little to no parties unless you host one
College Junior,2,"There is never enough parking nor is it very close to campus. I park in Lot 30, and it's quite a walk...and there aren't really any other options."
College Freshman,2,"I am trying to get scholarships from universities, but i don't like being blind folded and not knowing if i am rejected or not"
College Junior,2,No one really likes the Greeks here
College Junior,2,With the situation going on right now with the UC system I can't say I'm very happy with the administration.
College Senior,2,"Most go outside of Riverside for entertainment, into Temecula or Palm Springs."
College Senior,2,Some landlords will not give you back your deposit. Lots of the apartments are not maintained even after bringing it up to landlords.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not much to do, no bars or great shopping. Must leave city to enjoy yourself"
College Sophomore,2,There are always parties at almost every apartment complex students can live in. It's very loud and goes on until dawn. The party scene does not have a positive impact on the student experience.
College Sophomore,2,"They don't give me enough financial aid even though I qualify and always don't let me know ahead of time how much money I have to pay, which puts me and my parents in a difficult situation because we can't plan ahead enough to get the  money in due time."
College Junior,2,"Student volunteers on campus are nice...  But I have a friend who was wrongly accused of sexual assault and kicked off campus.  I also have friends that reported rape and the school and Riverside PD couldn't do anything about it.  The campus police are not very friendly and wouldn't help with the investigation of a stolen PS3 and other valuables. One time we had a protest and they brought in riot police and started hitting students.  The school is still going through growing pains, learning how to handle situations."
College Sophomore,2,"Some off-campus housing is close to campus, but is inconvenient. The housing lack parking and safety."
College Sophomore,2,"Crimes, ranging from assault to theft, are prevalent. One can often find shady looking characters lingering around campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There is little to nothing of interesting things around the campus. The school is sandwiched by railroads, mountains, freeways, miles of desert, and pollution."
College Sophomore,2,It is very expensive for very little living space and very few restrooms per room.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much to do unless you have a car and are willing to drive out somewhere. People are pretty dependent on Greek life or smaller kick backs. So Cal public transportation is spotty.
College Freshman,2,"It's hard to rate this because it's college and kids should experiment with their drinking. And well, since the school is strict with freshman dorms, no one can really drink unless they're at a huge party. 

I've also never seen anyone get in trouble for holding any substance except at the concerts because people will pre game and do something stupid and get hurt."
Sophomore,1,"Professors don't care and will literally make online school impossible. Some students are trying to get them fired because they were so bad at being accommodating and only cared about their egos being hurt. They will make the tests even harder just to feel like they better than you in STEM because of their superiority complex. Cant say the same for humanities majors, those professors seem a lot more nice and caring."
Sophomore,1,School was welcome at first until you realize that later on certain professors and students have no manners. Asked a TA for help on my difficulty in class and asked whether or not I should drop. He didn't even respond at all. There are also bad incidents that occur around this area so it is also not the safest. Experience my first year was terrible and only a few people from the staff helped.
College Freshman,1,"The students involved are very picky about the people they let join. Most of the fraternities and sororities seem like cliques and not very open or receptive to people. Some of the more academic focused ones are better and more open to people, but mainly they seem like closed off communities where you have to know someone just to get in."
College Freshman,1,"Literally never go to parties here. They're all boring, the music sucks, and no one can dance on beat."
College Junior,1,All asian food. thats it.
College Junior,1,"living on campus is not that great. I moved into the best dorms on campus in my freshman year, and i lasted two weeks and had to  move out. I hated the atmosphere, made me feel lonely and out of place. Unfortunately they didn't allow me to cancel my contract so i had to pay for the dorms for the rest of the year, including my rent where i was living. 

The price for living on campus is outrages. I have been living off campus and i enjoy all of my accommodations and atmosphere."
College Junior,1,My financial aid advisor had never emailed me back even once
College Sophomore,1,"What financial aid? The school is cheap. I have applied to practically everything that I qualified for or that I earned, yet, I got nothing. They always find an excuse to deny students money."
College Freshman,1,"We go to a commuter school so I get why they don't spend a lot of money on our safety. Campus is eerily empty past 6 when students take a mass exodus back home. Riverside has a high crime rate and the school really could do more. We had two attempted abductions, but like no security cameras caught the guys doing it. They're fast about telling you about crimes, but they really don't do much."
Recent Alumnus,1,The heat during summer was awful.  Parking seems to have some kind of VIP system so most normal students had to walk to lot 30.
College Freshman,1,"If you are into the FRAT life, then this is the school for you. But this is also a school where you will never find a party on a Friday, and you will never really have a chance to have fun by yourself. "
College Junior,1,Parking at school is a nightmare! There are never any available parking spaces and the school even closed down a lot so there are fewer parking spacing and people are cramming into one. it takes around 30 mins to an hr and its just a waste of gas to keep going in circles until you find a space. On top of that you still have to walk a distance to get on campus. It is honestly the worst system in the world!
College Junior,1,I usually drive to school even though I live down the street. The parking offered by school is the worst because we pay over $100 and still have to park down the street from school. 
College Sophomore,1,"Very humid, hot, and polluted."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking can be really hard to find and it costs way to much for a parking permit about 250$ a quarter, I mostly take the bus or walk if I need to go off campus."
College Sophomore,1,Ok... Our basketball team SUCKS! BAD! Our soccer team is good. Baseball is good. We have no football team.
College Junior,1,Finding a spot near your apartment is extremely difficult during the week. Parking permits are extremely expensive and and if you forget to put your permit on they will fine you an outrageous amount even if you just got out of the car they will spot you. They should make a sticker to put on the inside of the window instead of something that you have to take off every time you drive. Parking services are unreasonable with giving out parking tickets.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is horrid. I actually live in the dorms and have a permit specifically for those who live there. The cost is way too expensive and what is even worse is that I can never or rarely find any parking spots. I sure do not get the amount I paid. For ticketing and fines, I actually do not know much since I have never received one. Except for the price, a car would be very beneficial. It would be much safer and lots of nice restaurants are all driving distances."
College Junior,1,There are pretty much NO good clubs in Riverside so people stick to frat parties which tend to be Thursday-Saturday. The parties are definitely where everyone goes to have fun.. If you want to go clubbing I'd say make the drive to OC or LA.
College Sophomore,1,It is hot year round. With like 1 week total of cold weather. Once its march or april the weather starts at 80's and just keeps going up every day.
College Freshman,1,"There is no nightlife here. If there are, it's in pretty bad parts of town."
College Sophomore,1,we get kicked out of our majors if we fail a class twice. classes or not offered year round and it is very easy to get behind in the cnas majors
College Freshman,1,Our campus is a very dry campus. No alcohol of any sort is allowed even though you're 21. Sometimes you can get away with things but most of the time people get written up if you come back to the dorms drunk and if the RA can tell. Just do not drink in the dorms or come home drunk.
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police can be strict, they are a lot of policies. Though this is probably a good thing since it ensures our safety."
College Freshman,1,"I have seen and heard of a lot of different Greek housing off campus.  I am not a big fan of the Greek life, I have not seen or heard of any Greek students who actually do something useful.  It all seems to be for being part of a popular group on campus."
College Senior,1,THERE IS NOTHING TO DO!!! This place needs an off campus hangout. A place for dancing and drinking cocktails or something. This school has absoully nothing fun going on. ever. If I had known that I would have gone somewhere else.
College Senior,1,UCR is not known for sports. the sports fields are a joke. i always walk right by them. if ucr wants me to take the sports there seriously then they should act like it. sports aren't really promoted at this school.
College Junior,1,I am paying for my college through private loans yet I get no financial aid because my parents earns a lot. However they are not going to pay for my college so its a worse case scenario for me.
College Senior,1,"They do end up giving aid, but waiting for it can be a hassel. On top of it trying to get ahold of them is like pulling teeth."
College Freshman,1,"Buses Are... Only Option. There really is no sort of transportation unless you own a car. The bus is the only other alternative unless you're willing to drop money on taxis. 
Inconvenient."
Recent Alumnus,1,"there is no middle ground – It gets up to 115 degrees between spring and fall, so get used to that, and it is so, so far away from the nearest beach. then between fall and spring it drops down to a frosty 33 degrees, so no snow, but you will be cold. Lovely, right? Riverside is right beneath some small mountains, so all of the city smog gets trapped right here on campus, and if there is a fire anywhere nearby expect ashes to rain down- it will happen. No humidity, just dry air."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This campus's hated by the ACLU, look it up – You are not allowed to sneeze without permission. For a public university, this is unacceptable."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Gets too clique-ey – When visiting other campuses, greek life includes rivalries and friendships that extend beyond apparent social boundaries- people from different organizations get invited to each other's parties, the greek community stands together and represents itself well to the school. Riverside's greek community thrives on reputations for mischief, and not even fun mischief. The greek life does not add much to the college experience that you wouldn't get otherwise. Usually it just gives you fees, suspensions, and a bad reputation."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Overpriced, Only Convenient for Getting to School, Unsafe – No variety at all; priced the same as great college towns without even being a college town; crime is rampant; neighbors are generally pleasant; no nearby shopping; university bus includes all apartments in its route, but getting further than that will cost you some walking; parking ranges from non-existent to plentiful depending on which apartments you choose; some apartments are university run and have RAs up your butt every move you make; you can score drugs from your neighbors"
College Sophomore,1,"Extreme Opposites – The first couple of months when you first come back to school it's burning hot.  You'll be in your apartment, dorm, or library 24/7 just because you NEED air conditioning to stay alive.  Same goes with the couple of months when you leave.  During the winter time, the night times and other times are freezing.  It's a desert, so you get REALLY hot or REALLY cold.  Although, there's no snow and rain isn't very frequent."
College Sophomore,1,"Infamous for Boredom – There's not much to do in Riverside.  Riverside is kind of known to be a dead place to go.  The closest attractions are at least an hour away such as disneyland, the beach, etc.  The only things here would be a drive-in movie theater that's about 25 minutes away, an all you can eat sushi buffet (Asahi) that's 20 minutes away, and Tyler mall which is 15 minutes away.  Outside of school feels pretty unsafe, so it's rare to venture around town.  Most people go home on weekends because there's not much to do.  Another frequent activity for UCR students is to hike to the ""C"" which is a large concrete ""C"" on a giant hill."
College Junior,1,"There are plenty of activity events that go on at the campus. There are also several food places to go in the area. In terms of safety however the local citizens attack students for money or their possessions. Not very safe. There are the usual attractions like in any location. Movie theater, some stores, etc. However, all the major fun stuff are always a long drive away."
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Are Party People – Greeks are into partying and that is about it, well at least that is the way it seems. Some are too tired to go to class because they are hung over, or don't even remember what happened the night before. Personally, not for me."
College Freshman,1,we have non in our campus and the school will not allow us to have one and maybe becasue we are stupid.
College Freshman,1,The weather is moody during the winters and during the days in early fall quarter and all of spring quarter it's unbearably hot.

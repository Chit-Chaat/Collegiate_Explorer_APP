Alum,5,Most people don't think much of ship until they've experienced it. I really enjoyed my time as a business student and found the faculty and students to be very open and friendly.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Ship! I met some of my best friends there who I still talk to even after graduation. The professors are some of the most caring individuals you'll ever meet, they really care about you and your future."
Freshman,5,Shippensburg has been very professional and openly communicative with the recuritng process. When I went to visit they did a outstanding job in making me feel welcome. So far i don't seek any changes.
Freshman,5,"I haven't taken no online courses. But for the orientation the professors and advisor was so friendly and professional, it felt like they knew who in was already. And i really like that alot."
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman business/accounting major. I feel that my overall experience at Shippensburg has been good. The challenges and impact of COVID-19 has effected my spring semester. I was hoping to adjust and be open to joining several clubs for the social experience. Shippensburg is in a rural area and some limited resources. I am hoping I will take my car for sophomore year to allow accessibility off campus. The college is smaller and my classes were convenient from my dorm. They have multiple resources available for education and social atmosphere. I am looking forward to returning to school in the fall and continue my education.
Niche User,5,I started my career at Shippensburg University as part of the Ship Start program and plan to continue my career there in Fall 2020. The campus is beautiful and I never felt unsafe on the campus. All of the professors I have came in contact with were welcoming and there to help me at any time. I commute to Shippensburg University every day since I only live 20 minutes away. The campus has many parking lots for commuters and they are not far away. I loved my experience as a Shippensburg student this far and cannot wait to continue my journey.
Freshman,5,"For an example, during this pandemic staff have been very cooperative. The dorms style, and campus is ideal, same with athletics."
Freshman,5,"they take your academics serious and try all they can to help you pass. they offer tons of resources for you to help with grades, health, or finding friends."
Alum,5,"Shippensburg is a great mid-sized university where students can blossom in and outside of the classroom. Currently, Shippensburg is renovating campus in all aspects from dorms, athletic centers, and classrooms."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here! I am studying Math and I love all my professors. They are very willing to help and want you to succeed! I have only been here two semesters, but I enjoy my time here very much."
Niche User,5,"Shippensburg is an amazing campus, everything about it is stunning. It really makes me feel at home. I enjoy each and every day I am on the campus. I cannot put into words how great each person that is associated with Shippensburg is."
Niche User,5,"I attend the BSW cohort program and find it to be appropriately challenging. As a non-traditional college student, the fixed schedule is great. I love the professor's,  and the connectivity woth my cohort classmates."
Freshman,5,the campus atmosphere is relaxing and inviting . the dorms are very nice and the college offers array of courses and student support.
Freshman,5,I love Ship University. The friends I have already made here are very kind and it is nice to be in a school with such wide ideals and dreams. I am excited to continue my education here.  I wish they would improve on the food side of things but overall my general experience here is everything positive.
Freshman,5,"Shippensburg is a very fun school. There is a lot of new faces and people to interact with. The professors are nice, most of the time. It is an excellent experience, especially when there is a lot to see and do."
Sophomore,5,I've been at Ship for a year now and I love everything about it. It feels like home to me. The atmosphere of campus is healthy and welcoming. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.
Junior,5,"I have visited a ton of schools since I was a junior in high school. I could not say this about the others but how welcoming Shippensburg 
University was with the students and parents and how much they really care about the community. This campus really made an impact on my decision.  I really felt like I fit in for once and I could not have made a better choice for my education. This place gives off good vibes that I didn't feel anywhere else.  I feel honored to work with an institution that really cares about the students success and future."
Freshman,5,"I have visited many times and cant wait to start my freshman year, but from the times that I have been here and what my buddies all say about things that i haven't been lucky enough to experience yet it is the place to go and it is a magical place."
Freshman,5,I am choosing to attend Shippensburg in the fall of 2019 because there is so much to do around there. There is so many outside activities you can do when its warm and all the farms there are so pretty. There is not much to do around the campus but the campus itself is amazing and gives you so many different options of things to branch out on and learn more about yourself.
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Shippensburg University. The students are willing to help, they hold the doors open for you, they'll give you directions to the stores off-campus, and tell you where to find the buildings. They are also very polite always saying thank you or you're welcome. The teachers are always willing to work with students. They'll work with the student's schedule to make sure they can get one-on-one time to work on classwork or homework. The student life is amazing, there are always things going on for students to get involved in."
Freshman,5,"All staff are very helpful and resolve issues immediately. I love the campus, its always so clean and pretty. There isn't anything wrong with the campus. The class sizes aren't large, the surrounding area is very pretty with lots of options for food and shopping."
Sophomore,5,"I am in love with Shippensburg University.  It has a beautiful campus, up to date dorms, any resource center you can think of, limitless clubs and sports, activities almost every day, and teachers that are willing to help you every day to succeed. Every teacher will schedule time outside of their office hours to help you, in addition, there are tutors available all school week and Sundays.  The health center is easily accessible and reliable and the Staff members seem to actually enjoy helping you with your classes, financial aid, housing, whatever you may need.  The staff are always a joy to talk to at Shippensburg University."
Freshman,5,It is a very welcoming environment.  They do their best to make you feel at home and run events to keep you busy.
Niche User,5,We took a very beautiful campus tour.  The tour guide was very helpful and showed us around the very nice campus.  I liked the dorms and the location and campus size was just right.  After this tour I took I am very interested in going to this college it is my first choice.
Junior,5,"I love Shippensburg University. They have an amazing Political Science and Business programs. They have an amazing Greek Life, who are always there for eachother no matter what letters you wear. The professors know you by name and will do anything to help you in whatever you do. The sports teams are also pretty well known for being a D2 school. The dorms are super nice and basically like living in an apartment! The downtown of Shippensburg goes unnoticed a lot, but they have a bunch of little shops! The off campus living is way cheaper than other state schools and it's easier to deal with private landlords instead of company realtors."
Junior,5,I love how diverse the students are. The students and professor have positive attitudes. When you go here or even visit here you feel connected to the campus and the people. This school is in a smaller town but the party scene is awesome.
Freshman,5,"It's very beautiful and the professors actually care! Whenever I've toured, the staff and students were very polite and helpful. I am so very excited to continue my schooling in SU."
Junior,5,"I love this school! Everyday there is something to do, I feel like I am living in a teen college movie. I have visited almost all of the other PA state schools to visit friends, and none compare to Ship and our parties."
Niche User,5,"I have been accepted to Shippensburg University, this was my number one choice. I loved the campus, their Education program and all the amenities. I am looking forward to exploring the campus when I move in next summer"
Freshman,5,Everyone at Ship is super nice and ready to help you when you need it. There are multiple options for food choices. Most of the class buildings are close to each other so you have time to get to each class you need to. The diversity is incredible. The dorms are super amazing. I don't think there is anything that i would want to change.
Junior,5,"The school has been great, from our visit, to move in to all of the activities to the classes and professors. There’s always something to do and someone to help."
Junior,5,"Ship is lit!!!! The cops dont care about people, the townies dont care about people either. Its like a zoo and we can do whatever."
Junior,5,"I’m a junior at Ship and I don’t think I could be happier anywhere else. It is on the smaller side of medium sized schools, but student involvment is huge. The greek presence here is huge, and practically run the school. The athletics are also good, especially for just a state school. There are parties every day of the week, day drinking everyday, wibs every night too. I feel like I am still getting a good education while still getting to party like the bigger schools do. My only complaint is that greek life needs more housing."
Sophomore,5,"There are many things I like about Shippensburg University. It has a nice sized campus, its not too big or too small. All the professors are very kind and understanding and will do anything to help you. There are many things to become involved in on campus which I also enjoy.  The food is isn't the best but it could be a lot worse. And one of the most important things to me is that I feel safe."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my university and all of its fun events, people, academics, and opportunities to thrive."
Junior,5,"As someone who grew up being homeschooled, Shippensburg University has allowed me to meet new people from different backgrounds and meet some of the greatest friends I have ever had."
Freshman,5,My experience at Ship this past year was really great. I made some new friends and had great teachers for my classes. Each one had a unique teaching style and I had some fun along the way. I would highly recommend anyone to go to Shippensburg University if they're considering on going there.
Freshman,5,"First off, the campus is absolutely gorgeous. Shippensburg University extraordinarily spacious, there are huge grass lawns scattered everywhere. The dorms are place close to food and dining halls making movement and time management that much easier. Secondly, the faculty and educators are particularly personal. They are willing to help you progress at your pace while keeping you moving with the rest of your class. The advisors are willing to spend the extra time to make sure you make the right choices in classes, and take the right classes at the right time."
Freshman,5,"Shippensburg is a great school! Most people are fairly spirited and on a normal day you will see like 60% of students wearing shippensburg apparel. The party scene is great, there are options almost everyday of the week! A lot of parties do revolve around greek life though, so if you like to party definetly go greek!"
Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and super helpful. Everyone is really friendly and the buildings are up to date.
Freshman,5,I love it at Shippensburg.  I feel like I am apart of something bigger than myself.  Everyday I feel like there is something new to do.   All the teachers are really helpful and always try and connect to the students.
Freshman,5,Shippensburg has a great community. Part of the benefit of a school like ship is that you always feel at home. It was easy to get used to living there as a freshman and it was easy to find my way around campus. One thing that could be changed is the food. A lot of the food at the dining halls is not desirable. Also it would be nice if more food at the cub was available with a meal swipe.
Junior,5,Shippensburg University is my first university college. The campus has a delightful atmosphere and is breathtaking during the fall. The students are bright and professors make it worth to attend class.
Niche User,5,A lot of my friends from High School go to Shippensburg University. I have heard very good things about this campus. I would love to go here. The students and the teachers are very kind.
Sophomore,5,I liked the academics that are being taught here and would like to see more diversity in the university.
Freshman,5,"I love Ship its such a great school, the environment is friendly and their are great resources on campus like financial aid, academic advising, health center just to name a few"
Sophomore,5,"Shippensburg University is a fantastic place to be. The University is located in the Cumberland Valley in Pennsylvania. Campus is beautiful with large areas of open fields and adirondack chairs to lounge in across campus. The University offers seven different on-campus residence halls, one traditional and six suite-style residence halls. The suit style residence halls offer various room arrangements, with a private bathroom for every two residents. Suite style residence halls have laundry on each floor, a TV lounge on each floor, study rooms on each floor, and a kitchen/game room on the ground floor. Every student at Shippensburg University has access to the ""Ship Rec"", our gym and recreational facility. The University offers many dining options such as Reisner Dining Hall, Kriner Dining Hall, Century Cafe, Papa John, SubGen, Mondo Subs, Tomato, The Test Kithchen, The Grill, Sushi Do, Chickendipity, Dunkin' Donuts, and Starbucks."
Freshman,5,Small town with plenty of surrounding entertainment locations. Campus safety and preparedness is a major plus. Professors are friendly in and out of class. Plus a Starbucks on campus!
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE Shippensburg University. The campus is beautiful and everyone you meet always has a smile on their face. Of course the cow smell can be annoying at times, but I would not trade it for the world. Of course it is college, so the classes are hard work but you should be working hard anyway. All of my professors so far have been easy to talk to and they are very flexible with schedules. And don't forget about the Starbucks on campus! It's my home away from home!"
Niche User,5,I enjoyed looking at the beautiful campus and the environment of the students. The academic programs that are located at this school are also ones that will help those undergraduates figuring out their future. 
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, campus housing is what attracted me to this school and made my freshman year 1,000 times more enjoyable. Being in an apartment type setting with 3 other girls with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a kitchen and living room was awesome. They had pretty much everything you would use off campus and it made it really easy to get together with friends and meet lots of people. The cost is a bit up there, but it is a fair trade off for everything you are getting. Since basically everyone lives in these new suite style dorms, the process is easy and it is convenient. They are right on campus and all near each other."
College Senior,5,"Depending on the sport were consider top 20 in D2, I want to say our best sport is track, volleyball, field hockey, and baseball, but make sure you research to make sure."
College Freshman,5,"The people are lively, and welcoming"
College Senior,5,Safey is very important and they school does everything in their power to keep the students and faculty safe.
College Senior,5,It was very quick and easy and if there were any complications of discrepencies with my application they called me and sorted everything out.
College Senior,5,"I've been to a few schools before attending shippensburg, and what I realized when I began attending shippensburg university was that ""it's the perfect weird little school for me""."
College Sophomore,5,There are career fairs very often.
College Sophomore,5,Made me think outside of the box more often.
College Sophomore,5,Perfect blend of work and play
College Sophomore,5,Brings people together as groups and individuals.
Alum,4,Only had one online class and it was fine. Nothing great nothing bad. I've heard from others online classes are pretty simple.
Junior,4,"The only online classes I have ever done was during the Covid19 crisis in March of 2019. The adjustment was not the best for anyone, so I feel as if I cannot judge the professors for not knowing how to complete an online class. But from my experience due to the pandemic, online classes were not terrible."
Junior,4,"I think that my favorite thing about Shippensburg is the campus and the class size. This campus is not that big, easy to navigate, and you can walk across the whole thing in about 15 minutes or less. To add, I love the class size Shippensburg has. My class size ranges from about 20-30 students per class with the exceptional big lecture classes here and there. Unfortunately, the only downfall I have with Shippensburg is the food options, yes there is plenty, however, there is not many options when it comes to name branded food areas on campus."
Freshman,4,The online classes were overall easy as long as you had your books on hand and access to Zoom. The professors provided scheduled hours that they were available for Zoom meetings the same as office hours would on campus. The responded to emails quickly and provided very detailed information on assignments.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Shippensburg was good, regardless the fact that due to COVID-19 the semester was ended quickly. The professors were easy to make relationships with and were very helpful. The food is exceptional, and the on campus store has a good variety of things. The campus provides many different types of organizations to become involved."
Junior,4,"The college was great to go to. I only went for one semester and still an on going student. The way that they handled the pandemic was smart and I'm glad they did what they did to help protect their campus full of students and faculty. I hated that we were online but it was for the best. For the fall semester, I think we should not be on campus if the cases are still increasing. Also, it would be nice if we could all get a discount for the pandemic and classes being online."
Freshman,4,"I'm an incoming Freshman.  The campus is beautiful, the food in the dining halls is great.  The open house options were so exciting.  And communications from the school have been good."
Sophomore,4,I took online classes in the second half of my second semester. It was not planned but some professors were more flexible about assignments and zoom calls. It was a little stressful because it was a lot going on with the pandemic but I was able to make it through with a great GPA.
Sophomore,4,"When I first arrived it was challenging to find friends. After a couple of weeks, I found a friend. My second semester was going to be when I branch out started doing more activities but covid-19 happened. My first semester was good but it could have been better. there were couple of racism slurs said during my first semester. I loved a lot of the classes I was taking, my advisor was amazing and very helpful. He was also my professor so I could go to him about multiple things. My campus was very open I loved that there were chairs placed outside to sit."
Freshman,4,"I just went for their Dock At Ship Day, but it was a great experience. I will be attending their this fall. The staff is very kind and helpful and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,4,"Due to Covid-19 occurring in the middle of my spring semester, I was forced to have my classes online. Although it was a very stressful transition for most students, Shippensburg University alleviated a lot of the stress. The university was willing to provide laptops and hotspots to any student that didn’t have access to them. The university was also providing lots of information regarding Covid-19, as well as updates daily regarding the transition to online courses. The professors at Shippensburg were also a big help in making this tough time not as stressful. In my experience, all of my professors were willing to provide extended time on assignments, online copies of textbooks, and any other resource a student needed. Professors also were available for their students at any time of day and any day of the week; they checked their emails regularly, answered any questions asked, and were willing to communicate via Zoom or over the phone with any student that needed extra help."
Freshman,4,"My first year attending Shippensburg University was overall very enjoyable. I love how the university gives students multiple opportunities to meet new people and lifelong friends. The university also provides students with multiple resources; anything from providing students with counselors to help them with their mental health needs, many centers for students to get tutoring help, as well as providing many opportunities for students to get internships. One thing I would like to see in the near future would be more professor office hours. Although every professor is required to have office hours throughout the week, their office hours are only a few days a week and for a very short two-hour period. Many professor I’ve had are unwilling to meet with students outside of their scheduled office hour time periods, which can cause lots of stress on students. All in all, I am very pleased with how my first year at Shippensburg University went and I can’t wait to go back in the fall."
Freshman,4,"The professors are always extremely passionate about the subjects they teach, even if it's as something as simple as a University 101 class. There are tons of opportunities for students, whether it's work, academic-related, or play."
Freshman,4,"Only one of my five classes had regular meetings, while another had weekly meetings. The remaining three classes were entirely online via the professor speaking over a PowerPoint or a video explaining a source. The workload was somewhat cut down to account for the transfer to online learning, and it was manageable."
Junior,4,I chose Shippensburg because of their accredited business school. I enjoy the classes that I am able to take and learn a lot from the material taught. The environment on campus is nice because it is calm and we are all a tight knit community. I prefer this over a large campus because I feel like nobody knows each other and I would get lost. One thing that I would change about Shippensburg is the advising availability. I ask about my Degree Audit multiple times a semester and hear different responses from different people.
Freshman,4,"Choosing a college as a senior in high school was a very hard decision for me, but I feel that I made a wonderful decision when I chose Shippensburg University. Thus far, I have loved all the professors and faculty that I have worked with at Shippensburg. They are all committed to the betterment of the students and it is obvious. The campus is its own little tight-knit community while still feeling big enough to find and be yourself. One of my favorite parts about Shippensburg is the vast opportunity to get involved in undergraduate research, which I believe is a key component for the learning process. Overall, I would recommend Shippensburg University to incoming freshman and beyond."
Junior,4,"The Grove College of Business is extremely good at this school. The staff in the business college does an incredible job of helping students to succeed as well as make connections for job prospects in the future. Like most colleges you do have your good professors and bad professors, but for the most part I've had a higher than average amount of very good professors. Can't say much for other majors within the campus, but the business college at the very least is extremely good."
Alum,4,"Shippensburg University was an excellent mid-sized university on a rural campus. Buildings were easy to get to and campus security was excellent. The class-sizes were about 30 students on average, which made for an intimate setting and enabled students to positively interact with professors."
Freshman,4,"The overall environment is very friendly and everyone is very nice. Academic wise, the professors seem to be helpful and there are many opportunities to be successful on campus."
Niche User,4,"This school has the most polite staff, and the most impressive campus i have ever seen. Highly recommend!"
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus and perfect for my dual certification major of early childhood and special education
Alum,4,One professor almost ruined my entire experience. I think professors should not have the option to single someone out and treat them unfairly. I went to the higher ups and it was handled but it should not have gotten up the point that it did.
Junior,4,"In my personal experience, Shippensburg is a great school with very kind people and excellent programs. Some of Shippensburg's programs are unfortunately small, but I'd take quality of quantity any day."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman here at Ship. So far I am pleased with my experience. I enjoy the suite style living, the small class sizes ,and the amount of clubs the school has to offer."
Sophomore,4,I love some of the professors here and the marching band is awesome. I know exactly what classes I need to take each semester.
Freshman,4,The focus at Shippensburg University is Face-to-Face interaction. Every professor I have had to date has been focused on interaction with the student. The process to schedule classes and make choices is also personal. In order to register for classes you are required to see the adviser and the adviser personally gives you a pin to access your scheduling. All the on campus groups and organizations also have a personal and welcoming touch.
Senior,4,Shippensburg University is the place where I'm not only receiving a good education but I also made life long friends. The campus life is excellent and very student first.
Freshman,4,"After going over to the campus and taking a tour through the buildings and site, I really felt comfortable in the area there. I think that the students and teachers there are very fun and pleasurable to be around with my time hanging out with them. The area where the students and I would live in is very sweet because of how much they make it look like home. Overall, I think that Ship would be a great place to be in."
Sophomore,4,The campus life is very good. The communication in the dorms could be better. The professors are easy to wok with and understanding. Parent involvement is nice.
Freshman,4,I love how everything on the campus is pretty much altogether and easy to find. Everyone on campus is very friendly and will help you with anything.
Sophomore,4,"Shippensburg University is a good campus and it has decent  professors, but it was placed in a boring town with not much to do."
Niche User,4,"I went to visit Shippensburg University this year for the exercise science program. I really enjoyed talking to the different students in that program and learning more about the jobs you can get after completing that degree. I also got to take a tour of the campus and eat in the dining hall which was mainly the only thing I wasn’t impressed with. The dining hall food wasn’t terrible but I thought it couldn’t been better. Along with that, the buildings all around campus are extremely nice and modern but the landscaping makes the campus feel very industrial. Above all, I really enjoyed this University."
Niche User,4,The campus is very nice. people are super friendly. The dorms are really nice and up dated. A lot of food options around campus and safety is a big priority.
Niche User,4,Shippensburg is a very nice university with a very nice campus. The dorms are top notch and I really enjoy the food.
Freshman,4,The price of Shippensburg University is very cheap compared to other colleges around. I work in the registrar's office and there are very nice people who I work with. I am also on the Frisbee team and it is a lot of fun.
Alum,4,"It is in a great area of the State of PA. Close to major interstates, Philadelphia, MD and mountains.  Beautiful campus, and nice little town.  Outdoor activities include hiking, biking, fishing etc. opportunities for employment while going to school.  Good social scene and plenty of academic and social organizations to join. Classroom size is small, and many upgrades to campus.  Including dining halls, lounges and student union."
Sophomore,4,Its the only place I've gone to because I procrastinated in the process of college searching. I can't say I regret procrastinating the college search because I've made a lot of good friends here and the professors are very helpful as well.
Junior,4,"School is very nice, very up to date and features many outside of class activities.  The school seems very safe.  Professors are extremely smart in the college of business."
Sophomore,4,"A great campus that is still making renovations. Professors, students, and other staff are all happy to help with anything. Very easy to communicate with. I would have given a 5 star but because I recently transferred here, I am still new and learning everything here."
Junior,4,"I like the people and some of the teachers. There are only a few things that bother me. The school is not big. The food isn't great. There is only a small town outside of the campus. Police are cracking down on parties. The campus is dry, so no alcohol allowed. The dorms are way too expensive when the off-campus housing is almost half of the on-campus price. However, the school has many accreditations. The people are great. Lots of people help with charities. We have pretty good athletics teams that consistently win."
Senior,4,Shippensburg University has great programs that fit my needs in Communications. I have found my niche in the basketball as well as in other sports leagues in the community. I am happy I chose this to be my college home and look forward to continue going here.
Senior,4,Ship has a friendly atmosphere and very welcoming to all of its students. I love meeting new people and having the opportunity to learn with them.
Senior,4,"People often say that Shippensburg University has something for everyone, and after spending 4 years on and around campus I would have to agree. With hundreds of clubs, sports teams, and constant free activities, it is truly difficult to be bored. Coupled with amazing accredited academic programs and professors with real-life experience in their respective subjects, it is easy to see that Ship is it!"
Senior,4,Shippensburg is small enough where you can get to know the community and make the school feel like home. There is a good atmosphere for learning.
Alum,4,"Shippensburg University creates a community that provides a home-away-from-home feel. It is big enough that you do not feel like you are constantly seeing the same people, but small enough that you will see a familiar face as you walk across campus. It provided me the opportunity to become an independent woman as I earned my degree."
Sophomore,4,"This school is definitely a second home to me. The residence halls are very nice and the RA's are very involved. There are many social events to go to such as movie night, bingo, skating, laser tag, and dances. The professors are very hands on, they want to see you strive for greatness and want to help you as much along the way. The only thing I would consider changing is the food, they make the best food for open house, but when all the families leave, it goes back to mediocre food. If you want a home away from home and to feel 
a part of something this is definitely the school for you."
Junior,4,"Shippensburg University is a great school to get an education. They are an accredited school for business which was a must for me. Some of my favorite classes I have taken would be Business Law, WIFYS, and Accounting. I really liked the insight Business law gave me. It made me realize that everything you do may have a consequence which is not always in your best interest."
Freshman,4,"Shippensburg is a good university, the tuition isn't too expensive and the professors are usually very nice and helpful. It's a dry campus so there aren't too many situations where the neighbors on campus are loud. The suite style dorms are wonderful because there are bathrooms for every two people to a room. There is also a police station in the middle of campus and the blue help buttons are scattered all around the side walks."
Alum,4,"The size of the school was perfect. Not too big or small. The location, however, was in an extremely rural area and I was the town was built up a little bit more to involve more community activities."
Freshman,4,The college is small yet big in learning and experiences.  I exciting about learning new things and meeting new people. I wish it was closer to home.
Senior,4,I like the variety of clubs that are on campus. There is a lot to choose from to help get you involved on campus and in volunteer work. Most of the professors are very nice and willing to work with you to help you understand the material better.
Sophomore,4,"Shippensburg University is a wonderful university! The program for those interested in becoming educators is phenomenal as well as the business programs. Students are provided with many opportunities to build partnerships with future employers and other students through internships. There are also plenty of activities for students to participate in, as well as a concert venue on campus (H Ric Luhrs PAC) which provides great entertainment year round."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Shippensburg University so far have been a really great one. There is a lot of resources on campus to help you when you need it and also the professors are great, they try to help you in any way they can. One of the great things that Shippensburg University has to offer is a class that helps you throughout your first year of college."
Sophomore,4,"I like Shippensburg best for its education. There are many clubs and organizations you can join, but the food could be way better."
Freshman,4,I like that the Professor's are very easy to talk to.  They give you positive and negative feedback and lead you in the right direction to correct the negative.  The classes are challenging but if you put 100 percent into your work you will earn  good grades.  I believe if you invest your time into your education at Shippensburg your return will be of high value in your future.
Freshman,4,"I like that Shippensburg is in a good area that gives you both a taste of country and city life with just a short drive. I enjoy the college and its professors are quite intelligent, but most of all I love the fact that I'm more than a number to them and that they truly want to see us do our very best in college."
Freshman,4,"Shippensburg University is a very friendly and challenging environment. The school itself is amazing and the so are the people there. The studies are challenging, but are rewarded with positive professors that are willing to  help."
Freshman,4,"I like the intimacy of Ship it's a very small school which I personally love. Being in a small/medium sized town you get to know a lot of people, not to the point where you know everyone and everyone knows you which is nice, but in the sense that you get to make a good amount of friends that will stick with you forever. Another aspect of Ship that I love is the housing and dining services. The dorms are extremely nice and accommodative,  and make you feel right at home which helps settle in your first year away from home. The food is amazing and you get a lot of options which is nice it's not the same food everyday, and you also have late night options for late night study sessions. If there was one thing I could change it would be to have a more diverse campus. Because Ship is a smaller school people don't really come from all over the county or world even to attend and I really wish there was a more diverse population."
Senior,4,"Shippensburg is a welcoming place. Coming from a small town, I was able to appreciate the diversity spread across campus. Within the residence halls, you build a family and notice that there are many engaging activities that include talking about diversity. They challenge everyone to face the reality of racism, privilege, and hardships that people don't necessarily want to talk about but need to if they want to experience change in this world. This was an amazing experience- if given the chance to do it again- I would continue to go to this campus forever. If you're in search of a mid-size home where you can make a difference, then Ship is the place to look into. You will not regret it."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Shippensburg has been great so far. I like how friendly everyone is on campus. The campus is very safe and protected by campus police. There are many types of dorm selections to choose from. The classrooms are nicely sized and has good professors. Also, there are plenty of resources on campus that can help you with your work. However, I say that the food on campus can improve and the prices can be lowered. Overall Shippensburg is a well built University."
Sophomore,2,"While Shippensburg's tuition is very fair for the education you are receiving and access to the updated facilities are great, the culture there is toxic. For a division 2 school, athletes are not dedicated and each sports team only has a couple of good athletes to show for, don't let recruiting fool you. If you enjoy partying and getting drunk, this is the school for you! Admittedly, nights on Richard Ave. are fun, but the culture of drinking every night causes its own set of problems. Police presence is ridiculous, and they hand out underage drinking citations like its candy. If you want alcohol poisoning, join a frat or date someone from a frat. Or hang out with the Track & Field, Lacrosse, or Swim Team. If you go here, don't let the excitement of the night life distract you from classes! But most of all, TALENTED ATHLETES & STUDENTS SHOULD NOT GO HERE."
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't really see the point in having greek life at Ship.
College Sophomore,2,"Can not be around campus if intoxicated or drinking in the dorms.  Can not park anywhere not allowed without expecting a ticket. cops are not social or talkative, mean even when just registering for parking permit."
College Sophomore,2,"Its all pretty much just pizza, bar food, and diner food. Something unique would be nice."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of ethnicities, but people tend to stay with their ""own people""."
College Freshman,2,"I'm in the school of business, but right now, I'm just taking gen-ed classes."
College Freshman,2,Teachers are selfish and think that you only have one class.
College Freshman,2,There are some study places in the dorms which is cool. The Dauphin Center is 24 hours.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing around here. I rather be home.
College Freshman,2,"I would definitely choose a different school. I would choose a bigger, more athletic, and a school with more opportunities. I would also choose one within the city."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't heard much about sexual assaults on campus, but there is a place called the ""rape steps"". The health center is pointless. They really don't know what they're talking about."
College Freshman,2,It's so hard to healthy on this campus. The food is very oily and lacks taste. Some of the food doesn't seem cooked thoroughly. The lettuce are usually shriveled or brown or a combination of both. I rather cook myself.
College Freshman,2,I understand it's a state school but I could definitely use more aid.
College Freshman,2,Summer orientation is a bad experience. Students are all over the place with questions where others do not have the answer. Then the disappoint comes when the parents wants their children to get an education here and there questions gets unanswered or the staff ignores them. I had that experience last summer.
College Freshman,2,"I didn't receive any scholarships, but I got semi-good financial aid"
College Senior,2,I have seen better days but recently the nightlife has sucked.
College Senior,2,The police are undercover racist who use our school privelge against us to take away our fun.
College Senior,2,"The cost of living is the best feature however, the nightlife and transportation needs can be improved tremendously. It would change the attitude of the student body for the better."
College Freshman,2,There are parties practically every night.
College Junior,2,You must have a 3.0 to get into the major and keep this major. The requirements are strict and they hold you to high standards as future educators.
College Sophomore,2,"The only aid I received was the worst aid possible from the government and none from the school itself. My family is literally about $200 in income above regular aid help. However, my Family is more in debt than which allows my school to be efficiently paid for. I had many expensive medical bills throughout my upper lever education from 6-12 grade and continuing. This bump in the road caused us to pay off my medical debt and overlook other debt that was racking up. As of now, our debt is high and while trying to pay off that, the school debt is an even greater challenge. It would be nice to have some help and consideration for the current situation I am in as it is not my fault."
College Senior,2,"Up in the mountains, mother nature can be harsh."
College Sophomore,2,Its a small town.  Nothing really to do.
College Sophomore,2,The system in place is very inconsistent.
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife sucks, theres never a definite party going down and when something big is going down the cops shut it down right away."
College Freshman,2,"Few good places to eat off campus, just mostly fast food."
College Freshman,2,Only way to really get around is by walking or driving yourself
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really to do outside of campus.
College Freshman,2,"The financial process if very stressful, especially if you don't complete it on time or right away because you won't be offered much money or you'll have to take out loans. Getting scholarships at Shippensburg is somewhat difficult since there is no application you can turn in; officials will look at your grades or scores from high school and see if you qualify for any scholarships offered at the university."
College Sophomore,2,"I applied for a lot of scholarships and did not receive close to what I need to make it through school. I am still applying for scholarships, as I struggle to pay for school. "
College Freshman,2,"Way too uptight, I thought I'd have more freedoms."
College Freshman,2,"A large majority of the kids smoke marijuana. If they're not doing drugs, they are drinking. Shippensburg is notorious for partying. "
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process was fairly easy at Shippensburg. The best way to receive aid and to resolve any questions is by contacting your school, or by talking to a counselor. "
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus dining mainly consists of fast food and small diners. The diners are decent, however."
College Freshman,2,The Greek life is kind of a joke. They take themselves way too seriously and the houses are disgusting. 
College Freshman,2,"Campus life is okay. My dorm is very tiny and I live in one of the oldest halls. However, the people in my hall make living there better. "
College Freshman,2,The town is rather small and boring. There is not much to do on weekends and there are mainly thrift shops and small restaurants. 
College Freshman,2,"The only sports that attract above average attention is football and rugby. Fan support for the football is very apparent. Students and family represent wearing school merchandise and cheer for the team. The rugby team doesn't receive that much attention, but is one of the best teams in the nation. The rec center includes basketball, racquetball, an indoor track, and a weight room. The weigh room is very small, but accommodates a fair amount of students."
College Freshman,2,"There's not much crime on-campus. Most crimes are juvenile, such as stealing flags or small vandalization. Walking across campus alone is not a problem due to the size of the campus. Throughout campus there are several emergency buttons that can be pressed that will sound an alarm and attract attention. Most campus police travel off-campus and patrol up and down the party streets."
College Freshman,2,"The arts and architecture of the school are very limited. The rec center has a large 4 court, basketball court. The weight room is very small. There are plenty of campus events located in the student center. The student center has a dining hall, snack shop, a game zone that includes pool, ping pong, and air hockey, and there is a quiet TV lounge."
College Freshman,2,"The new suite style halls are very nice, but are designed very poorly. Second floor stairs are located right next to elevator, which is pointless. Social interaction in suites seem nonexistent. Suite style is a more homely living feel, but the price difference from traditional is just too much. Laundry isn't very expensive, but size is small, so more loads are required. Wi-Fi is very poor, cuts out very often. Most dorms are located right next to each other, so traveling to class is equal distance. The housing process is very basic, first come first served basis"
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of places to eat ON-campus so not many students feel the need to travel off-campus. However, there are various places to eat off-campus. There's minimal restaurants, but fast food joints and snack places are not far from campus."
College Freshman,2,Most students fairly same background. Some unique individuals.
College Freshman,2,On-campus students fairly quiet. Quiet college town
College Freshman,2,A big hassle. Very long process. Got expected aid.
College Junior,2,Only certain major groups to be a part of. Kind of like High school.
College Junior,2,It's a dry campus and police are constantly a pest.
College Junior,2,"The police force aren't anal about the guidelines of underage drinking unless you are bringing a lot of unwanted attention to yourself by stumbling, excessive noise, or destroying property. Besides people who might endanger themselves or others, the cops don't bother you that much. But they do have a prejudice against drivers and will give you a ticket for anything and everything."
College Sophomore,2,I don't pay attention for this. I don't care about how good our teams are.
College Sophomore,2,There is a mall with a movie theater in Chambersburg. It is a small town.
College Sophomore,2,"Most classes require you to do volunteer, or outside arrive work. If you don't drive and have a car, you may struggle to meet class requirements, and may be forced to withdraw from the class. Avalible public transpiration is scarce, and does not really meet the student's needs."
College Sophomore,2,In the social work classes there are very few men in the field then women. The ratio is this particular course of study is about every 7 girls to 1 boy.
College Sophomore,2,Not much student life in buildings. The bathroom facilities are low quality.
College Freshman,2,Everyone get along for the most part but some people are just weird
College Freshman,2,The greek life is boring. It supposed to be an organization where you reach out to indiviuals and help them as a group. They arent really together they rarely throw parties. They don't take it as serious as they should especially at Shippensburg
College Senior,2,"not good variety, bad hours (close early), expensive"
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few labs in various buildings around campus but not all labs can be accessed by all students. The main spot for computer usage is the library and even there the amount of computers seems very slim compared to the amount of students who need to use them. 

The system itself is very slow and it takes forever to log on and to load programs and web pages."
College Freshman,2,"The storage lots that first year students need to park in are a good 5 min walk from the nearest dorm... assuming that's your dorm... and in pouring rain, it sucks haha"
College Freshman,2,The process was slow. I was on my own with little help from the university.
College Junior,2,There's a lot of off campus parties & if you have a car there's stuff in Harrisburg and chambersburg
Junior,1,"I would have liked if the professors were more acceptable of our online situation when classes went online because I had many issues online. And my two professors did not even care that I had to work still and if my internet went out. Also, my one professor added a new system onto the syllabus so we had to learn a whole new website instead of introducing it in class at the beginning of the semester instead of throwing it into our face while we were already struggling with the transfer of classes going online."
Sophomore,1,"Terrible financial aid, will not help assist you in getting help. I had financial issues and they still refused to help me. Now have to find a way to pay thousands before doing rotc for this school. Don’t know how I will pay for it or where I wi
ll even sleep or eat there."
Sophomore,1,"Don’t go here.

When I first arrived at Shippensburg for my orientation, they made everything appear to be a lot better than it actually is. For one, Shippensburg University leads the entire country, yes the entire COUNTRY, in student arrests/criminal activity in relation to student entrollment size. This is absolutely ridiculous and should not be the case. I have been to other colleges where the drinking, drug use, and actual crime is much, much higher than it is here. The police around campus are out to get students, and they are in it for making money for their department. They are disrespectful and offer no real help to the students. All they care about is busting kids for smoking weed and drinking."
Freshman,1,Pick another school!!!! Everything is a joke from the frats all they way to administration. Majority of kids who go here are fake and are either high or drunk. Not a place to excel academically. Frat parties are fun the first 2 times then it’s a repeat of the same music and people. High crime with a police department that doesn’t care about solving them. This school is only good if you need to propel yourself to a certain GPA to get out of this STD riddled school.
College Freshman,1,"I'm used to late night food. The only option that is 24/7 is Sheetz and it's so unhealthy, and walking there at night and in the cold is the worst. The food just like the food at the school just with a better taste."
College Freshman,1,I am not part of it. It has no baring on me
College Junior,1,I have not received any financial aid since I was a transfer student. It is also hard to get scholarships unless you are an A+ student or if your family is in the poverty category.
College Freshman,1,"I hate my dorm (Naugle) it's the absolute worst. The bathrooms are completely gross, not that the staff doesn't take their time cleaning it everyday but the people here just have no home training; which is crazy since the girls' bathroom from what I hear is the worst. & my dorm doesn't offer air conditioning or the ability to move the furniture around if we wanted to."
College Freshman,1,It is generally very cold since we're up near the mountains. I'm not used to the harsh climate but you become used to it.
College Freshman,1,The food on campus is nasty! We pay amounts of money to go here and the food is disgusting
College Junior,1,"There is parking on campus but the cost of a parking permit it $67 per year. For this 67 dollars, there aren't many commuter spots and those that are available are on the outskirts of campus and not close to academic buildings. There are many faculty and staff parking close to campus. There has been construction on campus and so the commuter and resident spots have been taken away and they've given more faculty staff parking. It can be very frustrating trying to find a spot."
College Senior,1,Diverse school surrounded by a narrow minded community
College Junior,1,Nothin to Do around here at all! Chambersburg and Harrisburg are we're you go to watch movies and stuff
College Senior,1,Shuttle service is very unreliable. They do not follow the pickup schedule that is posted.
College Freshman,1,"If you are an incoming freshman and plan to bring your car to campus, you are forced to park in one of the two storage lots. These lots are located far from the dorms and are notorious for causing damage to your car. They are not monitored for safety and are on the outskirts of the campus, making them kind of unaccessible. If you are an upperclassman then you can park in any of the commuter or resident lots that are located outside the dormitories and class buildings. However because this is a relatively small campus, there is no need to drive between classes, making those lots kind of impractical,"
College Sophomore,1,"Whoever said this school is a party school must be living in the past or under a rock. I have been to every single spot in Shippensburg, from Creekside, to Frat Row, to Bard, you name it and they are all ass. No one dances, kegs kick at 11:30 and they all get busted.  Two years ago this may have been a party school but not now."
College Freshman,1,"Very Unhelpful – The employees of the financial aid office offer little to no help to students and are very rude when you go in or call to ask them questions. If you email them, it could take weeks to get a reply."
College Sophomore,1,"The commuter parking at Shippensburg is pathetic.  There is one huge lot on the far end of campus.  It is often cut in half because of events happening at the Luhrs Center across the road, or other events that need parking.  They block off the closest end of the lot, so students are jamming into this lot and walking very far to class.  There are a few other parking lots for commuters on campus, but all have 30 or under spaces, and are always full.  Not to mention the tiny spaces - I was T-boned in the parking lot because of how tight it is.  Poor visibility and not enough room."
College Freshman,1,"Bring an umbrella. It rains about 75% of the time here (especially during the spring and fall) but when it isn't raining, it is absolutely gorgeous here!"
College Freshman,1,"Drugs Are Everywhere – I can smell weed in my residence hall. There are drunks everywhere. The RAs do not crack down on the intoxicated, even if they are causing a scene."

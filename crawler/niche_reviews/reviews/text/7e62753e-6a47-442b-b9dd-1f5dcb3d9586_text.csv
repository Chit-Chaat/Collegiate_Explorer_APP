Niche User,5,"The people and professors are beyond nice and helpful to my family and I when we visited. The counselors gave us all the information we needed and more. It’s a great class and campus size, so what’s not to love?"
Sophomore,5,UDM has amazing academic programs and sets students up with many opportunities. Their smaller campus size is perfect for those who like close communities.
Junior,5,"Something I liked about the University of Detroit Mercy is that its a private school that holds its mercy values and is authentic and welcoming to everyone. The staff, the people, and the environment here is amazing and very comforting the campus makes you feel like you're at home making it very easy to call this place home."
Alum,5,Great school with a rich history. It is a beautiful and safe campus. Calihan Hall is a gem. The professors are approachable and truly care about your education. Where I work there is a lot of fellow alumni. All earn great salaries and are usually in management. The place will exceed your expectations if you give it a chance.
Niche User,5,"I love the small campus, with D1 athletics, great academic programs, and a lot of activities to do on campus."
Freshman,5,"it was very nice, safe, and big  when i went for a summer program. I can imagine myself there everyone was very welcoming and respectful. The campus was beautiful the college offers the majors i want which are law and dentistry which i remain undecided on which."
Junior,5,"From my experience at UDM, i can say that this is a great school for undergrad science majors especially chemistry, biochemistry , nursing and other pre-health and pre-medical programs.  All my liberal arts classes have been great as well.  It gets quiet here on the weekends.  This is NOT a party school.  most people here take their academics pretty seriously.  
The engineering and architecture departments have strong reputations also, although I do not have personal experience with them"
Freshman,5,I like the teachers and the Direct Admit Nursing program! There are a lot of opportunities for help like tutoring and there are a lot of events with free food
Junior,5,I am a graduate student from Wayne county community college. I am going to attend this university in the fall. As of now since the orientation i can say that this is a great Schol. The staff is very helpful.
Freshman,5,My experience at Detroit Mercy was excellent. The student leaders were very kind to me as well as everyone else they met and the advisors were very helpful and honest with us about what to expect at college
Freshman,5,"While visiting the campus of University of Detroit Mercy I quickly realized this was the university for me. The students are very welcoming and helpful. Additionally, Detroit Mercy is a diverse university; and being a Muslim woman that is very comforting."
Freshman,5,"Detroit mercy is a really great school to attend. I really love how close everybody is and how the classes size are small. Having small class sizes allows you to have a one on one conversation with the professor. Most likely, the professor will know your name. Everybody here is so friendly. You do not have to worry about if you will fit in or not. It is easy to make friends here. This is why University of Detroit mercy is a great school to attend."
Niche User,5,They are known for their great programs and academics. They have a very pretty and well put together campus that is small but very roomy. Overall they have a great environment that they have created. Great for people who want to go into certain fields or for kids who want a more one on one with the teachers. Outstanding in their ability to help and have the resources that students need to be successful with whatever they choose to go into.
Freshman,5,I love it. The professor really want to make sure you succeed. The class rooms are small so it’s more one on one learning.
Senior,5,"My experience at Detroit Mercy has been amazing. I got directly admitted to the traditional BSN program my senior year of high school and is on track to graduate next spring! Detroit Mercy helped me find my goals and dreams. Coming to this school, I found my priorities, my mentor and people to support me. I got accepted into a research program which allowed me to get my tuition paid for and a monthly stipend so I wouldn't have to work part-time and I can just focus solely on my school work. Because of the opportunities I have received at Detroit Mercy, I am pursuing a doctoral degree right after my graduation. I never once thought I could become a doctor in high school. I love my school and after my graduate from my doctorates I plan to become a professor to give back to the school and to teach future generations. All the professors are wonderful here. You get to know your professors and they get to know you."
Graduate Student,5,"Wonderful staff, university highly accommodating. Whether your on campus or online everything is easily navigated. Courses and curriculum very challenging and highly accredited."
Senior,5,It is a great school. Professors care about the students. Students are treated like a family. Very diverse school and everyone is treated equally
Graduate Student,5,"University of Detroit Mercy is an excellent private university, providing great education with a focus on community outreach. The university has an established reputation in Michigan and is part of the Jesuit Universities giving it's students unparalleled exposure to many national and international institutions."
Senior,5,Great & Respected College for those looking to get a good job. Very diverse and challenging for those over achieving students such as myself.
Sophomore,5,"Detroit Mercy has such amazing professors who love to see students succeed and excel. I am proud to be a Detroit Mercy Titan and it has great majors to offer as well as outstanding graduate programs. I feel they could change the way recitations are run in terms of organization, other than that it is amazing!"
Junior,5,"Detroit is such a beautiful city! The people are so friendly and it's a very safe place. It's so safe, most people don't even lock their doors. What a wonderful city!! I would like to see the sports teams do better than what they are producing !"
Freshman,5,"Definitely a family atmosphere here! While the academics are challenging, I feel more than prepared to join the workforce right out of college. The internship program here is really strong and the staff really do care about seeing you succeed. My advisor will randomly send me internship opportunities when she comes across one that she thinks I might enjoy which goes to show how the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home here. So glad I went with a smaller college, it has the student scene still just without the excessive drama."
Junior,5,I am very happy with my education at University of Detroit. The instructors and professors are knowledgeable and engaging. The only thing I would like to see changed is lowering the cost of tuition.
Freshman,5,"Since attending the University of Detroit Mercy I have seen impeccable self-growth. I have become way more independent. UDM is definitely what helped me transition from teen to adult.  In addition to that, UDM offers top notch courses with well-educated professors. Because of the small class sizes you are able to leave a lasting impression on professors who genuinely care about you."
Senior,5,"I like the diversity at the University.  I like the interaction with my peers.  Learning about their backgrounds, heritage, economical status and beliefs.  I feel safe and the atmosphere is religious base."
Freshman,5,"Great University to obtain a degree and prepare you for your next steps to your career pathway.  Great leadership, role models and academics programs."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience here has been amazing! 
The classes are interesting and just challenging enough to the point where I have to work hard, but not so challenging that they're impossible to keep up with in addition to my life. 
The campus, while small, is very nice, with a fitness center available to all students and a library including a cafe."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus size and its staff. Also all of the old buildings and how your classes dont have to be all over the place they could all be in one building. Another thing I like is the care from the staff and how they want you to join the mercy community. The dorms are also so close to the classes that you could get to class in 10 minutes which is awesome.
Sophomore,5,"I liked that everyone is there to help. The professors and staff there are willing to do anything to help you, all you have to do is ask."
Niche User,5,I took a visit/ tour at Mercy to decide if the environment was for me. I really liked the scenery and I felt at home. They took us to the dorms which only made me more excited for my future.
Junior,5,The professors are all very nice and helpful! The staff and administrators are always here to help and they do not make you feel dumb or silly. The campus is beautiful and they keep the grounds very nice. There is always an event or activity on campus that you can participate in! Student life is very fun and they try to make activities and events fun!
Sophomore,5,"University of Detroit Mercy has been a great academic experience for me so far. The faculty really know their stuff and make learning more interactive and fun, engaging you in lectures and the homework. Not only that, but I feel as if I am receiving the best education possible and being well prepared to become a nurse."
Sophomore,5,I must say that I really did enjoy my freshman year more than I ever thought that I would. I like the school settings as they are quiet and the professors really allow for us to get involved in all of my classes so far. I am going to have a great second year here at the University and continue to pursue my academic goals throughout my college years.
Sophomore,5,Being on Detroit Mercy's campus was an amazing experience for me. I met a lot of great people. What i love about the campus is the beautiful scenery and landscaping. It is so nice to take a walk at night and just look at all the beautiful buildings and nature.
Junior,5,This is by far one of the best universities in all of Michigan. The faculty and staff are very welcoming and work with their students to reach success. For anyone looking for a great education filled with amazing oppurtunities I highly recommend Detroit Mercy!
Alum,5,The best thing UDM had to offer me as a student was the small classroom sizes. Academics were focused on each individual in the class and you were able to communicate effectively with the other students in the class to help each other understand and learn.
Senior,5,"The University of Detroit Mercy has helped me build a great foundation for a bright future.  At Detroit Mercy, the academics are very effective.  Most of the professors have their doctorate and take their course very seriously.  At the Detroit Mercy you will not slide by without a breeze; it is tough, and prepares you to be a leader in today's world. "
College Freshman,5,The reason I wen to UDM is because it is so well known for PA school.
College Senior,5,I'm graduating making 6 figs
College Sophomore,5,BETTER THAN THE DORMS. COST LESS TOO!
College Sophomore,5,Ladies in financial aid are super helpful and work with you to figure stuff out
College Sophomore,5,I love living on campus & would not have it any other way.
College Freshman,5,It is extremely diverse and everyone accepts it.
College Student,5,Easy to find a spot
College Student,5,"The one on one from the professors, they're more like friends."
College Student,5,We have many computers on campus!
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy being in the mechanical engineering program. I like the ratio of kids to professor and the study groups. The facilities are clean and great to work in. The curriculum is rigorous, but fun. There are opportunities to work on campus. Finally, there are excellent internship opportunities with local companies in Michigan."
College Sophomore,5,"I will starting my third internship this May. The first one I achieved on my own. The second was through the school and submitting my resume. I guess they like me enough that they wanted me back again. So, I will be interning with the automaker as my third internship. Pay is reasonable and has increased with every internship. A typical work week was around 40 hours. Some of my responsibilities were performing tests, working with build shops and labs, collecting data, and creating reports. I enjoyed working with the people in the industry. My coworkers and managment were very friendly and helpful. There are no complaints on my end."
College Sophomore,5,"I was able to get in touch with the director of admissions for my program and she basically took care of everything for me. I interviewed, and the next day I received a phone call letting me know I had been accepted."
College Sophomore,5,i love detroit and it is at the heart of the city
College Student,5,I love being a nursing major. It is tough. I work hard and my life is dedicated to nursing school. I know all this hard work will pay off.
College Student,5,Everyone is very accepting and i have not faced any issues with campus diversity
College Junior,5,"Detroit definitely has its problems, but it is an awesome city.  I love it!"
College Junior,5,"The best thing about my major, is the advisers are so attentive, and are able to answer your questions.  I love my academic adviser."
College Senior,5,"As a member of the Greek community I am biased, but Greek life is awesome on our campus. There very few organizations but those who do join do not regret the decision at all. Most sororities are easy to get into but the fraternities have longer education processes and therefore require a greater amount of commitment. The downside is that although campus refuses to help with off-campus safety issues, they are constantly interfering with Greek life off-campus."
College Senior,5,Academics are a huge priority for most students. The programs offered are highly rated as well.
College Senior,5,"There are plenty of options for nightlife. Bars, clubs, and casinos are located directly within the city and the outlying cities have a wide variety of entertainment venues. Downtown is by far the best place for a good time though."
College Sophomore,5,University of Detroit Mercy has amazing programs that are offered at off-campus sites making it so convenient for those who would have a long commute to the main campus. 
College Sophomore,5,The campus has tons of events that happen all the time... you are never bored and if you want to get involved there is always plenty of options.
College Freshman,5,It's the top one and only in the nation.
Sophomore,4,"In the first months of moving to online classes, it was very difficult to keep up with the teachers but yet they were flexible with us along the way. they way teachers had their own way of giving out notes was confusing and not that much effective but we had our ways of learning. Overall, online learning got better as the months passed by and it was stressful."
Sophomore,4,"My experience attending the University of Detroit Mercy was a good one. Despite the long nights and studying, it had helped me be a better person along the way. The professors, students and workers made it a lot easier for me to get used to college. It was a struggle in the first semester, but in the second it got easier. The resources that they had, extracurricular, events, clubs, organizations,  and research opportunities were great to have whenever you want to do something new. Overall, it is a pretty good school to attend, despite the lack of effort they put into their food and, it was a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"Over the past year that I have been at the University of Detroit Mercy has been quite an experience and I saw that for various reasons, the first is going to a college for the first time is at times a rough transition but UDM helped a lot with adjusting to the new life"
Sophomore,4,"There are several i enjoyed but also disliked about the online learning experience from UDM. The reason that I enjoyed was that the professors put in the effort to help the students learn and excel. The thing that I didn't enjoy was that I'm a visual learner, I have ADHD and I need to see things in person"
Junior,4,"I have had a pleasurable experience with this institution. There were some aspects I would improve. First, this is a private institution and the tuition is extremely high for my family. Second, the food and workers should be improved with their quality and effectiveness. Third, the campus lacks student life and activities for students to enjoy. Last, the housing could be improved by quality. Aside from that, professors and education is great since the class sizes are small and personal."
Niche User,4,"The University of Detroit Mercy is a very good school to attend. The classes are small, meaning you have a better opportunity to connect with your teachers and classmates. The campus is safe and everything is close to the dorms."
Freshman,4,Detroit Mercy is a great school for people looking for small class sizes and individualized attention! Go Titans!
Sophomore,4,"I love that U of D is such a small school and such a tight knit community. There are many things we don’t have compared to the larger universities, but what you won’t get there, you’ll find here. Like small intimate classes, professors who truly care for and are invested in their student’s lives, and unique area to live and work in."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, Detroit Mercy is great. They have a few downfalls, like COE, and building upkeep. Other than that, professors are great, and the curriculum is on point."
Senior,4,"I have been a student at UDM for four years now. Given its small size, the experience you get from campus life is really what you make it. The academics are great. I would like to see a change in the organization of several departments within the school, such as financial aid."
Sophomore,4,Enjoy the academics very much. I have had a good experience will all my professors! I like the smaller setting because it is more personal with classmates and professors. The food is about average but not much on campus. The buildings and dorms are older but the campuses fine.
Freshman,4,"The campus itself, is beautiful. The buildings hold so much history, and many of the graduate buildings house architectural features that you just cab't find anymore. Detroit Mercy  has the best professors known to man, and they go beyond what hey are paid to do to ensure that you understand what they are trying to teach, and they just happen to be your biggest supporters other than the friends you make. Everyone here is friendly. You don't have to be shy to say ""hello"" or even ask for help. The tuition is a pretty penny, but you pay for quality, and not quantity. You are not a number here."
Freshman,4,"I have just completed my first semester at the University of Detroit Mercy in their 5 year Physician Assistant program. Within this first semester, I have come to love their strong academics. This schools teaches students to strive from greatness while also guiding them with many resources such as writing center and the student success center. This University offers many clubs and sports for students to participate in as well as financial aid packages to make paying for this university that much easier. Professors are always willing to help during office hours or during class and this aids in the success of their students. I would recommend this university to many students looking for a great academic and social balance."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have to say that my experience at Detroit mercy is pretty Good. EDUCATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! There are many professors here who enjoy their jobs and it definitely shows. Do not come to Detroit mercy expecting there to be parties every night. This school is not a party school."
Alum,4,"UDM is a good school but they claim that they are Catholic and are falling away from that a little bit. The education is great though and the community, fact that it's a small campus makes classes small and your professors actually know you."
Senior,4,"I am a current student at University of Detroit Mercy. I am in an excellent program,  Health Information Management. I have learned so much, and they even offer online classes. Because it is a private college, they are expensive. One of my classes require five books total. That is a bit much to ask when a student is taking between four to six classes a semester. My overall experience is good, at a expensive price."
Sophomore,4,"As an international student on a vigorous path towards dentistry, University of Detroit Mercy has been very kind in easing my adjustment in a new environment. The teachers are wonderful and very helpful."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the size of the campus. I am terrified of big schools so this is perfect! The school is diverse, you do not have to be of a specific religion to attend. Being a nursing student one of the first classes I took we discussed our school, and its mission. I found this to be very neat, because now I can tell others more about my school."
Sophomore,4,My experience here at the University of Detroit Mercy is very comfortable. It is easy for me to get around campus and seek help when I'm struggling in my classes. Being able to talk to my professors one on one and asking questions in class is the best part because the class sizes are similar to what my high school experience was like. GO TITANS!
Freshman,4,"Choosing the University of Detroit Mercy was one of the best decisions I've made. I personally think I wouldn't have fit in anywhere else. The professors are all great and really love getting to know you. The class sizes are reasonably sized (depending on the course). I am a commuting student, so obviously the drive there is frustrating if you live outside of the city. Also, I would love to see some of the buildings get remodeled. Most of the buildings are great, but some look like they need some keeping up. Other than that, I wouldn't complain about anything else. The staff here is wonderfull. They are always smiling and seem like they love it there. It is a very diverse school, so I love the culture that comes along with it. Overall, I think it's a great school and recommend it to just about anyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love the student to faculty ratio. I never see any new faces on campus, and everyone is alway ready to help. If this is someone who wants to go to college to have fun, this may not be the right school for them. The diversity is great. Although we do not have a football team, we are still a D1 school and the basketball games are our version of a big school's football games. I sometimes wish we had better professors for certain subjects, but that will be the case for the majority of schools."
Sophomore,4,I love the small campus feel. Most professors truly care about your grade and will help you succeed.
Freshman,4,"I knew that Detroit Mercy would be my best choice because of the beautiful, safe campus, small class sizes and great professors and faculty. They all make sure that we get the proper help we need. Unlike students at big colleges, I'm able to know and talk to my professor personally. While I have had good times at Detroit Mercy my freshman year, I do wish that there were more activities on the weekends for the students to do considering a lot of us live on campus. Other than that I truly am happy I chose Detroit Mercy."
Junior,4,"The University of Detroit Mercy has helped me build a great foundation for a bright future. At Detroit Mercy, the academics are very effective. Many of the professors are doctorates themselves and have a strong understanding of their field. I have yet to have a bad Prof in my time at Detroit mercy. The student life is good and offers many perks. Do not expect a party school though.  "
College Sophomore,4,It has been a positive experience thus far. The professors engage and clarify key topic areas with ease and take the time to address students' questions and concerns that arise.
College Freshman,4,"The university goes out of its way to ensure that all students feel safe while on campus while not being to intrusive in students daily lives. They have gone as far to say that so long as you are on campus you are safe, to which I believe for the most part believe. But it still remains to be seen how they actually handle a crisis."
College Freshman,4,Public safety is very proactive about safety.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is the perfect way to get involved on campus.
College Freshman,4,I am not very into sports but other people seem to enjoy them on campus.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great and I love the small class environment
College Senior,4,Not perfect but gives you the means
College Freshman,4,The fact that my school is private and small makes it great. I enjoy the fact that everyone could possibly end up knowing everyone if they really tried. I like that the smallest class size only reaches up to 35 students.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of job-fairs for not a lot of students. This means that internships are not nearly as competitive as they are at big state schools. There are always employment opportunities being advertised to students to apply to.
College Junior,4,"The program I'm in is extremely rigorous and demands a really high GPA requirement. That said, time management became a huge part of my life and I still managed to excel academically and socially."
College Junior,4,Campus is extremely safe especially with the Department of Public Safety which is basically UDM's own police force which is also easily accessible 24 hours a day.
College Junior,4,"It is what you make of it. The food might suck, but the academic and social success I found in my first year easily tops what most of my friends at big state schools found their first year."
College Freshman,4,I wasn't into sports but my  friends were. We went to championships in several sports.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of opportunities for students
College Freshman,4,"Class size is great, professors vary"
College Freshman,4,There are not a lot of Greek Life options
College Freshman,4,There could be a better turnout for outdoor sports
College Freshman,4,The people in my program help each other to succeed
College Junior,4,Employers tend to fight over University of Detroit graduates.
College Junior,4,I enjoy attending such a well known private school.
College Junior,4,The student safety department is a huge thing at UDM they have a gated campus with cards needed for entry.
College Freshman,4,Very safe! UDM is a gated campus and 5 officers are always patrolling the campus.
College Freshman,4,UDM has a huge variety of classes and professors are very nice. I would recommend looking up the professor before you register for their class. The teachers here are all friendly and want to know you and talk to you. They are very nice and helpful. Most of the classes are every other day. Unless you live in the dorms do not take classes that are later than 5pm. I highly suggest you go to every class and take good notes. Because missing a day in class messes up everything.
College Freshman,4,"University of Detroit is a very small school with a ratio of 12 students to 1 teacher which I love. My biggest class is 50 people. The professors get to know you and there office hours are very helpful. It is also direct admission so everyone is accepted into the program of their interests without having to wait until they fulfill their perquisites to apply. I am already in the nursing program and will be graduate in 4 years compared to other schools is takes 5 years. Their health majors are excellent. But everyone has 5 to 7 classes. To other colleges it is a lot, but it is definitely manageable."
College Freshman,4,There are great internship opportunities.  The percentage of receiving a job after graduation is also very high.
College Freshman,4,It is a great school academically.  Although I do wish that there was more to do on campus.  It is small so it is easy to receive great opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy coming to UDM. It's a small campus which allows you to know the names and faces of a lot of people. In my opinion, I think that it's a good thing that you know a lot of people on campus because there are many connections. Plus, you get closer with the same people over the years."
College Sophomore,4,"The Fitness Center at University of Detroit Mercy is amazing.  It is only a couple of years old and has been upheld very nicely by the staff.  It does not matter if you are an athlete or not, anyone can use the Fitness Center.  The equipment is very nice and kept clean and the track is organized so that people at all paces can enjoy it.  The Fitness Center is one of my favorite parts of the campus for sure."
College Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Detroit Mercy. Law school is tough, but this school has made it possible for me to succeed."
Recent Alumnus,4,"After graduating from UDM, most employers have heard of the institution and know that you received a great education."
Recent Alumnus,4,Professors are collegial and professionals in their areas of study. The class sizes are terrific; and they permit individualized attention.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors and instructors really adhere to the University's motto: ""We want great things for you!"" They not only want to succeed in the classroom, but also in life."
College Senior,4,"Being a law student is hard work. If it were easy, I'd be nervous about the quality of education I was receiving. Most importantly though, law school is what you put into it. I have worked very hard at UDM Law, and I have great grades, experiences, and connections to show for it. If you want a great place to study, pick a quiet corner in the library, or walk down the street to Starbucks and drink a cup of coffee. Professors often hold office hours, and I have found them accessible and helpful. The practicing-attorney professors are a bit more elusive, but they have their phones on them constantly and respond quickly."
College Senior,4,"It has been a great school for me. With small classes, I feel professors have time for my questions. The workload is intense, but it should be--it's law school after all. For the most part, professors want students to perform well."
College Senior,4,"Being in downtown Detroit, the UDM Law campus has to be vigilant, especially at night. But in my three years there, I have never experienced or heard of anyone experiencing a problem. We have great security guards who look after us and our cars. I don't worry about my safety on campus at all."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is really nice! Some of the staff can be a little busy and nothing gets done over the phone. Majority of the time you must go to the actual campus to get your questions answered.
Sophomore,2,"Cant say I like it. Many science classes are only offered once a year, and so you cant retake any in the summer if need be. Many science classes take place during a certain time of the day, so if you sway off of your academic path (like how I learned lots of college credits in highscool) you'll have to FrankStein class schedules every year.

Many departments only have a few professors, so if you have issues with a certain teacher you are stuck with them. 

Even though I am a STEM student and I have over a year's worth of liberal arts classes.

Instead of rebuilding the old dorms, they are taking down the advisors building to make a lounge for students. How nice. Too bad you wont be able to sleep in there when your dorm is either burning or freezing. 

This school is way too expensive for low quality junk."
Alum,2,"Detroit Mercy is not a college everyone would enjoy. You don't get the average college experience. It's a commuter school mostly, living on campus is extremely boring and very expensive."
Senior,2,The school is small and not in the best location for walking around. Most of the professors are not engaging and the students do not apply themselves.
Sophomore,2,"Their is not a great variety of clubs/activities. A few fantastic professors, others have not been very effective."
College Junior,2,Sporting events are seldom attended by students. The teams tend to do pretty well in competition. Basketball games draw in the most students especially on big game days and Saturday game days. Callahan Hall is an amazing venue for basketball games.
College Freshman,2,I did not personally live on campus but I had some friends that did that always seemed to be complaining about the rules and the temperature and simple stuff along those lines.
College Sophomore,2,"Public safety on campus is not very helpful and honestly does not do anything to make me feel safe and secure on campus.  There have been times where it has taken over 20 minutes for public safety to show up where they have been needed.  The campus is not big enough that it should take nearly that long for them to show up where they are needed.  In addition to this, they are not always very helpful and can sometimes be kind of rude.  They could be much better trained in how to help students with various issues on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Definitely not worth the money, its around 5k a year, you would save money renting a place somewhere close by. PLUS the dorms aren't that great, small, cramped, ugly... This is not a big 10 school, dorm parties are not fun or cool, the Frats suck but people here are so afraid to go outside the gates...If you wanna pay 5k to be a 5 min walk from classes, have access to ""campus life"" and terrible food that's your decision."
College Sophomore,2,The food is very low quality.
College Junior,2,Not safe unless in royal oak.
College Junior,2,No parties. Technology old. Not many private rooms
College Junior,2,Only two options. Machines are broken a lot.
College Sophomore,2,The food is expensive if you not on a meal plan and not always good. When it comes to the dining room food sometimes it's good it all depends on who cooks that day.
College Sophomore,2,"The food around here is very scarce unless you have a car. only things that are walking distance is McDonald's which don't have student discounts, Nicky D's Coney Island which also don't have student discounts, The University Coney Island which food isn't always good, Captain Jays which I don't believe has discounts but food is delicious and if you wouldn't mind walking a few blocks you have Little Caesars."
College Sophomore,2,"If you choose an something near the campus, but off campus, its cheap but a very BAD area. If you go a little farther, I heard it isn't as bad. Pricing is very cheap due to the area, but I wouldn't do it for safety concerns."
College Freshman,2,"There is a city bus, but even that isn't trust worthy."
College Freshman,2,Only have a subway and the cafeteria is crap
College Freshman,2,"Like everywhere in Michigan, Late-Spring, Summer, and Early Fall are great. The rest of the year is a free for all with anything like months of snow cover (this year) to pouring rain or anything else you can imagine. Last week the high temperature was 70 degrees and it still ended up snowing for instance. Gets very cold, like this January the wind chill was near -40 degrees."
College Freshman,2,"I had a pretty poor experience living in the freshman dorm. Freshman don't really have a choice about living here, or they will struggle to make friends and be active in campus life as a commuter. There's no air conditioning so the summer and most of the fall is blazing hot. Once it gets cold out. They crank up the heat and you have to leave the windows open or it can get really, really hot. There aren't very many options for food there outside of the store which has very limited hours. The head of residence life is an absolute jackass too. He is universally hated by students and lives in the freshman dorm. He fails to stop the actual problems going on in the dorms, like drug use and vandalism, but will write you up or ban you for trivial offenses. The elevators are sketchy and the entrance would require a room key to get in some days or an ID cards other days and sometimes both. Very frustrating. Outside of this however, the upperclassmen dorms are pretty nice and get the job done. I still would recommend living on campus as a freshman because you meet a ton of people and have a great time for the most part."
College Freshman,2,"They overprice the tuition and give out a ton of scholarships to make it look like you are getting a great deal. Nearly everyone I know got over 17,000 dollars in merit based aid. Willing to give out need based aid.

Like most of the administrative divisions here, they seem pretty disorganized and it took multiple visits to get the help I was looking for."
College Senior,1,We don't have athletics or athletic facilities on the Detroit Mercy Law campus.  You must travel to the main campus to access those.
Recent Alumnus,1,Housing on campus is absolutely terrible.
College Sophomore,1,"The frats play awful music, you know 80-90% of the people there and they're not even your friends... Small school- 3 frats...Pretty much a laughing stock after you go to a frat at State or Michigan. And if people aren't at the frat they're at O'Tooles, probably the lamest bar in all of Michigan. But hey, maybe you're into that? If not- venture outside the gate. Detroit has a great art scene, great food, rich culture, and a great music scene, you can pretty much find something for everyone-no matter what you're into. Why would you go to college in Detroit and never go outside the gates and really explore everything the city has to offer?"
College Sophomore,1,NOT HEALTHY. NOT GOOD. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT.
College Junior,1,"Nothing on campus, and cannot walk around campus."
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't really any apartments close to campus but the one that is a bad place to stay. The ones that are a little farther a pretty expensive. So it's like either you stay on campus, get an apartment with some friends little far from campus, or commute from home."
College Freshman,1,There is no public transportation.
College Freshman,1,There isn't really safe off campus housing outside of the fraternity houses. The neighborhoods around here are pretty bad and you would have a death wish living within 5 minutes of the school. Most people still live at home with their parents and commute. You have to drive 10 minutes north to Ferndale or Royal Oak in order to find safe housing.
College Sophomore,1,The off-campus dining is not so good. The quality of food is usually fast food or low quality food. I have not seen any student discounts. The cost is average for what you get. The variety is boring and limited. I usually drive about 20 minutes into another city to be safer and eat better quality of food.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't any. Probably because going off campus within the city is dangerous.
College Sophomore,1,Bus is not very safe transportation.
College Sophomore,1,Basically just a McDonalds and a bar.
College Sophomore,1,I have no interest in Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,Too dangerous to go out at night alone.
College Junior,1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! The dorms are disgusting and the food package they require you to get is gross as well. I stayed for one semester and couldn't take it. I went home every weekend to do laundry because the washers and dryers were the same...gross! Everything is incredibly old and outdated and in desperate need of remodeling
College Senior,1,You cannot live off campus near the university. You need to go to Royal Oak or Ferndale to find something safe and decent.
College Junior,1,"I planned to have an internship, but the career education office does not help."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus can be a field day depending on what time of day it is and what events may be going on at the campus. if any event or home basketball game is going on, it would be best to arrive to class at least an hour early to get an parking space."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Life and UDM is pretty divided at UDM. Why? you have black greek organizations and white greek organizations. black greek life is pretty dominate and very worthy to join but is not really seen that way at UDM because all of the Black Greek Organizations are not active on the campus, we dont have frat houses like the white frats, and only about 13% of UDM populations is black. on the other hand, 75 % of UDM is caucasian, there are a couple frats houses along the campus. they are still not that relavant because nobody really particpate in the events on campus. the black greeks and white greeks dont associate with each other or collaborate with each other on events."
College Freshman,1,"The school is composed of almost all white, conseravative, catholic people. I believe I have seen four African American people and a handful of Asian people. The diversity is at a minimum at the Aquinas campus. It is located in East Grand Rapids, which is the wealthy part of town. The college population is a very true reflection of the part of the city it is located in."

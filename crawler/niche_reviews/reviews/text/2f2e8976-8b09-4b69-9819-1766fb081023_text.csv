Sophomore,5,The transition to an online learning experience was easy thanks to Montclair and it's professors. I would say I learned the same amount of material online that I would in class. I chose classes that work for me online next semester because of this.
Sophomore,5,My online experience was really good. I really enjoyed it. The layout of my classes was very organized and had structure. My professors were always there to help and when they sent out the instructions it was very detailed and explain what was expected. They also gave you many opportunities to put your best work forward.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a couple of classes online at Montclair State University. These classes were general education requirements and they offer a lot of information virtually. The professors are willing to have one on one conversations with the students to help us understand the topics more in dept. It is a safe environment where I can always rely on the professor to help me whenever I struggle with course material.

Junior,5,"My college experience at Montclair State has been great so far. I am going to be a senior in the fall of 2020 and I feel that I got good experience so far. the professors are passionate and helpful about what they do. the classes are an average difficulty. there is a variety of food to choose from. the people are very friendly and easy to talk to. you get the best experience when being involved in clubs and events they hold. the only downside I can think of is finding parking at 9 am. The classes are small which is better because teachers get more involved with each student rather than a big lecture hall. The professors are always open to helping their students. Make sure to take advantage of the resources that are provided to you on campus such as, tutoring, the writing center, library, and health center. make sure to work hard freshman year because the GPA will drop throughout the years. Overall I learned a lot about responsibility from this University."
Sophomore,5,The environment and resources MSU has to offer is amazing. I always feel comfortable when I'm on campus. The staff are friendly and helpful.
Senior,5,"I took classes online this Spring and in previous semesters. Instructors made coursework very substantial by providing weekly asynchronous lectures, required reading and video material for students, multiple virtual availability methods, prompt virtual feedback and requiring students to complete weekly discussion boards, quizzes, video presentations."
Senior,5,I enjoyed the fact that my instructors were knowledgeable about their subject matter and available for consultation. I was pleased with the robust curriculum  and assignments that stretched my intellect. I also enjoyed the diversity of the student body. I would like to see a more diverse faculty that is representative of the diversity of the student body.
Niche User,5,"When I first visited Montclair State University, I immediately felt a sense of home. Montclair State was my first choice and I could not be happier. I have heard nothing but excellent things and can't wait to start in the fall."
Alum,5,I received a great education at MSU. The school of business career services department helped me land a job right out of college. The campus is beautiful. I also had a great experience with living on campus. I’d highly recommend living on campus if you can and getting involved. The campus gym is also very nice!
Freshman,5,"what I like about Montclair State University is the fact that this university cares about their students and always will be their number one priority. They tend to hold many activities and festivities so that the students can feel as if they are home, and by doing so they are uniting all students of different backgrounds and ethnicities. Montclair will always hold concerts and make the atmosphere fun , which is something you always want in a college. Of course they are very professional and even offer help when a student isn't doing good, ensuring we all get on the right track to fulfill our dreams!"
Freshman,5,"Everything is great, teachers, food, classes, everything! People are very friendly and there are always a lot of events! It does not matter the day or the time, there is always something going on!"

The campus is clean, well-kept, and constant construction is always being done to improve conditions."

Senior,5,Montclair State University has made the Transfer Transition process so easy! Their faculty and staff have guided me in the right direction to help excel and progressively become a better teacher in the education program.
Freshman,5,"Montclair State University has offered me a home. I met the people I think I'll be able to spend the rest of my life with, my second family. The students at MSU all look out for each other. The professors are excellent and are passionate about what they teach. My overall experience at Montclair State is more than words can describe."
Freshman,5,"The first time I did a campus tour, I fell in love with the college! It’s beautiful architecture, the view you could see of New York City, and the feeling it gave me. I felt comfortable and in an accepting environment. My tour guide was very informative of the school and welcoming!"
Sophomore,5,"I like the professors that I’ve had because they were determined to help everyone in the course pass ,and the ways some professors teach make the class more enjoyable and easier to learn because they are able to make the material the teach us stick with us.  I would also like to see more places to eat on campus, because some of the food places aren’t that great."
Niche User,5,"The university is very inviting. Having gone to visit on one of their open house days, I was able to understand the campus more. All the students and teachers were very welcoming and are always willing to help you if you have any questions or concerns. Id love to be part of the Red Hawk Family.What I like about Montclair is the scenery and the calm, quite campus. Even when there are a lot of people around I still feel a sense of calm when I am walking around campus. They also always have something going on for students which I appreciate, especially commuters."
Freshman,5,"What I like about Montclair is the scenery and the calm, quite campus. Even when there are a lot of people around I still feel a sense of calm when I am walking around campus. They also always have something going on for students which I appreciate, especially commuters.

Niche User,5,Looks like a really good college. It is cheap and pretty easy to get into. The prices for everything look pretty good and affordable.
Alum,5,"Montclair State Univeristy is a university that provided me with an amazing educational experience. I had great professors that provided me with knowledge and support in my field of study.

Freshman,5,"Montclair State University has so many great things to offer. There are many resources for academic assistance, and although it is mostly a commuter school, there's always something to do on campus; you just have to go and look for it. They value your mental and emotional health and have many programs for that."
Freshman,5,I like they dont just focus on academics they focus on student social and being part of the community and get to one other.
Sophomore,5,"I love how open MSU is to students. I feel more safe there than I was at William Paterson. They have great programs, great activities and just overall a great environment."
Niche User,5,"I went for a school tour to learn how to get in for college in fall 2020. I really enjoyed my experience while touring the campus, the school seems to offer a variety of academics and majors . I would love to go to this school ."
Junior,5,I think that Montclair has a a great atmosphere with great people. It’s the perfect place for me because it’s not a small school but it’s not a huge school either it’s right in between. I like it because I feel like if I was in a bigger school I would be overwhelmed but I feel comfortable at Montclair. Also at some school’s you don’t know half the people that go there but at Montclair I feel like everybody I walk part I know. The only thing I would change is the food. Our food is ok compared to other schools I guess but I would like to have more of a variety of places like mabye a Chick-fil-A or Salad Works.
Sophomore,5,I love almost everything about Montclair State University. The staff is extremely nice and approachable. Which is especially needed due to the fact the campus is so huge and when someone is transitioning into the campus it is very comforting.
Junior,5,"I currently attend Montclair State University and to say I love the school is an understatement. The University has many programs to help their students to succeed. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. The University always has events for students, so there is never a dull moment on campus. There are also a lot of food options on campus and there are tons of places to study or hang out with friends."

Graduate Student,5,"Great school, conveniently located to public transportation.  Diverse school with great faculty that care about their students.   The school is middle sized.  The programs are up to date and applicable to the industry."
Junior,5,I like how people are connected together. Faculty are always ready to help you whenever you need them.
Freshman,5,"My experience here at Montclair has been a good one. I enjoyed every moment here at Montclair and the classes. This school has such a comfortable home-like feeling to it. Whenever I am here I always feel at home and safe. This is a great school, I wouldn't change a thing. I give it a 10/10 would recommend."
Junior,5,"This will actually be my first year attending Montclair myself, but I have experienced the school through friends who have attended before me. Everything about Montclair has drawn me to it. I look forward to each and every experience and encounter that will take place for me in these upcoming two years."
Sophomore,5,"transferred in not that long ago and its a good school nice people and a great atmosphere. professors are good,food is very accessibly and good. Good school worth the experience at this school"
Freshman,5,"I will be enrolled in Montclair state university starting in the fall of 2019. The campus is very beautiful, clean, and the architecture of the buildings is very unique and beautiful. The academics in the university are also very good. The town of Montclair is also very convenient, the campus is approximately about 15 minutes away from New York City. Montclair State also has a train station on campus, which is a plus for traveling back and forth to see family and friends. I highly recommend going to Montclair State University."
Alum,5,What I loved most about Montclair State University was the family aspect of it. It is not a big school so I get to know many of the students there. The classes were small and I was able to create relationships with my professors. I also worked at the day care on campus which was an amazing learning experience.
Junior,5,"I love MSU. I love the Psychology program and I love the professors I have met. I have heard bad things from other departments though, so be careful! The communications department is trash."
Junior,4,"Great school- many teachers are very helpful and excited to be there. Many people in my family have graduated from Montclair State University and I'm glad to be one more. They have a great education department, and you can tell each professor actually wants to be there for you. The school is about 75% commuters, and MSU does a great job at making them all feel at home and welcome by offering many student life opportunities and chances to get involved. It is located in the best spot, as it is so close to NYC, and it is right off of the Garden State Parkway, it is the ideal college for a commuter. You also get a very great quality of education for a fraction of what you would be paying in other state schools like Rutgers. I've even had professors that taught at Rutgers and they told me the kind of education provided is nearly the same. Montclair State is a great school, offering many different options for academic achievement. I love it here."
Junior,4,"I'm a junior at Montclair State University, and I've had a productive and positive experience thus far. The school has remained committed to staying open as much as possible in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have taken extensive measures to ensure that social distancing and mask-wearing policies are enforced in order to keep the student body safe. The campus is kept safe by a university Emergency Medical Services department (of which I am an active member) and a University Police Department. The academics and internship opportunities are decent, with the university's close proximity to New York City providing many benefits and opportunities to the students. The campus is scenic, with great views of New York, and it's in close proximity to state parklands and bustling town centers. Overall a great campus, and I've enjoyed my experience thus far."
Junior,4,"I've personally struggled a bit with online learning; however, a majority of my professors have gone the extra mile in ensuring that we have enough resources to learn course materials and complete assignments. Zoom sessions take the place of in-person class meetings, and professors have unlocked enough online curricula and homework assignments to ensure that we are staying on track with the course load.Different professors handle things differently, but overall my online learning experience has been relatively positive."
Sophomore,4,Montclair is a great school with wonderful professors who truly care about seeing their students achieve their goals.
Sophomore,4,My professors have been very accommodating with the transition to online learning. They are not expecting anything absurd from myself and my classmates. They have also made themselves very accessible when help is needed.
Junior,4,"I was a transfer from Bergen Community College, and I was thrown into the fire at Montclair. It is very different than a community college. I learned this very quick, and I have only been at Montclair for 2 weeks. The professors are very nice and helpful towards the students."
Junior,4,I would say i had a pretty good experience at Montclair state university. As a commuter i felt i was less involved in the campus which I said my last two years I will get way more involved. I wish some of the financial aid office people were a little easier to contact  to help the student find other options so they can pursue their education as well as career.Most students  miss out on financial aid because of parents incomes.
Alum,4,"Regular online learning works very well under normal, less strenuous circumstances. Having to adapt fully to remote learning in light of COVID made certain classes like teaching difficult but nevertheless professors worked with what they had and did their best to help us out the best they could."
Sophomore,4,"Although I am only a sophomore at Montclair State University, I have really grown to love the school over the past year. It is such a diverse school and I think it has so much to offer."
Junior,4,I love the campus and its accessibility. It is not a huge campus but just the right size. The parking however is horrible there Is no way around that unless they build another garage just for students
Freshman,4,It is give and take. Some things are great and other things you start to hate. I love many of my professors and classes. I do have some complaints but overall Montclair is a very good school I just need more money so I can keep attending.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Montclair State began the second semester of my first year. It was honestly great! As a commuter, the campus is easy to get around. The parking can be overwhelming especially towards the afternoon as it gets full very quickly, but other than that, the campus is very nice !"
Alum,4,"Overall, I miss MSU and it a great university filled with fun times and made real friends who I will always cherish."
Sophomore,4,"Teachers were easy to contact and everything was laid out nicely. It was a nice transition after everything occurred, but being in class is definitely better for retaining the information you learn."
Sophomore,4,"This school is very beautiful and most people are friendly on campus. You’re professors have your best interest at heart. The school is a big commuter school and people like to go home on the weekends, so it’s not busy during them. Dorming is pretty nice, but expensive. The experience is worth it though. There are wonderful programs here especially for Teaching and the Arts. As for the party scene, you’re most likely going to travel off campus for parties. The campus is very safe and there are shuttles that take you around campus, and on the weekends, to Clifton Commons."
Sophomore,4,I took one online class during my spring semester. The Professor was very helpful and made things easier especially when COVID-19 took over.
Sophomore,4,Montclair State is a great university that provides many different clubs and things to do. Everyone is willing to help you when you need help and it's a great place to meet new people.
Senior,4,"Montclair is a great college. Very diverse school with many interesting people, all with different backgrounds. There are always many events on campus going on at all times. They have a good bus system to get around. Parking can be quite a struggle at times tho I feel that is a main thing the school can improve on. The food on campus can also use some work-the majority of it could be a lot better. The teachers have all been wonderful and have all seemed to want to do their best to help their students succeed. There are many different club options as well which means that there is something for everyone! Overall a very nice school to be at!"
Senior,4,I have had no problems with online learning at this school. We use zoom or canvas conference and once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy.
Sophomore,4,"My first year at MSU was surprisingly easy. The transition from high school to college was smoother than I expected. I've made plenty of new friends on campus that I still keep in touch with despite the ongoing pandemic in 2020. There are plenty of places to sightsee on campus along with a stunning view of New York. The entire campus is pretty small once you get used to it. They have great places to get food from such Panda Express, Chillies, Dunkin Donuts, etc. The professors there are very approachable and understanding. If you need help with something or have a certain concern that you need to address they're there to help you."
Sophomore,4,All of my classes were held online. It was mostly asynchronous courses that I've taken. Most of the professors online were very understanding when health issues or internet connection issues arose. They were available to contact every day of the week besides on the weekends. We had Zoom meetings for the current schedule I had made for the spring semester. It was intriguing and fun during the meetings.
Freshman,4,There were no disadvantages regarding online classes. It was still the same as usual and I was able to communicate effectively with my professors. I think the university handled the Coronavirus pretty well and they made quick decisions that would benefit everyone.
Alum,4,I took a couple online classes each semester and over the summer and winter as well. They were easy to follow and the professors were great. Montclair State has tons of online classes and programs that can make your schedule more flexible if you are working or just want to spend less time in a physical classroom.
Alum,4,"Montclair State is an excellent state school in NJ. Close to the city, nice town, and great people. Social life can be slow if you're not in Greek Life or other clubs. Most of the professors are great just make sure to look them up on ratemyprofessor.com.  As long as you are involved on campus, you will love Montclair State."
Senior,4,"MSU is primarily a commuter school. Overall, its a nice campus, and I received a thorough education. A great pro to MSU is that it is very affordable. As a commuter, I do not know much about the dorms, but there are opportunities for students to get involved on campus. One major downside to the campus was the parking, the parking authority gives out tickets left and right. You have to get to campus early to get a decent parking spot."
Senior,4,"For my personal classes, I was able to complete them sufficiently and was still able to perform well. I was also able to graduate on time in this difficult situation. My professors were able to switch to online classes within a weeks time. I was able to communicate them throughout the whole process and they were very understanding."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were great for the most part, but I found it harder to focus during class with the distractions being at home brings. Some of my classes didn't continue online and in those classes I felt as if I didn't learn anything."
Alum,4,I did not take any online courses during my undergraduate years at Montclair. However I took a hybrid course for Math 100. I believed the online software was an excellent tool that advanced learning. It was interactive and kept record of assignments and pass grades. Meeting once a week with the professor and having available lab hours throughout the week complimented the experience.
Alum,4,"Montclair has a beautiful campus with a elements of modern, state of the art buildings and the feeling that it’s surrounded by a forrest. It’s a big campus with so much to offer to a wide arrange of interests. Faculty is particularly special as each department is well handled and in expert hands. MSU could improve parking space and the cost of parking. Tuition as affordable as it is at MSU does not need to come at the price of over paying for parking. Montclair, as it continues to expand and reach new heights, attracts more and more people. The school is in a great location making it highly appealing to student commuters.  Parking is essential and students need to access affordable parking."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are easy as the professors make use of online platforms easy and seamless with the assignments. Everything is straightforward.
Sophomore,4,"The overall campus allows for different types of environments to study, learn, or have fun in. The learning environment is clean and modern. MSU can further improve by updating and renovating older buildings, so that they become more spacious, clean, and efficient."
Junior,4,"The campus is really nice and there is always some form of activity going on in the quad. From my experience, the professors really care about providing their students with the best education they can. The food isn't terrifying which is a plus!"
Freshman,4,"I like that there is a plethora of programs that address all student interest.  At this time, I don't know of any areas in need of improvement."
Junior,4,"The campus and surrounding area are appealing. Great scenic view of NYC on the main campus.  The academics are good for a state school. Like with all universities, it is what you make of it and the effort you put in. The Feliciano School of Business is challenging.  Yes, the big four and other top companies recruit here. For sure MSU is continuing its up and coming reputation. Parking is a challenge;  at what university is it not? Overall, MSU is an above-average university. The administration do tend to care. Professors can be hit or miss as with any higher eduction institution. Some of my professors  have academic backgrounds from Rutgers, NYU, Baruch College, Cornell, and even Harvard (serious). MSU is certainly progressive. Small veteran population. The recreation center is great-top notch if you find the time to make good use of it."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere of Montclair State! Everyone is very welcoming and makes it easier it adapt when transitioning into a more independent life. All of the professors are so kind and understanding and try to make classes easy for their students to succeed. The one thing that I think Montclair State can improve on is their food choices.
Sophomore,4,"Montclair is a small, quiet university that has a beautiful skyline view of NYC. Although it takes a bit of effort for people to tell you important things that are crucial to your education, the staff and administration strive to help us get the best education we can get."
Freshman,4,I had a great first year at Montclair State University. The teachers are very caring and want best for their students. There is always fun activities to do to make you feel involved and meet new people
Freshman,4,"This is my first year here! I love it so far! The people and teachers are very friendly. This is a hard working school. So, You have to make sure you apply a good amount of time to your work. Make sure to get involved and have fun. This is a medium sized campus, so you have plenty of time to get to each class."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Montclair is the diversity on campus. It is awesome to see all of the different cultures I'm surrounded by. I also really enjoy student life, there is always something to do or events to go to if you aren't busy doing work. But something that could be improved is work on campus. College can be expensive and there are not many jobs to go around."
Sophomore,4,"I love Montclair State's learning atmosphere and I feel like the school has a lot of help available in all aspects! Teachers are great and understanding individuals, I've been enjoying it so far!"
Sophomore,4,"I like Montclair and I really have no qualms with it. It is close to my house, the dorms are nice, campus is nice, the people are nice and I don't feel isolated or anything. The only thing I would like to see improve is the dining hall food, the food everywhere else is delicious but the dining hall food is honestly despicable."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked about Montclair State University is that it is a very diverse school and provides different programs for everyone to part take in. My first year I was an accounting major, but after my first semester I rethought about my major and started looking into other schools that fit my interest. I talked to my advisor and he directed me to the college that will be able to help me transition or meet the requirement to be accepted in the program. Some things I feel Montclair State can improve is the communication with he students. There were time I had to keep reaching out to them to find out what was needed and it took a long time to get what you needed. I understand there are a lot of student they have to help but some things could've been handled quicker than it took."
Freshman,4,"what I like about Montclair State University is that it is very diverse compared to what people think, there are also many activities on campus. The one thing I would change about the school are the shuttles because they never run on the time indicated and sometimes it doesn't even tell you if the shuttle is coming or not."
Niche User,4,"The university is very inviting. Having gone to visit on one of their open house days, I was able to understand the campus more. All the students and teachers were very welcoming  and are always willing to help you if you have any questions or concerns. Id love to be part of the Red Hawk Family."
Sophomore,4,Montclair seems like any other state university. Can't complain honestly. Maybe the professors could be more interested in their jobs though.
Junior,4,"The university has amazing professors and many different major opportunities. Would not change much, just to renovate some of the classes and buildings. Besides that my overall experience has been like no other."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the diversity. The dorms are nice but the food in the caf is really bad.  They need more selections and should have buffet style.
Freshman,4,The experince at the University is very good. It has an excellent campus wide experience for all students
Freshman,4,"I find Montclair State University to be an excellent school, the atmosphere is great and everyone is friendly."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at MSU thus far. I would suggest the school to anyone looking for a good liberal arts university.
Senior,4,"This school is clean, great, everyone is mostly nice. I love MSU - but if you can't take the cold and don't like a big campus or a lot of stairs, it wont be for you."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experiences at Montclair have been eventful. I love the campus, it's beautiful. My dorm feels like home and I am grateful to be here. I am majoring in Medical Humanities and this far, all my classes are interesting and I enjoy them. The school is quite diverse and it has a lot to offer."
Freshman,4,Overall very good school however food is not that great and all freshman dorms have communal restrooms
Freshman,4,"I am only a first year student so I have not experienced much, however I can speak on my love of the actual campus vibe and the racial diversity of the school. Also the outstanding amount of things that there is to do on a daily basis. Professors so far have been about average, most if not all of them have other primary jobs so they do not try very hard when it comes to teaching or forming relationships with students."
Junior,4,"I truly love the campus at Montclair State University.  I love how they host many events to try to form a community within the students.  One thing that I would like to see change however is the parking.  As a commuter, I spend hours looking for parking and sometimes I am forced to skip or be late to some of my classes."
Freshman,4,Ive been a few times with friends and the first time was with a school group the first time wasn't that interesting because we didn't really see the business parts or their computer programming Parts cuz it was still in construction but when I went with a friend this summer it was very good and friendly
Freshman,4,I like how supportive the staff and counselors are. I also think there is good student life and activities and clubs to join. I would change some of the teachers that I had because they did not really teach.
Senior,4,"My college experience at Montclair State has been wonderful so far. I am going to be a senior in the fall of 2019 and I feel that I could definitely share a lot about my experience as a commuter and a resident. First, I would say that it is important to get involved in clubs to keep yourself busy but of course make sure you can manage your school work first. Second, make sure to utilize the resources that are provided to you on campus such as, the writing center, tutoring, library, health center, and many more. Third, If you are a commuter I would say get to school earlier because parking at Montclair is quite a headache but don't worry you will get use to it. I do have a lot more to talk about Montclair but I feel that I have covered the most important and relevant information you need to know in order to finish at Montclair satisfied!  Hope this helps :)"
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student who is studying Clinical Mental Health Counseling, I would like to see more programs in regard to that field. Most information received or taught is about school counseling."
Sophomore,4,"College is really about what you make of it. Montclair for me was special because of the people I met there, as well as the professors. As long as you show an effort, the professors and all the faculty will extend a helping arm."
Sophomore,2,My experience was decent but I wish the professors would be more helpful During these tough times. Especially during a Pandemic.
Sophomore,2,Half the professors can’t even manage Google Drive. The other half struggle to engage their students over zoom or other platforms. Students teach themselves everything ultimately.
Sophomore,2,"A state school with no particularly special features or programs. The school is known as a teacher’s school and yet poorly pays its own adjunct professors while proclaiming its teaching degree program will result in high paying positions. All this happens while the dean herself is awarded raises and bonuses while tuition for low-income students gets higher and higher. Overall, a school that I personally had no choice but to attend, but others who are able should surely avoid it."
Junior,2,"Awful.Many schools allows first semester students to choose their classes. This is the only school who screws students over by choosing random classes in their first semester and I had to switch classes and things got worst so I ended up with a 2.0 gpa after. Now a 3.2 gpa! The humanities department and philosophy department needs to understand that many students are taking their courses as “gen ed” but they still keep hiring bad professors. This is the treatment I get after moving to college.The nutrition department is broken too!There is a 1 credit 6 week class where ur required to pass a certification test with a 75 or higher or u fail the course just because of a useless certification.This whole education system and treatment of students is broken.The school care more about policies and money rather than the well being and success of students. My graduation is delayed to 21’ as well.Do not go to grad school at MSU, u’ll regret."
Freshman,2,"The academics are good but the school environment could be better. During the weekends there’s nothing to do, and some weekdays also making it easy to stay in your room & not get involved. If you don’t find your group of friends, it is very very easy to be isolated. The food is good sometimes but other times it’s bad. If you’re a freshman the meal plan you must have is a waste of money because it basically forces you to eat at the same place everyday unless you use your flex dollars which run out very quick. It’s not a terrible school but there’s so many things that can be improved"
Freshman,2,"If you're an out of state student DO NOT GO HERE. You will be lonely on weekends because it is an 80% COMMUTER SCHOOL. I made some amazing friends, but I was lonely on weekends. Everyone goes home or goes to Rutgers to parties. MSU wasn't bad, but if you hate being along GOOD LUCK!"
Junior,2,"Montclair State University is a great school, there are some really good professors who care about their students and really make you dive into the subject even if its not related to your field of study. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the computer science department is poorly managed. I don't see any program or event that makes students get involved in research or any extracurricular activity. It would really make an impact if they start doing events that instill curiosity in the minds of the students at this department."
Graduate Student,2,The Graduate School was poorly managed and was a no frills package. The course load was extreme for the executive program. All of the MBA programs are identical and for some reason they all had different tuition rates. Do your research before attending this school. It will benefit you in the end if you went somewhere else and got the correct bang for your buck.
College Sophomore,2,Theres no real school spirit. Not once have I ever heard of someone going to a game or even speaking of one. It kind of feels non existent
College Sophomore,2,"School spirit and fan support are almost nonexistent. I have been to exactly one sporting event, a football game during my first semester, where our varsity football team was embarrassingly crushed by a sub-par school from my home state of Maryland. Since then I have all but ceased to care, and apparently, so has everyone else. The facilities themselves are nice, but resemble more of a high school setup than a university. The only upside is that our student recreation center is one of the best in the area and has even been nationally recognized for its stellar equipment and appeal to the student body as a whole."
College Sophomore,2,"I say that housing is bad, because first there's not system for it. Its basically a free for all and whoever gets to apply first gets it. You don't really have a lot of options once it's your turn to pick. And then even if you pick your room mate your not guaranteed to get them."
College Junior,2,"I have never been interested in Greek Life because while they promote volunteer work, all I have come in contact with are how much they like to party."
College Freshman,2,I can't say for sure.I only know a guy who knows a guy
College Freshman,2,"Freeman has no air conditioning, and the elevator never works, and even when it's freezing outside it's somehow way too hot inside, and the building's basically a brick so you don't get good wifi. The heights are way too expensive, and blanton has air conditioning but it doesn't work very well. Overall, the housing is ok I guess. I mean, its housing. But it's not that great."
College Junior,2,Anyone in CSAM has a horrible chance at recognition after graduating from here. Very rarely does anyone get into medical school either
College Junior,2,Horrible waste of money. They don't care about students.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think I need a review what I pick speaks for itself.
College Sophomore,2,I am not a fan of the food and sometimes it does cause certain students to get sick after while
College Junior,2,"No chance to even obtain off campus housing, cause it fills up so quick"
College Freshman,2,"The reason is because my situation is a hard one since because of the documents I have doesn't prove I'm a resident despite living in NJ for a long time, thus didn't qualify for any Aid."
College Sophomore,2,I have not met anyone
College Junior,2,It doesn't appeal towards me.
College Junior,2,Just go off campus.  There's never much going on on campus
College Junior,2,"Stick to cafe diem, which is now an au bon pain (why?).  Einstein's bagels is also decent, but more expensive.  The convenience store in the student center has options, but you're going to pay 3x what you would at a grocery store or even at 7-11"
College Sophomore,2,"I have a very strict gluten free diet. If any of food come in touch with gluten, even just being cooked in the same pan or using the same utensils I become severely ill. The dining halls on campus are occasionally accommodating but not all the time. There are very few options besides gluten free bread and salads."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus at MSU was great when looking at the social atmosphere. I'm a music student and my dorm is directly across from the music school. I can walk to class in about 2 minutes. It was easy to stay in the practice rooms until 3am and feel safe walking back to my room because it was only across the quad. Besides the social part of my dorm building there aren't many good things about it. The heat is broken, there is no hot water, the elevator is broken on a regular basis (and I live on the 6th floor), and often times the water is brown. I have a very strict gluten free diet due to illness. The dining hall was hardly accommodating. When the manager was there the staff had no problem answering my questions but when the manager had already gone home for the day it was hard getting the chefs to answer my questions."
College Freshman,2,"I hate that there aren't any parties on campus, it's pretty dry. You have to travel to another school or go to a club. It's pretty annoying but it has it's perks sometimes."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you want to take the train to NJIT, there isn't much to do. There are people who tell you there are parties, but there's a clear distinction between getting wasted and getting wasted *at a party*"
College Sophomore,2,"The wifi at the school is awful.  The network is always down which is unfortunate, especially when you need the internet for a project or for homework.  Many professors do not take the excuse that the internet was down to why you could not complete the homework."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life doesn't have their own housing and while they help the social atmosphere of the campus, there's not much attention brought out to the students. Majority of students tend to think of them as stereotypical like the ones shown in television."
College Sophomore,2,"I heard that there used to be a party held at Montclair State but because the university is located near a residential area, it got shut down pretty quick. The party was moved to NJIT, which makes sense since it's located in the city. I would say this university is pretty much strict with parties."
College Sophomore,2,There's no enough financial help.
College Sophomore,2,Theres no much to do
College Sophomore,2,There's no parties unless you join a frat or sorority
College Sophomore,2,I did not have money saved for college and my parents and I cannot pay out of pocket but I received no financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,Concerned about finding the right major and internship.
College Sophomore,2,Getting back to campus is a hassle.
College Freshman,2,It is a strict and dry campus. They have a very strict attendance policy.
College Freshman,2,There's rarely any parties on campus. Everyone goes off campus for the parties.
College Freshman,2,There is barely any off campus housing for students at all.
College Freshman,2,"I am elected Biology major.  I like it alot and find the workload manageable.  The professor knows how to teach and opened for questions.  But biology comes with chemistry.  Next semester I am  having professor with bad reviews, and I am limited to only that professor. The administration puts us in groups to help create connections and ease accommodation to college life, but the drawback is that I can not select another professor.  Not because there isn't space in the other chemistry class, but because of that artificial limitations.  Very disappointing."
College Senior,2,"I don't hear about any events except for the job fair, once a semester.  Luckily, I was able to secure a job by reaching out to various offices and going on different interviews."
College Senior,2,Start early! And look for scholarships on your own.
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive for college students
College Junior,2,There aren't too many parties on campus.  Many go home for the weekends.
College Sophomore,2,Very overpriced for what you get. Although the rooms are spacious many rooms don't even have air conditioning. Most students were assigned to buildings they didn't want. Not ideal.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is not willing to help you find aid to provide enough funding to attend. Since its a public school they don't give out money but the financial aid office is not helpful at all. They give you two options for loans to apply to and if neither of those work, tough. Not happy with anything regarding the financial aid office."
College Sophomore,2,"While Montclair State is great at liberal arts, the physics department is not that great. There are few faculties meaning there are fewer classes to choose from. The courses do not run frequently. But i do have to say that the faculty is great with helping students, and helping them find research work. Because the department is smaller it is easier to tend to each students needs."
College Junior,2,The food could be much better if they screened who they hired to make the food or trained them better.
College Junior,2,"I have to apply to outside scholarships since the school doesn't provide much. It is cheaper than most schools, though."
College Junior,2,Thank god they are switching food providers. sodexo is awful
College Freshman,2,Bio majors can't have a life.
College Freshman,2,Fall- extremely hot to really cold Spring-freezing
College Junior,2,Too expensive for what you get
College Junior,2,Nothing really going on over weekends
College Junior,2,You have to be from underprivileged family to get any aid. Or single parent household. The whole system is unfair
College Sophomore,2,The cops are always pulling people over and searching the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,The school is near a highway and very concealed. If you do not have a car you're stuck here.
College Junior,2,I wish their were less broader options.
College Freshman,2,"Being an out of state student without a car on campus, I see the transportation offered to be pretty inconvenient and nonexistent."
Sophomore,1,"I went here and had a miserable time and transferred out. It did not feel like a real school to me. There was no sense of community for me, nothing to do on weekends, not a lot of people were friendly when I was dorming, the food was bad, it felt like I was living in the bad version of the Truman Show. I wish I spent more time looking at other schools and went to community college instead of going on. There is no structure, the faculty is rude, the professors are average for the most part and have this as a side hustle when education should not be a ""side job."" The faculty lie to you on many occasions and leave you in the dark for everything."
Freshman,1,They did not take a lot of credits I was a sophomore and now I am a freshman. This is a commuter school with very low social life. It is great if you have a lot of friends from high school. But if you want to meet new people and socialize this is not the place for you.
Freshman,1,"Montclair was not my first choice of school and they made it an absolute terrible experience. I would often find myself running around in circles trying to get in touch with somebody. Their freshman orientation is, to say the least, a bunch of BS. I was unable to stay through the night and they made me practically have to get on my hands and knees and beg them for a makeup orientation day. The staff besides the teachers do not care at all. We had problems with my insurance through the school and student services cursed out my mother on the phone. I only spent one semester here and it was absolute hell for me and my family."
Niche User,1,Had to transfer after 1 year. Depressing is the best way to describe it. Such a bland environment. School work is very easy if you are looking to breeze your way through college.
Niche User,1,"This is a JOKE OF AN INSTITUTION. I came here for one summer as a visiting student to get some of my classes out of the way. Worst experience I've ever had. No one returned my phone calls or emails in regards to enrolling in an class that I needed approval for. I had to drive there on my spring break, being told the people I would need to speak to would be there. When I arrived I learned that was not the case and I wasted my time and had to continue emailing administration daily. It took TWO WEEKS to get a reply from anyone. After the summer sessions when trying to pay bill, I was told after I received confirmation of my payment that they did not receive money and I was yet again directed to a million different people to get everything sorted out. If you're planning on take summer courses, DO NOT come here!"
Graduate Student,1,"Subpar at best. Professors don't answer emails and might decide not to show up to class for weeks, advisors are nonexistent, registrar/financial aid is disastrous."
Freshman,1,"DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL. It's not ""all here"". Nothing is there except construction and conceded theater majors. I lived in Bohn hall and moved out within the first 2 months. My room was broken into while I was in it, my roommate and I were harassed, and my RA's were no where to be found. I found out the next day that the building didn't have working alarms and the kids that broke in just came up the fire escape. Yes, it's cheap, don't get me wrong, but it's not even worth the instate tuition. If you're a commuter, get ready to never find parking anywhere and miss half of your classes. The best part of the school was its proximity to NYC, however, trains don't run on Sundays. Oh and there's absolutely nothing to do on or off campus and there aren't any parties if you want that sort of thing. Montclair students were banned from TCNJ frats by the end of my first week there. I'm happier at community college to be quite honest."
College Sophomore,1,"The worst is the housing process. There are many students that can not afford the expensive heights and machuga. However, this year that was the only housing available. Blanton and Freeman filled up fast. They also didn't put into consideration the different need for housing. Students that for sure couldn't commute should have first priority for picking."
College Freshman,1,"d3 sports can only be so good, very boring overall"
College Junior,1,This place is so strict. You can be 21 or over but still not allowed to own alcohol.
College Junior,1,"I would like to party, but they either aren't that fun and non existent. And i don't have time to travel to NJIT for 2 hours and try and make the train back to MSU before 12am"
College Freshman,1,The parties here are horrible. I would rather and have considered transferring to Rutgers.
College Junior,1,"Prepare for the worst, it will be an ongoing nightmare for your entire college career."
College Sophomore,1,I understand that MSU is a dry campus but I think the strictness is a bit over the top and unnecessary.
College Sophomore,1,i personally choose not to engage in that part scene at my school. The main reason being campus police an RA's are over the top strict when it comes to drinking on campus. If you drink on campus you will most likely get caught and my education isn't worth that risk.
College Freshman,1,"I didn't do that great my first semester because of finances and financial aid, I honestly had a mental break down and cried but I fought to get the money I deserved."
College Freshman,1,"I did very well in high school and did not receive anything. Meanwhile, the kids who are worried about losing their scholarships because they're on Academic Probation keep their money? I made Dean's List last semester, and do you know what I got? A generic letter in the mail congratulating me. I find that insulting."
College Junior,1,"I've gone to one party hosted by MSU students for the past 3 years that I've attended. It's safe to say that it was the first and last MSU party I attended. It was just chaos and the people that were there were acting like it was there first time ever going out (yes, throw up and everything)."
College Sophomore,1,"You can't do much, almost everything can get you in trouble."
College Freshman,1,"The only off-campus housing available are actual houses and apartments. Being that we are students, we do not make an adequate amount of money to live in the houses that are off campus."
College Junior,1,I barely get any scholarships or financial aid
College Sophomore,1,parking is awful and the advisors are useless
College Senior,1,"My financial aid experience has been overall a nightmare!, I am a New Jersey resident and I have been paying taxes since I started working, but somehow I am considered an international student; therefore, I have been told by many financial aid adviser's at MSU that the changes of me getting in financial help are none, although this upsets me, I continue to focus on my studies, I am still wondering how I am going to pay for next semester though."
College Senior,1,"I think that the registration process definitely needs improvement because as a transfer student I have difficulties signing for my classes since i'm not familiar with the school's system, i actually went to see my advisor and she told me to do it myself and I did and after I took the classes that i took, I went to ask her to find out if I was taking the classes that i needed to take and she told me that I took a class I wasn't supposed to, in which I wasted my money and time on."
College Junior,1,"Summers are manageable but the 3 other seasons are bad because of windy it is. It's usually extra cold and windy, especially in the winter."
College Junior,1,the campus is a little too strict. especially when it comes to creating an on campus organization
College Junior,1,"finding a parking space? during the week? yea, good luck with that"
College Junior,1,"As a Greek, Montclair State crucifies our community. Any Greek org that does not do enough to please the review board is either put on probation (no rushees allowed) or is suspended from the campus for two years. The scrutiny we face is borderline discriminatory."
College Sophomore,1,Paying for taxis every night is costly and going to njit takes time to get to.
College Sophomore,1,"The greek life is a cult here, if you're not in one especially the girls do not like you."
College Sophomore,1,It is very windy and cold all year round.
College Junior,1,The computers and technology are awful.
College Junior,1,The food off campus is better than the food on campus.
College Student,1,"We're on top of a hill, so it gets pretty windy and cold during the winter"
College Sophomore,1,There really is not much to do and there needs to be more of a night scene to attend
College Junior,1,"Montclair is a dry campus. There is absolutely no nightlife. I do not live in the Village and do not know anyone who does so I do not know if things are happening there. The dorms are boring for the most part. Unless you make friends with your floor, or in your dorm its hard to hang out on campus. I recently turned 21 and am looking into the bars off campus, but do not know much about them. I would like to be able to go out locally and not spend a lot of money going into the city to have a good time."
College Freshman,1,There's nothing to do on campus
College Freshman,1,"I thought it would be less money for my mom, unfortunately Montclair has been so expensive for the room and board, if I need my car I have to pay for the parking and the shuttle is not accessible at all."
College Freshman,1,I barely receive any financial aid at all and the prices are very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,Cops are the biggest assh**** in the world at this school. Mostly because the surrounding town is upper class white people so the Little Falls and Montclair police make their money by busting poor college students for drinking and smoking. They LOVE that s***
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife at Montclair is embarrassing. If you're lucky theres a party, which is sad for a college. If there is something going on, be prepared to stand around in one of the sports houses with the same 50 people you see every weekend. If there is music playing that party is getting busted by 12:30-12:45. Pretty much, if you had fun in high school, don't go to Montclair because its another 4 years of basic parties, not college parties."
College Sophomore,1,Always incredibly cold and windy
College Freshman,1,Finding parking is the worst. It is also really expensive for just two semesters. 
College Junior,1,I wish they had scholarships for transfer students.
College Junior,1,Parking here is awful. The permit is overly priced and parking is beyond hard to find. Overcrowding is an understatement. Fines are ridiculus and parking enforcement will give you a ticket for every and anything.I recommend night classes for those who do purchase a permit becasue thats when spots are usually easier to find.
College Junior,1,"The people working in the Financial Aid office are rude and mean. I went in last year asking for help because I was not sure how to afford school so I was hoping I could get at least some advice. Instead, they looked up my parents' income, said it was too much to apply for financial aid, and essentially told me to leave. The office was not busy. I did not go in asking for money, I was asking for HELP. I left crying. I have never gone back."
College Junior,1,"I absolutely HATE the food on campus. I'm not exaggerating at all. I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, extremely healthy, and I lived on campus for one semester and now I've gained a significant amount of weight. The reason? There's no vegetarian food! There is SOME... if all you want is carbs or salad. There are no protein options. So I find myself either eating pasta just to use up my food plan that I was forced to pay $2000 for even though I did not want it, or I eat salad and am hungry for the rest of the day. I'm trying to eat healthy but there's nothing healthy to eat. There is fruit, but it's never fresh. The vegetarian options are the same every day. And at Sam's place, where they offer more vegetarian options, usually do not have options with protein. But Sam's place cannot be the only place that provides a selection for vegetarian food. The non-vegetarian food has variety, so why do the vegetarians get stuck with the same food every day? I am a vegetarian because my stomach cannot process the fat in meat. I am suffering at school with the awful food they serve. I am sick most of the time because of the food. "
College Junior,1,"Parking was awful when I commuted the past two years, and this year I live on campus with my car parked in the 'visitor parking deck' and there's spots there more often, but it's extremely expensive. The commuter permit is outrageous as well. Paying hourly is painful to anyone's wallet. "
College Freshman,1,I spent so much time on filling out financial aid and got next to nothing in return. 
College Junior,1,I am in great need of financial aid but still have no received any. It seems impossible at this point.
College Junior,1,There nightlife at Montclair State University is practically non-existent. 
College Freshman,1,I've notice many people around get in trouble for drugs and drinking. but there is no peer pressure
College Freshman,1,"The campus shuttles get crowded quickly, even if you make it on time, you might still get stuck waiting 15-20 minutes for the next bus because they run out of room."
College Freshman,1,"I never understood why the fee for the permit is almost $300. It seems really unfair. The closest parking lot to the main campus is Carparc and then you have to walk up an exhausting flight of stairs. I have to get to school at least half an hour before my class to find a spot at Carparc in the morning. In the afternoon, it's not bad. There are other parking lots further from the main campus and they offer free shuttle buses to the building (no exhausting staircase), but the buses get packed fast and if you don't fit you're stuck waiting another 15-20 minutes for the next bus."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on near classes is the absolute worst. There is technically no speed limit and it's like a race to see who gets a spot on the highest level first.
College Freshman,1,This place is the worst nightlife of all time. You couldn't find a party if there was a gun pointed to your head.
College Sophomore,1,"MSU does not tell you any off-campus housing. If you want to live off-campus your on your own and it may even be expensive because it in the subarbs. Also, you may not be able to throw paries for the same reason."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Computer labs were always full, printers always breaking down, and some computers out of use. Such a big school there should be more computers, more labs, definitely more printers (as there were NOT ENOUGH) and better attention for the care of the technology (so as to repair issues quickly)"
College Freshman,1,you can take out loans for the graduate program but financial aid is hard to get so save up!!
College Junior,1,"the food on campus is bad and a rip off they give you meal plans or swipes that arent excepted on most campus eateries and the food they do serve isnt consistent or cooked sometimes, also there is only 1 24 hour place to eat anywhere in or off campus and most meal plans arent excepted there, and this location is on campus"

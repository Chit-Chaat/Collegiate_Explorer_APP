Sophomore,5,"My first year at Mitchell College was a great start and pick for a student like myself. As a person with learning disabilities, Mitchell provides many kinds of support for a multitude of students. The housing choices were excellent, college advisors arrange students to their dorm rooms and roommates based on common likes or dislikes. I was sorted into my first dorm and ended up starting my first social friendship with my roommate, who ended up becoming a close friend. However, the social environment for students is both safe and friendly for everyone; the many clubs ranging from Rugby to Competitive Gaming have opened friendships and relationships for students on campus. After joining the Competitive Videogame Club, I have made a full group of close friends in Mitchell College before my school break even started."
Freshman,5,At Mitchell College I instantly felt welcomed. The stuff is amazing and always willing to help out when you need it.
Junior,5,"I love the small classes.  Professors are great. I love that they are always updating the school. New locker rooms, new sports fields coming, new drama building coming."
Freshman,5,its a home away from home. they welcome me with open arms. right now being a incoming freshmen i really dont know what they need to change
Junior,5,Great small college in a charming small town. Excellent teachers and students are well rounded and smart. Great place to invest in your education.  lots of clubs and activities.
College Freshman,5,alumni's come in and work at practice with us.
College Freshman,5,they are willing to do anything for us.
College Freshman,5,People are really nice. A lot to do.
College Freshman,5,Very thankful for the facilities and opportunities.
College Freshman,5,Small class sizes make learning easy. Workload is never to much to handle.
College Freshman,5,Proffesional and the professors are great when you need help.
College Student,5,"I always feel safe on Mitchell's campus. Campus security is always seen patrolling. I do recommend keeping anything of value locked away or seen, these are a bunch of college students not angels."
College Junior,5,Students are always going to the home games as there is a dance team to cheer them up. Dance team gets the crowd crazy as they start cheering with them. Students sometimes paint their which would be red and white for the college colors. Some of the students make poster to hold up at the game for the players and wave them in the air. They have special days  for the seniors on the athletics team where parents come and they get flowers. There are always posters on the walls in the dorms that said the game times. The teams always work together as they always get their teammates hyped up. The team is laughing and getting along with each other. One of the teammates get mad at a call or mistake they made in the game another teammate will cheer them up. The workout facilities and trainers are excellent to the athletic teams . They are always going to the games to show support for the teams.
Sophomore,4,The only experience I have had when it comes to online learning is when Covid-19 came into place and I believe that each of my professors worked with me and were extremely flexible. They understood that this was a challenging time for not only them but their students. With it kind of coming out of nowhere I believe that my professors handled the situation and their classes very professionally.
Sophomore,4,"My first experience at Mitchell College was full of welcoming upper classman and staff. My courses have been extremely helpful not just for learning purposes in the classroom but also in something we call ""the real world"". My professors have worked with me one on one but also figured out how each student works and I believe that as a student it really has helped us succeed. Mitchell College has allowed me to come out of my comfort zone and go after my dream job in the criminal justice field. I will be going into my sophomore year at this college and I have already learned so much about my field and more. This college and it's courses have allowed me to have more of an opened mind and to think outside the box but also has helped me come out of my shell tremendously. I can't wait to see what the upcoming years have to hold."
Junior,4,My favorite part about Mitchell college is the private beach which is very relaxing. Going in I never thought I would make friends but I was able to meet people that were so accepting. The teachers are good especially in my major. Overall a good experience.
Niche User,4,"I love the private beach. I am in love with the campus appearance. It is so beautiful. The college has a Bentson Learning Center. This center can help me because the center helps people with disabilities with their classwork and grades. I have Autism so I know this can help me with my grades and classwork. Most importantly, this school is located in New London. New London is like another home to me. My grandfather's (from my mother side) people came from there. I am half Native American and I am from the Eastern Pequot Tribe. ftw"
College Freshman,4,campus safety is very good at being there
College Freshman,4,Mitchell College was the right choice for me.
College Freshman,4,This school has a very good ed program and i like the small class sizes.
College Freshman,4,"The program itself is great, the school is very small"
College Senior,4,"So far, my overall experience at school has been pretty great. As a freshman in college surrounded by people I don't know and doing work more advanced than high school, I'm getting the hang of things. I go to Mitchell College and it's a pretty small community which I like. It's easier to get to know people and I feel safer in a small group. The professors are nice and helpful when it comes to school work and answering questions. Also, because it's a small school, I've found my way around campus easily and haven't gotten lost... yet."
College Junior,4,I am hopefully living off campus this upcoming year for my senior year but it is a little pricey.
College Freshman,4,Both are very nice people
College Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing at this college, they all have amazing backgrounds, and have all done amazing things with their life. They all also enjoy teaching which makes it even better for me as a student to learn from them."
College Freshman,4,"My financial aid process went very smoothly, i never had a hassle or any trouble getting the aid or speaking with a financial aid representative from the school. Everything happened on time and accurately."
College Freshman,4,Theres plenty of majors to choose from. There professionalism is ok. 
College Freshman,4,You can almost always find a campus safety person only issue is they don't have someone at the entrance at all times. 
College Freshman,4,It is a little run down on the outside but the food and service is amazing!
College Sophomore,4,"The safety and security on campus is great. I feel safe and comfortable wherever I go. Since I have a physical disability, I call campus safety to escort me to classes and to the library. Typically, I don't have to wait very long to be picked up or dropped off. Campus safety has student's best interest at heart. "
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity should be Mitchell College's middle name. The campus is so diverse. It is a melting pot of different cultures, religious backgrounds, races, creeds, and color. Mitchell is very accepting of everyone here on campus. We are one huge family. We care and support  for each other. Mitchell has a no bullying policy. "
College Student,4,"Most students at Mitchell are genuinely attractive. The people are all very social and it's too easy to make a couple friends. You'll find many different types of people here from jocks, to country guys, city slicks and plain janes. Very diverse students."
College Sophomore,4,The coolest thing about this school is that it's right on the beach. It also has small classroom sizes and the whole campus is close together So it doesn't take long to go from building to building.
Alum,2,"First of the view was amazing, it was great being able to walk to the beach when ever i wanted. When i first went for a tour everyone was so friendly. i soon realized that the school was very Clichy and everyone from the local highschool went there. As far as the academics they were very easy and i found this to be an issue becasue i was not challenged. Also it was very exspensive and sometimes i wish i went to a cheaper school."
College Junior,2,"There is not much to do in New London. The area is relatively small and not buzzing with activity. If I wanted to go out to the mall, I would have to go into the next town. New London is cab city! I take a cab everywhere I go. It can get expensive. Shopping in Connecticut overall is expensive. I spent at least $40.00 (and up) at the local CVS."
College Junior,2,I don't go to the parties off campus. The police show up after fifteen minutes and sometimes fights break out. I stay in my room and study.
College Freshman,2,"If you live in the newest building, Mariner Hall, you are all set. If you don't, you are screwed on amenities and basic needs. I would rather commute almost 4 hours a day than live in these dorms..."
College Freshman,2,It's just basic high school level classes but in a college setting...
College Freshman,2,The financial aid kept losing the paperwork I sent. I had to eventually walk to the office and demand to see my adviser 3 days in a row until I was finally allowed in to finalize my paperwork.
College Freshman,2,"They do not care what students do. The RAs are never on duty and allow anything to happen. People run up and down the halls at 2am screaming and nobody says anything to them. And if you want drugs or alcohol, just walk into the upperclassmen dorms and they will gladly give you something if you have enough cash."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Safety is usually around during the day but after 5pm, they are nowhere to be found. If there is a problem, you call their phone number but you might never get anywhere. The health services however are basically the same. The athletic trainers are very good but the general student services are mediocre. They are just old and retired nurses who need a paycheck...."
College Freshman,2,"The local atmosphere is difficult, because of the proximity of mitchell college to uconn college, we do not interact with one another at all. furthermore, during the night times its dangerous to be outside because many students have been attacked or victims of robbery."
College Freshman,2,"This college is more of a stepping stone to life i would say. Unfortunately there is a very few number of people here who are mature and adult enough to handle living alone and be able to handle themselves. Others just intent on acting very childish and creating hard situations that you would normally expect from high school students. Me being someone who is mature and have a goal to set my life further, its very difficult for me to associate myself or even deal with the stress from the other students creating difficult situations. Also, being a small campus everyone will be aware of the situation, which only influences the mob-mentality. It is very easy to make friends with everyone, or be completely alone at this campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Marijuana usage and alcohol consumption are greatly visible on campus. Entire dormitories and academic buildings reek of weed, bodily fluids and booze. Mountains of empty beer cans and bottles can be found in or around any designated trash or recycling area. Underclassmen have even resorted to using communal bathrooms as dumping grounds for their post-party wastes.

The college continually fails to punish students who promote, participate in or condone underage drinking and illegal drug use. A student who practices self-defense is more likely to get disciplinary probation than a student who is caught with an ounce of pot. If caught in rooms with other students engaging in said acts, the school will be more likely punish those who are in possession of the substance(s) or contraband, (e.g., you will be exempt from punishment if you simply declare their ""innocence"" and can offer no proof of direct involvement.)

Peer pressure doesn't really exist, since it's more so disabled students, overly-hormonal jocks, socially inept over-achievers and unmotivated stoners trying to live out a ""conventional"" college life-style. Yet, if you choose to abstain from partying, you will definitely feel bored and alienated, (especially during long weekends.)

The use of tobacco products is another huge issue on campus. Students consistently violate outdoor smoking policies, as they freely smoke across campus. Cigarettes are virtually an accepted form of currency at Mitchell, as a majority of students suffer from serious nicotine addictions. Even I, myself, being someone who had long declared refrain from such activities, have begun smoking cigarettes whilst here.

Thankfully, the abuse prescription medications and drugs like ecstasy and cocaine are less visible and frequent on campus."
College Freshman,2,There needs to be more drug watch going on for marijuana. To many people smeak into the wooden paths to smoke near my dorm and its bothersome and stinks. 
College Sophomore,2,"The academics offered here for undergraduate underclassmen are no different form, if not worse than that of any decent community college, though some classes are advanced and have very impressive professors. 

Unfortunately, many of the professors/instructors as well as other faculty and staff, are adjuncts, associates, or are first or second year.

Certain courses are difficult and pose challenges for some, (those typically learning disabled or intellectually challenged). If you consider yourself to be ""high functioning"" and did very well in high school, than the courses here will be a breeze, if not a complete and utter joke. 

Some argue that the money the school demands from students and their families is greatly disproportionate to the quality of education offered.

Honestly, I don't feel this is true, as long as you receive decent finical aid, scholarships and grants. The costs of textbooks and other required course materials are relatively low and are competitively priced.

If you seek a more genuine, traditional or advanced college experience, PLEASE study ELSEWHERE.

***IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUS L.D., DIDN'T APPLY YOURSELF IN HIGH SCHOOL, OR STRUGGLE SOCIALLY , THIS MAY BE THE RIGHT SCHOOL FOR YOU, BUT IF YOUR NOT, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!***"
College Sophomore,2,Mitchell can be strict with alcohol and drug use. You're punishment depends on the severity of the violation. Don't keep telling people about you're plans to drink because you will get caught. Mitchell is small and word will get out.
College Senior,2,we have an average safety department here at Mitchell. if you are studying late at the library and don't want to walk back to your dorm in the dark they will give you a ride back to your dorm. They do slack on enforcing the rules with the parking sticker and they lack in being in the campus safety booth
College Senior,2,its average its the same as most campuses I think the best place to get food is sandellas or the student center at night
College Senior,2,since we are located near water when it rains here we flood easily but if you wear rain boots and a rain coat and keep your books wrapped in plastic bags you will be fine
College Senior,2,I give the school a c- because I believe that the school is lacking in its strictness to uphold the rules and you can talk your self out of trouble with a lame excuse and get off with a slap on the wrist and they are lacking in upholding the academic polices too
College Sophomore,2,It's OK – If u have a good group of friends then your good paryies are ok but not all that
Niche User,1,"Parents beware: this school employees a very high number of adjuncts- they have stopped investing in full time faculty members and tenure-track professors. Many of these adjuncts don't even have Master's Degrees AT ALL, or even in the area in which they are teaching. How is that possible? Students (parents) are paying a premium price tag but aren't even getting quality professors. Instead, Mitchell pays current full time staff to teach classes on the side. My son told me that the woman who manages the cafeteria is now teaching a hospitality class, the lady from financial aid teaches accounting, and some one with just a bachelor's degree is teaching psychology. My son will be transferring after this semester as we are SO disappointed in the empty promises Mitchell offered. Save your money and find a different school."
College Junior,1,I do not like the food at all.
College Freshman,1,It's very dangerous if you leave campus on your own. There is a lot of crime in the surrounding area so I choose to never leave campus without being in a car...
College Sophomore,1,Can't wait to transfer. When you first come to the school every body ask you why did you choose the school and I always wondered why do dey ask that because the school is so horrible even teachers and stuff don't even understand why people apply to the school
College Sophomore,1,They don't need to be strict is not a normal college
College Sophomore,1,"The school is run to take care of artistic people so a normal person will feel very uncomfortable unlike me I didn't no it was like that I wish I would have done more research before I went to this hell I regret it everyday. Since the school

Small the teachers have time to help u that's the (only) good thing but it has 20% graduation rate which is bad top 50 as worst school wit graduation rate so it will be hard to get a Job wit a degree from the school as I kept on to research"
College Sophomore,1,After classes there's nothing to do nothing that goes on just bordem.  I just stay in my room and wish to leave and go home every weekend. There's nothing positive because of the school being so dead it will peruse you to smoke marijuana. The school changes you because is that bad you can be against smoking and later turned into a pot head or other drug because there ain't nothing to do is that bad so be-careful or (stay away) is the best choice
College Sophomore,1,Basketball is good. But they don't really face any hard competition because the school is not a normal school more like handicap
College Sophomore,1,Bad place first day in the area I saw a guy take a mans car and almost ran him over is just a bad school basically bad environment everything bad
College Sophomore,1,It was hell I was asked to do the same thing over and over
College Freshman,1,"This school is a school that is entirely drowned in marijuana. it corrupts everyone if they allow it. Even my roommate, someone who was completely anti-marijuana, ended up doing it in order to fit in with his group of friends, because of that it ruined our friendship because i am anti-marijuana."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't have a car or a weekly allowance of $300, then there's nothing to do in or around New London.

Crime is noticeable high and several students have already been mugged. By no means is New London a decent college town."
College Sophomore,1,"Once again, more than a third of the students here are seriously disabled. As a result, man students are incapable of successfully managing healthy and normal relationships. Physical abnormalities are also present in many of these students."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is designed for students with serious disabilities. The school's curriculums reflects this, as most 100 level classes offer the same level of intensity as a first year high school course."
College Sophomore,1,"The college's student body primarily consists of seriously disabled students, athletes of non-white heritage, socially inept LGBT community members and substance abusers. The school is nearly half white and a majority of the students come from upperclass backgrounds."
College Sophomore,1,"This may literally be the worst school in the whole entire world. I came to this school unaware of it's 25+% population of seriously emotionally unstable, socially immature and intellectually challenged students. I regret ever transferring here."
College Sophomore,1,"Students without cars have no more than tree taxi services to utilize. Each company provides non-competitive rates and will charge students as much as $8 for a mile ride. Drivers consistently over-charge students, as they continually ""adjust their rates"". Walking into town is both tedious and dangerous, so I urge you to bring a car."
College Sophomore,1,"The school's gym consists of two separate levels. The first floor is a workout area with literally less than a dozen machines, fairly decent weightlifting equipment and a small, sectioned-off aerobics area with matted floors.

The second level is a small gymnasium used for both basketball and volleyball. It's an incredibly small space, but I guess it's what one would expect from a Division III school. The bleachers are the generic extendable/retractable wooden types. Since Mitchell is a D3 school, it also lacks a swimming pool and track."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no social scene at Mitchell. ""Nightlife"" is non-existent, as a majority of students remain on campus drinking, fighting and smoking in their dorms. These activities start as early as 4:30pm and end as late as 3:00am. No school-regulated off-campus transportation is provided for students. Either you have a car, know someone with a car or constantly rely on a local taxi service. Mitchell College students lack an inkling of what partying really is."
College Sophomore,1,"A variety of students, including those who are disabled, get away with a tremendous amount of ""rule breaking"". A noticeable portion of students, particularly males, drink and smoke marijuana on campus. 

Violence is taken too seriously, yet the possession of illegal substances and the performance of acts such as underage drinking are comfortably tolerated.

Academically, the college is a complete and utter joke. Mitchell offers scholarships to anyone who can pass a low-level class. As a result, a majority of the students there are either seriously disabled or simply unmotivated.

Academic and disciplinary probation aren't strictly enforced and the process of receiving a hearing, decision or appeal approval are unnecessarily long. The college does very little to communicate with its students."

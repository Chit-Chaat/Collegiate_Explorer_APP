I must say I am truly grateful. The faulty and staff members treats each and every student with honorable respect.

The students disciplinary is excellent and house warming. There isn’t any down fall that I dislike about this school .

Niche User,5,"It’s a small university, with great people. The campus itself is beautiful. I’m going there to play soccer and I love the athletic side of the school. The girls on the team are amazing. I grew up around st Thomas so I knew what it was about in the athletic side but the academic side of the school blew me away. I loved it"
Niche User,5,"I am a struggling student and the academic program St. Thomas has for their athletes is impressive. The support program offers accountability, responsibility  and commits to the success for all students."
Junior,5,"The school is beautiful and the Professors are excellent. I started here in my Junior year on a sport scholarship. I would just like to see more dorms for athletes as I’ve had to move in with my sister who’s 45 minutes away. I couldn’t stay at home because it would have been 2 hours each way. Other than that, this is an awesome school and experience."
Senior,5,"ST Thomas University is a well diverse university, the staff and professors show great interest in  our  success."
Sophomore,5,"St.Thomas University is an outstanding University with different cultures spread along campus and amazing professors. Campus life is spectacular and the classrooms makes you feel at home, with the advantage of being able to talk one on one with each and every professor."

I am impressed with the diversity of the student body and the care the faculty and staff are taking to ensure all students feel a part of the university and college life.
I am particularly impressed by the care the university is providing the campus itself and the new parts of the campus being built.  I can see there has been careful planning in the vision of the school and it's goals.
As my parents and I have gone to visit and complete the orientation process, I can see they genuinely care about their students and want them to be leaders in the community and excel in whatever they can in the future.  Kudos to STU!"
Freshman,5,"The University of St Thomas is an incredible school I highly recommend it. It is an academically rigorous university and attendance is required in most classes. If you choose this school, be prepared to stay engaged in class, participate as much as possible, and study daily. Aside from education, the facilities on campus are top-notch, I recommend checking out the fitness center it's huge and so beautiful. There is a ton to do off-campus, lots of shops, restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. If you're looking for more nightlife it's only a quick drive from the Florida A&M University! I can recommend this school highly enough."
Sophomore,5,At saint Thomas the campus is very pretty. the professors work with their students on any assignment they need help on. The professors give lots of feedback on what needs to be fix on a particular assignment. The class size is perfect for any student who doesn't like to be around a lot of people and it helps you learn better with less students then with a lot of students
Freshman,5,Saint Thomas University is a great school with a amazing environment and the students and faculty is immensely nice. One thing I'll like them to change is that they need to add more events for the school.
Freshman,5,I think it's a great school with a beautiful campus. I am stoked about being a student there and playing football with their school.
Freshman,5,"The campus is a bit small, but its easier to get to classes. The teachers are great! They explain very well and teach at a moderate pace to ensure that everyone fully understands. You can also ask extra questions after class, if you wish. The classes are also small, so you have more one-on- one learning experience. It feels similar to high school, only the workload is more and the teachers are more interesting. College life is amazing, well considering this is my first time off on my own. If you want to succeed and have an awesome learning experience, St. Thomas is for you."
Freshman,5,"Studying at STU is amazing! Everyday, I come out of class saying, ""I love college!"" all because of how amazing the school is. The campus is great, the diversity and its people are excellent, and the courses provide high standard academic requirements. With such attributed qualities, however, the cost of attendance is quite costly. Luckily, the university offers numerous amounts of scholarships to help its students pay for such a great education."
Freshman,5,Love my school. It is expensive but they offer a variety of different opportunities for scholarships. Free summer courses(up to 18 credits) !

Graduate Student,5,Students are well guided. The curriculum is rigid but well-taught by professors. All the professors are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are teaching. Your writing skills will be honed by the assignments and weekly discussion topics. The discussion thread is so much fun with students coming from different backgrounds. Professors interact with all the students online and gave timely feedback on all required assignments especially the research paper.
Junior,5,"The people are great, the professors are great, the whole staff is there to help you through your college years. There's a lot of Financial Aid available and a variety of courses from which to choose. It is a good school, very friendly and very green."

Niche User,5,"I went on a campus tour and was treated with the upmost respect and attitude by the staff, which is the main reason I applied and decided to become a freshman at St Thomas University.The diversity and Academic life, the students currently attending posed, was an added bonus to the already beautiful scenery of the campus. Every building and structure is perfectly placed to move from class to class with ease and reduced stress. When looking for a school with more emphasis on education and not partying St Thomas is a clear winner among others. From state of the art technology for nursing students and a law library open extended hours, this college shows its students it cares about their future as leaders. On thing to keep in mind however, is that its not all work and no play. St Thomas offers many on Campus student activities."
Niche User,5,"St. Thomas Univeristy is one University I've considered since i first heard about it. From many reviews that ive seen, THe NAF Program is one to join especially i want a career in that path. I actually haven't studied there but it would mean everyhting to get into this great school. The people are super nice and the make you feel as if you're home. Great service when it comes to getting information of the school."

Junior,4,"I Ike that my school has great professors, I would change the college tuition price if I had the chance. The campus is life is average"
Senior,4,"St. Thomas is a university that is known for how small it is which creates a better learning environment. It is easier for professors to know and help students when there are smaller class sizes. Also, it's more likely to know most of your peers which is also helpful in the learning environment. Overall, building connections and creating ""Leaders for Life"" is the biggest goal for the university."
Senior,4,"I'm not a student that usually does online classes. I am more of an on campus/in-class student. However, from what I hear as a student leader who's pretty well involved in the school, Ive heard that it is a good experience. According to the few classes I have taken online, they were pretty well structured and organized."
Sophomore,4,"When you first enter the campus, you have to go through the guard booth which provides a safe environment for visitors, students and staff. The surrounding area is decorated with greenery making it very beautiful. The staff on campus is very helpful and accommodating and will get you what you need in a timely manner."

Freshman,4,"Although, I did not take any classes online. I did have to do my orientation online and the process was pretty easy."
Freshman,4,"I will be a freshman this year, but based on what I heard from students that go there and the few visits I took. I feel that STU will bring many fun experiences and provide a good education."

Senior,4,"Unlike any other online program or schooling that I have done, St. Thomas' online schooling feels just as engaging as being in person. The professors still manage to keep high encouragement as well as liable availability for any questions or any further clarification."
Freshman,4,I took online classes early fall and also when the coronavirus was present. I enjoyed taking online classes because I had the opportunity to finish my assignments early and it was much easier to communicate with my professors if I didn't understand a specific lesson rather than asking in front of the whole class.
Junior,4,"Attending Saint Thomas University has been a good experience so far. The campus is very well secured. The faculty and professors are very understanding. The classroom sizes are small, with about 15-25 students per class and this is perfect because the classes are not cramped and the students understand better with the professors. The campus life is a little dull, the university needs more activities for the students."
Niche User,4,"As an incoming freshman, I feel Saint Thomas has already made me feel so welcomed. I am excited to begin college and continue furthering my education with them."
Graduate Student,4,"St. Thomas is an expensive private school but they work with older students who decide to make career changes. The school is most known for their Law School and Nursing Program. I am a law student. The school offered me scholarships when I initially enrolled and depending on what grades you make after your first year, they reassess your scholarship amounts.

I think that St. Thomas was the best choice for me because it is a small community that looks out for each other. The deans have an open door policy and truly care about your success. 

The only cons to the law school are: 
Private school tuition 
Limited parking
Limited food options
Limited professors (if you get one you don't like, good luck. You may have them again)
You can't control your exam schedule"
Junior,4,"My two years at St. Thomas has been very pleasent. Because of its small size, I am able to speak to my professors privately and receive help from them. It is a very friendly campus community, also very clean. The dorms are very nice! I"
Niche User,4,"I’m not a student to to the institution. However I did attend their open house for the nursing program. Base on the info provided, it seem to be a outstanding school.

Sophomore,4,"I haven't been long at St. Thomas, but I do not regret my decision. The staff is always helpful in any department. The students are great people and there is a great diversity."
Freshman,4,"The campus is a bit small, but its easier to get to classes. The teachers are great! They explain very well and teach at a moderate pace to ensure that everyone fully understands. You can also ask extra questions after class, if you wish. The classes are also small, so you have more one-on- one learning experience. It feels similar to high school, only the workload is more and the teachers are more interesting. College life is amazing, well considering this is my first time off on my own. If you want to succeed and have an awesome learning experience, St. Thomas is for you."
Senior,4,My experience was good but I think the security is a little to strict because most students or adults move away to school to gain independents but if the school gives you curfew; you might as well live at home and some homes you do not have curfews.
College Sophomore,4,I would choose the school again because the academics are worth it and the school has prestige
College Freshman,4,I have not witnessed any underaged drinking or drug use.
College Freshman,4,I do not live on campus but the buildings are maintained very well and the students have easy access to food at all times. The campus also provides transportation to some locations in the area.
College Junior,4,"STU is small, diverse and caring school. The professors love their subjects and really care about the student's future. You have many opportunities to do well and form connections that will help in the future. It has an amazing research program with those students studying in STEM fields. It's an opportunity to get experience earlier than most students. That opportunity alone makes this school incredible."
College Freshman,4,I don't live on Campus but they look pretty great.
College Freshman,4,Great facilities to work out in
College Freshman,4,The staff and teacher are ready to help me with anything I need.

College Senior,4,My specific major at St.Thomas Is Psychology. It is a challenging major at ST.U but I as a student strive to what I want to succeed in. My dream is to  major in Psychology therefore challenges is what helps me learn.
College Senior,4,"One of the internships I have been apart of is called North Dade youth and family coalition. My commitment to this internship was very committed, I loved coming in early around 10 Am every day and leaving at 5 pm in the afternoon. When times were extremely busy I wouldn't ever mind staying late passed my given work hours. My responsibilities were to help out the coalition with any needed services. I also helped plugging in data that needed to be put into system for coalition and researcher that used our data to help his researches ( Was a professor at S.T.U's research assistant) ."
College Senior,4,At St. Thomas University Greek students versus non Greek students seem to have an indifferent viewpoint towards one another. Our campus is small therefore our campus becomes a community and all student no matter where from have no better view point them one another.
College Sophomore,4,When you get all your required courses out of the way that's when you can finally go for what you've been dreaming of your entire life. The difficulties is that some professors do not care. The most important criteria for admission is to make sure your financial aid is good.The program that I'm in is not difficult at all. The tips i can offer for admission is always know the status of your financial aid and make sure you register early.
College Freshman,4,Personally I love shopping so there is always a different place to shop everywhere we go.
College Freshman,4,You have to make sure you are very persistent. They have a lot of people to deal with so definitely be on them.
College Freshman,4,There is not much to do on campus but if you're above 18 going out in either ft Lauderdale or south beach is very fun and where you can find most of the STU family.
College Freshman,4,The professors here at St. Thomas offer so much to the students and to the school itself. It's easy to have a personal relationship with them due to the class sizes being no larger than 30 and up to as small as 6. They really challenge you and are very understanding. I haven't had a problem with any of my professors.
College Sophomore,4,i love being apart of WSTU95 the
College Junior,4,theft is an issue that I want more focus on
College Senior,4,"The school has high academic expectations. Therefore it is frowned upon to cheat. People have been kicked out, and they should have been."
College Senior,4,"I never have a hard time parking on campus. There are spots that fill up quickly, but that is not the part of campus I need to be in."
College Senior,4,I have never seen drug use at our school.
College Senior,4,My school was the first to offer the undergraduate degree in my program. They are pioneers. I like being a part of history. They are great conduits of putting their students in great positions to be successful.
College Senior,4,Our campus is very diverse. We also have many international students. I love it!
College Senior,4,It is located 15-20 minutes from South Beach. Need I say more?
College Senior,4,Our school has great faculty and small classes. You really get a chance to get to know your professors and your fellow classmates. The school provides plenty of opportunities to get good practice. Our Alumni are very open to answer questions and offer advice and share their stories.
College Student,4,I am born and raised in Miami so I can always find something to do from visiting family to walking South Beach 
Niche User,2,"They have hired a new president that hopes to make STU a better university. Bringing football to the school may draw better teachers, but the athletic programs needs a complete make-over. As well as updating policies and procedures for registration, applying for financial aid, course selection, and having a counselor, etc. Attending has not been a great experience, and some professors could care less about teaching, they are only there to receive a check  - and that's when they do show up for class. The professors do have their favorites, and they need to be more diverse and give everyone a chance to learn. 
The campus is very pretty, small but easy to maneuver. 
The dorms are very outdated and overpriced. And the campus food is very unhealthy, pricey, and not good.
The students are nice, and a lot of different ethnicity. It has been educational learning about the different cultures through the students. 
Being a Catholic university was important also."
College Senior,2,"No one really cares. Maybe it's because all the athletes are jerks, especially the Volleyball team"
College Senior,2,Party scene at our campus is low. Most activities at our campus are not very fun in my opinion.
College Freshman,2,I don't really know much about off campus living.. Sorry.
College Senior,2,There are really no options for eating. There are two.  The food you can get is not the tastiest.
College Senior,2,"Students here look very homely, which is surprising because we are located in Miami. I also realize that we are a Catholic school and maybe fashion for most is not important. Not much effort is taken into what their outward appearance looks like. "
College Senior,2,"There aren't really any close restaurants besides the usual junk/fast food like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell, etc. There is a fish & chips place which is different from the typical fast food burger joints. You have to drive several blocks to get there though because the university is located near the airport and residential neighborhoods. "
College Sophomore,2,The food in the cafeteria is good once a month. I recommend the rathskellar.
College Sophomore,2,Closest club from schools is about 30 min. one or two parties in school the whole year.
College Senior,2,Not enough variety. Food lacks seasoning or any flavour for that matter.
College Sophomore,2,the school cracked down hard on the greek life when there was a mishap at a hotel and too much partying in the nineties so it is not really a presence right now
College Senior,2,"Catholic University – Since this a Catholic school, there are strict rules when it comes to dance team and cheerleading routines. They do not want anything too sexual. They are very strict about money issues, pay up or get kicked out or sent to collections."
College Senior,2,"Average College Students – Most the students dress relaxed. Since it is Miami, girls wear mostly tank tops, shorts, skirts, and summer dresses; as well as sandals and flip flops. The guys tend to wear polos or t-shirts and long shorts or jeans. Popular brands for males and females are aeropostale, abercrombie, hollister, gilly hicks,american eagle, mossimo, candies (for girls), and anything from Macys. Stores shopped at are mainly Macy's, Kohls, Walmart, Forever 21 and Target. Social life is typical, since it is a small school everyone knows everybody. Most people prefer to date people off campus to avoid drama. The students are usually from the surrounding area, although there are out of staters from new york, pennsylvania, etc. Also frm all over Florida. There are alot of Hispanics (mainly Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans), West Indians, and Asians (mainly Chinese, Koreans, Russians), Eastern Europeans, and African Americans."
College Junior,2,"Cost to Live Near St.Thomas – Cost is quite high on the area surrounding St. Thomas University. It is a rather wealthy neighborhood and landlords think they can charge us students those smae wealthy rent prices, but a student has very limited resources and rents should take that into considration."
Freshman,1,"Terrible school. Teacher do not care. Staff is very rude. They said there were ""free"" summer classes, which is false you are basically paying for it in your Fall and Spring tuition, but not taking the classes until summer."
Graduate Student,1,"The coursework is rigorous which is a good thing, however education programs do not lead to certification as suggested by the dean and all promotional materials."
College Freshman,1,We don't have fraternities or sororities
College Senior,1,It is super expensive and for no reason. The dorms suck.
College Sophomore,1,i hate where i live i really would like a scholarship to live on campus
College Senior,1,"We do not have any quality dining off campus. Everything is fast food and non-healthy eating options. It is very disappointing,especially if you are trying to watch what your food intake is."
College Student,1,Financial aid is so overwhelming because of the long detailed questions.
College Sophomore,1,"dining on campus is terrible, nothing is close enough to walk to and get food unless you have a car."
College Freshman,1,The pavement and walkpath getrs slippery and there are only 10 minutes intervals between classes. Classes that are on the other side of the campus with no cover up that you have to run under the rain.
College Senior,1,Not located in the best of neighborhoods and not many options of getting to school if you do not have a car
College Sophomore,1,"There are not many activities or people on campus. Most students are commuters, there are not that many campus residence."
College Senior,1,I am a commuter school policies hardly affect me. With the exception of two grade replacement rule. D is for dumb since the L letter doesn't exist.
College Senior,1,"Dining Around Town – There are not too many places too eat near the school, but a few miles away there are plenty of great restaurants, and night life."
College Freshman,1,the schools nightlife is prettyquite there is not alot of activities going on
College Freshman,1,there aren't really off housing options here in miami for st.thomas university students unless you already live in miami
College Freshman,1,There are no food facilities near that are in walking distance...

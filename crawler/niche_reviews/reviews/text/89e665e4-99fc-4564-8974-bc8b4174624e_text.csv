Niche User,5,USA is an amazing school with tons of resources and options for every kind of person. There is something for everyone at South.
Niche User,5,"I took several online courses at the University of South Alabama. The online course curriculum, combined with external education resources, make the experience worth it."
Niche User,5,I received a B.A. in English Literature from the University of South Alabama. I have a concentration in Creative Writing and a minor in Political Science. The best part of the university is the faculty. One-on-one guidance and educational resources that were provided to me were essential in preparation for the work force.
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman entering during a crazy time.....Covid-19, but the university made it easy to make sure I was ready. Communication was excellent for any question I had whether it be of a professor or a department. Even the bookstore was super helpful."
Freshman,5,"Everything I did to get ready for my freshman year had to be done remotely. It went very smooth. I have not started my online classes yet, but my professors have been very helpful in answering my questions. The university did a good job at zooming  info on how to use canvas so that students were ready to do web classes."
Senior,5,"I have not taken any online classes at USA. However, when we were required to switch to online learning due to COVID-19, the transition was smooth and effortless. Overall a wonderful experience."
Freshman,5,I will be taking some online classes and some of my professors has got in touch with me and has told me what I will be needing for their class.
Freshman,5,I have not yet visited South Alabama but while going through the process of registering for classes and getting ready to move on campus the advisors and everyone else has been a great help for me. If I reach out to them they have a quick response and are very much helpful and they make the process so much easier.
Junior,5,"I did take classes online. This past spring, my English and other general classes went over very easy and the Zoom app really helped in making that possible. The fault is where I took art classes, specifically animation. It was hard to communicate with my professor and impossible to get the programs needed to succeed in the class. I would not advise taking it online until you have the programs required."
Sophomore,5,"It definitely was an adjustment, but the teachers were so understanding and willing to learn right alongside with us.  Overall it was a great experience and I can not wait to be back on campus to learn in the fall!"
Sophomore,5,I LOVE South!! It is like a second home and the atmosphere is so inviting.  The people are so welcoming and I love spending time there.  The libraries are a great place to study and get some coffee.
Sophomore,5,My online experience at USA was very good. The instructors balanced school work online and in the classroom and made it very easy to do classes online.
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of South Alabama! USA is a smaller school, which means the amount of students in a classroom in less. This allows teachers to work with students individually and insure you know what is happening in the class. USA plans many events for the students to ensure you have a great time while you are there."
Sophomore,5,The University of South Alabama has one of the most family like communities. I am from Mobile so I grew up going to several events at South and at a young age I always knew that it was the college I wanted to attend. South Alabama also has great diversity and some really great professors. The class sizes are small which gives you the opportunity to meet new people and also create a connection with your professor and fellow classmates. I would 10/10 recommend South Alabama to anyone!
Junior,5,I took classes on campus. The professors use the online website to share things that we went over in class and things we need to help us.
Junior,5,"The environment is amazing, so many friendly people. The teacher are always willing to help when you are lost. The one thing I would like to change are the class sizes."
Sophomore,5,I was very unsure how the transition to online courses would be. I was pleasantly surprised with how extremely easy the transition was to online classes. I actually enjoyed taking online classes
Sophomore,5,The University of South Alabama is truly a wonderful university. The staff  welcomes all the students in with a welcoming smile and a friendly attitude. The University makes me feel like I am meant to be there.
Senior,5,My online classes were worth taking because you are still able to get in touch with the professor. And you have time to get each assignment done on time.
Senior,5,I like the fact that the professors take their time to teach every student in their class. I had a great experience at USA. I wouldn't change a thing.
Junior,5,"I have only had 1 online class so far at South, but after taking that one class online I have scheduled 3 for the upcoming summer semester and 3 for the fall semester. I was nervous about the online classroom because I had never had an online class before, but after taking one I found out that it is just as interactive as an in class experience, and I actually learn better when I can move at my own pace, and like the opportunity to get ahead."
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Alabama is excellent 4-year University! It has a beautiful campus close to the beaches and it makes me feel right at home. Everyone, from students to faculty and staff, are very friendly and they will go great lengths to make sure you are on the right track and successful in you academic careers. I am a nursing major and I just recently finished my freshman year. South has a really good nursing program and many great opportunities within the College of Nursing. Along with that, there are many clubs, organizations, honor societies, Greek organizations to be a part of. Currently, I am a member of the Alpha Epsilon Delta, which is an honor society for pre-health majors. Furthermore, the campus is a nice size! It is not too big and not too small. There are a lot of great resources, such as the Jagtran, which is a bus system that students can use to go to their classes. One thing that South can improve on is the Dining Hall. It gets pretty messy in there sometimes."
Freshman,5,I am currently finishing my freshman year at South Alabama and I absolutely love it. The campus is beautiful and makes me feel like I am at home. Everyone is friendly and the professors do everything to make you feel important.
Sophomore,5,Great school for Biology Majors.  Also has wonderful opportunities for Marine Biology. Great school for commuters that do not live too far away.
Senior,5,"It's been great! I'm looking forward to my final two semesters at this great school. The atmosphere and academics are top notch, and I'm grateful to be apart of the Jags family."
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at the University of South Alabama, and it has given me many opportunities even with the virus keeping us from in person classes."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of South Alabama was really amazing. The people were very welcoming and energetic. I loved how the campus is set up. Th campus is spread out, but it is not too big. They keep everything nice and neat and clean. They have a lot of variety of foods on campus so you will not have to leave as much. The transportation that they have is a bus and I really think it is very helpful for people who do not drive or for people that do not want to walk to their next class. Overall, I love South Alabama and I cannot wait to be a future jag."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and in an ideal location. The resident halls are particularly nice and the administration is extremely helpful.
Freshman,5,"This university has been my home away from home. I am able to join new clubs, have access to multiple resources for my academics, and I am also still in the South where I can be close to the beach! I have been able to branch out of my shell and meet so many great people through Greek life. While maintaining a job and sorority I have managed to have good grades with the help of my professors."
Freshman,5,"South is a wonderful school full of wonderful people. I'll admit, it wasn't my first choice, but I am more than happy with this school."
Freshman,5,"Great School.  Close to activities and Florida beaches.  Campus life has all that you could want including resort style pool, climbing gym a workout facilities.  Dining is great too."
Senior,5,My time at South was a memorable one. I was very lost in what I wanted to do for a major then I saw there was a Hospitality and Tourism department. It was fairly new at the time and me already being in the restaurant industry I decided why not? I chose this as a major and never looked back. The professors and the entire department have been nothing but amazing and encouraging and I can not thank them enough. The campus itself has gone through some renovations in the past few years and it look incredible! It is definitely a world class campus with potential to grow even bigger.
Graduate Student,5,I’m an online student in the BSN to DNP nursing program. It is an organized and rigorous program that will prepare you for advanced practice nursing. You visit the campus for onsite skills training that is taught by professors who also teach the medical students. Did I mention the program is comparatively affordable as well?!
Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my first year as a freshman and look forward to continuing the rest of my college years at the University of South Alabama. My major is Elementary Education. My professors so far have been very helpful and knowledgeable. The campus is easy to get around. My only complaint is the parking. There could be definitely more areas to park that would help the student flow to each class.
Freshman,5,I’ve had the best experience going to South! It has made my first year away from home easy. Classes have been fairly close together so I’m not walking miles and the tran is amazing.
Niche User,5,I haven't started taking classes there yet but I loved the college visit and the guide was so knowledge full and so positive that all of us were going to go there. I absolutely thing the campus is the most beautiful and well-built campus' that I have been too.
Niche User,5,"Everyone there made you feel very welcome. I was able to make friends in my classes very easily which helped when there was a test because we were able to make a study group. The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the recreational facility has an amazing gym that is available to all students."
Junior,5,"I love my college. The professors are outstanding and make learning so much fun. The campus is big and beautiful. Although the campus is big, the university provides amazing transportation for students. The student center is wonderful, it offers great food options ranging from not so healthy to super healthy. The faculty and staff are all very nice and welcoming. Each department does their best to go over and beyond to meet your needs. I feel 100000% safe on campus because of the amazing campus police that we have access to 24/7. There are a ton of resources that students have access to, for example counseling and testing. This is by far one of the best universities to attend to. Students have a say in their education and it is great to know that our voices matter."
Niche User,5,"I love South atmosphere. The energy is amazing and everyone is very helpful and caring.  South has grew over the many years, I can truly say I am a Future Jag!"
Sophomore,5,"The university addresses the concerns of parents and students during the school tour and orientation phase. The event is well organized. Once the preliminary business is handled, the faculty and staff continue to work together with the common goal of student success. The accessibility to teachers and advisers is above average. The differentiation of activities for students was the most impressive.  The list of glows are endless, but the only thing I would like to see are band auxiliaries such as flag, dancers, and majorettes. I feel the football season would draw more support if the halftime show is full of entertainment."
Freshman,5,"Coming from an incoming freshman, I have fallen in love with everything about the University of South Alabama. From the location to the professors, South Alabama is lovely. If you ever have a question, each department contacts you back immediately with precision. The campus is beautiful and has a lot of areas for students to learn and congregate outside of the classroom. Class sizes are small enough to get that one on one feel with professors. Although the University of South Alabama is located in the big city of Mobile, Alabama, the campus has its small town feel so everyone feels secure no matter the time or day. I would definitely recommend this university."
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Alabama is a spectacular school with some amazing professors, most of which are not only active in their field and many also make substantial contributions through their studies. Furthermore, the campus is fairly large with numerous amenities, and has several successful sports programs, with the female volleyball team holding the title for 3 years running currently."
Freshman,5,"Well I'm a incoming student, but so far I'm in love with the school and my overall experiences there."
Junior,5,"I am a returning student to University of South Alabama, and it is the best experience I have had in college!!"
Alum,5,"I loved the atmosphere the college establishes. The faculty and staff are very helpful and friendly. Depending upon the department, there are many opportunities for research and fellowships to continue your education. They teach for you to excel in life not just to pass the exam. There are so many organizations that students can become a part of along with multiple opportunities for volunteering."
Sophomore,5,South is growing and it's absolutely amazing. You can tell that the staff really care about your success. The school is small as far as student population goes. This is good for students who like one on one time with their professors. South Alabama is most known for their nursing and engineering program.
Freshman,5,Although I love this school the main thing I would change is the campus. The layout and area that the college encompasses could definitely be organized better and expanded. More parking and a central outdoor area would vastly improve the layout of the campus.
Freshman,5,I completed my first year at South as a new incoming student straight from high school. The campus is beautiful and you are 30 minutes from Dauphin Island and one hour from Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. There are many cool things to do on campus and the Jaguar Productions Team always has great things going on in the student center and all around campus.
Freshman,5,Im excited to see how different the city is than where I live. From what i've seen the living style is great there. So many activities for you to do. The beach is close which is an even bigger bonus! The university is clean and well maintained.
Junior,5,This University is very diverse and the professors are amazing. The only thing that they should change is keeping the books the same so that students can offered buying and renting them.
Freshman,5,"It is so far from home, but the people here make it feel like a new home. I love going to the events and meeting new people because everyone is so friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,5,"This is my first year at South. I recently transferred. my experience is everything I thought it would be, from meeting new people, to hard school work, but in the end, it is all going to be worth it. Although one thing I would like to change is the amount of parking, because there is never enough."
Junior,5,"Being a transfer student, I was more than nervous about starting somewhere new again. South was very helpful in my transition process and never made me feel worried or anxious about my academics. Advisors and teachers are always available, too. There is a welcoming environment on campus. The Social Work program is remarkable, and I am very excited to see what my future holds with this major."
Junior,5,I like going to the University of South Alabama because it is a very diverse school. They also offer amazing tutoring programs to help students pass their classes. Also being at the College of Engineering is great as well because the professors and staff really take pride in grooming the future engineers.
Freshman,5,"The experience was amazing! I felt at home, & so welcome when on campus. My mother is one tough cookie, and even she felt the love there. I advise anyone interested in a great learning opportunity to apply. This has been a life changing experience."
Junior,5,I like going to the University of South Alabama because it is a very diverse school. They also offer amazing tutoring programs to help students pass their classes.
Freshman,5,I am curently loving my freshman year at south. I got a 4.0 the first semester and mad the presidents list. it was pretty easy but the professors made it easy. my favorite was Mrs. Delaney Tucker. we really connected over the summer. i ended her class with a 97.
Niche User,5,I love the fact that it is very clean around the campus and that students that go there are friendly. If I could change something it would be to change the football stadium and add more parking spaces around the campus because parking is horrible.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love the University of South Alabama. I am an elementary education major and I love the experiences we get in the schools during student teaching. All of my professors have been great to me and have helped me through the hard transition to college my freshman year and now to real life. I think this university is the perfect size for me. It is up and coming and will continue to get better in the future. As of now, some things I would like to see change is student support in athletics. I am on the dance team and we dance at every basketball game, and there are barely any students there. The same goes for football, students will come for a while but leave after the first quarter. I think this will continue to get better as they are building an on campus stadium, but I would like to see it change for other sports than just football. Overall, this University was my top choice and I am so happy that I chose it to continue my education."
Graduate Student,5,The university is challenging. I like the flexibility of the programs they offer. They offer programs for traditional and nontraditional students. The programs are rigorous but doable.
Niche User,4,Online classes were very well set up and easy to access. The professors handled the situation very well.
Alum,4,"I transferred to south during my junior year and received a Bachelor of Social Work with a minor in Military Science. My wife received her BSW from here as well. I loved my time at South...The campus is quite beautiful and has just about everything you need. My professors have all been amazing and the coursework was fairly challenging at times. My only gripe was with the sudden and drastic increase in parking fines and tuition. Kind of odd it happened right around the time they were rejected some dunding to build the new football stadium..Because of my GI Bill I could have attended pretty much any school in the state, and I am so glad that I ended up choosing south. Would recommend to anyone."
Senior,4,"The Elementary Education program is FANTASTIC. All of the advisors are so sweet and very helpful. They are truly interested in the well-being of the students in the program. The workers in the Financial Aid department could stand to be a little more helpful, but overall, they are great. South Alabama is a great school."
Alum,4,"Online classes were well organized and informative. Professors were usually easy to contact and understanding of technical issues and life changes. Most online classes were less demanding of time than in-classroom options. It is unfortunate, however, that certain classes were only offered in an online format which limited class discussion and the opportunity for learners to select the format best for their learning style."
Alum,4,"I did not take online classes while attending  Univ. of South Alabama. However, I have heard great things about online classes."
Freshman,4,Just entering this year as a freshman so have not taken any classes as of yet.  I will be starting this fall semester and plan to live on campus.
Junior,4,"I came to South from a small town in northwest Alabama 5 hours away, and I found my place on campus very quickly. I have had amazing professors and made genuine connections with them. I love my school and could not be more happy with my decision to come to South Alabama."
Junior,4,"At the university of south Alabama, I felt welcomed as soon as I stepped foot on campus. I was nervous about college but for some reason south jsut felt like home. I have been there for 2 years now, and I still love it just as much. I am excited to return to campus and use the new football stadium."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled in The Mitchell College of Business at The University of South Alabama. I feel that the business program that South offers is one of the best around! I know that I am getting a great education from some of the best professors. However, I wish that South's overall campus life was a little more lively. There should be more events to encourage students during each semester. South also provides a bus service to students but it is not the most reliable to get to class. I would also advise incoming students to live on-campus because it is more affordable than off-campus housing. Everyone at South is so nice and it doesn't take long to find a great group of friends!"
Sophomore,4,My time at South has been great. The professors are very helpful and I really enjoy my classes. I recommend South Alabama to anyone seeking a great education and great campus. Go Jags!!
Junior,4,"I really have enjoyed my time thus far attending at the University of South Alabama (USA). The campus is beautifully kept and I have not been overwhelmed by the number of students that is on campus. All off my past instructors were knowledgeable and the class sizes were not overly large. I cannot classify this as a party campus, but I have made friends from around the country. The cafeteria food is somewhat to be desired, but it did keep me from starving.  I would recommend anyone who do not want to attend a large college campus to consider USA."
Senior,4,"The professors are hands on and want you to succeed. The campus is absolutely beautiful, and makes you feel like you are not in the middle of a city. I have not had a great experience when exploring Mobile, as the night scene can become sketchy and the city is dirty. However, if you stay near campus it does not give a downtown vibe but more of a college town one. Campus safety needs to be stronger."
Niche User,4,"I look forward to starting my college experience at South Alabama in Fall 2020. After taking the tour and talking with friends already enrolled there, I feel like it will be the perfect place for me."
Sophomore,4,Parking is definitely the worst part of this campus. Zoned parking doesn't have enough spaces and parking out of zone will result in a ticket/s. Jagtrans are very unreliable and can result in being late to class. Academics are pretty good. Most professors really care about students and want to see them succeed.
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at the University of South Alabama has been anything less of Good. The campus food is good, the sporting events are a ton of fun, and the professors are good at teaching their material. The only thing I'd like to see change is how they could work to improve the traffic flow of the campus."
Junior,4,"I had a little trouble adjusting at first to life on campus, but now I am getting around well.  It's a nice campus.  Places to eat are pretty conveniently located.  My dorm is probably one of the oldest on campus but I like it.   There are a lot of places to eat and shop nearby.  I hope to find employment in the coming year.  My options are pretty great.  USA is a great place to attend college."
Alum,4,"My time at South was really enjoyable, being an out-of-state student I feel like I wouldn’t have had the same experience if I stayed in state so I’m glad I made the decision to come out here and meet new people and just experience something new. The food is decent, there are a lot of events/activities/parties outside of class so I feel like I got a lot of The “college experience” ."
Niche User,4,"It is located in the beautiful city that is Mobile, Alabama. It has a lovely campus. People at this university are friendly, and professors here are polite and understanding. The food here is decent, and could be better. The University of South Alabama has great internships and graduate programs."
Senior,4,"Though I have yet to see the campus for myself, online resources have been a great way for me to visit the campus virtually.  South Alabama appears to be a friendly and welcoming university that centers in educating their students as well as making them feel at home. Their faculty is all hands on deck and willing to put their all into helping each and every individual to use their full potential. With this said, USA is centered on nurturing their students to be successful within the career that they have chosen."
Freshman,4,I like the friendliness of the staff and the safe campus with many opportunities to make new friends.
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere of USA. The culture is very academic, and the campus is huge and separate from the rest of the city of Mobile."
Junior,4,The professors at the University of South Alabama are very passionate about the fields that the teach in. They are always willing to do what they can to help students as long as they ask for help. The only problem at the moment is that the school is growing so much that construction is year round and can slow the usual pace of getting from place to place on campus.
Freshman,4,University of South Alabama is  a school that maintains focus on the development of their students. It's a great place to realize what works for you and what does not.
Junior,4,"My experience has been wonderful with the classes, professors, and other students. I have made many bonds with my classmates and have found a love and passion in my degree that I am pursuing along with them. And when I lived on campus, everything was so much fun and it was easy to get around and get involved. The only thing that is irritating is the parking lot rules and the tickets are extremely expensive."
Senior,4,"What I liked about the University of South Alabama the most was the opportunities and connections I have made while I have been here. Also the campus itself is absolutely beautiful. While at South I got the opportunity to work along side the athletic trainers team for multiple sports as an internship, that was great experience for the degree that I want to pursue. My experience at South has helped me grow educationally and personally in ways that I never would have imagine possible. I would highly recommend the University of South Alabama."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful! The squirrels will realy brighten your day. However, it can be rather loud at night which make it rough to sleep sometimes if you live in Epsilon  or 2. The teachers want to help you learn and will let you visit to discover education opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"So far my classes have been ridiculously easy. I get somewhat frustrated that I pay the amount of money they require, but I feel like I am not really learning anything."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy studying at the University of South Alabama. The campus is great. This campus is my home. If I were to change something about this campus, it would probably be to advertise more about tutoring programs and also to encourage students to get more involved in organizations like clubs or sororities/ fraternities."
Freshman,4,"Great Campus, friendly people, NASTY FOOD. Not a super intresting town but great school, not gonna lie, pretty boring but theres things to do if you want to be in the party scene. Dry campus blows and the fact that the football stadium is off campus and all the way downtown is annoying. but its all changing. NO CUTE BOYS!!!"
Freshman,4,"Classes are great, and textbooks are not really a problem paying for since there are many affordable options. However, the school is very big and personally I find it hard to navigate and often am late to class because the bus system runs slow, or my next class is a 20 minute walk with 15 minutes to get there. Despite this, professors are understanding because most of the time they are running across campus, too. Overall, I am very happy attending South."
Graduate Student,4,"There is great support from professors and staff, particularly in the nursing field. In studying for acute care nurse practitioner the faculty have been extremely supportive of my goals."
Freshman,4,I have had a great experience at South Alabama! They have helped guided me towards what I want to be in the future. I have gotten very involved on campus and have met really amazing people!
Freshman,4,Great school with smart professors who truly want the students to succeed and learn the material. The campus is very pretty and they are adding more things. The school is overall a nice university and has many opportunities to get involved in campus.
Senior,4,"I am encouraged to be a member and student at the University of South Alabama  (USA) family.  
USA has given me the insight  to understand my academics weaknesses and methods to  strengthen my abilities to perform at a high level.   The campus life has help me make a positive transformation to use great problem solving skills each and everyday.  Through God’s will! I will be receiving my second degree from USA in 2020."
Senior,4,"I had a phenomenal experience, but am starting to see the accounting program degrade. South's accounting program is trying to shift to online. The online professors seem to care more about their convenience and lackadaisical schedule than ensuring the students learn. The online program should not be continued. Students pay to learn the material, and that is only happening in the in-person format. I'm glad I got through the program when I did before the Business College's Accounting program began shifting away from in person. Greek Life was great but different than the experience you would get at larger schools. It's super easy to get involved and make a difference campus-wide. You literally can make a difference anywhere, and there are numerous opportunities available to you, both relating to your major and external interests."
Freshman,4,"USA is a beautiful campus in the heart of Mobile, AL.  Athletics are a big part of the university and are very competitive.  Student life is excellent with something to do for everyone.  Academics are great with some of the best departments in the country."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful, and the professors care. Everyone here is generally really nice. There are plenty of opportunities to grow here!"
Graduate Student,4,I began taking graduate nursing classes via South Alabama's online MSN program.  I selected to apply to this program after doing some research on top programs within the country. So far the courses have been well organized and the professors have been very helpful.  I believe this university stands by it's values and mission.  I will have to travel to the campus twice throughout the 2 year program and look forward to seeing what the physical campus has to offer.
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience with South has been pretty good. Most of the faculty and staff care about your education and are very accommodating when problems arise. For example, I was recently in need of a time-override code, so I could register for some required classes that conflicted with each other. The professors and English Department were very understanding and did everything they could to help. I've had some very good teachers here, and I know what I've learned will stick with me for the rest of my life."
Niche User,4,I am currently planning on attending South Alabama. I toured it over the summer and thought it was a great place. The fact that it’s in a sizable metro area like Mobile is nice as well!
Graduate Student,4,excellent academic advisor assistance with application for only MSN-NP program.  staff emailed me back quickly.  courses work within my schedule and are reasonably priced.  online software is more complicated than others (not as easy as Blackboard or Canvas).
Freshman,4,"There are so many opportunities at South, and i love the diversity. The school is constantly evolving with its educational equipment and is making student life 100 times better."
Senior,4,USA is a great school if you want to stay close to home and have affordable tuition and live along the gulf coast.  It is big enough to give a true college experience but remains small enough that you are more than your student number.  Parents can feel secure sending there kids here and it offers a decent education.
Junior,4,The faculty and staff are really there to help and teach you. If you have a problem with classes or financial aid or scholarships the professors and the staff have all sorts of recommendations.
Senior,4,USA has great academics and the school spirit is out of this world! The atmosphere is friendly and the campus is beautiful.
Alum,4,USA has become a leader in health care education.  The upgrades on campus have been great in the last 5 years.  Th recreation center is superb.
Niche User,4,"I love the campus at South Alabama, I like being close to gulf shores so as far as I can tell I wouldn't change anything!"
Senior,4,Just an great environment!!! Very diverse! If you like big classes this is your school! I love being around the different cultures and the different backgrounds of my peers.
Freshman,4,It's a top-notch university that is also affordable. There is plenty to do around the city and the campus is centrally located.
Alum,4,"South Alabama was a great campus to be a part of. From the young athletic tradition to knowledgeable faculty, I enjoyed everything South had to offer. The Exercise Science faculty was very hands on and interactive with us students which made the learning experience that much better."
Senior,4,South has been great and I'm so glad I decided to stay local when choosing where to attend college. The Pre-Health programs are fantastic  and i would strongly recommend the university o South Alabama to anyone wanting to pursue a career  in healthcare.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful, the faculty actually care about you. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because the city of mobile is not a great place to live. The college tries its best to segregate itself from the rest o the city for safety reasons"
Sophomore,4,I liked the smaller campus and the atmosphere that the school offered. I also liked how easy it was to get around campus and how helpful the staff was with answering any questions I had.
Junior,4,"So far, I am having an overall good experience at South Alabama. The students are nice and the staff is both helpful and knowledgeable. I also work at the university as a student assistant in the department that I am studying in and it is a lot of fun. I am learning so much about the inner workings of a university, which will help prepare me for when I become an instructor at South."
Junior,4,"During my first and second year at South Alabama I was a member of the Jaguar Marching Band, it was an incredible experience for me providing me with amazing memories and great friendships. There are some downsides including the issue of parking, especially in the areas of on campus housing. But the overall aspect of this University is very welcoming."
Sophomore,4,"I love South, Go Jags! The University of South Alabama is a well diverse campus with lots to do, since it is located in the center of Mobile, Alabama. The classes are pretty easy if you have the right professor, people are friendly. There are lots of great food options on and around the campus. Lots of clubs and opportunities to make new friends. The sports programs here are amazing and the football games are so very excited. Especially the Troy versus South game, since Troy is our rival school. Overall, South Alabama is a great school. One problem I do I have is with the parking situations, there is hardly any parking."
Junior,4,Small college and campus so its very personal. More focused on academics than partying and sports. Local area is great and close to a lot of different places for students to enjoy.
Alum,4,"Because South is a smaller school, there are more opportunities for one-on-one time with teachers, research opportunities, and other opportunities that make it easier to bridge the gap between professors and students. Though the sports teams aren't as big as some of the bigger schools, there are plenty of fun things to do on the weekend in Mobile. All in all a great place to focus on your education and get the whole college experience."
Niche User,4,The professors and staff on campus are all working together to make the students college experience the best that it could possibly be.
Junior,4,"I love South Alabama! The classes are smaller than the average and the instructors are awesome! The advisors are very supportive and ensure that you stay on track. The campus is beautiful and is very well maintained by the landscaping department. The athletic department is awesome and the teams are very supportive of each other. South Alabama has a small town atmosphere but is close to all the perks of a larger city. The beaches are close enough for a day trip, the Mobile downtown area is great with a diverse group of people and places to go. South Alabama is a very expensive school, especially for an out of state student as the out of state tuition is double the rate for Alabama residents. Overall, I am happy that I chose South Alabama. I will be applying to the medical school there this summer."
Freshman,2,"I was not a big fan of the housing, atmosphere, campus or staff. Most of them were not very helpful. I did not like how spread out the campus was either."
Sophomore,2,"I had a very awful experience there, if you aren't from that area, don't go. It's a waste of time, those people are so odd. I'm only in touch with one person from that school and that's only because they are from the same state I'm from. My dad was born and raised there and I never understood why he was so eager to leave"
College Junior,2,I didn't even know I was accepted until the week classes started.
College Junior,2,"Rude, unprofessional professors. Instructors who are not familiar with content."
College Freshman,2,"There are no emergency police stands and limited lighting, but housing and dining are very close."
College Sophomore,2,"theres not even an honor code here, stuff gets stolen"
College Freshman,2,I'm not a fan of how big Greek life is
College Sophomore,2,I do not exactly feel safe on campus at night time.  There has been a lot of reports of violence and crime at night time on campus and it's much better to avoid leaving your dorm at night especially alone.  We have had a shooting and a stabbing.  Police are really quick to respond though and you will normally get an e-mail about it a few minutes after for safety.
College Student,2,People smoke marijuana in their dorm rooms.
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I haven't looked much into the Greek scene and most of what I know about it is second-hand information. There's pretty regular mentioning of it on Yik Yak, but it's not a common topic of discussion. There's usually a fundraiser going on by at least one sorority.

There are about six sorority houses located in a central, well-lit area. Their grounds are well-kept and what I've seen of the insides are clean & tidy.

Fraternity houses, however, are sparse and situated in various places around campus. They look much more run-down than the sororities, from the houses themselves to their lawns. I've seen a good bit of trash and other junk around them."
College Freshman,2,Meisler hall knows nothing and they often lose and mess up paperwork.
College Sophomore,2,The process is horrible and took multiple attempts for it to even get accepted and then after all that I still did not receive any aid. My parents make just enough to not get any aid yet we do not have enough money for college and are forced to take out expensive loans!
College Senior,2,The local student apartments have horrible parking and are expensive.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's only 2 or 3 off-campus options for a college of thousands of students, in all age ranges, marital statuses, family situations, etc. So I don't see the few hundred off campus apartments at okay quality with outrageous prices helping anyone."
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall is overpriced with bad food and limited options. There is a Starbucks at the library which is good. The Java City is also bad and overpriced.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is terrible.  It was good the first week of classes, but continues to go down hill.  They serve the same food everyday and it gets old quick. It is way to expensive.  The food court is not bad but lines are always long."
College Freshman,2,Programs could be better and more convenient to students since they paid so much
College Freshman,2,Not much to do but the same thing!
College Freshman,2,It wouldn't be rated so poorly if the dining hall wasn't so awful and if I wasn't required to buy an expensive unlimited meal plan.
College Senior,2,"I'm not a very big fan of the dining hall. At first, it wasn't bad. But lately I feel like they are becoming lazy with the food choices. I paid for this food, I should get better choices. I've also gotten sick from the dining hall food."
College Junior,2,It's not safe on campus. The police officers are lazy and hang out in the parking lot all day and night talking to one another.
College Junior,2,The dining hall is the number one complaint for students on campus. The food was good at once but new management changed a lot of that.
College Freshman,2,"Our off campus housing basically is to where if you want to live nice then you have to pay the huge price. You only have one selection of nice apartments that's close but they are expensive. Anywhere else is basically run down, trashed by students, or just plain not worth it."
College Junior,2,Parking is terrible. You can rarely find an empty spot during the day.
College Junior,2,Greek life on my campus is very small and they do very little around campus.
College Freshman,2,Hope you don't mind paying off loans the rest of your life.
College Freshman,2,"Rednecks, mardi gras, constant partying. If you're coming here to learn, there's not much offered."
College Freshman,2,Drugs are being used just like at any other college or university.
College Junior,2,There needs to be more restaurants closer to campus that also offer more discounts.
College Freshman,2,"depending on how you look at things, the officers can be very strict. For instance, just last year, a student was shot and killed by an officer, and this year that same officer had a car revoked from a student even though the car was reported stolen upwards of six years ago and the student had no knowledge of said theivery"
College Freshman,2,"The heat down here is near unbearable because of the god awful humidity, and alabama is not the rainiest city in the country, it literally rained for 3 weeks straight."
College Freshman,2,Many people complain about where they live off campus and wish they could be somewhere else. I heard the price is too high and half the time they won't care if something is broken in your room or apartment.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people at this school have the same major as me, so the we're not very prized. The faculty, though nice, don't bother to talk to the students much, and the workload is pretty high. I have yet to even figure out how to get an intern under my major. It's kind of weird. As a biology major, I have relationships only two biology teachers, and don't even know how to get an internship, but I have relationships with more chemistry teachers, and was offered an internship in the chemistry department!"
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall is nice. They always have a large salad bar, sandwich bar, and pizza. They change everything else depending on the day. The hours are not optimum. The place closes at 9pm every day, so I often times have to leave my work out early or skip dinner. There is a place that is open at night that has a lot of snack food and a restaurant you can use your flex dollars, but it is fairly expensive, and not worth going to in my opinion. The student canter has a lot of good food, but since I have a meal plan I don't usually eat there. I only eat there with my flex dollars when it's not optimum to eat at the dining hall. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one ""public"" computer lab. I put parenthesis around ""public"" because there are two or three labs that allow people only from that major to use them. The public one is in the library, and was moved to the third floor because the one last year was too crowded and they needed more room. This makes it very out of the way and harder to get things done. Also, you have to pay $0.10 per page. Which doesn't seem like much until you need to print out two labs and three homework assignments a week. The only reason I haven't spent more than $20 on paper this semester is because my job allows me into the chemistry computer lab despite the fact that I'm a biology major. If you have your own computer, the internet is nice, but you need that and your own printer to really enjoy it."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Like most university campuses, USA has always had a parking availability issue.  It's always one of the topics that students bring up during SGA meetings."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The scholarships are all targeted at incoming freshmen, so there's no motivation for deserving sophomores, juniors, and seniors to apply."
College Sophomore,2,"South Alabama's campus is a ""dry"" campus with the exception of the Frat houses. The penalty for having alcohol on campus is being thrown off school property, going to jail and paying a fine, or being kicked out of school. If a student has an ACT score of 18 or below they have to take tests and depending on your score you have to take a semester of remedial classes which comes out of your loans/aid and doesn't go toward any major but its a whole 13 hours worth of electives."
College Senior,2,I only know of a few people in fraternities. My grade is based on only the few I know. What I know is that one student rarely comes to class. When they do they reek of alcohol. Most non-Greeks view Greek students as partiers who need to grow up.
College Sophomore,2,There is a fairly large student body of international students at USA. Most classes I have had consisted of a handful of racially different students. There are many different organizations that these students can join and meet with similar students. They also seem to have no problems interacting with everyone else at school. They however tend to stick together in cliques.
College Student,2,"From what I have heard the dininng hall has fruits and vegitables on display, but there much like the forbidin fruit. Eat on and they will go metal... but that rumors, and if I go there I will grab an apple. The Vangrad acutally had a story on this not to long ago."
College Freshman,2,"It rains quite often! The weather can be a bit temperamental, but it's really nice a lot. Invest in some rain boots, but know that in the winter you'll be a lot warmer than many of the schools further north."
College Sophomore,2,There have been a lot of thefts and a couple of murders on campus.
College Sophomore,2,I've never seen any illegal activity firsthand but it depends on who you hangout around.
College Student,2,"The school has poor drainage systems, but they  take extra precautions to guarantee safety."
College Student,2,The food choices are not healthy as they claim to be. You will gain the freshman fifteen and many more if you do not stay active.
College Freshman,2,More buildings are being built but parking isn't being added! Makes no sense.
College Junior,2,"I really do not think South Alabama has any ""unique qualities."""
College Sophomore,2,Parking is a nightmare. There is very limited parking and they fill up very quickly. Parking services is constantly hanging out parking tickets and fines around campus. There is a desperate need for more parking yet they are constantly building more buildings
College Sophomore,2,"Mobile is an on and off city. It could be raining one day and sunny the next. Cold in the morning, hot in the afternoon or vise versa. Weather changes a lot. And there is no true winter. and gets really really hot in August."
College Sophomore,2,"USA is not really a big bar scene, nightlife type of school. It is actually pretty quiet for the most part. Usually becomes more alive on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,This depends on what lab you are using. Computer availability is good.
College Freshman,2,Some professors aren't really prepared to take on the responsibility of teaching students on a college level. Other professors can actually handle the atmosphere of a college campus.
College Junior,2,There are basic places to eat around campus. Basic fast food joints and a couple restaurants. It gets old after a few times. I would like to see more options available.
College Freshman,2,"During the fall and summer months, expect rain and lots of it. Due to it's role as a regional employer, the University rarely cancels classes. A hurricane-level rainstorm for example will not mean your classes are canceled.

Student dormitories and available parking are in mostly open areas and will leave you very vulnerable and often soaked to the bone before you reach any sort of cover regardless of your umbrella or coat."
College Freshman,2,"Mobile weather is so bipolar, one minute it is freezing and the next it is burning up. You just have to take a chance with what to wear to class. If you have morning classes you will be freezing, mid morning classes warm weather evening classes cold weather."
College Freshman,2,"THE  ATMOSPHERE HERE IS OKAY. THE CAMPUS IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO DO"
College Freshman,2,ITS VERY SEGREGATED HERE. I'M A TRANSFER STUDENT FROM TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY. IT SEEM LIKE EVERYONE STICKS AROUND THERE OWN RACE AND IT MAKES IT NOT FUN HERE
College Senior,2,"There are plenty of apartments here to choose from, but in my opinion they aren't worth what they cost. Some are very nice though. There are a couple of apartments right near campus that are affordable."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid operators are not always to friendly. I would be sure to have all of my information when calling or visiting them. I had an okay experience with them. I would be aware that the more scholarship money you receive, the more likely your financial aid will decrease because students are allowed only a certain amount of financial aid. Your scholarship money is considered financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,the deltas need to be torn down and rebuilt/replaced. most of the rooms have mold and walls that are cracking not to mention rust and smells. also not very safe when the dorms open straight to the outside instead of having to go through a lobby or something else of the sort
College Senior,1,We have a lot of crime and very few special security measures.
College Freshman,1,"I have to say that it is the worst due to one cop who acted very rude and terrible to me. he even flicked off my friend. BUT not all campus cops are like that, most of them are pretty nice. However i still have to give it a one star because of that one cop that should be fired."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Same applies to professors and courses. This place is nothing more than a sham and disappoint, USA is giant joke in regards to providing a good quality service to any student."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Career and all Center Services on campus or off campus, where ever they may be, while associated with USA are deplorable. In phone, in person, email, etc. 

If by chance you can actually get through to someone; they are rude, uninviting, always seemed bothered by your questions, don't want to help you, and will normally continue to transfer you through to an office where no one is (or they won't answer anyway), or they will give you an email address of someone they think can answer your question (in all reality they won't answer your emails either). 

The place is a total joke and proceeds to amaze me how people go to work everyday and should care about their job but instead don't have to worry about a thing or be held accountable for any amount of customer service."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have it, you won't have school"
College Junior,1,If you park out of your zone for a minute to run into a building you will get a ticket/s.  The on campus police are rude and power hungry.
College Freshman,1,"Our school could use so much more school spirit and events towards sports, like fun activities to help support the athletes, fun game day trivias so people can win prizes, days where people get to meet the athletes, our school has poor sports related fan support and our teams sometimes are horrible. Our school should bring more spirit to our sports so people would be more interested. (Ex. Team parade days through campus)"
College Junior,1,I have the worst experiences with the financial aid office. They are not helpful.
College Sophomore,1,I have not received any assistance but loans.
College Freshman,1,The weather here is crazy and unpredictable.
College Freshman,1,It's extremely bipolar! It's 80 degrees one day and freezing the next. And even if you look at the weather it's almost impossible to tell when it might rain. 
College Student,1,"The girls here aren't as attractive as I expected. Every once and a while you'll come across a cute one, but most of them will already have boyfriends. The cutest ones are in sororities though. A lot of the girls are stuck up here too."
College Senior,1,The University of South Alabama has one of the highest crime rates in Alabama.At night I never feel safe on South's campus. Last year my back window of my mini van was shot out by someone with a slingshot. The incident happened during the day and was random. I was not the only student with damages.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at the University of South Alabama reminds me of the new movie the Hunger Games- ""May the odds be ever in your favor"". There are simply not even parking spaces provided for the students as South Alabama is rapidly increasing in admission size. By the Health Sciences building, I have spent over thirty minutes searching for a parking spot which led me to be late for my class. To reassure one makes it to class on time and gets a parking spot, I would recommend leaving at least thirty minutes early for class  ."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is horrible! There are never any parking spots. The lots do not accomodate the amount of cars. The parking lots that you are required to park in never has an open spot. If you park in another lot for even 5 minutes you will end up with a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,"I've had the worst experience with the dorms. I'm past the breaking point. The mold kills my sinuses. My shower scalds my skin, I have severe burns on my scalp and legs and I'm getting severe migraines from getting scalded in the head. Nothing AT ALL in my dorm works. Took them over a month to fix a simple frayed wire to get the cable working. My internet is barely working and it's the week before finals when all of papers are due. The meal plan is $1500 minimal and the food is nearly inedible. My scooter was vandalized. I hear everything through the walls. I'm getting harrassed by maintenance and housing. They tried to frame me for having illegal drugs when I threatened legal action on the slum-lord conditions. Maintenance & Housing is constantly in my room or calling me, which has caused me to miss so many classes I'm about to fail a class I had a B in at the beginning of the semester. I've been Dean's List every semester and this semester I may fail and lose my scholarship. If you care for your health/grade/or future do NOT move here!"
College Freshman,1,"Mobile, Alabama is about as boring as it gets. It's very small and entertainment is limited. The only excitement is around the time for Mardis Gras and the rare times big entertainers come to the civic center."
College Sophomore,1,"Rainboots, Froyo, and OMG! So you would think that if you got enough girls in a sorority house on a  college campus, at least a couple would have a brain. Unfortunately this is not true, whenever I see my friends from high school get around their sisters it's as if their brains have melted and have been replaced by one of those toy monkeys with cymbals. I can never even imagine stepping into a Greek house, especially since each sorority has their own vice, be it drinking, partying, or sleeping around. I would never let myself be sucked into that image and I only hope that if I have a daughter she won't be pulled into that hellhole of a distraction from her studies."
College Sophomore,1,"University of South Alabama is a dry campus, meaning alcohol is not allowed even for people over 21. This drastically reduces the ""party scene."" To make matters worse, the city of Mobile has passed a new regulation that prevents anyone under 21 from entering any of the clubs or music venues downtown, and there is also a curfew for minors. I should also mention you are not an adult in the state of Alabama until 19. Do people drink and party? Yes, but in private, normally small groups. This is not a party campus by any means."

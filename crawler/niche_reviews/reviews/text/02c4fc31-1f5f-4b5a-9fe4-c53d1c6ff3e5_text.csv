Sophomore,5,"It’s been challenging to adapt to online learning for sure, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by my experience so far. My professors have all adapted their curriculums to make things easier on us while still ensuring that we’re learning, ie. One of my classes switched from doing full length tests once a month to fifteen minute quizzes a few times a week. NU also recently implemented an optional credit/no credit system, which has definitely helped with the pressure and lets us just focus on learning rather than grades. Remote learning still sucks, especially living in an area with bad internet connection, but I have felt like my professors genuinely care about our experience and are going out of their way to help us get through online learning."
Sophomore,5,"One of the few schools that strikes that rare balance between rigorous academics and a genuinely fun student experience. The typical student is creative, forward-thinking, socially-conscious, and constantly searching to learn more about the world around them. People also tend to be very involved in the community and are generally super friendly. In my experience, people are rarely cutthroat and will often go out of their way to help others out. It’s very easy to make friends in your classes and form study groups. Professors are absolutely amazing — even those considered experts are truly focused on undergraduate teaching. The university also practically bombards students with opportunities for research, internships, study abroad programs, etc. My one complaint would be the administration, which sometimes seems to put students’ demands on the back-burner (ie. ignoring calls to divest in fossil fuels). Overall though, NU is a wonderful school, and I’m so glad I chose to attend."
Sophomore,5,The best school ever. I sjsjsjjsjsjjsjsjjsjsjsjjsjsjjsjsjsjsjjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsjsj
Sophomore,5,"Once you find your niche and figure out an appropriate classload, you can start to take advantage of the vast resources at your disposal. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!"
Graduate Student,5,I have really enjoyed my time at Northwestern and find the work there useful and enjoyable. I hope it can lead to a prosperous career after graduation.
Alum,5,"Overall, I had many excellent opportunities when it came to research, working, internships, and more. The professors were really talented, and I learned a lot from my courses."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online, so this is not applicable for me. All the classes I took were in person and on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Northwestern has outstanding curriculum and many great professors. The campus community is very supportive, and the location is unbeatable."
Graduate Student,5,"Professors were very educated in online learning and the systems we used to complete online work were modern and glitch free. I began the program in a hybrid format (online and in-person). However, with COVID-19, we have moved to solely online classes. The professors have been very available for support online and worked hard to make our classes feel as in-person as possible."
Graduate Student,5,I would highly recommend the university to those looking to continue their studies. I am finishing up my MPPA and have had a wonderful experience. Professors bring a variety of backgrounds that are beneficial to our studies and have been very available for support both online and in person. The Chicago campus is beautiful and serves as an interactive satellite location just 30 minutes from the main campus in Evanston.
Senior,5,"Professors are really trying, but it's what you make of it. For me personally, as a senior, I didn't expect and want much. I'm preparing for medical school right now so I appreciate the break so that I can focus on other things."
Senior,5,"Northwestern seriously got me to where I am today. I would not be the confident, well-rounded, entrepreneurial person I am if not for Northwestern's various opportunities. There really are no other schools like Northwestern with regards to opportunities for challenging oneself, developing holistically, and making new connections. 
Honestly, NU is so underrated. I wouldn't trade it for anything."
Graduate Student,5,So far everyone has been very helpful from the admission process for the masters of counseling program up until now where I've been accepted and am working on aide for the upcoming semester
Graduate Student,5,I expect to have a great time in my online classes if they are anything like the preview sessions I have been in so far.
Senior,5,"Great academics, solid programming for students, and a decent amount of diversity. There is also a great deal of activism that happens on campus. Definitely on the expensive side, but they offer a good amount of financial aid to their students. I highly recommend going to Northwestern University if you are highly passionate about learning in a rigorous environment that offers a ton of opportunities for growth and connection with students and faculty."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere is great. Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. The food is eh but I think it's like that at every campus. Evanston is an amazing city and is so close to Chicago. It's very easy to get places
Niche User,5,I am a double legacy at Northwestern and will be attending in the fall. My experiences with this community have opened me to endless opportunities. I feel passionate about being a part of Northwestern.
Niche User,5,"During my visit to the school, the students and faculty were very kind and inviting. We had an hour and a half to explore the campus, and the students along the way had helped us find the things that our counselors wanted us specifically to see. I wish we had more time to see the amazing campus, but from what we saw, I was amazed as prior to the visit, I expected a completely different environment as it is a top college in the country."
Alum,5,"Challenging Academics!  Talented Students! Great Experience!  Beautiful Campus!  

A great environment if one is prepared to take advantage of it."
Freshman,5,"Northwestern is an amazing, one of a kind school. The people are what make northwestern so great, as there is a place for everyone at NU. With its many undergraduate schools, northwestern brings together both students and faculty specializing in engineering, journalism, theater, and liberal arts and sciences all on one campus. These are some of the brightest and most fascinating people in the world, and they are the reason northwestern is so special. Positioned on Lake Michigan with two beaches on campus and the famous lakefill, northwestern's campus has a stunning natural beauty and waterfront location that is unrivaled by any american college. The campus contains blends of old and new, which speaks to NU's legacy and its future."
Sophomore,5,"I love the school, even though it is extremely stressful and nerve-wracking at times. The cold is a terrible part of the experience, but after the first winter you learn to suck it up and get through it."
Freshman,5,"It's been an amazing experience to apply for Northwestern, and I am looking for more years of experience while I'm at Northwestern."
Freshman,5,"I love Northwestern. It is an ideal location for me, and the campus is wonderful. I feel a sense of community here. The school fosters a connection that grows from the start and throughout the years at Northwestern."
Niche User,5,I liked the campus. The organiztion of the campus tour and all of the opportunitues it has to offer.
Niche User,5,"I have been to the Evanston campus once, but in that visit I was astounded by the various opportunities offered by the university. Every program, whether that be the musical program, theater, biology, medicine, or integrated science, was fleshed out to a point of great immersion and understanding. Not to mention that there was an overall atmosphere of learning and curiosity. Highly recommend!"
Graduate Student,5,"Great school, beautiful campus. Evanston is super fun and very easy to get into Chicago as well. Faculty quality is top notch and learning happens everyday."
Freshman,5,"So far, I've loved Northwestern. It is very obvious that they are looking to diversify the student body here. There is still a prevalent white, rich population, but it's very liberal here and people are well-informed. My professors have been amazing so far and there are opportunities constantly presented to us. The only negatives are some of the older dorms and the dining halls could be improved."
Niche User,5,"I was amazed with Northwestern's community, they have the best college community out there. On tour I got a real feeling of what Northwestern would be on a regular day.  They are joyful and optimistic, not to mention their great leaders. They have students that stick out as role models and really aspire me to be like them.  Northwestern's class selection is one of a kind. They have great class selections from medicine to journalism. They also have one of the best academic flexibility I've seen. I heard during a tour that a student during his second year, taking courses on his career path, was able to change without any problem. The advisers were also supportive of his actions."
Junior,5,"It's truly a great university with rigorous academics but a great balance of fun events and social life. It is truly a ""what you make of it"" type school. There are so many options and ways to spend your time. The quarter system goes by fast, so you are always doing something, always learning, and always busy."
Alum,5,My years at the school provided a solid academic and extracurricular foundation that prepared me well for my career and exposed me to professors and students who helped me broaden my perspective. The university's setting on the lake must be seen to be believed -- it's a gorgeous place and its location in Evanston and proximity to Chicago offer so much in the way of entertainment and culture. The winters are tough -- not going to lie -- but I would happily do it all again.
Sophomore,5,"It is an excellent school and attending is a big learning curve, especially for those who are very close to their families."
Niche User,5,I visited Northwestern in August and absolutely loved my tour as well as my tour guide. I learned lots about the flexibility of the programs in order to easily try new subjects and expand your interests and passions. But my favorite part had to be the beautiful campus I was lucky enough to tour.
Sophomore,5,"The IB program that I participated in prior to college set me up well for the academics at Northwestern, so I have enjoyed them so far. While NU is not the most diverse school, it is quite diverse when compared to others. Big 10 athletics allow for camaraderie and school spirit in which I enthusiastically participate. The newly renovated dorms like Willard are amazing. Dining hall food is standard, and the proximity to Evanston is nice."
Sophomore,5,"So far Northwestern has been positive in very unexpected ways. The concept of what Northwestern was to me in high school ended up not really aligning with the reality. People who are honest and true to who they are as people, regardless of what they’re studying, are the most respected among the population. It’s really easy to want to morph yourself to fit the norm, especially here. Just figure out what you’re good at and what makes you happy and do a lot of that."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior, but I have a close friend that attends the university, and he sais that it was the best decision of his life. Everything is perfect, he loves the snow, the location, and the people. He eventually convinced me to go for a visit, and when I did I absolutely fell in love with it, especially the environment. I also like that it is an academically rigorous school."
Alum,5,"Best of all worlds scenario, and a rising star in higher education (along with its crosstown rival, UChicago). Who knew Chicago was such an education hub? Its beautiful campus is a huge cherry on top of the top-notch education you'll receive."
Sophomore,5,Northwestern pulls an incredible variety of motivated and interesting people from all over the country. This makes for excellent wide-reaching discussions.
Alum,5,"Amazing place to spend 4 years. Opportunities to be very involved, study abroad multiple times and set me up with a top notch job after graduation. What more could I ask for?"
Niche User,5,I love how beautiful northwestern looks on the outside. I am not attending right now but hopefully after graduate school. I visit here and there because I have family and friends who go there and they love it so much. I would love to dorm there because how clean and safe it looks. Would recommend to anyone investing in going there!
Freshman,5,Northwestern is a great school and the people here are generally reallt nice. The dorms and food are not the best but they are not terrible.
Alum,5,"Northwestern is a well-balanced school--top notch academics, great arts programs, amazing engineering and science facilities, in a minor city (Evanston) and very close to a major one (Chicago), and even a bit of sports culture. NU students tend to be fun-loving, driven and ambitious, both in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits. It's definitely a work-hard-play-hard atmosphere when you're on campus, and while there is danger in this as you can easily over-extend yourself (and many students do at some point), it makes for a fulfilling four years."
Junior,5,"Northwestern offers great courses, resources, and opportunities to all students. You can be involved in almost anything and find your niche and group of people to bond with for life."
Graduate Student,5,"I haven't started yet at Northwestern but I will be attending this fall. So far, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. All the faculty is very supportive and kind, and the students seem fairly diverse. Can't wait to get to Chicago in September."
Freshman,5,Northwestern is so great. I can't wait to attend undergrad there I think it will really be a great match for me or anyone who likes a fun school with also rigorous academics.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy studying at Northwestern University and don't think I would change a thing! The balance between rigorous academics and social activities make this experience hard to get elsewhere!
Alum,5,Great balance of academic excellence and social life. Exceptional reputation opens doors. Students work hard but maintain a good perspective.
Freshman,5,"I love Northwestern. Although I'm in the music school, and that's a bit separated from the rest of the school, I absolutely love my time here. Everything about it is great. There are issues, as every school has issues, but I definitely have never experienced such a nice place before. I'm learning a ton and I'm excited to spend the next three years there."
Alum,5,Great resources for students to gain access to career advising and course assistance. The campus is beautiful and it has been a pleasure attending this University.
Niche User,5,"The school was beautiful and full of life, even in the dreary month of February! The professors were welcoming, the students were happy, and I left loving the school more than any other I had seen."
Graduate Student,5,"Northwestern is a school I am beyond proud to be a part of. The reputation of the school is immaculate, no surprise given the experience I have had at NU. The professors are incredible. The campus is beautiful. Evanston is a perfect setting, and the downtown Chicago campus could not have a better location and setting. The academics are competitive, yet that should be expected from a top University. The professors greatly care about the students and want everyone to succeed. It was here or Stanford, or Columbia, and I am very happy I made the choice I did."
Alum,5,I've attended a few other universities and a junior college before transferring to Northwestern. It was the best decision I ever made. The academics are superior and the campus is gorgeous. Northwestern has a vibrant alumni network and it's easy to tap into it to further your career.
Freshman,5,"Northwestern University is great college and community. I like the residential neighborhoods, there's lot's of clubs and opportunities to take advantage and downtown Evanston is also nice. However, the BUDGET CRISIS is causing some issues for renovating older facilities and providing transportation money for clubs that have to travel some where. Still, I'm learning good stuff and most of the facilities are very very nice."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour of Northwestern once. The area was awesome, the facilities were nice, the people were friendly. It seems like a really great college."
Alum,5,"NU has outstanding  professors, a well rounded student body and a great campus environment that is enhanced by its proximity to Lake Michigan and Chicago.  It was a great college experience for me."
Alum,5,"Great balance of superior academics , athletics , fine arts and social opportunities . Great experience meeting people from all over the world ."
Alum,5,"Northwestern is a world-class academic destination that combines the best of so many different worlds — top-flight academics, Big Ten athletics, a thriving extracurricular culture, friendly students... everything you could hope for in a college experience. Top it all off with that view of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline? Can't be beat."
Niche User,5,I took a violin lesson with Professor Milton and it was an amazing experience! The campus is also very beautiful and clean.
Alum,5,"Northwestern is that rare institution occupying an incredibly unique space within higher education. It's home to world-class academics and one of the nation's most impressive alumni rosters, but carries about half the pretense or snobbery you might find at any other elite university. It's home to top-notch arts & sciences, but has the added benefit of having a number of highly specialized programs, including its prestigious journalism program; a top-ranked music school; one of the nation's most productive theater departments; and a robust engineering school.

Add to all that its utterly romantic setting on the shores of Lake Michigan in one of the best college towns in America (Evanston!) and you get Northwestern — a truly remarkable place that shaped my life over the course of four years. It isn't perfect, and those four years were filled with a lot of blood, sweat and tears, but the friendships forged and experiences made at Northwestern are truly priceless (forgive the cliche)."
Sophomore,5,"Such a great balance of the academics and education of an Ivy League (small classes, personal relationships with professors, etc.) and the culture and social scene of a Big10 school (football tailgates, campus life, etc.)."
Niche User,5,"The academics are incredible and the campus is breathtaking!!! The only downside is the cost. I do not go there yet, but I sure am applying. I visited it recently and talked in depth with a few professors so I got a really good picture of the kind of school it is."
Graduate Student,4,They have set up a pretty good system for online learning that has really helped during COVID. All of the material has been efficiently broadcast to the students via online learning.
Alum,4,"Northwestern is a vibrant academic community that has the feeling of a small school-- with a tight-knit, supportive community and small campus, but with all the opportunities of a major research institution."
Sophomore,4,"I only took online classes in terms of covid, so I'm not sure how relevant my experience is. With the transition this spring, most all my professors were good about supporting their students and being flexible."
Sophomore,4,"The academics at NU are unparalleled. I am always fascinated by my classes, and the professors care so much about their students (especially in Medill!). However, as a freshman I had a hard time making friends, even though I joined many different clubs, a sports team, and a sorority. This was obviously affected by COVID-19, but I feel like the social scene at NU can sometimes be dominated by party culture."
Sophomore,4,"I think my school tried their best. Obviously, this isn’t what we all wanted, but NU has made a serious effort to adapt, and it’s been impressive. We operate almost completely on Zoom. They also gave us a refund for housing and food costs, which was really great."
Freshman,4,"There are plenty of things to love about Northwestern University. To start the campus really is beautiful and the lakeside location only helps to add to the campus aesthetics. In addition, there is no denying the academic rigor on campus. Students are motivated learn and professors are equally motivated to teach. That said, the academic environment can become a bit overwhelming or aggressive. Students need to be hyper organized to stay on top of assignments as there is a narrow margin between missing an assigned reading and falling significantly behind in a class."
Niche User,4,"Northwestern is an amazing school, located in Evanston, right outside of Chicago. The rigor and academic aspects of the school are what make it top-notch. The social scene is what can improve there, but people who commit to Northwestern know what they are getting themselves into."
Freshman,4,"There is definitely a culture shock the moment that you step on campus (coming from an African-American male born and raised in Los Angeles, CA). Some of my peers have had social issues in terms of ignorance amongst students and staff, but we expect that to be true of the world. Everyone is definitely working hard, maybe too hard, to succeed in their field of study and their classes. There is a definite high-intensity aspect of NU, but if you're up for the challenge, the reaped rewards will be unmatched."
Sophomore,4,"While Northwestern may be ranked as one of the top schools in the nation, these high reviews may be slightly deceiving. Undergraduate education here is honestly what you might see at other universities and colleges--something that I didn't expect until I came here. As a McCormick Engineering major at least, you'll have your share of good and bad professors and experience even some classes that are impossible to do well in. While Northwestern has some very nice, new dorms, you might be located to one of the older ones. The food is not very good. The weather during late fall, early spring, and the entirety of winter quarter is brutally cold. That said, one of the best things about Northwestern, is the campus life and the people. I've made some of my closest friends here and the campus is beautiful with good weather. Graduating from this school will look great to any employer and there are a lot of resources for you to succeed here; just don't think it will be easy."
Freshman,4,"Love the research opportunities and the professors here. The bonding culture is real and I love that too. One thing that a lot of students struggle with is the quarter system, but even that, you get used to. Amazing, underrated university."
Sophomore,4,"My Northwestern experience has been mixed. On one end, I have enjoyed most classes and like being able to explore the wide range of offerings. While the quarter system creates a stressful environment of midterms and finals nearly all year round, I don't think I could have explored my varying interests with depth without it. On the other hand, the current budget crisis from the multiple new buildings on campus is a pain, especially when the majority of campus does not utilize these facilities. Evanston itself it not a great college town. Businesses close early and are expensive. However, for the most part, I think the problems Northwestern suffers from are not unique to Northwestern, but rather just how college, especially private research universities, are. I've had many experiences where professors are awful teachers because the university hired them for their research, not their ability to teach. The bureaucracy of Northwestern is a pain, but not unexpected."
Sophomore,4,The school is super expensive but provides great opportunities for students and individualized plans to succeed.
Niche User,4,The city of Evanston is amazing. It is close to Chicago so you can get there in 15 minutes (in good traffic) but still has a nice local feel.
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, especially in the fall, but it gets very cold. The athletic teams are pretty average, but it's part of the big 10 conference so the competition is good; the games are really fun to go to and watch. Professors almost always care a lot about their students and do their best to be engaging, most of the class sizes are really small so it's easy to get to know the professors and teaching assistants."
Alum,4,"I loved NU, it was a place full of great, passionate professors and provided many opportunities to explore new interests. The people were really nice and great overall. They need to work on their mental health services on campus though."
Niche User,4,"Northwestern's STEM research, more specifically the Amaral Lab at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, has a variety of opportunities for high school students looking for a professional experience at an acclaimed university."
Freshman,4,"Northwestern was my top choice! Getting accepted ED was outstanding. I do not regret coming here, Evanston is such a quaint little town, but I had a perfect adjustment."
Graduate Student,4,"I feel that overall it is great, but the location does create some problems for people that are not used to the cold. I also feel they should give more benefits for the cost."
Niche User,4,I absolutely love the campus and it's only a short walk to downtown Evanston. The students are very friendly and welcome anyone with opening arms.
Junior,4,They offer tons of opportunities and you always find your place. The one thing I would like to change about Northwestern is its competitive environment in every field.
Niche User,4,"I was a student in Northwestern University's School of Professional Studies. It is a good program, they offer a fairly wide range of classes, though I think that they could make more of a commitment to treating the School of Professional Studies students as a part of the Northwestern community."
Alum,4,Northwestern University taught me an incredible amount about myself as a person through its academic rigor. I was honored to work alongside and with very talented and gifted peers and professors who challenged me and made me a better student and young adult. It is a beautiful campus with many opportunities and resources for professional growth.
Junior,4,NU is a great school but can take a toll on your mental health. Winter is rough and the competitive nature of the students here can be a lot to deal with. It's still the best choice I could have made for college & will definitely help me get a great job in the longrun.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed Northwestern University. I attended the School of Education and Social Policy, and I was surrounded by supportive peers and faculty. Due to their teachings, my career goals evolved and Northwestern easily accommodated these changes. It is true, what they say about NU being a bubble. Very few students venture outside of Evanston's borders, and even fewer visit the less affluent parts of town. We may learn about our privilege here, but we do little to change it here."
Junior,4,"I would like to see better mental health advocacy and services being performed by university faculty. This is especially true for Northwestern because we are a high-achieving school with students who are constantly nervous and stressed about their future and not performing as well as their peers. I'd like to see policies put in place that better allow students with mental health problems to perform well in classes, such as better assignment extension policies."
Freshman,4,I have loved my classes and professors thus far. The campus atmosphere is great and I have made plenty of friends!
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled as a Percussion Performance and Music Cognition double major at the University's music school. So far, I have absolutely loved the college experience, both socially and major-wise. I have made great friends and I wouldn't want to be anywhere to pursue my musical endeavors. However, I haven't been to pleased with some of the other academics, on-campus housing, or cost of attendance."
Sophomore,4,"The academics in the engineering school are rigorous, but most of the professors are helpful. I find that there are often many sources to help us succeed. Life on campus is generally very positive. The campus is beautiful and downtown Evanston is incredible. On the other hand, I am very disappointed in the athletics at Northwestern University. The athletic department is not one that I liked dealing with."
Niche User,4,"Northwestern University has an ambient atmosphere that shows no signs of competitiveness among peers but rather collaboration. The percent need met is also very compelling and supportive.The only thing that I feel as if the cost of tuition is a bit too high for the education, although it is a very good education."
Freshman,4,"The university lives up to its high standards.  The classes are difficult and require a significant amount of study time.  However, the resources here are phenomenal.  There is always someone available to help.  Because the cost of coming here is so high, students are also presented with a lot of opportunities like going to professional games or performances in Chicago, or the giving away of free school apparel.  All in all, if you can keep up with the workload, Northwestern is a great school."
Niche User,4,Great tour and campus! Seems classy and interesting. Our tour guide was very genuine and made me want to go to the school. It is a very expensive school though.
Junior,4,"I really like Northwestern because as you walk around campus and engage in discussion with your classmates, you know that everyone around you is passionate, driven, and responsible. I have had very good experiences with everyone on this campus and have found that everyone here is incredibly involved and everyone is a genius in their own way, which I find fascinating. The campus is beautiful throughout all seasons, has great resources, and can really become whatever you want it to become if you are willing to get yourself involved."
Niche User,4,I loved my visit! The guides were very thorough and explained the structure of the school with lots of examples. Definitely worth the visit and seeing if the school is right for you.
Senior,4,"Northwestern is a great school with an immense amount of resources to offer. While the classes (especially on the pre-med track or engineering) are definitely rigorous and will challenge you, the people and the community available to you is definitely worth it."
Senior,4,"Northwestern's defining feature is the unique spirit of camaraderie and collaboration that permeates every element of college life. Northwestern tries to incorporate a lot of group projects and get students active in their studies outside of just coursework and exams through its hundreds of student-run groups.

At Northwestern, you are actively encouraged to take a variety of classes outside your major, and you really get to explore different disciplines. Northwestern has a quarter system, which means that in a given school year you will take about 12-13 courses instead of the semester standard of 10.

Throughout my years here, I have made friends studying every discipline, and they have opened my eyes to a world of knowledge. I encourage anyone with a desire to learn a wealth of information and experience a collaborative learning environment to apply."
Freshman,4,"I love Northwestern. They do the best they can to ensure you have a smooth transition into college, and they have so many resources you can reach out to depending on what you're looking for. It's incredibly challenging academically, but having friends to study with helps a lot."
Sophomore,4,Will prepare you very well for the real world.  Incredible career planning support. Professors are the very top of their fields. Students are all incredible smart and engaging.
Alum,4,"I attended Northwestern because of the music program and the professor I would be working with. My professor was amazing, and so was the music program as a whole. I was able to pursue a double major with an outside field, and while it was difficult and busy, the administration helped me every quarter by allowing me to take extra classes to finish on time. The campus is beautiful, but there is always construction. It is not a huge party school, but there are parties and lots of other ways to have fun. I loved the proximity to Chicago and the public transit system. Overall, I liked the student body. There was a general hard work ethic, and though my majors weren't particularly competitive, I know there were some that were fairly cut-throat. The mental health services can be improved upon, but I felt that NU was a very accepting, diverse, and progressive school overall. Financial aid was great, and getting better!"
Alum,4,"This school was a good undergraduate experience.  I really enjoyed my classes because my major was in a small, passionate school.  The school is pretty segregated, so you need to seek out ways to interact with people of different backgrounds.  Even though they label themselves as ""Chicago's Big Ten School,"" people don't really go into the city much (you don't even get a train pass!).   Northwestern focuses a lot on its athletics, but I wonder if their teams will ever end up going anywhere."
Niche User,4,"I loved the location of Northwestern, as well as their highly acclaimed academics and facilities. However, the price point is insanely high and only continues to grow. I cannot afford it."
Junior,4,"Northwestern is an amazingly challenging and diverse world-class institution. The reputation of programs ranging from chemistry to journalism, music to economics, and everything in between, precedes itself. Every student is extremely passionate about whatever they're studying or participating in on campus.  That being said, the student body does give off an air of pre-professional culture, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if like-minded, but can be overwhelming at times for students less sure on their future career path."
Alum,4,"Northwestern University's Evanston campus was a beautiful place to live for four years. The surrounding community is pleasant but as usual it doesn't always view college kids warmly (and sometimes that's very deserved). It's not the most exciting place but the campus is connected to Chicago by the el train, which I couldn't have lived without. The lake view was priceless to have. As for academics, Northwestern has many stellar professors and offers a very well-rounded, challenging education, as well as numerous career services and opportunities for experiences and networking. It is, of course, up to the student to make use of these resources. Some dorms are much better than others, but none of the ones I lived in were terrible. "
Niche User,4,"I went to Northwestern about two years ago and I thought it was a nice school. They have a beach literally on campus and it is so nice. There are a lot of bugs because of this though. The student to teacher ratio is okay, but I prefer more intimate settings. The food was really. They have a lot of activities on campus and you will always have  a social life. The dorms are cute and overall I had a nice experience. "
Junior,4,"Northwestern offers a rare opportunity for an amazing academic experience without losing out on the incredibly important aspect of a four year university. It is- using a term my friends and I made up- a relaxed Ivy; while the rigor and academic institutions match the Ivy league standard, Northwestern has a more inviting atmosphere, a less rigid environment of competition. It is the perfect place for a person who wants to learn about themselves and the world in the most healthy way possible. "
College Freshman,4,Professors are generally good. Watch out for chem though.
College Freshman,4,I live in elder and it is pretty nice.
College Freshman,4,Their parties are very fun.
College Freshman,4,Students usually go to the football games.
College Junior,4,Northwestern is stressful but gives me a great education
College Sophomore,4,"The class curriculum is very diverse, the class sizes are typically appropriate for the subject matter, and accessibility to graduate courses as an undergrad is a plus."
College Sophomore,4,"I typically feel safe on campus per the blue light buttons, campus security, and general safety of the neighborhood; however, the university is not as progressive as I thought in terms of sexual assault consideration and procedure."
College Sophomore,4,"The school is definitely measured up to academic standards and has stellar staff and curriculum; however, the environment is highly competitive not so much within the school itself but in terms of the expected extra-curricular contributions ."
College Sophomore,4,"My degree is very competitive, but I feel with Northwestern I have a better chance to get the jobs I do apply for."
College Sophomore,4,"I like Northwestern a lot. I think it has a lot to offer and combines the best aspects of a lot of other top schools--Big 10 sports, location close to Chicago, good job opportunities, high quality education, social life, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"There's usually not many incidents, and the university provides lots of education about health and personal well-being, both during freshman welcome week and throughout the year."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a college dorm, it's not going to be a mansion. You usually can get one of your top dorms if you don't drag your feet on your res application. The dorms are average, clean (if you keep it clean) and averagely spacious. They each have their own personalities, so do your research on which is the best fit for you. Also keep in mind the North campus/South campus personalities."
College Sophomore,4,"I think you really get a social advantage if you join Greek life, if you're looking to meet new people and get in on the social scene. That being said, the process of recruitment for sororities can be judgy and there is a slightly palpable elitist vibe that comes from some of the chapters. I think joining a sorority was one of the best things I did during my first year, but it's not for everyone. No one will judge you if you don't, it's all personal preference."
College Sophomore,4,"Northwestern is very professionally oriented, and can be sort of a bubble environment. When your there, its stressful and sometimes it's easy to forget the rest of the world and what it's like to interact with people who weren't top 5% of their class and involved in 15 school clubs. Overall though, I would choose Northwestern again, because I think it gives you the best of both worlds when choosing between top private schools and the atmosphere of a state school. The education is high quality, the location is great, the social life is decent if you make an effort, Greek life is active but different than at a state school, etc."
College Freshman,4,"It's generally a very safe place; there are definitely mishaps, especially late at night, but overall, I would say campus is pretty safe."
College Freshman,4,"There are so many things to do, and I've only just begun exploring, but I really love the campus and the people. It's an amazing school, and I am so glad that I am here."
Alum,2,"Chicago winters are tolerable, especially coming from out-of-state, but the campus culture is toxic and a breeding ground for mental health issues. Stress is high, and the social divisions that cut through America can be keenly felt here. The professors are great and there is a strong intellectual culture here, but it's hard to appreciate all of that when the environment makes you feel socially and psychologically unsafe."
College Freshman,2,Drugs are pretty prevalent but no one will force you to drink if you do not want to.
College Sophomore,2,I am not a supporter of Greek Life on any college campus.
College Junior,2,"NUPD do good things. Absolutely. But in terms of mental health services here, as I've been made aware by friends, NU can be very unresponsive and negative in dealing with it."
College Freshman,2,"For a private school with such a high tuition, we should be receiving better housing."
College Senior,2,"If you're not in greek life, you probably won't have much of a social life."
College Junior,2,I know many people who did not receive proper support from staff/faculty after an assault. Requires a major change.
College Sophomore,2,"I have been very disappointed in my choice of Northwestern. The school breeds stress. There are constant exams and assignments due on the quarter system, the classes are very hard and are graded harshly on a curve. Most students simply care about getting into med/law/grad school and just care about grades and doing extracurriculars to look good on a resume. The winter months are brutally cold. The school is extremely expensive with not enough financial aid for the middle class. There have been numerous mental health issues and suicides recently. We were rated as having one of the worst student quality of life by the Princeton Review for good reason. The school cares more about money than it does about its undergrads."
College Sophomore,2,Evanston locals are awful and hate fun.  Seriously this is where prohibition started and this is not surprising to nu students. It is not uncommon to see elementary school age kids as well as plenty of rich snooty elderly people.  The area itself however is beautiful and the proximity to chicago is perfect.
College Sophomore,2,As an athlete it definitely could be better as far as school pride and athletic focus especially in the big ten.  It is getting better though and more focus is put into facilities but compared to other big ten schools we're like a 3 out of 10.
College Sophomore,2,The worst part is evanston police department are very strict and often get complaints from locals.  Parties can never really be at full volume which sucks... its college.
College Sophomore,2,the dorms are fun and friendly if you end up in the right ones but all of them are pretty old and sub par.  Everyone keeps their door closed which I found kinda weird.
College Junior,2,It's terrible. Only lived in first year.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very tense relationships between wealthy suburbanites in their gothic victorian mansions and students. Make sure not to walk in big groups down the sidewalks making noise. Don't have house parties. 

Chicago is a great city and probably the best reason to have a car. Yes, the L comes right up to campus, but a trip downtown involves transfers and can take upwards of 50 minutes one way, with long waits on frigid platforms at night."
Recent Alumnus,2,"When I was there, a lot of the buildings were quite subpar. Too many cinderblock wall/linoleum floor jail cells. Very strict, sober atmosphere in certain dorms with RAs who would report small infractions/call police. Certain north campus dorms seemed like they were much more fun, but not at all luxurious."
College Freshman,2,"Ok so the standard Chicago transit system goes through Evanston.  EL stops are pretty close but if you use them regularly you better have some form of income because though they aren't overly expensive, they are not super cheep and there is no student discount.  Northwestern transportation is bad.  Though the idea is nice (the intercampus shuttle is great) shuttles (except the intercampus) can be very very late, as in this is not an option to get to class.  The times are terrible, they run around once an hour but a lot of shuttles don't start until evening.  The shop and ride (goes to target and CVS) is nice but is not consistent.  Honestly transportation through the university is bad.  We are just big enough for it to be annoying that transportation sucks, but just small enough that the University doesn't find it neccessary to really invest in the system."
College Freshman,2,"Chicago is indeed the Windy City. Also this year was a particularly bad winter with the Polar Vortex, but you will survive somehow."
College Freshman,2,"It's cold here in the winter. Like, blisteringly cold. But the fall and the spring (though short-lived) kinda make up for it."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very difficult to find parking in and around Northwestern. Although, they are building new parking structures on campus. "
College Sophomore,2,It's difficult to have a relationship at NU because everyone is far too busy for that. There is literally no time for an actual relationship. I found success dating outside of NU and I highly recommend it.
College Sophomore,2,The high cost of Evanston living is the worst
College Freshman,2,The school is in a suburb of Chicago and overlooks Lake Michigan. It's beautiful until November and then you are constantly freezing when you are outside.
College Junior,2,Don't bring a car to campus. Only seniors are eligible for buying an on-campus pass and they're ~$500.
College Freshman,2,"There is very little peer pressure to do drugs or to drink.  Students are usually respectful of your choices on each topic.  In addition, the campus police usually come to break up rowdy parties."
College Junior,2,"Every school claims to be diverse but I don't think many really are. Northwestern is still heavily populated with white, affluent students."
College Junior,2,"Evanston is not known for anything major except Northwestern. If you want to have some real fun, you would have to go to Chicago."
College Freshman,2,"Engineering is a difficult program to get into, no matter which school you apply to. I think the most important criteria for admission are good grades, a strong ACT/SAT score, and a solid grounding in math and science in high school. When applying, MAKE SURE you fill out ALL  the required forms. I realized the day before the deadline that there were forms I had not filled yet. "
College Freshman,2,"Campus officials are VERY strict about noise violations and parking. They don't mind people starting new student organizations. In fact, I'm starting my own a capella group on campus and the process has been very easy. There is quite a bit of drinking going on, particularly on weekends, and I don't think officials do much to stop it. "
College Freshman,2,"Parking is very close to dorms and classes. However, it is very hard to find a spot, and campus police are periodically touring the parking lots and making sure everyone has a permit and is parked correctly. They find the tiniest things to fine you for, such as having one of your tires slightly on the parking line. Permits are quite expensive. "
College Freshman,2,"There is absolutely no visibility during the week. However, the school becomes a total party school during the weekends, according to my on-campus friends. It is not rare to see someone on your floor come reeling in drunk. "
College Sophomore,2,We are a big 10 team but only in terms of academics and girls lacrosse
College Sophomore,2,Its expensive and often not much for what you pay. Expect run down
College Sophomore,2,"NU's administration is very anti-Greek. Two fraternities were kicked off before my freshman year and almost every fraternity feels like they can be kicked off next if they fuck up (except SAE, they're not getting kicked off because they're headquarters are in Evanston). The only time Evanston/NU was cool was for Dillo Day. However, you can drink/vape in the dorms if you're not obnoxious about it. Most CAs (NU's version of RAs) don't want to get you in trouble. From personal experience, my floor's hallway smelled like weed a lot of the year and the worst that ever happened was an email saying ""Remember, weed is illegal."" You can definitely still have fun here. In fact, it's kinda hard not to get f***ed up semi-regularly if you live in Elder or Bobb."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are many cultural groups, but not very many economic groups."
College Sophomore,2,"The security guards are pretty strict about checking people into the dorms, but otherwise, most security is pretty lax."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus can be pretty strict about underage drinking, but it's really Evanston that the policies stem from."
College Freshman,2,"I rarely have to park, but the one time I did I received a ticket."
College Freshman,2,"You definitely need your own computer. I would also recommend your own printer, if not in medill school of journalism."
College Freshman,2,"There are many different types of people personality-wise, but not race wise. There are mostly white and Asian people."
College Junior,2,The spots along the streets are far and few between. The city permits are expensive and you have to move your car for street cleaners and snow plows. Students can't park on campus until senior year and that's still costly.
College Sophomore,2,Mainly Football – Football games are well attended by students but other than that not nearly as many students attend other sports.  Our sports teams are ok but  NU isn't a sports dominate school.
College Sophomore,2,"It's Just Ok – For me the academics are challenging, especially in weed out classes but a lot of them aren't stimulating because you're so rushed.  It also gets really cold during the winter time.  There is quite a bit of school spirit though and sporting events are fun so it balances out.  This school wouldn't be at the top of my list of suggestions though."
College Junior,2,"Lakeshore Campus in the ""Windy City&quot – I am from the northwest suburbs of Chicago, so I thought I was completely ready for the weather at NU, but the wind coming off of the lake is stronger and colder than I expected, and it's always blowing. As long as you have a wind-breaker when you walk to class, you'll be fine."
College Freshman,2,"Don't Be Stupid – Most of the time crime is off campus late at night when someone is walking alone, so make sure you travel in packs or call safe ride. But there has been a few daylight crimes this year. Health is good, safety is lacking."
College Freshman,2,"It's Evanston. There's a lake right there. The cold here is not a joke, and it can snow a lot. If your classes are far from your dorm, then that really sucks."
College Sophomore,2,The school takes it very seriously. Northwestern highly values academic integrity considering how prestigious the university is.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing Isn't Great – The campus housing is extremely expensive and usually pretty small. The best dorms are BOB and Elder and they are probably the worst dorms to live in, but are the best social dorms. They all pretty much suck but they are livable. Allison is the nicest dorm, but it is really far away from any parties."
College Sophomore,2,"Chicago has great weather for two months of the year in july and august so when no one is there. The winter is brutal and doesn't really get warm until mid to late april if you're lucky. Sometimes it doesn't get warm until may , which sucks because school is over in the first week of june. You also get there in september and it starts to get cold in October. It also rains a lot when it isn't snowing. When it is nice weather the beach if awesome and everyone goes out. Only really nice in september and most of spring quarter."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, if you're going to school for nice weather, you obviously aren't picking Northwestern. It gets cold fast, and the wind adds an extra component that makes early morning walks to class almost unbearable."
College Freshman,2,the moment you get to school it turns freezing cold
College Sophomore,2,"all the cultural houses are fine, feels weird if you aren't that ethnicity but join anyway"
College Sophomore,2,Not Much – Don't expect much. Most people ride a bike or walk.
Recent Alumnus,2,Norris Student Center – It is in a bad location and although renovated I rarely visit it or the bookstore.
College Sophomore,2,"Well, the weather is gorgeous in the summertime. Unfortunately, this is the time of year when the majority of students have gone home for summer break. The winter is brutal. We are located close to the very windy city of Chicago and our campus is right next to Lake Michigan, so temperatures can get very low and it snows quite a bit. Classes don't really get cancelled so everyone just learns to deal with it. Just buy a good coat...and gloves...and a scarf...and boots."
College Senior,2,"not great. not even good – Evanston is not a shining example of a safe town, despite the amount of self-righteous people who inhabit it as full time residents. My street has had a number of robberies this year, and assaults happen. It is sort of unwise to walk alone here, especially if you are a girl. The fact that most off-campus students are limited to pretty faraway housing and often enter their places through dim alleys really doesn't help, but most people know this when they move next to Chicago. People travel in packs. To be fair, our health services are actually pretty good."
College Senior,2,"Sucks on AND off campus – NU is pretty awful for strictness, and a lot of it has to do with Evanston's district of resident whiners who don't think they should tolerate student lifestyle to exist in their neighborhood. Enforcement itself is spotty: on campus, frat basement busts ranged from nonexistent to weekly; off campus, I rarely see cops from welcome week to dillo day. Don't be loud, and you likely won't get caught, but the fear (and over-occupancy eviction threats Evanston likes to issue) seems to keep true raging parties to a minimum."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's Almost Always Cold – Yes, you're on the beach. And if you're lucky, you'll have beach weather for the first week that you're there (recall: you arrive in mid-September), and then for a couple of weeks right before summer break. So, enjoy the 3 weeks out of the year that it's temperate. The rest of the time you'll be shuffling around in your Northface and earmuffs. You DO get used to it, though."
College Sophomore,2,"Strong School Spirit for Poor Performance – There is strong school spirit during homecoming football games, but this is rarely found during any other athletic activities.  Northwestern University is not great when it comes to team performance in varying athletic teams."
College Freshman,2,"Don't Bring a Car – With Evanston and all classes within walking distance, don't bring a car.  Parking in Evanston is generally free but away from campus and limited.

If you're concerned, get a bike."
Recent Alumnus,2,"What happens when you mix a huge amount of white rich kids with a small smattering of everyone else?  Northwestern.  Read the comments in the Daily Northwestern (campus newspaper) for an idea.  Comments I've seen include ""financial aid-iots,"" ""minorities with chips on their shoulders,"" etc.  Luckily, there are pretty vocal student organizations who stand up for students of color and other likely targets of bigotry.  But the numbers make it a pretty bad place for authentic diversity."
Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate this school. I am beyond miserable here. You might be happy here if you’re from Chicago or somewhere else in the midwest. If you are from anywhere in Southern California, DO NOT APPLY. Everyone is depressed. So many people I have talked to agree that they “would have transferred, but figured that staying is better for their future.” I am transferring because I feel as though an incredibly depressing environment is actually awful for my future. This is a sad place. Only good thing is that professors are very approachable and it’s easy to get into classes that you want. Praying I get into the schools I applied to transfer to."
Alum,1,"I had a horrible experience at Northwestern, in large part because of my mental health issues and the university’s awful response to them. I had a mental breakdown my sophomore year and went to student counseling, but it was awful. No help at all.

Northwestern was a mixed bag academically. Some classes were great, but many were not. You will encounter lots of “dud” classes. The professors weren’t friendly.

Forty percent of the campus is Greek, and you will find that they treat those outside the Greek community with contempt. The student body didn’t show much intellectual passion. They didn’t care about what they were studying because they planned to go to law or med school.

I get phone calls from NU asking me for money. These infuriate me. They couldn’t give me the help I needed as a student, but now they pay someone to solicit me for money? My advice is to transfer the money you use for soliciting donations to your mental health clinic."
College Freshman,1,"I've been trying to get connected on this campus, and it is nearly impossible unless you're involved in a club (which there are few of) or athletics. I was really excited to come to this university, but now I dread coming here. There is no student life, and everybody goes home on the weekends and for a good reason."
Recent Alumnus,1,All frats and terrible bars. Best bet is if your friend is having a small house party. Otherwise it's likely to get shut down.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Totally sucks in that it dominates the social scene. There are very few fun hang-outs and bars in town, so frat parties can feel like your only option. House parties get shut down by overzealous Evanston police. Dorm parties get shut down by overzealous Evanston police, who a quick to cuff underage drinkers. You have to pay absurd money and trick yourself into thinking it's cool to be part of greek life in order to party like a real college student."
College Sophomore,1,Absolutely horrible. Costs too much. Theres not enough hours in the day to do all the homework assigned on any given day. Students are over worked and stressed out leading to major mental health issues. We've had student suicides every quarter. The university cares more about money than it does about lives.
College Sophomore,1,We made a slight mistake in the financial aid documents and could not receive the full financial aid that we needed.
College Freshman,1,There really is not parking available on campus for students. There is a parking deck a mile off campus that is really expensive and parking during the day is only by permit and mostly for staff and faculty of the University.
College Sophomore,1,"The only ""financial aid"" I was offered was all my expenses covered in federal loans. PhD students have it made, they get all the TA positions and scholarships. There is little to nothing for masters students."
College Sophomore,1,"Paying for Northwestern's tuition probably demands a high income, which means you don't qualify for their scholarship programs. Money is almost exclusively given on the basis of need rather than academics or merit."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Alcohol Policy – The punishments are severe and cause people to not report incidents so they don't get in trouble for being ""in the presence of alcohol."""
Recent Alumnus,1,I moved off-campus almost entirely to save money from the mealplan.  It's beyond ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,"Evanston Freeze – IT'S COLD--the most bone-numbing chill one could possibly ever experience in his or her entire lifetime (aside from living in Antarctica). Winds like I've never felt slapping me in the face as I attempt to trek to classes that feel miles upon miles away even if they're just across the way from my dorm, simply because of the added shin-level layers of snow, sleet, and ever present rain I have to endure."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid isn't very negotiable.  I was given a package and it's still very difficult for me to afford school and I've had to take out massive personal loans and the school won't really do anything to help me out.
College Senior,1,"If you park ANYWHERE in Evanston, you will definitely end up with some type of ticket ranging from $25 to $60! This city has no tolerance for available parking. Every street has two-hour parking and/or parking on certain days. I swear, they perform street cleaning on every street twice a week! Evanston has the cleanest streets in America and collects the most money out of any city in America. Students have the following option: walking, parking and coming out with a ticket every two hours, or buying a $300 student parking pass."
College Junior,1,"The process of rush for both sororities and frats is miserable, so many people feel left dejected, and then people go around priding themselves on the quality of their Greek house. It's kind of ridiculous, but going to the events is fun even for those who choose not to go Greek. Greek life is a big deal at Northwestern, though-it's everywhere."
College Freshman,1,What Did You Expect? Chicago weather-enough said.
College Freshman,1,No One Cares – We suck-and it reflects in students' enthusiasm.
College Junior,1,"DON'T BRING A CAR – Evanston has towed my car twice for parking in front of my own apartment, and I've gotten four tickets from NU for parking in front of my own dorm. There is no leniency here. Only seniors are allowed to park on campus, and you have to pay a lot of money if you want a legal parking spot anywhere. Bottom line: Don't bring your car."
College Freshman,1,"Really there is a lot of diversity when it comes to political background and religion. There are a lot of people of Asian decent, and Northwestern likes to pride itself on that fact. But there are very few black and Hispanic people here. We have only 140-something incoming black freshmen, but there are at least 2,000 students in the 2013 freshman class. Stuff like that needs to change."

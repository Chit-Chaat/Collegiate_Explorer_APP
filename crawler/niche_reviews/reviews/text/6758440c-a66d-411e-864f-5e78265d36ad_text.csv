Sophomore,5,Westmont is incredible. It feels like home. The challenging academics and vibrant social life really round out the college experience. Would recommend for any student.
Alum,5,All four years on campus.  It was a truly memorable experience of integration of learning and faith.  I learned to think and write at Westmont.
Alum,5,Outstanding liberal arts college!  Santa Barbara is a great college town and Westmont is one of most beautiful campuses in the nation. You will make life long friends here.
Senior,5,"When COVID-19 hit it took a toll on a lot of students. It was stressful having to shift in person classes to online. But, Westmont managed to do this very well and it was actually quite easy. The professors were willing to help students every step of the way and they and they made sure we had everything we needed for the time being. The classes online were well organized and time manageable. It made school a lot easier during this crazy and stressful time!"
Freshman,5,"Westmont professors made the switch to online learning due to COVID19. This switch was made swiftly and they adapted quickly without much time for preparation. I felt most of my professors found ways to complete normal class activities (such as discussion, testing, peer collaboration) just as they had, through zoom and other platforms."
Alum,5,Westmont was great for me. The proffesors are awesome. They all new me by name and would have students over to the house. The community was fantastic too and so thankful for the friends I made. And the campus is so pretty.
Graduate Student,5,"I had a fabulous experience at Westmont. What sets Westmont apart is community and sense of belonging. There were always loving people around, a resident advisor or director to chat with if you had a problem or crisis.

Student life was really revolving around the community on campus. It's not a party scene at all, but I was not looking for that. It is a strong Christian school with a campus living statement.

I enjoyed my academics, although I pursued a liberal studies degree and was in a different track with credential program as well, but I found the academics enjoyable and very manageable. My professors were caring, available and very highly qualified. 

Santa Barbara is GORGEOUS and there are amazing beaches, nice quaint downtown, incredible Mexican food and mountains to explore nearby. It's a great small city, near LA.

Overall, I loved my time at Westmont. I got a great degree, grew in my faith, and made amazing friends in a fabulous, tight-knit, caring community."
Alum,5,Westmont helped me form a solid foundation for my life as an adult.     I learned as much from the students as I learned from the faculty.      I transferred from Azusa Pacific College (APC) to Westmont in my sophomore year to get a bit more academic approach and a bit less emotional Bible School feel.     I'm glad I made the switch as Westmont fit me better.     I was more comfortable that I could seek the truth wherever it might lead me but in an intellectual Christian environment.     At Westmont it just felt more honest and I trusted my education and the answers I arrived at more than I did at APC.     That said I'm feeling that someone from a conservative Baptist or Pentecostal Fundamentalist background might feel more at home at APC or Biola.     Just my take.
Niche User,5,I loved the environment and felt like a very supportive community that would help me grow my faith. I loved meeting with the golf coach and walking the nature trails of the school and seeing the beautiful beach
Freshman,5,"I have completed my first semester at Westmont and my experience was exciting. Westmont College has much to offer. It has given me many opportunities to be my best and become independent. My classes were small teacher to student ratio, but still challenging enough to keep me interested. I am looking forward to my many years of studying and growing at Westmont University. I am also a student athlete who participated in Westmont’s baseball program. Academic and sports go hand to hand for me. I recommend this college to anyone who is interested. It will not disappoint you."
Niche User,5,"Westmont is an amazing school, helping its students grow academically and spiritually. It is in the stunningly beautiful Santa Barbara. I loved how Westmont felt comfortable, a place one can truly prosper. One place they have opportunity  to grow is within their housing, which for freshman dorms, they are not the nicest."
Niche User,5,"Over spring break, my parents and I spent an entire day at Westmont College. It was the best day ever! After we checked in, we were given a walking tour of the beautiful campus. I then sat in on a Business class taught by a very engaging instructor. After a delicious lunch in the cafeteria, we met with one of the professors from the school of business. We then met with the director of finance to discuss tuition and financial aid options. I hope I am able to attend Westmont College. Westmont is my number one choice of schools, and I hope and pray that I get in!"
Sophomore,5,"Sophomore Econ and Business major. Best professors you'll ever meet are here at Westmont. There is a party scene down the road at UCSB and one can easily participate in that; however, most come to Westmont to study hard and create lifelong friendships."
Niche User,5,Westmont College is so beautiful and offers many different opportunities for its students. As a future undergraduate student I am more than excited to live the next 4 years of my life at Westmont. Not only is it in the best location of Santa Barbara but also the students and professors are super kind and loving.
Junior,5,"As a heads up, this is not a school to attend if you want to party. It's a dry campus and they expect students to follow that rule. The people they discipline are usually the ones that need help; they are much more focused on transformative policy rather than kicking you out. The food is not amazing but it has gotten dramatically better since my freshman year. The student Life [read: mandatory chapel] is lacking but they are aiming to address such issues as well.

That being said, Westmont is a truly amazing school largely because of the professors. They are invested in any student's life and love to talk about life during office hours or over lunch. Additionally the various abroad programs are truly phenomenal. I know people who have traveled to over 20 countries with their Westmont professors. 

It may not be the traditional college experience but it definitely is a life changing one."
Niche User,5,My visit was pleasant. Everyone was nice and willing to help. The small college community follows the ideals of religion and is very accepting of all who come.
Niche User,5,"First off, the campus is beautiful. The atmosphere is very nice and welcoming. As for the academics, the professors really care about you and your education."
Sophomore,5,"Westmont College is full of faculty that legitimately care about their students and want the to succeed. As a student, you are pushed by the professors to do your absolute best in classes and try to get the most out of you as a student."
Freshman,5,"Westmont College does a fantastic job of combing academics, spiritual growth, and social activity. The Christ-centered learning promotes a kind and encouraging student body. While there is not great diversity at Westmont, the staff and student government does an excellent job of promoting diversity awareness and celebration of other cultures. I am extremely grateful that I chose to attend Westmont, and I would highly encourage other students to consider the college."
Freshman,5,I love Westmont College. It is a spirit led community focused on developing well rounded individuals. The professors really care about students and it is a wonderful community
College Sophomore,5,Im in love with everything about westmont
College Sophomore,5,i haven't heard of anyone being without a job
College Sophomore,5,there hasn't been a time i felt unsafe
College Sophomore,5,You get the best connections at westmont
College Sophomore,5,"The experience at Westmont has been amazing! Great community, great courses and staff. Although the courses are tough it pushes me to be a better student and it has."
College Sophomore,5,Health and safety is extremely important and Westmont takes is seriously
College Sophomore,5,My school has a great sense of community not just in student life but with professors and staff as well.
College Freshman,5,westmont is highly accredited for giving students a well rounded education.
College Freshman,5,"The drug scene at Westmont is not a issue, there are parties off campus but any athlete at Westmont knows not to violate their contract and drink, due to financial consequences. There is a lot of peer pressure also at Westmont not to drink."
College Junior,5,"I was very concerned about how I would feel in college and how people would treat me. I have been bullied my whole life  because of who I am and I feared that college would be the same. Westmont blew my mind in the best way! Everyone that works there and attends are all so loving and accepting of everyone! I have made friends that I know we'll be friends far past graduation and the teachers are always there for you! I would defiantly pick Westmont again, I highly recommend to anyone looking for a Christian based private college (that accepts all denominations of Christianity as well as non-Christians) full of wonderful and loving faculty, staff and students!!!"
College Sophomore,5,Between State Street and Milpas areas there are plenty of options
College Freshman,5,The education is worth the price tag.
College Freshman,5,"The professors know their stuff, and because classes are small, it is impossible to slack of and still get an A. Most teachers have attendance grades."
College Freshman,5,"Westmont is updating buildings every year, and the campus is gorgeous. We have a mountain and ocean view."
College Freshman,5,There's no place like Santa Barbara.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is friendly and approachable, and even if there are more girls than guys, there is no shortage of attractive guys!"
College Freshman,5,"Westmont is unique, and the best place for me."
College Freshman,5,"We have a very active alumni network, and our office of life planning has many connections and is willing to work with each student individually for any length of time."
College Freshman,5,"Westmont isn't for everyone - but for those it suits, it is the most incredible experience."
College Freshman,5,"Santa Barbara has endless food options, from pizza parlors, to vegan cafés, to the highest dining."
College Freshman,5,"They enforce the rules whenever there is a violation, but the enforcers aren't overbearing. They don't go looking for people breaking the rules, but if an RA or staff member sees something, the offender will be reprimanded. The rules are clear, and everyone signs the community life statement, and if they break the rules they are breaking a contract with the school."
College Freshman,5,"There are ample scholarships available, and most people find that they are able to pay for Westmont. Westmont offered me the most financial aid of any college I was accepted to."
College Junior,5,Santa Barbara food is underrated. Exceptional bar scene. Even better Italian food scene if you ask me.
College Freshman,5,"When you're tired of DC food, go to State St."
College Freshman,5,They work with us to make sure we don't break rules
College Freshman,5,Getting to the DC has never been faster!
College Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student to Westmont College and I have had the best semester of my college experience. This school not only challenges you educationally but also stretches your faith in Christianity. You are not only being educated but your soul is being fed. At Westmont, the community atmosphere creates a safe place to be vulnerable with peers and staff. Everyone is welcoming and genuine. It's easy to get involved and connected and most importantly, campus feels like home. It's safe. There have been no assaults on campus and theft is extremely low. The only reports we get are for cougar or bear sightings. It's so easy to get your classes because of the smaller population of students and the faculty and staff here care about YOU. They invite you to their house for dinner or for bible study. They can become your mentor. You can actually build personal relationships with them. Here at Westmont, you build life-long friendships. Westmont expands you to not only be prepared to face the real world but also the spiritual one. God comes first at Westmont which makes this place absolutely the best."
College Freshman,5,Love getting a intense and focused time with prof
College Freshman,5,The financial aid office worked closely with me!
College Freshman,5,Love going downtown to eat!
College Freshman,5,"Westmont is in a very safe neighborhood and I never have any fears for my safety, though I do recognize that may also be impacted by my being male."
College Freshman,5,I would do the visit all over again. I had some much fun staying there for a weekend my senior year of high school.
College Freshman,5,The food is so good. It just sucks that there is no food late at night.
College Freshman,5,The dorms are very close and you can basically visit anyone and do anything outside.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Great study abroad programs where you actually LEARN (and not just how to party in another language/culture). Great language immersion programs, great program directors - my semester in Mexico was by far the best time I've ever had!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"In the Communications Studies department, we have a lot of fun while learning very applicable skills and information about one of the inevitabilities of being communicative human beings. The professors within the department have varied backgrounds and each bring refreshing perspectives on the communication studies field as a whole, so I really felt that even at such a small school, the department manages to expose students to a wide spectrum of information."
Recent Alumnus,5,Individually tailored education in a supportive and collaborative community would sum Westmont's academics up pretty well.
Recent Alumnus,5,"With such a small student body, the professors really invest themselves in you personally and therefore go out of their way to help you make the most of the huge connection basis Westmont does have - even for such a small school! I didn't have an internship during my four years there, just because I had to work my way through instead, but I have a part time one now that I love. I definitely wouldn't have been able to get any of my previous 3 jobs or my current internship without those connections! And I know of quite a few people who were able to find paid positions for internship credit, even if they were just minimum wage."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Great program, the faculty really invested in me and got to know me personally. This meant that not only did the profs in both of my majors repeatedly havr me I over to their houses, for instance, but they knew me better through that and were able to mentor and teach me in a much more personalized and meaningful way."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Santa Barbara has one of the highest (if not THE highest) per-capita number of restaurants in all of the US! Everything you could ever want, from comfort food all-American, to the most exotic cuisine from countries you haven't even heard of yet! I'd highly suggest picking up an Entertainment book or the SB exclusive version, the Axxess Card. Either one gives you literally hundreds of buy-one-get-one free deals so you can afford to try out a bunch of these places on a student budget :)"
Sophomore,4,"Well done. I took the second half of my spring semester classes online due to COVID, and while not the ideal situation, Westmont and its faculty adapted fast, well, and efficiently."
Sophomore,4,A beautiful campus that promotes Jesus. There are some amazing Jesus loving people that attend Westmont and it is situated in the hills of Montecito above Santa Barbara.
Junior,4,"So many of the faculty and staff are just so welcoming and happy to help you at any time. The professors truly want the best for their students and are so willing to meet them where they are at. I love the goals and the expectations the college strives for. One recent issue that the college is struggling with is diversity. They have claimed to take action, but nothing has really happened so far. This upcoming semester for Fall 2020 seems more promising than the rest, so we will see. But other than that, I love the people I have met and the became life-long friends with."
Junior,4,"Due to Covid-19 I had to take some classes online here and I think my professors did a great job transitioning on such short notice. They were really forgiving and willing to work with whatever needs you had, as well as the different situations students were in. You could tell the professors really wanted to try their best to make it work for their students because they just care so much, which is such a great thing."
Freshman,4,"Westmont provides an amazing college experience for many reasons. The class sizes are kept small, and as a result, I've built real relationships with many students as well as professors, who make all opinions heard, are open to discussion, and put in effort to assist you as well as get to know you. There are high academic standards and as a result high-level classes that push me to work hard and be better. The small campus and campus population contributes to a feeling of community uncommon to college campuses."
Sophomore,4,"The sudden adjustment to remotion education was rough on faculty, but all of my professors were very understanding and flexible and I felt my education was not impaired greatly."
Sophomore,4,"Westmont is one of the better Christian liberal arts colleges out there. I love the school's small student body and community - it took just a few months before I felt like I knew like half the people on campus, and yet the school never felt too small. There are some truly great students here. Westmont has wonderful professors and is differently more academically challenged than a typical challenge. I am impressed with how Westmont's Christian values felt genuine without becoming too legalistic or fundamental like some other Christian colleges. It is easy for those who are interested to plug into a strong Christian community. However, this college is not for everybody, and those who do not fit in struggle, especially non-Christian students. There have various diversity issues that have been raised that are currently being addressed, as well as an unhealthy addiction to ""overcommitment"" among the student body. Overall though, I am glad I picked Westmont."
Freshman,4,"Westmont is very communicative, which is probably my favorite part about it. If you are an incoming freshman they make you feel very welcoming. The only thing is the price, it is more expensive, however they are very helpful with letting you know about scholarships, as well as giving their own scholarships out as well."
Niche User,4,"The campus was beautiful. Walking on campus felt like camping. 
 The food was average quality but there was a variety. I appreciated that there were options for different diets simce I am a vegetarian. One of the teachers let me sit in their class when they found out I had an interest in that subject. It was very interactive and cool that he let me just pop in. The class was about hybrid orbitals, so.ethung I have get to study. But I learned a lot in that class. The students were very welcoming."
Junior,4,So far very good environment of people and staff. Everyone is very friendly and the sense of community is very fulfilling.
Junior,4,"The education is a cut above the rest; they require a very focused mindset at all times, and the professors push you. However, the opportunity you are provided here is a amazing, and there are many opportunities to go above and beyond. My biggest complaint is the social aspect; predominately white with a mold that is expected of the students."
Freshman,4,"Westmont is the perfect school if you are looking for a small community. Everyone at the school is there to support you and makes sure you are doing well in all of your classes, but the student life here including food and dorms is not the best. Those are a small price to pay for an outstanding education and one on one time with your professors."
Freshman,4,Westmont College is a small private Christian school. Everyone on campus is really friendly and welcoming. If your looking for a school with not to big of a crowd and smaller classes then Westmont is the place for you. The professors are really flexible and really try to make sure you succeed. Most of your professors know who you are and will notice if you're missing class. Westmont is also very diverse and accepts everyone.
Sophomore,4,Such an amazing school full of wonderful people! For the most part every person I've met has been so friendly and caring. I can say the same for all the staff and professors as well. Campus is absolutely stunning and it just makes me so happy to walk around and see all the beautiful plants and trees.
Senior,4,I had a wonderful experience at Westmont. There is so much room for genuine growth within an uplifting community. Professors are there to see you succeed and administration genuinely cares about their students
Freshman,4,"This is a very wonderful school in which you are encouraged to become your own person and discover your own voice.  The faculty and staff are really great people, and the students form a close and supportive community.  Your professors are extremely accessible and easy to talk to, and they make time to get to know you and help you with your homework if you need it.  The one thing that could be better is the food in the Dining Commons."
College Freshman,4,The overall experience at this school is great because I am not just another student among many.
College Sophomore,4,living on campus makes it easier to be plugged in
College Sophomore,4,The dorms on campus are a little old but they are good and clean. The bathroom gets cleaned every day and community is great! they are also very close to class rooms
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at my school are great! They are one of the best in NAIA Div. 1. Our facilities are outstanding, professional athletes use them."
College Freshman,4,classes are real tough. but professors are accessible and accommodating and always have great advice - whether life or academics related.
College Freshman,4,"There are always things you can change, but Westmont has surpassed my expectations in many ways!"
College Freshman,4,The academics and workload  is  challenging and registration is fairly simple. I mostly study in my dorm or the library because it is quietest.
College Freshman,4,I have not heard of anyone being sexually assaulted on our campus or the systems in place for sexual assault.
College Sophomore,4,Great people. Great location. Great facilities. Great professors. Lots of work.
College Sophomore,4,"Nothing on campus at Westmont, but there is plenty of that happening in Isla Vista"
College Freshman,4,"The campus is incredibly safe and supportive. It's easy to be seen at the health center, and the doctor is knowledgable and helpful in most cases. The health center is only open M-F in the day, so it isn't available when people need it the most - weekends and the middle of the night."
College Freshman,4,"For an NAIA school, we have high quality athletics. We win many conference championships, and regularly go to nationals in almost every sport. The fields and gym are very nice, but the workout room is crowded and has very few machine options."
College Freshman,4,"Great people, who are willing to help."
College Freshman,4,"Great food, and healthy choices."
College Freshman,4,A bunch of my older friends love it.
College Freshman,4,"Taco Tuesday. I'm telling you, it's the best!"
College Freshman,4,"Great variety, its fresh and local and if you're vegetarian like me then you won't run out of choices. People say they get tired of the food and I could see why but compared to state schools this food is awesome!! I can't complain."
College Freshman,4,Always feel safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,Love cheering for soccer and basketball!
College Freshman,4,Off-campus housing is great and competitive!
College Freshman,4,"There is a good variety of restaurants, though it can be a bit pricy."
College Freshman,4,"The school is a little bit away from the actual town, so it is a bit difficult to get to the city. The main street is fun, but there is not a huge amount to do. The best part is definitely being so close to the beach."
College Freshman,4,People are very trusting and leave dorms and classrooms unlocked a lot. Not much theft
College Freshman,4,"State street is great. Plenty of shopping, eating, library, theatre, movie theatre, art museum, churches, all within walking distance. Oh, and the beach is right here, too!"
College Freshman,4,"Not the biggest part of campus life, which i think is great."
College Freshman,4,Encourages respect of authority and of each other. Not outlandish rules for a christian campus
College Freshman,4,They do a great job of choosing roommates and sectionmates.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are all really knowledgeable about what they teach
College Sophomore,4,No matter what major you choose the professor over it will help as best they can.
College Sophomore,4,I personally enjoy the strictness of the campus life
College Freshman,4,"I have not had any yet, but I look forward to having some."
College Freshman,4,"Guys are very polite, they will open the door for you any time they can."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very different and unique in their own personal way.
College Freshman,4,There are many opportunities to study abroad and attend other activities.
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone goes pre-med but then they change their major.
College Freshman,4,Saanta Barbara is the best place to be at. There is always something to do around there.
College Freshman,4,"They're not extremely strict, as long as you follow the rules there are."
College Freshman,4,There are many places to go eat but they're all pretty far.
College Freshman,4,There is always a place to hang out at any time at night.
College Freshman,4,"Everything is great, it is just really expensive."
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are very helpful, you just have to ask for help."
College Freshman,4,The parties that usually take place are just social gatherings.
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone is in a sport of other activity.
College Freshman,4,You can call for help anytime. There is always someone around.
Junior,2,"The academics are good at Westmont. You get a good education here. 
However, the social scene here needs serious work. Diversity is better but is unlearned. Very sheltered and feels like camp and cliquey. If you want to grow and meet different types of people this place is not for you. It feels like highschool. The college dorms are outdated. You will not get a college experience here i'm sorry. I wish I liked it here. I go out of my way to make friends elsewhere. If you are white, love Jesus, and want to meet like-minded people this place is for you."
College Sophomore,2,Ultimately the RA and RD could not fix issues be it roommate issues or facilities issues
College Freshman,2,"There is not much ethnic diversity on campus, mostly white and Asians. Ii know of no one that has come out with sexual orientation, they are not tolerable, gays are considered evil and going to hell sadly."
College Freshman,2,"The food and housing is expensive, everything is outdated, the washing machines don't work, they won't dry your clothes and your clothes smell sour. The bathrooms are horrifying - sooo dirty. I was happy to see they cleaned the dorm carpets in the main areas at spring break, made it smell much better."
College Sophomore,2,"I felt that Westmont College was not very accepting. I was not able to choose the school of my choice, therefore I had to attend a religious school. Keeping in mind that I am not religious, my review is biased in this way. I was always a good kid growing up. When I came to Westmont, I was perceived as a ""bad kid"" and ""rebel"" since I drank and went out on the weekends. I am not a crazy party person, but when I was at Westmont I felt like I might as well have been doing hard drugs. The students overall do not accept you unless you are a committed Christian. There are pockets of kids who do, but they are few and not popular. I felt judged and ""pitied"" because I did not share the same beliefs as the majority of the students. I wanted to like the school; It's a beautiful campus in an incredible location, but the unaccepting community (students and staff) caused me to transfer."
College Freshman,2,The staff is basically incompetent. You basically have to figure things out yourself.
College Freshman,2,"They do their best to accommodate those with dietary restrictions, but there are very limited options and it gets boring. It's operated by Sodexo, which means the meals are overpriced and many are unhealthy. Organic foods are only available on Farm Fresh Friday, and even then it is only one lunch option."
College Junior,2,"Being a Christian school, I did not expect much of a party scene, and that is exactly what I got. About twenty minutes downtown is Isla Vista, and that is more than enough."
Recent Alumnus,2,Overpriced for food lacking in the quality you'd expect for the price.  Great salad and sandwich bar though
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not a huge athletics-crazy school, but it is just NAIA after all - not like we're. D1 or anything! Not too many people show up for the typical sporting events, but each team tends to have its own personal cheering section because of friends showing up etc,"
Recent Alumnus,2,Montecito is just plain outrageously expensive - no matter how you look at it. Most people I know who have lived off campus go a little further into actual Santa Barbara to find their apartments within a student budget!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some political opinion diversity, but that's about as far as it goes. Very homogenous student body racially, ethnically, and in spiritual beliefs. But it is a very small Christian school of only about 1300 students so you have to take that into account, too."
College Sophomore,2,"Quite strict on the whole scale of colleges, but when you look at specifically Christian college Westmont is on the less strict side."
College Junior,2,"The surrounding neighborhood is nice to look at, but there isn't much to do unless you are a millionaire. Everything is so overpriced its ridiculous."
College Junior,2,"About half of the guys are really hot and seemingly good at everything; but the other half are really odd and sheltered and in need of social help. The girls seem like they all came out of some cookie-cutter factory. Most of them are attractive, but full of themselves and pay little attention to detail. There are exceptions. 

On the weekends everyone seems to have a social life... Because the campus is deserted. 

Relationships are extremely overdramatic. Most of the girls are constantly hunting for their potential husbands. Its a bit creepy really."
College Sophomore,2,"Westmont College is not very diverse.  Most students are white, middle to upper class, conservative, christian, and heterosexual.  There are very marginal differences in our student body."
College Junior,2,"Not very many people are able to get off campus housing, and those that do still have to deal with the difficulty of the housing departments rules and regulations."
College Junior,2,Not enough diversity or acceptance of diversity
College Freshman,2,I am not able to have a car as a freshman and it is very inconvenient at times especially since I've been stranded when the shuttle has failed to pick up.
College Freshman,2,"Currently, the major I would like to pursue is not offered at my school, and I would have to take classes at other schools to obtain a degree in it.  The number of majors and opportunities here is limited."
Sophomore,1,Online classes are harder than the regular ones. They add more work because they do not believe you are doing anything while at home.
Sophomore,1,"This is a terrible college. If you look at their retention rate you can see how few people are actually happy here. I have many friends who are transferring or who want to transfer but can not afford to go to another school. Westmont does not care about students of color. If you are a minority this is not the place for you. Especially if you are black because black students only make up two percent of the population. You will have to deal with racism and microagressions from everyone around you including professors, peers, staff and admiration.  
The best advice I can give students is stay away!"
Alum,1,"There are many ways to review a college.  I feel compelled to give Westmont a low score for one reason: it extolls propaganda more than knowledge.  When I think of the various schools I attended, the ones that made lasting, positive impressions where the ones that helped me grow.  Westmont felt more like indoctrination.  They help their students fit into their mold. I know gay, lesbian, and transgender friends who graduated believing that they should marry a straight partner.  Of course, that seldom worked.  Divorce came after months, years, or decades.  A few times, it resulted in suicides.  For a school who believes it inspires deep thinking, why is it so afraid of liberal Christianity and science?  Until it can open itself to alternative perspectives, I can only give it one star.  It doesn’t matter how attractive your campus is or how friendly the faculty and students are.  I know people who died because of this college’s teachings.  It can do better."
Alum,1,"Westmont College is incredible beautiful as it is seated in the hillsides of Monetcito, only a short drive to the beach and a short hike to mountain top views. Unfortunately, this college is unfit for students of color or students inclined to progressive activism as its highly conservative and evangelical culture fosters explicit racism. In the past years that Westmont administration has better become known for tokenization, silencing and alienation of POC which has led to two current student movements, No White Jesus and #ToxicWestmont."
Alum,1,"There answer to every problem seems to be ""pray about it"" which isn't helpful at all. Junior year my roommate and I found black mold in our room. The new dorm was barely finished by the time school started and because they rushed its pretty crappy. My door frame wasn't sealed all the way, leading to hundreds of ants in my room when I moved in. They wouldn't cancel classes during the Thomas Fire until the very last minute even though the air quality was atrocious and you could see the ash in the air."
College Freshman,1,We do not have fraternities or sorority on campus. it is more like high school with clicks.
College Freshman,1,The parties at the off campus seniors' houses were pretty horrible.
College Freshman,1,The administration is a joke.
College Freshman,1,"Dorms are absolutely disgusting. They look like they are cleaned once a month, if that."
College Freshman,1,I don't party soooo...not interested
College Freshman,1,It is formed by the dorm you live in.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If strictness is a bad thing, then Westtmont is pretty bad. But before anyone goes complaining about it too much, they should remember that they decided to go there.  They knew what they were getting themselves into when they applied becase the school makes it's moral code very obvious and directly connect it to the fact that it is a Christian insituutution. Peoples finding themselves prone to complaining, too, should remember that they also signed their life away in an honor code contract before even being allowed to enroll! So for someone who wanted a party school, it would be hard to believe they just happened upon Westmont without realizing it wouldn't be a good fit for their lifestyle."
College Junior,1,"All of the campus security employees should just be fired and replaced. They are absolutely no help, and only cause problems. I have keys to a lot of the buildings, and every time one of them comes around they automatically view me as some sort of threat and try to kick me out until I tell them that I have been given keys to the buildings. 

One time my car got broken into. EVERYTHING was stolen (stereo, ipod, gps, wheel key, stick shift knob, change) and campus security did NOTHING about it even though my car was parked in plain sight of their security cameras. Isn't it their job to at least TRY to look at the footage?! 

Do not be fooled by how wonderful montecito looks. There is a REASON why every other house has massive locked gates. People come up to Westmont to steal things because they know that the campus security sucks."
College Junior,1,"Living on campus is definitely not worth the money, however, you don't have much option. Only a very small majority of students actually receive the privilege of living off campus. 

The dorms are VERY SMALL. I was lucky and got wonderful roommates. Sophomore and junior housing is the worst."
College Junior,1,"Going to this school is almost like being in a religious version of ""The Stepford Wives"". Everyone is SO SIMILAR that after a while all of the freshman seem to blend together and go unnoticed even though the student body is so small. The food is absolutely horrible. The employees at the front desk of admissions and financial aid are exceedingly rude (at one point the lady from admissions brought me to tears by providing no help and waving me away like I was a peasant or something)."
College Junior,1,The DC food is AWFUL. Admission events are a lie.
College Freshman,1,"There is no nightlife, and freshmen are not allowed to have cars.  The average weekend consists of taking the shuttle to state street or watching movies."
College Student,1,"Nobody drinks, does drugs, or has sex. It's great!"
College Freshman,1,"Dont go here if you like fun of any kind. This is the strictest place i have ever been. when it comes to alcohol you can get in trouble by just hear say. a simple ""he/she went to UCSB last weekend"" could screw you over. smoking is not allowed on campus, you have to get on a shuttle and go downtown if you smoke. also if anyone sees that you are even in possession of cigarettes or any other tobacco products they can confiscate them, eventhough it is very legal for you to own them."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid department has one person that actually knows what she is doing, but since no one can hold her ""baggage"", She is very grouchy and refuses to work with me most of the time"

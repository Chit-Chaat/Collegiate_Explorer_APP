Freshman,5,"It's a good school. I feel like I am being held to a very high standard, though the school is also providing a lot of extra resources outside of class for free, and most of the professors are lenient and reasonable."
Sophomore,5,"The first thing you notice about the campus is the amount of diversity. The student population is so diverse. Along with that, the professors in each department are very supportive. I can guarantee that you will find at least one stellar professor for each subject. They make learning at the college easy and fun, especially if college is not the only thing going on in life for you. It's a great college to attend when you're balancing many other priorities in life as well but it's still credible."
Sophomore,5,"I'm attending the college as part of a dual enrollment program. So as a high school student trying to balance many other extracurriculars along with education, I tend to choose online classes. Over half of the classes I've taken at Bellevue College have been online and I love it. Most online teachers are asynchronous meaning they lay out your work for you and the resources needed but you can work on your own time. That being said, the professors are amazing in the sense they're always available for help and accomodating with learning being online. They offer many resources and make the classes an easy process. I've taken all different types of online classes from Economics and Accounting to English and Poli Sci and they've all been great experiences!"
Freshman,5,"Bellevue College is a great school. The people and staff are really easy going. I've never felt uncomfortable asking questions. So far even with the COVID-19 pandemic, BC staff has been pretty responsive and available virtually. Also, considering the location of the school, it has a somewhat diverse community."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent classes and lovely faculty. Community is diverse, welcoming, and I had a great experience as a Running Start student."

Sophomore,5,"I've had a pretty positive experience with online learning at BC, but I think it depends on alot on the prof!"
Sophomore,5,Really great school for running start students. Lots of class options and opportunities to explore interests outside of the restraints of high school courses.
Sophomore,5,My experience with the school overall was excellent. There are many resources within the school that are there to aid. As a first generation college student I found college very hard to navigate through because early on you get many details thrown your way it is good to have a few people on your side that are able to steer you in the right direction. The academic advising is phenomenal. They are there to assist with any academic regards. My best piece of advice is use the resources that are provided to you as a student.
Junior,5,"Amazing experience, very supportive professors and other staffs like writing lab, IT tutors. Very nice experience"
Junior,5,"One of the best college. A lot of parking, multiple learning scope and chill atmosphere. There are many resources that student can take benefit of and most of the professors are well qualified and experienced."

Sophomore,5,"I love my school, I feel like the instructors are very supportive and my learning experience has been great."
Sophomore,5,"I really like the teachers as they truly help a lot. The people are also friendly here, and the campus is also pretty safe. Its really close to a lot of cafes and restaurants, including the mall so many students like to go to study. There are also a lot of study groups found around campus so it is easy to find help. The professors are also helpful and they are not super busy like some professors in other colleges. The credits also transfer to UW so it is the best option for someone who wants to knock off some credits for much cheaper."
Niche User,5,Amazing/laid back teachers with informative classes and easy to follow online courses. Very diverse and rich student culture with great classes that taught me a lot about the real world.
Sophomore,5,"Going to Bellevue College is one of the best decisions I have made in my academic life. It is incredibly resourceful in its professors, in its library programs, and especially the tutor programs that are free and available to all. I have been utilizing the free tutoring programs most, they are open from bright and early in the morning to past sunset. I am very pleased with what I have been able to achieve due to Bellevue College."
Niche User,5,"Very open and diverse community. Advisors there are super helpful, especially the moses who specialize in their department."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed the dedicated teachers and staff in the music department. The band room, practice rooms, and theater are all great, although we could use some more practice rooms. We could also use more parking AND parking enforcement as people are often parking where they shouldn't with outdated parking passes"
Freshman,5,"So far Bellevue College has exceeded my expectations! My professors have been incredibly helpful and personable. Everyone I've needed to contact in the admin office or any other student service office have all been friendly and informative. The tuition is extremely fair and they have TONS of online class options, which is all I can take being a full time working mom to 4-year-old twins and a 10-year-old.  This school has been a godsend for me!"
Graduate Student,5,Bellevue college is a great option for students who struggle financially. They provide a high standard of academics so students are able to take the next step in their career. The environment is very diverse!
Sophomore,5,"Really amazing teachers. They are kind, approachable and openly communicative. I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff there as well. The school can be a bit confusing to navigate at first, but there are always people around to help you out. I've never had to wait a long time to talk with a financial aid or registration advisor. Teachers are usually pretty quick to respond to messages and I've never thought the content being taught was overwhelming or too difficult to understand. I believe this is because most of the professors at Bellevue College have been teaching for quite a long time and have learned the best ways to relay information to students. I'm very grateful for this experience and I couldn't have chosen a better school to attend."
Niche User,5,Bellevue College has a great atmosphere. It is super diverse in both ethnicities and ages. There are a lot of High School students who take part in the Running Start (Dual-Enrollment) programs at BC. No running start student is treated any differently than the other students. There are lots of clubs and groups to join and their class selection is super broad. They offer a great variety of classes and it is super easy to graduate with an Associates Degree in two years or less.
Junior,5,"I enjoyed taking classes in Bellevue College. Students get great one on one chances with instructors. They offer online, campus and hybrid classes. Students can still balance their lives while taking classes in Bellevue College."
Graduate Student,5,Bellevue college was the saving grace for my academic career. The one to one with the teachers is super important and was very strong at bellevue college. The amount of classes for this type of school was good and the parking was good as-well. I would recommend bellevue college to anyone who is not sure what they want to study and if they have money issues because bellevue college is extremely cheap.
Sophomore,5,"Prior to attending college I had no idea of what I wanted to achieve. After attending Bellevue College for two years, I not only have ambitions to become the best academic student I can be but have developed a passion for multiple fields of study. Bellevue College has prepared me academically, and professionally to become a well rounded individual in and out of the classroom with the skills and abilities to succeed regardless of my profession."
Sophomore,5,Bellevue College is a place where everyone feels welcome to gain their higher education and to excel in general.
Freshman,5,"The campus is in great condition, and most of the teachers are great! Do yourself a favor and buy a parking pass!"
Niche User,5,"Bellevue College is a solid community college. I went here for the running start program, and it was a great experience. Some of the professors here are fantastic at their job, and the campus itself is pretty nice too in terms of safety and amentities. The small classes and caring professors made the academic experience quite enjoyable."
Alum,5,"My favorite school!
I learned so much from the clubs offered at this school! staff were very attentive and did everything possible to help me succeed. I also loved the library on this campus, it has a quiet floor which was nice to study in."
Sophomore,5,"A fairly casual college that is relatively cheap to attend and easy to get to transportation wise, being just a short distance from the park and ride. There are also numerous online and hybrid classes as well as a variety of transfer options."
Junior,5,"Bellevue College is a great place to start before transferring to a four-year. The classes are small, teachers are helpful, and the price compared to a university is amazing. Bellevue College also offers Bachelor degrees which is amazing! Going to a smaller college before going to a university really helped me to become more comfortable with asking questions, working in groups, and becoming slowly accustomed to college academics. At Bellevue College, there is a wide variety of types of classes to take including different kinds of dance, a whole plethora of art classes, and all of the other basic requirement classes and more."
Freshman,5,As I’m a current student I love the different opportunities the school gives no us. There’s always places to go to for help with anything you need. So many resources!
Freshman,5,"Very diverse demographic. Professors are kind and fair and while I am an online student, many have office hours available to speak to them in person. Staff is friendly and efficient. Lots of parking available, even daily parking."
Junior,5,"Had a great time while attending Bellevue College. The advising staff were great, helpful and encouraging. The school has a lot of international students which make it a diverse school. The school provides free tutoring for many of the courses that they offer."
Junior,5,"I just started attending, and it's nice. The classes are mostly small, so it's easier to get to know peers. It's also very close to where I live. It's a 5 minute bus ride there. It's a big place, and has a good atmosphere."
Sophomore,5,Overall a really great school.  A lot of variety of good classes.  Professors teach well and are super helpful if you do no understand something.
Junior,5,"Bellevue College was the starting block into higher education for me. The teachers are fantastic, the diversity is out of this world, and I especially appreciate the culture at BC. One thing to look out for is that their student government is not fantastic, and they struggle getting clubs organized. Other than that BC is a great place to get your associates, and a great place to network and make friends."
Sophomore,5,"Bellevue College has been a life changing experience. Four years after graduating from high school my first day was extremely nerve wracking. Nail biting, sweating, and heavy breathing. I almost turned around to go back home. I stuck it out, found a easy parking spot and walked to my class without getting lost. I sat in the back left corner that way the teacher would not call on me for any reason. She was very pleasant, made me feel as if the only thing I feared was fear itself. I made it through the first day. On my second day, I met a great friend. We studied together and even signed up for the same classes the following quarter. Since that first day, everyday since has been a positive one. All my teachers have been engaging, wonderful, and go above and beyond for their students. I feel safe on campus and even if I feel scared about walking to my car at night they have security that will escort you. Overall BC is an exceptional college."
Niche User,5,All the staff and teachers are very helpful and have been very understanding. I have been a running start student since last year and every time I join a new class or visit the campus everyone is very welcoming and it is a great working/learning environment. The campus is very big and beautiful so it is easy to get lost but I feel as if I can ask anyone for help!
Niche User,5,Good for Running Start and getting ahead. Very good and attentive professors and very interesting classes; good with online learning
Junior,5,"I like many things in Bellevue College like a professors, location, campus life and the staff are very friendly. Every think it’s a great"
Niche User,5,"I liked that Bellevue College offered a wide variety of resources, including free tutoring, academic advising, degree audits, and the availability of both online and on campus courses. I am enrolled as a Running Start student and it has been extremely beneficial for my future academic plans."
Niche User,5,Bellevue College is the best! I attended via the Washington State Running Start program. The school is very diverse and there are many different points of view to learn from. Teachers are available outside of class and very helpful. The bookstore is great and buying textbooks is easy.
Freshman,5,I love Bellevue College so far but I haven't had much to go off of as I have taken one class on campus and two online. What I have been exposed to has been excellent.
Alum,5,I had a great experience here. Was able to get my degree completely online which allowed me to continue my education while pursuing my dream of dancing as a professional ballerina! Professors were helpful and staff is amazing!
Freshman,5,"Bellevue College is a great school!  The professors I've had have been very good and I've learned a lot here so far. There are a  wide variety of subjects to take a well as days/times of day to take classes. 

The campus is nice and spacious and everything is easy to find.  All the buildings are easily marketed.  The campus has plenty of parking and easy access from the freeways."
Junior,5,"I have enjoyed the past two years so much that I am actually hesitant to ever transfer; however, I will have to transfer to pursue my path in pre-medicine. Bellevue College has amazing professors who have both challenged me and inspired me. I have learned a great amount these past two years and feel well prepared for my future studies. While I spent most of my time in the science building, I often wandered to other parts of the campus and found Bellevue College has a lot of resources to offer. BC has a great library with many resources, a great cafeteria,  a great music department with piano rooms to practice in, and much more."
Junior,5,"Bellevue College offers a variety of subjects and classes, and most of its teachers really care about their students. The campus is very nice and peaceful."
Freshman,5,"I really liked about Bellevue College.The professor at Bellevue College are super nice and patient.They are always here to help if you needed.I would like Bellevue College add more online class,That will be great."
Niche User,5,"I commute with a motorcycle to school and work so I like how Bellevue college provides motorcycle parking so I never have trouble looking for a parking spot. I recently re-registered after being out of school for 5 years. All of the instructors that I've encountered were great. Close to the end of the quarter- instructors encourage students to complete an anonymous review about the class and the instructor. Tuition is still expensive- I'm paying around $1500 for three 5-credit classes. Although tuition is expensive, there are still other resources you can use like financial aid, student loans, or occupation reimbursement. Student Central has a convenient way to make appointments to see advisors, through computer or smartphone. I like how they incorporated that because I wouldn't have to wait that long to see an advisor if needed."
Sophomore,5,"Bellevue college is a really great school. They are very welcoming, students are kind and involved in many activities. Most of the professors are wonderful and treat their students well, which makes for enjoyable classes. There is a huge variety of classes available and programs. The campus is easy to navigate. However, there seems to be a lack of street lights at night around parts of the campus, which can be dangerous for students walking to and from their cars. I also think parking passes should be a bit cheaper."
Alum,5,"A very nice and friendly learning environment. Most instructors are super nice with explaining the class materials after classes and really care about their students. There was no on-campus housing while I was studying there, however, by the time I graduated the school was building a new dorm."
Sophomore,5,"I've been attending Bellevue College for about a year now and I have nothing but good words. It's a fun, energetic, and safe campus to attend. I've taken morning/day classes, night classes, and online/hybrid classes - The teachers are always willing to work with you, their educated, and they enjoy their job. Big shout out to my PSYCH100 teacher Mr. Kiralla! He is awesome. :)"
Alum,5,"Best bang for your buck. Bellevue College is a commuter school so it is difficult to make friends that are willing to socialize with you after class. People usually stay here for a few years then transfer to a larger university. The clubs here are small, but a great way to make friends. Barely anyone goes to support the athletics here. Most of the teachers here really know their subjects and are willing to help you succeed. Bellevue College is probably one of the best colleges in the area."
Freshman,5,"Bellevue College is amazing! I have been going here for 1 quarter so far and all of my professors I've had the pleasure of being taught by have been awesome! Leo Kiralla in specific who teaches Psychology is very good. By far my favorite professor at Bellevue College. Nick Russ is a wonderful Sociology teacher. All of the professors I have encountered so far have cared for the well being of their students and made sure they had everything necessary to succeed in their classes.

Can't wait for Spring 2017 quarter! As long as you check your professors out on RateMyProfessor you won't have any issues with getting bad ones! However, I didn't even do that and I got some of the greatest professors I have ever had. Period. Keep up the good work guys!

Go Bulldogs!"
Sophomore,5,"Bellevue College was a great experience. The faculty that taught my classes were all knowledgeable in both the material and its application towards future careers, the courses were taught with efficiency and purpose in their content, and were of the same quality that anyone could find at any other educational institution. However, the class sizes were far smaller and focused then larger colleges, and the costs for tuition were far more preferable. I learned almost everything I felt I needed to know to transfer into my primary college and still be ahead of the rest of my classmates, and those skills learned are still helping me today."
Senior,5,"The teachers I interacted with were all highly qualified and genuinely cared about student successes and educational goals. If anything, I would say all that might be improved is teacher transparency with students. Overall, an excellent experience at BC"
Freshman,5,So far being at Bellevue is a great experience I received a lot of help when I started. My friends went to Bellevue and they had nothing but good things to say!
Sophomore,4,Bellevue college is a really diverse Campus and everyone there welcomes you and helps you feel at home. There are a lot of services to help make your academic journey an excellent experience. The counseling center is amazing and has helped me not fall into depression
Freshman,4,"It has had its ups and downs, though I think we are all finally figuring out how to effectively teach and learn at a large scale. 

I look forward to returning to class because I miss hands-on learning and no-webcam exams, though I definitely want synchronous online classes to remain an option for people like me, who need to take the dreaded I-405 to get to and from campus."
Sophomore,4,"Professors were either hit or miss with online learning. STEM professors, specifically math, struggled to adapt to the online setting. However, my art prof adjusted well and I enjoyed the class. Teachers who traditionally taught online handled the change better."
Sophomore,4,"I've been at Bellevue College for over two years now, I enjoy being on campus because there is always some fun activities going on. The staff is always friendly and advisors are always helpful. I would like Bellevue college to have more classes available especially if it is popular classes."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is made easy through Zoom, some professors do get technical difficulties. Science labs are not held at all, professors will send out a video of someone creating the lab so you cannot do labs yourself wish I enjoy most about science classes. Professors are easily accessible online."
Freshman,4,Bellevue College has welcoming professors and friendly staff. Some campus buildings are new and clean. I had a good overall experience at Bellevue College.
Freshman,4,All Bellevue College courses use Canvas platform for both hybrid and online classes. They are very organized and easy to direct. The way the online class is designed depends on the professor.
Freshman,4,"Due to Coronavirus, I did online schooling towards the end of my winter quarter and the rest of spring quarter. I, personally, am not fond of online, due to the fact that self taught assignments can be a bit challenging, but my professors made it amazing! They were so willing to help in more ways than usual, they were lenient to misunderstandings, and provided the best assignments for my learning. To my surprise, online school wasn’t as bad as I anticipated."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed Bellevue immensely! It provided me with great education, friends, and fellowship. It was an easy way to receive credits and I can safely say that I recommend it to anybody who is considering going."
Niche User,4,"I like their transparency and how well they are handling the COVID outbreak. It wasn't easy having to transition to online classes, but Bellevue is handling it well."
Niche User,4,"I like that many of the good teachers were blessings in disguise. Although the overall environment was lacking in competitiveness and hard work, I couldn't help but feel close to many of the people I've met."
Junior,4,Chill environment. Not much drama and is becoming more diverse as the population increases. The campus is open and there are many places to study at.
Niche User,4,"Bellevue used to be community college and now is a 4 year school. To give someone the full college experience, it would need to improve its student engagement but overall it's a great school."
Sophomore,4,"Bellevue college offers variety of classes. The class size is smaller than regular university so the teacher can focus on each student and have better quality of teaching.  Also, the transportation is very convenient. Regarding to school life, there are not too much of activities. Hopefully, in the future school can hold more fun activities for students to bond."
Niche User,4,"I choose to go to Bellevue College because I mostly liked what a variety of educational programs they have.  I am enrolling for the interior design program as an international student. I really liked that Bellevue college has the best program for that in the state. Additionally, it has a lot of helping services for student's, which I love. On the other Hand I find the website from Bellevue college a little too complicated, in the view of an international student, to find the right answers for students questions or at least a phone number. That is what is struggled the most with."
Senior,4,"I love this school! I’m so grateful for the opportunities I’ve been able to take advantage of here. The professors really care, and while there are a few duds, I’ve never had a bad class. I’m about to enter my last quarter at BC and part of me is sad. I haven’t been incredibly involved with clubs or anything like that but I have fully enjoyed the school culture."
Junior,4,"Overall, Bellevue College has been a pleasant community college experience for me. I've been able to round out my core classes at a relatively affordable price and believe this has been helpful for me to be a more attractive applicant to Tier  1 universities across the region. This school is located in a wealthy suburban area, so be wary that living near campus may be difficult to afford. As an adult student that works full time and is returning to school, they had enough online classes for me to work my schedule around. Ideally, I would have preferred more evening course offerings, but your mileage may vary based on course need. Thanks Bellevue College!"
Niche User,4,"Most of my experience with Bellevue College has been great. I got into most of the classes that I wanted to, every subject had quality professors, with small enough class sizes and overall students to have good office hour sessions. There is a plethora of resources like tutoring, counseling, computer labs, and more. The campus is nice, and keeps improving. There are quite a few modern buildings with new equipment and rooms that enhance the college experience, and many more are also being renovated. The campus environment was also nice -- apart from the occasional conflicts of outside protesters, there was never anything blatantly bad happening on campus. I went here as early college and I greatly appreciate the experience."
Sophomore,4,"I Liked my experience in Bellevue College because I learned from bad and good moments. Furthermore, thanks to the diversity of races and ethnicity I felt confident to take positions of leadership. The school has many sources to help students succeed in life and most important always listen to the students voice."
Sophomore,4,"I loved Bellevue College. It is an amazing school, with teachers who really care for an unbelievable price. Not all of the teachers are great, but the majority truly care about their job and don't let their biases interfere with their teaching (political). It is a very accepting university!"
Sophomore,4,"Compact, clean and friendly community college campus with knowlageable professors. In my two years attending so far, I have enjoyed going to class! There are many on-campus events to keep the college lively. I would highly reccomend for those who are looking for a small high-quality institution."
Freshman,4,"Bellevue College offers a variety of academic programs for students from opportunities inside and outside the campus. Not only that, but networking here is a lot of fun. You meet a diverse amount of peers who might have some aligned interests or goals that knowing them provides you a sense of perspective in that subject. Overall, BC is a college experience that feels at home with what its community and opportunities in and out of it."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Bellevue College has been very good because the people are very friendly and the professors actually care about your success.
Alum,4,The school is definitely worth the money. You get far more then you pay for. The only problems I had with the school were parking and foreign teachers. A few of my math teachers had heavy accents and I couldn't understand them so it made the classes very hard to take.
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity, safety, campus, and surrounding area. The professors are pretty average; I have had a few awesome professors as well as some pretty bad professors. But, for the most part, the professors were average. I like the average class size of 33 students; it makes for a close-knit learning environment."
Sophomore,4,This is a great college with an amazing commute. The class sizes are very nice and the professors really know what they are teaching.
Sophomore,4,"I have had an overall good experience with Bellevue College. I am just about to start my second year and haven’t had any problems with any professors or any administrative issues. There are a lot of students, I think around 30,000 so if you just want to keep to yourself and go about your business you totally can."
Sophomore,4,"Bellevue overall is a great place to start off your college career! I believe that it is a necessity to get involved in college groups and teams. I joined the cheer leading team which helped me find my core group of friends as well as connections that will help me grow in my career. Since the school and classes are on the smaller side compared to a typical university, it helps creates better relationships with professors."
Sophomore,4,"As a Running Start Student at Bellevue College, I have thoroughly enjoyed being a student at college and working towards my associates degree."
Works Here,4,"This school has some of the most amazing professors and faculty that I have ever met. This school is a very welcoming and open school, they are very heavy on diversity.   the people here are very friendly and welcoming to help anyone they can. Over all it is an amazing school."
Freshman,4,What I like about Bellevue College is that it's a very good school for people that want to go the cheap route through college and that people go to this college to save money and eventually transfer to a 4 year degree school. What i think should change in this school is the graduation rate is low and it's because people take advantage of a college that costs less than a university and they waste there time.
Niche User,4,"I attended Bellevue College from 2014 to 2018. Bellevue College has given me experiences I will never forget. I've had some bad professors and experiences, but also many positive ones that involved me to grow and force myself out of my comfort zone."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy going to this school. The class sizes are small, and the teachers seem to actually give a shit about the students. I lived my classes that I took here. Also, I had an amazing adviser in the TRiO program. I would highly recommend this school to anyone living in the area."
Freshman,4,"Bellevue College is a place for students to focus on their studies. There are many areas where students can be quiet and do homework or study and the buildings are well maintained. This is more of a local college, not a university so there aren't any dorms or housing which is understandable and wouldn't be necessary. Most of the classes are straightforward and are pretty flexible. There are many options and pathways for students and their journey at this 4-year college."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Bellevue College. The diversity in class choice is incredible and every teacher I have encountered has been so helpful and passionate in their teaching. The ability to enroll in online classes is also extremely helpful in case of work or busy home-life. Bellevue College is also very accepting. It does not matter what your gender, sexual orientation, race, or religion people at Bellevue College will treat you with care and help you in almost any way possible. Going to Bellevue College helped me discover what I was truly passionate about, languages! Now I working towards admission into the University of Washington, from there I plan to major in Italian and Education."
Niche User,4,"The campus is really diverse, and there is a lot of good supportive professors that promote their educations."
Niche User,4,"Bellevue College has a welcoming environment and the teachers care about their students' success. The school community is also politically active. Walking around campus, it's not uncommon to see people discussing the causes they're passionate in."
Niche User,4,"I am currently a student in the Running Start program. I have enjoyed my experience on campus. I recommend taking classes on campus if you want to get plugged in, and don't be afraid to get to know people in your classes!"
Sophomore,4,"I took classes here since I haven't had really much money to go to university. I took some good and interesting classes like nutrition, philosophy, math. Some teachers were excellent but I did make sure to check them on ""rate my professor"". Always check and don't get stuck with a bad teacher. I heard some of the teachers were really bad, from my friends. Honestly, I don't think it's fair to expect too much from this kind of college. They give you what you signed up for but there's definitely a lack of social experience (many people are high school students doing running start or adults) although I did make some good international friends.It's almost smaller than my high school but so far I'm enjoying my experience."
Niche User,4,"I spent two years at Bellevue College through the Running Start program which allows you to take college classes in high school. I completed my AA degree there and was given so much help. All of my teachers were kind, helpful, but also pushed me to try my hardest."
Senior,4,Campus is open and clean. Dealing with tuition and registration is what you would expect. Instructors are knowledgeable.
Junior,4,"Bellevue college is accesible and affordable, but with the science course prerequisites it adds on a whole year of courses just to finish a two year degree."
Sophomore,4,"This college did a wonderful job so far of preparing me to transfer to a 4-year school. Lots of resources are provided for students, it is very clear that Bellevue College wants to see their students succeed in their future endeavors. I have met so many teachers that were very passionate about what they were teaching and got to expand my horizons a lot in the two years I attended here."
Alum,4,I really liked my experience in the music department! I had a great time and worked a lot. I also enjoyed taking foreign languages like French and Spanish. I only wish there was more student networking and resources for disabled students. The cafeteria left some to be desired.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed most of my professors, and the campus is very nice. I just do not like how we have paper textbooks that the school will not buy back in the end. The ""textbooks"" are very pricey."
Niche User,4,There are many options for classes including online and the professors are nice and approachable. I am in Running Start and love the program.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently on my second year as a Running Start student (Sophomore in college; senior in high school) and I'm planning on continuing as an official student next year, once I graduate high school. The reason for that is because I personally love the environment in this school and how safe it can feel. I do not have a big preference for large campuses and classes, so being here is great because there aren't a lot of students in a class (30 students or so) and it is not hard to get from class to class. Although, I have bias towards this college, one thing I would like to see change are spreading out more on printing stations."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed my time at the college. The classes are very good. I really felt like I gained knowledge.
Niche User,4,"Pretty good selection of classes, engaging teachers, and large campus. Would like to see more classes offered for running start students."
Freshman,4,"Bellevue College is a great place to continue your education. All the professors I've had so far has been extremely invested in their students learning. There isn't much to do on campus, but as a student who just wants the education it's perfect. The college is transitioning from a community college into a traditional 4-year college. Overall a great college and nothing beats the price of the tuition."
Sophomore,4,I am currently enrolled at BC and attaining an Associates Degree with the plan to transfer. The teachers and community are great and are prepared to help you in both the classroom and the world.
Niche User,4,Wonderful teachers very small and easy to reach all classes. The LGBTQ room does have some problems and isn't as inclusive as they say they are though.
Sophomore,4,Overall great school and a great way to start off the road to college at first I was not sure what I wanted to do or in what direction I should head in but there are many great teachers here that have helped me narrow down my search for a job and have also peaked my interest into different subjects
Junior,4,I had a hard time connecting with people but it was an amazing stepping stone in my higher education! I was lucky to learn and grow independently here.
Niche User,4,"Its a nice school. Nice looking campus, a lot of resources available, professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Theres a certain vibe here that you dont get in all the other schools, but its a good one so not to worry about. It does feel like lectures here are tougher than what ive gotten in other schools but overall, a good school."
Sophomore,4,I am an online student and have very much enjoyed my experience and learned a lot. This is my 3 quarter and I am excited they have expanded their programs.
Sophomore,4,"The Professors i encountered were mostly welcoming and encouraging. The campus and message was always open to people of different races, religions, and all backgrounds. Some of the teaching styles did not always reflect the course outcomes, but most of the professors went beyond that and strived to make the learning environment not only welcoming but one that i wanted to be a part of."
Sophomore,4,I think that Bellevue College is a good college overall. The classes are small and intimate so it's easier to meet and make connections with your professor if you ever need help or need a letter of recommendation. If you aren't doing too well with classes there are a lot of available resources like the Academic Success Center with walk-in tutoring sessions or you can even sign up for one on one sessions. It's easy to make friends and the classrooms are very diverse in age and race.
Freshman,4,The campus itself is very clean and classrooms are very clean. Some of the buildings have aesthetic interior. Usually the classes are slow when it comes to teaching. It isn't as social. They let you print 150 pages for free if you are a student and they have a nice library where you could study in a quiet environment. The bathrooms near classrooms tend to have small stalls. Staff are very willing to help especially when you first enroll and attend orientation. A lot of students are able to transfer to University of Washington which is a plus. I take Japanese and the teacher is very thorough with teaching.
Niche User,4,My brothers enjoyed this college and look forward to enrolling into this college. My brothers have always come back from school with a smile and knowing that they were in a place were people were valued and in a safe place.
Niche User,2,"Horrific! I seriously cannot believe that the administrative personnel are being paid to do these jobs!

I've been ping-ponged back and forth between various office departments for two and a half months now just trying to get a single damn form processed so that they don't make me pay THREE TIMES THE TUITION I OWE THEM!

Nobody seems to know what they're doing. The issue isn't even that the attention being paid to my issue is impersonal. I could care less if the staff want to be best friends or complete strangers. But if anyone could just ACTUALLY READ THE EMAILS I AM SENDING AND NOT COMPLETELY GLOSS OVER MY CONCERN LEAVING ME HELPLESS, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

Go to this school if you're dual-enrollment or if your endgame is a bigger school. If it's the best option for your wallet, then fine. But be damn careful not to let yourself get screwed over by  the lazy admin."
Freshman,2,"Not great. Students are alright. Dorms are pretty and new, but absolutely no social life and many can attest to that. I feel safe overall, but not somewhere I’d stay longer than a year if I had the choice."
Niche User,2,The classes are known for being easy and the students are very nice and there's a lot of choices. Very poor management and the school has put my tuition amount incorrectly twice (overcharging me) and caused me to drop from a class I payed for 5 months prior. First in person class had a horrendous teacher.
College Senior,2,"The teachers here at Bellevue College are mediocre at best. There's new teachers every quarter, all their ratings on ratemyprofessors.com are terrible. Almost all the classes I have taken there had some problem with it, primarily the teacher. Some doesn't update our grades, some always cancel class, some offer no help whatsoever outside of class, etc. The advisors there is actually really nice and helpful though."
College Senior,2,"It's pretty bad, with only the Bellevue fund which is extremely confusing to apply for."
College Junior,2,This was not my first time attending college because I took running start. But it was difficult trying to get help here because people were not really trying to answer my questions.
College Freshman,2,Compared to all the updates school are making now for students this really isn't that great.
College Junior,2,"The financial experience was very tedious. They asked for vague items, but after doing it the first time I got the hang of it for the following year"
Recent Alumnus,2,They are not very accommodating towards students efforts at extracurriculars. They do not appear to care very much about student life or faculty life.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly very frustrating, it takes forever for them to go over your application. After they do they take forever to ask you what else is needed."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much on campus
College Freshman,2,It is being upgraded right now. Slowly becoming better.
College Sophomore,2,"It's such an odd mix. You have a range of ages from high school students in the Running Start program to folks who have been in there careers or the job market for a long time before starting at BC. You make friends mostly through your extracurriculars, sometimes in your classes. Mostly though, people go to class and go home. Oftentimes, I went a whole day on campus without speaking, except in class discussions.

Cool thing though, there are TONS of international students, so the student body is very, very diverse. You can sit in the cafeteria and listen to conversations in five different languages."
College Sophomore,2,I could not receive a financial aid because my parents' income and have never received a scholarship yet.  The staff at the financial aid office didn't seem to care about me as much as other staff at the school. I am working on raising my GPA to get scholarships. 
Recent Alumnus,2,The school is mostly made up of Asian students who came to the United States for school. It's really hard to interact with them because most of them speak really poor English.
College Junior,2,There are very few Engineering related courses.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I learned a lot and was very motivated through my time here at BC, but there was one aspect of the classroom that I did not enjoy. Some students wanted to be there while others obviously did not. These students would hold back the rest of the class and the professors usually did nothing about it and slowed down the class for these individuals to catch up. I feel like I missed out on a lot of learning experiences this past year."
College Junior,2,i wish bellevue college had more than an associates degree in their science   programs. A bachelors degree program would be nice.
College Senior,2,"Everything have been great as far as getting the classes I want, however working with the admissions department it probably one of the biggest hassles of entire life. There are two people manning the desks for VERY short hours, who are bitter and don't give you the personalized experience you deserve. Expect to wait a minimum of 40 minutes on the phone, and 20 to 30 in line at the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have had a difficult time with a few of the instructors and workload at Bellevue College. I would say it is far more difficult than classes I've taken at a university and I found some of my instructors to be argumentative and defensive and not very helpful.
College Freshman,1,"I feel that the overall experience at Bellevue College was horrible. The city is amazing but the school is far from that. The student body is boring and I haven't met any student who is very outgoing, and the education is even worse. I haven't learned mush from Bellevue College and wouldn't recommend it to anyone that I knew."
College Freshman,1,I don't like the students on account of most of them are in high school.
College Freshman,1,The tuition is cheap yes but if you don't pay for classes asap you are slapped with a MAJOR FEE. Even if your internet goes down...
College Freshman,1,The career center here sets the students up for a dead end job.
College Freshman,1,It's horrible. They only offer majors in which do not apply to most people...
College Freshman,1,It's very hard to learn here because of the fact that you are just another number... not a student.
College Freshman,1,The campus is not only ugly but very dead in culture. The learning environment is horrible.
College Junior,1,I'm always trying to get help with financial aid and I end up at nothing. There is no help at all.
College Senior,1,"Since this is just a 2 year school, it doesn't really matter to employers. They look more at your 4-year school than your 2 year."
College Senior,1,There is no post-grad services. There are no services after you leave BC.
College Junior,1,OUR COMPUTER NETWORK IS TERRIBLE!
College Junior,1,"Some of the teachers don't know what their doing, and then its on me and my grade...."
College Senior,1,Transfering Sucks – Most of my credits from an oregon college are not accepted here. So what was the point of me going to school for a year and a half if all I have to show for it is 3 classes they will transfer
College Junior,1,"Internation Student – there is no benefit to international student
i got scholarship 400 dollor, but i paid 3200dollor per each quater for tuition"
College Sophomore,1,"Online Classes Have More Requirements Than on-Campus Classes – I have had numerous online classes as well as attending on-campus classes.  I have found that the class requirements are excess in workload for online classes compared to attending on-campus classes.  Some are very demanding in online discussion questions for peer-to-peer interaction, yet have the whole class answer the same question week by week and then reply to fellow classmates posted answers.  At least 90% of the time, the instructors are not responsive and take weeks to post grades for their weekly requirements and get very defensive when this becomes a topic in the online discussion board among the students.  I have yet to see a survey come out on the online class and instructor that they have students do for on-campus classes."
College Sophomore,1,"Admittance to Certain Health Care Programs Has Unconsistent Criteria – Unpublished criteria for admittance to certain health care programs and the admittance requirements change on a month-to-month basis. My previous degrees with general education requirements fulfilled were excepted while doing other prerequisites and now they want me to retake basic lower level classes delaying admittance into a program.  Also, having students retake critical preprequisite classes until they receive an 'A', an A- is not good enough.  Giving those that re-apply year after year for their programs priority."

Freshman,5,"Tacoma is an extremely diverse area, University of Washington takes pride in having students and faculty from so many different backgrounds."
Junior,5,"UWT has very supportive staff members who care for all their students. The professors are very energetic and love what they do. This makes the whole classroom experience a great environment to learn. I admire the diversity and constant focus on ensuring every student is safe, and having equal educational experiences. University of Washington Tacoma additionally, offers many diverse programs for every field!"
Junior,5,"Very efficient and straight forward. Canvas is very easy for students to navigate and obtain their online learning. Additionally, there are plenty of online resources available for all students."
Senior,5,"University of Washington-Tacoma Campus is great! There is a variety of awesome majors to choose from.  Many interesting clubs to join and in a diverse environment.  This campus has a YMCA free membership for Huskies, great Teaching Learning Center for tutoring; overall a great community."
Senior,5,Online professors are REALLY flexible.  They are willing to video chat and accommodate to your schedule as needed.
Senior,5,"My professors are extremely helpful and always there for me whenever I need help. I can feel that they sincerely want us to succeed. I am surrounded in an environment that values equality, talents, personalities, and strongly opposed to any form of intolerance, racism and violence."
Senior,5,"I did take some online classes. Even though we don't meet in person for the lectures, but i am still able to make in-person appointments with my professors. And they answer my emails very promptly."
Freshman,5,The campus is located in downtown Tacoma and is close to everything you would need. On Pac ave there are so many places to eat at. The campus  is big without feeling like it is overwhelming. The perfect balance between a small and large campus.
Alum,5,"I loved the small community and the class sizes. The campus was also beautiful and walkable. When I was a student, there were less amenities than there are now, which is a plus for all incoming and potential students to enjoy."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere of the campus! It is located right outside of the central city and is built around many little shops, perfect for exploring. I also really love the class sizes. They're not too small or too big and allows for you to get a hands-on education."
Niche User,5,University Of Washington is very diverse and makes the campus very comfortable to students. It creates many opportunities for students in their academic life and major. It has a very friendly and secured environment for students and has excellent diversity. You feel at home when you are here.
Junior,5,"Never have I seen such a place that celebrates diversity and minority representation more than UW. Out of all the schools that I have attended, this one made me feel the most welcome and appreciated."
Senior,5,"To be quiet honest, I was pleasantly surprised with my last 4 years at this campus. The school is super diverse compared to the other campuses and the class sizes are perfect. For the most part the campus and professors really do care about you and there is a better sense of community, especially once you get into your major."
Junior,5,While I attended the University of Washington Tacoma I enrolled in numerous business classes. I was interested and wanted to learn not only national Business but also International Business. I have communicated with my classmates and groups on a discussion about the general topic of business and international business. By seeing the statistics and numbers actually change I gradually got interested in International Business and became more convinced about how I felt about my goal more clearly. I have a strong passion for this Major. I would like to have the opportunity to learn a lot more in business and increase my knowledge with confidence and enthusiasm.
Freshman,5,"It's a lovely campus with really understanding professors. The people are kind, and the Tacoma Dome Station is a really great resource so you don't have to pay for parking."
Freshman,5,"The campus has a great and welcoming atmosphere for their students, staff, and faculty. If there is any issues an individual may be facing, there are several resources available and where they can express their needs. Everyone is welcome and facilitates great learning experiences for all individuals."
Alum,5,"It was a great place to go to school. Much smaller than the campus in Seattle, so the class sizes were a lot smaller, which made it easier to really get to know your classmates. I was in class with the same people pretty much through all of my classes junior and senior year."
Graduate Student,5,"I love UW Tacoma! The city is beautiful, the buildings have so much character! The professors are amazing and truly care about their students. One improvement I would make is regarding diversity. The majority of students and faculty are white. This is an issue because students need to see faculty and leaders that look like them. We cannot truly say we value diversity and equity if we aren't making the changes to our hiring policies that are so desperately needed."
Freshman,5,I love the professors and how much they care about the students' learning. I also love the food places on campus. Students of UWT are really friendly people!  There are so many resources on campus for students to use for when they need help with just about anything. If there is anything I would like to see change at UWT is making parking free for all students and staff.
Sophomore,5,"University of Washington Tacoma is a major step in the right direction. The classes are always a decent size and the content we study are always intellectually stimulating without being too complex for some students. Campus is incredibly beautiful and modern with more modern renovations to come. The people on campus are always friendly and inviting as well as the staff, they are always willing to help and are always here for the students. The quality of classes and degrees are nothing less than what you would have at the main campus of the university of Washington. The campus is sourounded by local businesses making a great environment for learning, studying, or just hanging out. The modern campus and the friendly environment make for a wonderful place for students and teachers to learn, live, and love."
Alum,5,"I transferred to UWT for my Sophomore year from WSU in 2013. I immediately fell in love with the campus and how urban it is. It is in teh middle of downtown Tacoma and the Link is in front of the campus, so you can park at the park-n-ride at the Tacoma dome. The professors are great and teh class sizes are small, so you can connect not only with the professors but the students in your class. Only drawback while I was in school was the parking. I would say that it looks like it has gotten a lot better and I know that they are still working on improving that."
Senior,5,The Univeristy of  Washington Tacoma is a great college to attend for those financially unable to attend a 4-year university. The univeristy provides an education that can be found at any 4-year university and the campus has a community college-like atmosphere.
Senior,5,I love the small class sizes compared to the Seattle campus. It gives you a chance to speak with the professor's and develop relationships.
Graduate Student,5,"After completing my first year in the MSW program here I can say that I am really enjoying UWT. The campus is convenient and aesthetically pleasing. The professors are passionate and knowledgeable and I am learning a lot. Overall, a very positive learning environment."
Junior,5,"I am going to transfer to university of tacoma in fall which made me really excited, because I have heard the diversity of UWT from others, and my friend graduated from UWT and got a job immediately."
Sophomore,5,It is located in the heart of Tacoma. Lots of the buildings are old city businesses that have been renovated into parts of the school. They do an amazing job incorporating the city life and culture into the student life. And the smaller campus allows for a more intimate feel and class sizes are incredibly small for a major university.
Junior,5,It is a beautiful campus in downtown Tacoma. On-campus housing is literally across the street from the university and located next to the Art History Museum and the Glass Museum. Campus is clean and well-kept.
Junior,5,"I like how it is a small campus with lots of other student commuters. The student to professor ratio is a fair number where it's easy to connect with the professor. In addition, I would like for there to be additional parking areas for students, so finding parking won't be a struggle."
Senior,5,"While UWT is not as large as its parent campus, it still offers a lot of opportunities. It is settled in downtown Tacoma, so there are plenty of shops and restaurants to explore. The Glass Art Museum, Tacoma Art Museum, and History Museum are all a short walk away. There is a YMCA on campus as well, with a student center located inside!
The location of Union Station also provides an excellent mean of public transportation instead of having to drive to campus every day. But because this is a commuter campus, if you want to do sports, you have to either do them at the YMCA on campus or go to the Seattle campus. 
The dormitories are a little small, but they house all the students they can. Due to the lesser amount of student housing, there is not much partying that happens on campus. I personally love this, for others, maybe not so much."
Sophomore,5,Who said we have to go to the main campus of a university to have the experience of a life time? I have never been so happy to be at UWT!!! I absolutely love it!! Its at its most diverse and the professors here are just terrific! Not to mention the Y connected to it. I would recommend everyone in the Washington area to come to this school you won't regret it one bit.
Junior,5,UWT is a great way to start your college experience! Staff and faculty are here to help students become successful. The classes at UWT are a lot smaller than most classes at a larger university which makes your learning experience. Student Engagement on campus plans several events throughout each quarter for incoming or current students to get to know each one another and to net work with those who have the same interests. They know and understand how hard it is to be a student so they organize events to De-stress during mid terms or finals. The university offers a variety of majors and minors the students can choose from as well as services like disability services ans veterans. This campus wants every student to have the best college experience so they also offer study abroad programs for student to travel to other countries and focus on a topic they are interested in learning.
Junior,5,"I enjoy this campus because the teachers are so king and full of energy! Also, you'll find that the campus is so clean and has a positive atmosphere. I really enjoy my time here because all the fellow students are really good at socializing."
Junior,5,"The University of Washington in Tacoma has great professors, and the classroom sizes are much smaller compared to the campus at UW Seattle. And it has great food and restaurants around it. It also has a great gymn and great activities and clubs to join. The thing that I would like to see change at UW Tacoma is to have more science majors such as biology or biochemistry available for students pursuing medicine or pharmacy."
Senior,5,The academics are great! Diversity is excellent! The location of campus is also great! Professors are excellent and are always there for extra help! As well as the tutoring center!
Junior,5,"Everyone at UW Tacoma is very nice and helpful towards getting you set up with the major of your choice! They treat you like a person rather than a number! I would like to have a better selection for parking, but other than that, everything here is great!"
Junior,5,I had a great experience. Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  The staff members are great and are very good at answering any questions you have.
Senior,5,"With UWT, you get a UW quality education with Community College size classes. It's the best of both worlds! The campus is located in downtown Tacoma. They remodeled old factory buildings, so you have a really cool urban/vintage feel walking around campus. There are lots of clubs and things to do on campus, but don't expect much around campus past 5 PM. You'll have to drive down Pacific Ave or 6th Ave for that."
Junior,5,"I really have enjoyed attending the University of Washington Tacoma campus. The urban atmosphere is exciting to be in, there are lots of places to hang out at and go to between classes, and it is just a comfortable place to be. The teachers and academics have been great. I am finishing prerequisites for Pharmacy School, so all tough science classes and UW Tacoma's new Biomedical Sciences program is perfect and they have introduced new classes that have made it an excellent choice for me. I would recommend to anyone attend this campus."
Freshman,5,"It's a different pace than it's sister schools, with smaller class sizes and a very strong concept of community. The local town surrounding it offers a lot to do, especiallly if your willingness to let oil, Andy the people are quite a pleasant experience."
Sophomore,5,"I like how the campus isn't so big so you see lots of familiar faces. The students are friendly and very welcoming. I like the environment and the many restaurant choices that are close by. They have a bus transit right in front of the school so you are free to go wherever without walking too far. I like the University Y center, students can take fitness classes, play sports, work out and it's right next to the student housing which is great!"
College Junior,5,"Professors are always so organized and helpful. They are not afraid to get personal with their students, since most classes are reasonably small. My professors have even offered to walk me to my car, incase I feel threatened unsafe after class."
College Junior,5,"Student services is always around and welcoming to every student. No matter how busy they may be, their doors are always open and ready to advise students seeking help. Internships are constantly available, as are jobs on campus. Student leaders remind students to always look for ways to get involved, to assure the best college experience."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe while on campus. The campus security has come a long way and has assured its best work is in use. There are emergency buttons found on nearly every corner and officers are a simple call away.
College Junior,5,"The few nights I have been here have been amazing. We get together for football games, game nights, and frequent ice cream socials. The resident assistants are always helpful and energetic while always on the job. I am looking forward to the friendships and memories I make along the way."
College Junior,5,"Student involvement is always encouraged! I love the faces of the student leaders as you show interest in joining their club or sport. They welcome everyone, no matter your strength in the sport, for that is what learning and growing is all about."
College Junior,5,My school is unique and outstanding from its diverse and outgoing student leaders. They work each day to assure the new students feel welcomed. Getting involved is also highly suggested by every faculty and student! Go dawgs!
College Sophomore,5,I love the class sizes because we get so much attention from the professors!
College Junior,5,"I have had a stellar experience with my classes, professors, and my overall time. I am excited to pursue my higher education here at UW Tacoma"
College Junior,5,"I feel like this is the best place to obtain my higher education. Since high school, I always knew that this was where I wanted to pursue my BSN and MS degree."
College Junior,5,"The Campus life at UW- Tacoma is such a welcoming environment. I remember my first day stepping on campus I had a feeling that I was ""at home."""
College Junior,5,Going to The University of Washington was my dream.
College Freshman,5,"I really love my school, professors are great!"
College Junior,5,"I love everything about UWT! our class sizes are small enough to be able to interact directly with the professor, but big enough to have many different opinions with each student. They offer many classes, but sometimes the classes overlap so you would have to pick one or the other. However, I'm sure that happens at many different schools. I love the professors, they're interesting and smart. They truly are interested in how the students are doing and will always check up on us if something goes awry."
College Junior,5,"UWT trained teachers are some of the most sought after teachers around! We all declare a specialty, ELL or SpEd. I've been told from students that have done the Masters program here that no student goes into spring quarter without a full time offer at a school! It's pretty exciting to know that I'll have a job guaranteed. If not, I know it will be easy to find one with the skills and reputation of UWT."
College Junior,5,"No matter what you're always safe on campus. If you don't feel safe, you can always call campus security and they will walk you or take you wherever you need to go. There is also the emergency posts all around campus just incase."
College Junior,5,"I love UWT! I love how every professor interacts with us separately, we're not a number in a 500 person lecture. I've formed meaningful relationships with many of my professors and I know that all of them would be willing to write me any kind of letter of recommendation based on knowing me personally and knowing my work personally. UWT does not use TA's, which I love! We get to have actual professors as well as lecturers who are trained in their fields and are so knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,5,"The University of Washington Tacoma is well know for their advancements in the technology field. You can say it is a 'computer science' focused University. This creates a technology friendly environment within the campus. It is right on the edge of downtown Tacoma, yet the University has still managed to create a friendly aroma of learning. Every time I walk on campus it influences me to read a book. This University has gone above and beyond the agenda of keeping incoming students involved many different areas of the school. Diverse is a perfect description of the curriculum and the people who attend the University."
College Junior,5,"the syllabus is clear, the instructors are great presenters; they are available if i need help. projects are submitted online."
College Sophomore,5,"This satellite University is perfect for me. It's not far from home, the classes are fantastically small, professors want to know you, and there are plenty of things to get involved into without being completely committed all the time to being on campus."
College Junior,5,"I love this school! Its got a good urban feel from being downtown, but its not to crowd, so it doesn't take forever to get from your car to your classrooms, and classes aren't very big. The advisors are great and the staff are very helpful."
Senior,4,it's a very diverse college. people are very friendly and easy to get along with. TLC is a good place for group meetings.
Senior,4,"it's ok, I prefer in person classes. But all my professors have been available remotely. They are still able to have office hours and tutoring sessions."
Senior,4,"University of Washington Tacoma has a diverse set of professors who dedicate their time to their students. By attending UW T, you are given the opportunity to work with a diverse set of individuals who encourage you to challenge your own thinking.  I would recommend attending UW T to anyone who is interested in expanding their horizons and challenging their prior knowledge and assumptions."
Junior,4,It's a campus where you can really get the required attention needed. There are clubs you can look forward to joining and fun events to go to. The only thing lacking would be more inclusiveness on on-campus life for students who don't live on campus.
Freshman,4,"Professors and faculty connect with students very quick and often, whether it's through email or Canvas."
Senior,4,"The classes I took online were better than most that I have taken in person. I felt that the remote learning allowed for me to take my academic career into my own hands in a way that I was not able to before. With this being said, some professors made it difficult to learn online by not being as organized as they could have been, but this is understandable since this change to fully remote was something that no one could have prepared for."
Junior,4,"Overall I’ve had a good experience on this campus. The biggest classes I’ve had are 40 people, which I prefer, and I’ve only run into one professor that I didn’t like. This is NOT a party school, for those who that matters to!! You’ll need to go to the main campus. Also, athletics aren’t really a thing on this campus. We obviously support the football team, but any support is minimal since we’re so far out and away from it all. But if you like a small school feel with lots of student involvement, then I highly recommend! Also, your degree looks the same as the Seattle campus one, but for a fraction of the price."
Freshman,4,"So far throughout my first three quarters at UWT, academia has gone pretty well. I love this school, the campus is very small and makes it a bit more personal than larger universities. I would highly recommend attending this school, however there are some drawbacks. I don't stay on campus and somehow $4000 in is calculated into my tuition for campus housing which doesn't make sense, and some of the professors seem to assign homework and assignments as though their class is the only one you're taking and as if you don't have a life outside of school which is a bit frustrating."
Junior,4,"The professors at the university are quite passionate about what they teach. This help create interest in the subjects while keeping my attention fully which made it fun. I also enjoy that many professors (at least for me) are understanding when it come to mental health or needing extra time to work on certain essay. There is plenty of useful resources provided as well on campus such as loaning laptops or certain equipment for projects. What I don't like is that there isn't many language courses provided or art themed classes on campus. Its frustrating to go for a passion major and not have the classes you need for the major you want, focusing more towards STEM than anything really. Though, still a nice campus for what it is."
Junior,4,"I just attended the first quarter of school, and I took four classes during the quarter. It was very great experience for me because I met awesome professors and learned a lot from them. They showed their caring to me when I had trouble going to class because of sickness and support when I needed. I appreciate them and UWT that I chose."
Junior,4,"A good university to attend in regards to academics. Supportive professors and a high amount of student help offered through outside resources such as tutoring and self study areas within the library. As for the city surrounding the school it can be difficult to manage finding ones way around town and parking is a hassle as well, however, the campus and the academics easily make up for this issue."
Junior,4,"As a current student at University of Washington Tacoma, I can say with confidence that I am pleased with my experience so far. The atmosphere is not as overwhelming as a larger college campus and one can still get the college experience that they hope for. However, parking is a continuous issue for many students who attend this university."
Freshman,4,"It is in the heart of a quickly growing city.  Tacoma has a very sad and rough past, but is hardy and the school shows that well.  The school is one of the most involved in its community that I have ever seen, and they have made a very significant change and investment in the community.  I cant wait to see it continue growing!"
Sophomore,4,"I really like this school and what it has to offer. There are really small class sizes, so it makes the transition from high school learning to college learning fairly easy. However, there is not much on campus housing which makes this campus primarily a commuter campus. With that, there is little to no parking for students. The school makes this a bit better by urging students to take public transportation with the U-Pass which is in your student ID- allowing you to take public transportation free in Washington state. 
You can also take the sound transit for free to UW Seattle for games (and you can participate in those sports) but it will take a while to get there."
Junior,4,"My experience with UWT has been enjoyable so far. I've met quite a few people who have gone above and beyond in giving me information about the different resources that are on campus. One of the biggest challenges for many students in college can be reaching out to their professors and receiving assistance. The benefit here at UWT is that with the small class sizes, most professors truly care that you succeed in their classes and are very responsive to meeting in person to help or through email."
Freshman,4,Would like to see a more consistent and efficient parking and car commuter program as most of the students and commuter students
Graduate Student,4,Small class sizes have made my experience very good with faculty and other students. It's easy to get help and there are good campus resources.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at UWT and as a college student. For the last 6 months I have pretty much enjoyed all of it. All of the professors I have had have been great, the diversity here is excellent, and there are so many ways to get involved. Student housing is really nice to live at since I am not from the area, and it gives easy access the everything around you. The campus is also pretty small I would say, which I personally love, because it takes about 5 ish minutes to get anywhere on campus. I do work on campus, and I love everyone I work with, and the people in the environment. I also always see campus security walking around which makes me feel safer being here. It is a bit challenging that there is no meal plan here, even though housing units have a full kitchen, grocery shopping can get expensive, and it's even more challenging if you do not have a car to get around. All in all, I do think it's a great school and I love watching it grow more and more everyday."
Junior,4,"University of Washington Tacoma is a great university for it's name. The campus is located in the heart of Tacoma city. The professors are always available for help. However, they need to improve summer class availability. overall, I highly recommend this school."
Junior,4,I havent started yet but I hear this college has a very high academic standard and curriculum. The buildings are located in beautiful downtown Tacoma. I am excited to begin this upcoming quarter.
Senior,4,I have had many great experiences at UWT. There are tons of on campus help for financial aid and counseling. I wish some of the program advisors were more helpful when trying to plan classes.
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my time at UWT, though I only spent one school year there to get a new experience. Definitely a high quality school that is not afraid to show you that they care about you and your education. They offer a very very wide range of resources for just about anything you could want to get into. A nice campus that isn't too big, but not too small. Very easy to navigate and I've met many friendly and kind people who also helped along the way, making friends was incredibly easy there and a great place to get a pretty well balanced and detailed education!"
Sophomore,4,"This is a nice campus, the class sizes are small but there isn't much involvement around campus since its a commuter campus."
Freshman,4,"The University of Washington Tacoma allows the perfect university experience and education while being close to home and in more student based classrooms. With class sizes at a 20-1 student, professor ratio, help is extremely easy to access and open classrooms make openly asked questions more frequent."
Senior,4,"This is a great school! Good location, downtown and close to the freeway, next to many coffee shops and food. Faculty cares about the students, classes are small and it gives proffesors the chance to really get to know the students. Very politically active!"
Junior,4,"The Biomedical Program at this University is new. In fact, I was in the first group when this major was made. The professors in this major are AMAZING!! I have learned so much from them and they are always there for me. While the classes are very difficult everything taught is worthwhile learning. That is in a sense where showing up to lecture always is worth it. That’s the professors though. Advising wise there is one adviser for the Biomed program currently and I would recommend not even wasting time to see her. Often using the program DARS and talking to professors and fellow students you can figure out class to take. She normally isn’t any help. Other than that the Y always has activity’s and the tutoring center is always available. I am overall super glad I choose to attend this school and would recommend it to anyone!"
Junior,4,I like attending this school. All of my teachers so far have had either a PhD or a doctorate and they are all passionate about and experts in their fields. I love the location of the school.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending university. I am a first generation student. From my perspective I did not believed my professors required too much from me. The campus is small, and the classroom size as well. For me this is perfect because I enjoy a small class size."
Senior,4,UWT allows students to get a quality education in small classroom sizes. The professors will get to know your name and you can meet with them one on one for office hours. Many professors also are flexible for students who can't make office hours. The student population is very diverse and many cultures and walks of life are represented in the student population. They also have all gender bathrooms (1 stall) and lactation rooms. The only complaint is the lack of parking. Most of the parking near campus is pay for parking or you need to pay for a permit.
Freshman,4,"I definitely like the sense of “home” feeling that it gives off, but I would definitely like to see more ways and opportunities in how to get connected throughout the school."
Sophomore,4,"It's a nice school with a beautiful campus. Mainly a commuter school with only those living on campus trying out the activities they provide. Next to no student life or activities worth your time. Academics are worth it though. Great professors and small class sizes. The largest class size is usually about 40 students and allows you to interact with the professor easily. Some professors offer office hours at their convenience, but are willing to reschedule with you to adapt to a time you could come in."
Freshman,4,"A small college with about 3,000 students. Very cozy location with many shops and museums for students to visit as well as the added convenience of an apartment building converted to a dorm right across the street from the campus. Buildings are all fixed-up factory warehouses, giving the area a really old-timey look. Administrative departments tend to have trouble talking to each other, but everybody you talk to is genuinely helpful. Very easy for freshman to get familiar with the campus. Signs make it really easy to navigate."
Senior,4,"The whole atmosphere of the community was amazing. Very diverse. Very well protected. A safe place to study. Everyone is friendly. Professors are helpful, understandable."
Freshman,4,"University of Washington - Tacoma, is a great place to build relationships with your professors. To understand one another, to share experiences, and to learn and receive tutoring on a personal level. The campus itself may not seem like a fun place to be. But if one is willing to be part of the community they will be able to create great experiences with their peers of which can be their professors."
Junior,4,"University of Washington Tacoma is a very small campus. However, the professors are all very interested in helping every single student.  They also work very hard at having activities for students.  This allows students to be a part of a bigger community within a small campus."
Junior,4,"University of Washington, Tacoma campus, it is a great facility with great resources. Classes are small, and you feel more comfortable asking questions during the class, or when having presentations.
The only reason I give 4 stars, is because it is hard to find parking, and to pay it is expensive."
College Freshman,4,The sports are on the main campus mostly but all University of Washington campuses have tons of school spirit. Go Dawgz!
College Freshman,4,I love the UW Tacoma canpus. Professors and other staff are super helpful. Everyone really encourages you to be the best you can be. They all want to see you succeed!
College Freshman,4,All the people that I know of are big fans of the sports play at this school and school spirit is very high.
College Freshman,4,"As with any type of school, if your the type of student that is open and friendly to other.  It will be the best four years of you life. So spend some time on interacting with a lot of people."
College Sophomore,4,The staff members really care about finding students opportunitis during and after college.
College Sophomore,4,"Sometimes I fear that my moped won't be there when I get back just because of Tacoma's reputation, but I feel safe other than that."
College Sophomore,4,My first year at UW Tacoma has been exciting and totally not what I expected college to be like. My professor's make it fun and interesting to learn. I get to explore so many topics with the degree I'm working towards and I know I can go to my professor's any time. The small classrooms and student-friendly campus is the best part.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe and secure to be a student at this campus.
College Junior,4,"While UWT does not exactly have a sports team, the morale is felt from the UW Seattle campus. It's fun to be apart of an organization with such high ranking in sports! Our YMCA is brand new and it's perfect for what I need it for."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are extremely helpful and friendly. You can't fail unless you didn't put effort into studying.
College Sophomore,4,"The University of Washington Tacoma just finished building a new YMCA for all students. Granted the fact that the membership fee adds on top of the tuition, It is still an amazing perk for each student as they are blessed the opportunity to utilize all the brand new programs and equipment. I've gone there almost everyday since it was built(1 year ago). Varsity sports aren't as big of a deal at UWT because all the teams perform at the UW Seattle campus. Intramurals are much more popular because UWT is so small the people love to have fun. The University of Washington Tacoma provides students with plenty of ways to maintain healthy physical habits. I love it here!"
College Junior,4,"Its a good school, suits my needs and i love it!!"
College Junior,4,"One of the greatest things about University of Washington Tacoma is the downtown urban vibe. It feels as if you are in a large city, but still has the neighborhood feel. The culturally diverse student body is what makes this campus unique."
College Freshman,4,It is nicely located near a lot of food places in Downtown Tacoma. Class sizes are small and the professors are nice. Curriculum is challenging so far and it is nice to learn.
College Sophomore,4,"So far my time at UWT has been pretty good. I enjoy the small class sizes, it allows for a lot of interaction with students and professors, making it easier to connect with others and ask for help when needed. I particularly like how the campus is small as well, I can get to classes fast and all buildings are just a small walking distance away. I like how the campus is in the middle of downtown Tacoma and close to a lot of food places, all within walking distance. However, the school is still developing and lacks in course offerings and majors. The majors isn't an issue for me, they offer the one I'll be pursing. But I'd like to see a larger range of course offerings for my major and more interesting electives."
College Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my experiences with school so far. Transitioning from community college was easy enough. The advisers are very helpful and available. Class sizes are small and it is easy to get involved in different things on campus. Also, the area is not as expensive as some other universities in the state, although parking can be a pain at times."
College Sophomore,4,"So far my experience has overall been great. It's quite hard to make friends, and the tuition really hurts to pay, but I have not had one bad professor. The campus is close to home and I can save money by living at home. The parking options aren't the best, but that's to be expected when being in an older city. The education and small classroom sizes more than make up for the small ""issues"" though. Not to mention the new student Y center is pretty nice."
College Senior,4,I have only been there a year but my school is very nice. The campus is close to home and in a convenient location. There are plenty of things to do around campus as well as plenty of places to study at around campus.
College Junior,4,Campus is beautiful. Location is great. advisers are nice.
College Sophomore,4,The school offers a variety of clubs and there's always something to do on campus. It is not that big but that allows for a feeling of community.
College Freshman,4,"Most places give you student discounts or a separate menu for students. You can eat at a different place everyday of the week and they will offer you a nice selection. Plenty of coffee shops that are great to just hang out with friends, meet new people, or cram for an upcoming exam."
College Freshman,4,The office that deals with financial aid is very helpful and will sit down with you to explain any questions you have. Financial Aid is an inherently difficult and annoying process they really try to help you break everything down and seem to have students' best interests at heart.
College Freshman,4,"I love it here because it gives you the chance to be very independent but with a lot of resources to tap into should you need help. The advising center is filled with friendly, well-informed people who do a wonderful job of guiding you through your college experience. The housing that you find through the school, however, is expensive and fairly strict with rules and curfews. But, you don't have to stay in campus housing and there are many places that offer great housing nearby, not through the school."
College Senior,4,"Mostly off campus dining is great and there are a ton of vegan and vegetarian options, however it's all expensive."
Senior,2,"My experience as a student in online classes has been slightly unpleasant. My professors haven't made themselves available on Zoom, so all of the lectures are pre-recorded. This is inconvenient for me as a student because I'm not having any face-to-face interactions."
Junior,2,My online learning experience with UWT was/is okay. I think colleges/universities should deduct their cost of tuition majorly because of the pandemic. UWT is charging students full tuition rates for resources on campus that we cannot even utilize. I am taking a chem class currently and they charged a huge lab/resource fee even though we are not physically there.
Junior,2,"The online transition was rough, and I’m definitely not okay with how it was handled. I had professors double our work load, while also giving zero room for understanding with those who couldn’t afford to get the texts necessary. The school also wouldn’t even refund us for the transit pass which is USELESS this quarter since all public transportation is free now. It’s only $45, but that’s $45 I could have put towards food after being laid off from work.
The school itself has done little to support the majority of its students, and only refunded our Y membership after being pressured with being sued. I’m grateful for the professors who are doing their best to help, but UW itself handled this ordeal horribly and ripped off many of us in the process."
Graduate Student,2,"This rating is for the UWT education program. 
I would NOT recommend this program if you are interested in wanting to be a teacher. This program provides lack of support for the students. The program overall is very unorganized and things are always switched up on us. No one is clear and everyone does things differently. 
We have supervisors that guide and support us through our student teaching journey, but all supervisors do different things. 
We are placed in Tacoma school districts and we are being told to stay longer than the required time for our student teaching. Some supervisors are requiring student teachers to student teach until autumn quarter (a whole extra unnecessary quarter). 
I would NOT recommend this unorganized and unsupportive program. 
This campus is also not as diverse as they claim to be."
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are outrageously small looking and way too expensive.
College Freshman,2,"Because it is a commuter school, there are no parties at UWT itself. None. But if you go a few miles up the road you can have a true college party experience at UPS. It's nice because you don't have to be apart of that scene if that's not your scene. If you feel like getting a broader experience you go to UPS and meet people and party if that's what you like to do."
College Junior,2,There are a few Restaurants around campus but they are expensive and take to long to get food in between classes. The only food offered by the school that I know of is a little snack shop.
College Freshman,2,The area is located near the projects so it is kind of a sketchy area. Parking is not all that great again due to it being near an urban setting and near busy streets.
College Student,2,Tacoma is a military town; not a college town.
College Student,2,It rains too much and that affects your mood.
College Student,2,I didn't see many options on campus.
College Junior,2,"If you are not 21 in Tacoma, you can't really do anything, and going to seattle is just as bad...unless you are on campus"
College Junior,2,There is nothing for students in downtown tacoma
College Freshman,2,It's hard to find a parking spot and also remain within guidelines of parking.
College Freshman,2,"UW Tacoma does not have dorms. There is one apartment building where the third floor only is for UWT students. The price for the apartments are terrible and not worth it. It is cheaper to get an apartment ""off-campus"" at a different apartment building, but the cost for other apartments are also very expensive. "
College Senior,2,There is no support for finding internships for my major. But one isn't required to graduate. In programs where internships are required I assume there would be more support.
College Sophomore,2,The Tacoma campus currently does not have any athletic team that represents the school. It would be awesome if the campus did have a team for football because there are many athletes who love it here in Tacoma and would rather be here. To add to that response some students who currently live in Tacoma could find it as a great convenience to be able to play a sport that of which they love. There is a fitness center but at the moment its capacity size is small and hard for some to work out because some equipments are not available or couldn't fit inside the facility.
College Junior,2,"You have to park a few blocks uphill for free parking. And if you pay for parking, the meter maids are quick to ticket you if you're even a few minutes late. It's a pain if you don't really have to time to walk to and from classes to your car because you have to be somewhere."
College Junior,2,"Not much in options.  Few healthy options, even fewer healthy and cheap options. Wish there were more options available."
College Sophomore,2,There is a very limited amount of places to eat around campus. I pack a lunch every day because there's not many affordable healthy choices. Walking far distances when you have a huge book bag/ backpack is not fun and there are some scary characters that walk around campus sometimes so I don't recommend walking far.
College Freshman,1,No Greek life on Tacoma campus
College Senior,1,"One security officer threatened to kick my four year old at the time out of the pre-school.  My husband parked illegally, but he should have dealt with him and not drag our daughter into it."
College Junior,1,"If you are near the university,be prepared to spend a lot of money on a small space"
College Freshman,1,"There is literally nothing to do here, we make our own fun. :-("
College Junior,1,There's not that much to do in downtown Tacoma. You have to drive up to 6th Ave to see any action.
College Sophomore,1,"Too Complicated – the registration process is absolutely horrible. there aren't enough classes, the registration process is really really outrageously complicated and frustrating and the staff takes forever to answer questions. i made countless phone calls to my department and e-mails and appearances to financial aid and my department and they never answered them in a timely manner. by the time i got my registration problem solved all the classes I needed were all full. it's ridiculous"

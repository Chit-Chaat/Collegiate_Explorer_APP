Junior,5,I actually transferred to this school this past Fall 2019. I was previously still in WV but at a JUCO (Junior College) for volleyball and so i decided to transfer and continue playing volleyball at the next level. Coming here everyone was very helpful and made my transition to a new school very easy. I love the small campus and class sizes and am glad to have made the choice to transfer here to not only finish out and get my bachelors but luckily still being able to finish out playing the sport that I love.

Freshman,4,I’ve met so many people from so many different ethnicities. I’ve also had some very wonderful teachers who truly wanted me to learn. I’ve had great courses and also a wonderful time in two of the athletic programs.
Sophomore,4,What I liked about Alderson Broaddus is that the teachers and the students there are awesome and very kind. The school isn't that big so it isn't much of a hassle trying to make it to class on time. What I like most about Alderson Broaddus is that people take so much pride in the school and the support that each sport gets is outstanding.
Freshman,4,"I have only spent one year at Alderson Broaddus.  I really like it here.  They classes are challenging but the professors care about your success.  The student body here is diverse and friendly.  Dorm life is good. And after talking to students at other colleges, the food is very good."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Alderson Broaddus University has been very good. I have taken several classes here throughout the three years that I have been enrolled here and have learned so much in all of them. The atmosphere is great, the teachers are very helpful, and the students are for the most part very friendly."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and faculty here! I really hope they do not lose the accreditation because it feels like home to me.
Alum,4,"Alderson Broaddus is a small school on the mountain top that makes you feel like you have the world at your hand. The school over all was a great school but I feel like the resources that were available especially in the science department, that's where the majority of my time was spent, need to be upgraded tremendously. The school is really trying to satisfy the needs of the incoming students and I appreciate that fact. I met some of my closest friends at AB and it will always hold a special place in my heart."
Senior,4,"Alderson Broaddus is a beautiful school located in the mountains.  The interaction  with students is typically a high level considering most students here are athletes, we all know one another or support sporting events. The professors understand that student athletes miss a lot of class so they work well with them one on one."
Niche User,4,My older brother went to ABU and it was lovely for him. The only problem that needs fixed is they need cameras outside in the parking lots because students tend to get beat up of mugged and its wrong.
College Sophomore,4,Many students are hired in the area right out of school.
College Sophomore,4,"The only complaint about my school is that it is so small only certain amount of classes are offered, but all the classes I need for my major are offered at the same time."
College Sophomore,4,Courses overall are great at AB. You can always go to a professor for extra help
College Sophomore,4,Health & safety is seriously taken into effect
College Sophomore,4,There is a different style for housing for every type of person on campus which is very important.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics on campus is a big part of what brings everyone together. It is very family oriented.
College Sophomore,4,Experience has been a once in a journey. Most professors teach the class effectively and the area of the school has beautiful scenery.
College Sophomore,4,"Good quality sports progams, soccer program stands out!"
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love the dorm I live in, and I'm very excited to be in the same dorms again. It is relatively easy to get the dorm you want, and overall students seem pleased with all the living spaces."

College Sophomore,4,I have not heard of any major security concerns.
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed most all my professors
College Sophomore,4,I ENJOY THE DORMITORY AND HOW THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR ROOM MATES IS DONE.  I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE BEST SUITEMATES EVER.  WE HELP ONE ANOTHER
College Sophomore,4,THE FOOTBALL TEAM IS A BIG PART OF THE DYNAMICS AT THIS SCHOOL.
College Sophomore,4,iTS A FAMILY FRIENDLY ORIENTED SCHOOL WITH CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES.
College Freshman,4,Health and safety on campus is great. Many issues and injuries are taken are of properly. Staff is very helpful.
College Freshman,4,"Many students here are focused on athletic training or nursing. For these degrees , many students work within the school itself and also the proximity to the Philippi Hospital."
College Freshman,4,"After transferring schools, I saw the difference Alderson Broaddus really had against it. It is a great school, filled with friendly and supporting staff and students. There is so much diversity, and alot of people open to socialize. In Alderson Broaddus, you are not alone."
College Freshman,4,Greeks among campus are extremely friendly. They always work for the community and host social gatherings for everyone to enjoy.
College Freshman,4,"Staff is extremely friendly, teachers love what they do here and their interest and passion for the subjects they teach is highly contagious."
College Student,4,I plan to play soccer there
College Freshman,4,There is an extremely low rate of crime on campus. Very little incidents occur other than a handful of theft incidents. I feel very safe even walking back to my apartment in the dark.
College Freshman,4,"The professors and faculty are very engaged with students at the school, even more so due to its small size."
College Freshman,4,I don't live on campus so my opinion is not exactly relevant here.
College Freshman,4,"Alderson Broaddus is very big on athletics, however, I cannot personally say much as I am not an athlete nor a fan."
College Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my time at this school so far immensely.
College Freshman,4,Living is great with many options
College Freshman,4,The greek life is small on campus but they do have events that are fun
College Freshman,4,The athletics here a great and the atmosphere is unimaginable. The school is small and doesn't have a lot to do but we find and make fun.
College Sophomore,4,"I love school; I enjoy everything that I experience here.  I have learned so much about not only my major but about how to live on my own and adapt to changes.  Coming to college was a rude awakening for me.  A lot of things were going on in my personal life before coming here and during my first semester.  However, the staff, friends and great people I have met here have carried me through the struggles and brought me out on top.  I work hard every day for my major and future and I am very satisfied that I got the opportunity to do that here."
College Sophomore,4,ABU is a great school. It is a small community. The professors are beyond helpful. You fall in love with the campus and school.
College Freshman,4,Most student are athletes and the stadium is really good condition.  Fan support is low and school spirit is low.
College Freshman,4,The Administration is usually lenient when it comes to certain things that are not effecting others in a negative way.
College Freshman,4,It was easy and the financial aid office is helpful.
College Freshman,4,The food is usually good.  Jazmines Cafe is excellent.
College Freshman,4,Newer housing buildings that are very clean.
College Sophomore,4,Our administration is one of the best. Follow the rules and regulations of campus without getting into mischief the administration will treat you with the utmost respect.
College Sophomore,4,"Housing is wonderful. There is something for everyone. Everything from apartment style to regular community style residence halls. Some buildings are older than others, but the campus is working to improve them all. Overall I love campus housing."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very diverse in regards to ethnicity, religion, economic background, political beliefs and sexual orientation."
College Junior,4,"There are a few computer labs, usually easy to get in to. The network speed is average and wifi is pretty good."
College Junior,4,I don't think there are any challenges.
College Junior,4,"I enjoy my program. The workload isn't too bad, sometimes there is a few tests scheduled on the same day which makes it a little difficult."
College Junior,4,"Getting into the program isn't bad. All you do is take classes they tell you to, then after you graduate from the college, you go onto certain hospitals for more schooling. That part is what is difficult to get in to."
College Freshman,4,its a small campus no need for transportation everything is in walking distance
College Freshman,4,Its rather cheap but there are a few places to chose from
College Freshman,4,"Havent heard of anyone not accepting those diversity challenges, they have a no discrimation policy"
College Freshman,4,campus security is helpful to new students.
College Freshman,4,The dorms I live it are like perfect distance away from everything. It does not take that long to get to any of the buildings. The people in the dorms are really nice and I have made some really close friends in my dorm. The cost was very convenient and affordable. The RAs helped make the transition easier and they are very helpful when any of us need help.
College Freshman,4,Scholarships offered through the school based on merit.  Also possible athletic scholarships.  Work study is a plus as well.  Nearly all students receive some type of financial aid.
College Freshman,4,Diverse majors offered and adequate study areas throughout the campus.  Also the ACES programs is available if you find yourself having problems in a particular class.  Very good health science and music classes.  Liberal arts school so you have the opportunity to have a well rounded education
College Freshman,4,Like the Criminal Justice classes thus far and the professors.  Solid curriculum and low ratio of students to professors makes it easier to get help when needed.  
College Freshman,4,Not a lot of peer pressure for drinking or drugs.  Many students travel home on weekends.  No alcohol allowed in the dorms or on the campus.  Safety is very good at this university.
Freshman,2,"I attended AB for a semester this past fall, but transferred out after the semester ended. Early on, I enjoyed my time. The campus community is close-knit and the small class sizes are really nice. However, there is NOTHING to do around campus. The majority of the students are only there to play sports, and it shows with the effort given in class. The sad part is, most of the professors are good at their jobs, but the students don't care enough. Much of the university is in disrepair. The dorms look decent once you get into the rooms, but they're falling apart on the outside, and the school doesn't make much of an effort to fix the problems. There's also no real security presence, which is great if you like to party at the same dorm every weekend, but not great if you want to get a decent night's sleep. AB is also overpriced for the value it offers. I now go to a community college and am taking the same classes for about 1/10th of the cost. Best decision I've ever made."
Junior,2,Education was very unorganized. Some teachers do not care. Facilities on campus not always available. Not enough parking. Not enough student activities available to students. On campus weight rooms not available enough. No cameras anywhere on campus. Students are disrespectful to campus. BGU is a great dorm. Other dorms are very old and need updated. Food is awful. Campus is located in the middle of nowhere. 40 minute drive to Walmart.
Alum,2,This college is pathetic and should be shut down. It is a waste of time and money. I transferred after my first year because both of my majors only had two professors on staff.
College Sophomore,2,The process for wanting to live off campus is a hassle. The requirements to live off campus are also pretty much unattainable unless you are a fifth year senior. With such a small town finding places to live off campus is also very difficult.
College Junior,2,"There is barely any parking for the amount of students we have. I am glad I do not have a car because I would be livid. People have to park on the other side of campus because there is no parking at there dorm lot. They get tickets for trying to park in places that are parking spaces. They say that we are lazy  and we need to walk. Freshman should NOT be allowed to have a car their freshman year to cut down on this problem, or just make more parking lots available."
College Freshman,2,The freshman housing is filthy and cramped. The nice dorms are very expensive and quite a distance away from the campus center.
College Freshman,2,"Many of the RA's don't care about what their students are up to, so it's very easy to get away with things that are against the rules."
College Sophomore,2,Not enough parking spaces for the students. school is increasing in size and spaces are being filled fast everyday
College Freshman,2,"Only a few restaurants locally but food is good in the local pubs, restaurants.  Few fast food restaurants in the small town.  Traveling about 30 minutes brings you to many other offerings however."
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any places to go off campus for night life. The places that are off campus do not let underage students in without appropriate I.D and card at the bar so even if underage students are there they cannot drink. 
College Sophomore,2,"There really aren't many rules on campus. It is a ""dry campus"" but the punishments for having alcohol on campus are minimal to nothing. There isn't a dress code, room check, curfew, lights out time, or quiet hour (except during finals). Pretty much they just care where you park and some teachers care that you come to class. I love the school, but they definitely aren't strict."
College Junior,2,"Although I do not live on campus, the college has many entertaining events that they plan. Comedy shows, bands, etc. I've been to a few of these, and none of them have left me disappointed, for the good part!

From hearing a lot of people talk, most of the entertainment in this area is going to Lil Moe's and getting wasted on a nightly basis. That particularly isn't my kind of thing, and if you aren't into the bar scene and don't go out of town much, you won't find much to do around Alderson-Broaddus at night."
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife is what students dislike about AB. It's a small, dry campus. So there isn't much going on. It issn't allowed, even if you're 21. Most students go to Morgantown when they want to go out. There are plenty of clubs and bars there."
College Junior,2,Most of the teachers are very respectful and caring about your college success and your college experince. There are a few though that like to play favorites. If you would have a problem it is more less that you must find a teacher who cares and is willing to help. I have enjoyed A-B but it was because of the friendships that you make up here. You will learn how to be a productive Athletic Trainer.
College Senior,2,"False Advertisement – At Alderson Broaddus, the resident life directors and dean of students says that they have many restrictions on getting an off-campus house but they never follow through with most of these restrictions. As of this year, they are encouraging students to move off-campus because they do not have enough room to house them on-campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,College Is All What You Make It – AB is a veryy small school with less than 1000 kids. They are doing a bunch of much needed remodeling and working on bringing more people in which is good. I liked the small class sizes because I felt like I got alot more out of it than I would have otherwise. The town of philippi is not very supportive of the school in general although the school brings alot of business there. But like I said school is all what you make it. I met a lot of great people there and had some of my best times and worst there.
College Sophomore,2,"For the freshman its a little harder to find parking or we have to park a longer distance away than anyone else. As for commutors they have to get on campus early because sometimes, after a weekend the freshman haven't moved there cars yet and there are no spaces to park. As for tickets the security might write them and put them on your cars but they don't turn them in so you rarely get caut."
College Sophomore,2,I have a fiance in a different dorm than I am in so when I go over to his room during the afternoon its okay to walk over but usually on the way back to my dorm it dark by then. There are girl who have been raped on campus and nothing was done about it. So I always walk fast and make sure that I am in the lighting that is available there. There isn't much and because of this I don't always feel safe walking from dorm to dorm.
Niche User,1,"This is coming from a fellow student at Alderson Broaddus University, coming to this school was one of the worst decision I've ever made. I came to this school to continue with my athletic career and not really looking at reviews. First the student life is comparable to living under a rock. Every dorm on campus having some damage to it with leaking, walls paper thin, mold growing. You can't live in a house of campus so experiencing the college experience is not a thing at this school. Current students say in person to each other and on the internet that going to AB is ""depression"" and that is the truest word to describe this college. I transferred out and went to a new school and sitting in a classroom for one week, I already knew that I was getting a way better education. The food is comparable to eating cardboard. This is the worst college in America, do not let yourself go to this school, son/ daughter or anyone thinking about going there. It's a JOKE"
College Sophomore,1,"Remote, far from civilization from the city. not enough places for food or shopping"
College Freshman,1,only there two days a week
College Junior,1,"The only transportation we have are vans, which are reserved dominantly for school events, Here-And-There Transit, and self-owned vehicles. It's a small campus, but it would be nice to have a small shuttle to go with it."
College Junior,1,"As of right now, there aren't really any options for living off campus, unless you want to live with your parents."
College Sophomore,1,There is really nothing to do on campus and there are no bars in philippi.
College Junior,1,"There is one bar in the whole town, because the town isnt very big. 18 year olds can get in and they have live entertainment but its mostly country based and sometimes karaoke. A lot more happens on campus than in town. All the parties that happen in town involve underage kids and no one wants to be a part of that."
College Sophomore,1,If you don't have a car of your own you either have to borrow or catch a ride with someone because there is no transportation downtown to Philippi at all.

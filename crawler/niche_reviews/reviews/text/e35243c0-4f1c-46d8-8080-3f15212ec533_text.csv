Niche User,5,Germanna is an easy way to start off as it allows high school students to partner with them to start integrating college into their lives.
Niche User,5,I did not take any online courses but I was duel enrollment through my highschool and I have learned a lot.
Freshman,5,I was truly concerned about learning online however Germanna and all of the instructors/professors have made the transition a breeze.
Freshman,5,"So far my journey has been pretty smooth. Due to my registering very soon before the beginning of the semester, I have had a few minor issues. The few hiccups in the road are almost not worth mentioning and nothing the staff and instructors have not been helpful in resolving."
Junior,5,"I took a couple of classes online and it was harder than in person, but the professors are willing to help you out."
Freshman,5,"Germanna is a great place to start a college journey, with a lot of great, easy options for assistance in both learning, finances, counselling, and other needs. If anything is difficult to understand, it's easy to find help and explanations. The professors have all been very encouraging to me, even after or between courses, if I pass them in the hallway or shoot them an email. The one thing I found strange is the immense pressure to transfer to a four year university, when Germanna offers so many excellent two-year degrees... and I find the website difficult to navigate."
Alum,5,Germanna is a great school to get students either started with college life or get them the education they need for a job. It helped me get used to the typical college workload and boosted my confidence that I could continue to a four-year college. It is a place to open your mind to possibilities whether career-wise or just new knowledge. Many of the professors want students to share their opinions and speak up in class. They are helpful and there are fun classes and clubs to take while attending.
Alum,5,My professors were generally pretty good about switching to online classes when everything happened.
Sophomore,5,"I took 3 classes online and all my teachers were easily accessible, made the wotk clear and understandable, and everyone got along."
Sophomore,5,We experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and the college made sure everything was still accessible while ot physically being able to enter the school.
Sophomore,5,"I really love how quiet the library is in Germanna. I am not very satisfy with the class diversity. Sometimes, they don't have the class as they show on the list."
Freshman,5,"The internet is an amazing thing to have in the 21st century. We can now learn in the comfort of our homes. We get to see a different perspective of our professors, and they still work their hardest to see us succeed."
Freshman,5,"It is extremely easy to figure out what to do to get started. The advisors are also amazing and super helpful. You don't have to worry about the feeling of being new because they help you feel at home. They have such wide options of things to choose from, so you don't ever feel closed into one particular box."
Graduate Student,5,Germanna Community College was the best educational experience I've had! The teachers are very understanding and open-minded and the tutoring center was always ready to help with whatever classes you're struggling with. The campus has awesome diversity.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing college to first start out at! Because of the help and success starting out at Germanna, I'm now able to complete my dream degree when I transfer this fall to Oregon State.

This school has a over a 95% passing rate of their nursing program and will help you with every obstacle. The classes are comfortable and very good amount of students so you can obtain the information. The counselors also are helpful and work hard to put you in the direction you need to go to attain your goals. I am about to take my BIO-141 Anatomy and Physiology and I’m sure the class will be tense but also give me a lot of information on how our bodies functions and the different parts of our body. Germanna has expanded over the years and improved on technology. The school is safe and even have a library where you get study and print off your paper work. Also have enough computers to write your paper and search internet for homework. This school has all the resources for you to get good grades and work towards your degree.

Also Germanna professor are the best because they genuinely really want you to be the best person you can be.

Freshman,5,The staff is very helpful at all locations and the professors are professional and willing to work with you.
Sophomore,5,"The advisors and counselors have been amazing, especially through the Nursing Program.  They're always open to help you achieve what you're going for.  Also, they are on top of making their office hours known or any changes.  I've loved attending Germanna.  They offer online, in class, and hybrid classes and it's been an amazing experience."
Sophomore,5,Germanna Community College was the perfect place for me to start my college experience. I was able to transition back into academic studies quickly and successfully after a GAP year. The Finance office was very helpful with the difficulties I had with m FAFSA application. I love the Work Study Program and really enjoyed working in the Counseling Office. My professors were varied and provided me with an appreciation of what lies ahead in the professional world.
Graduate Student,5,"The scheduling is great! You can schedule your classes around your work life without having to worry about calling out sick or missing a class. The assignments are challenging, but not to the point of causing anxiety. The professors there are willing to help you with any questions that you may have about any subject. Diversity is very prominent as well there. Tuition prices are not horrible either and the transfer process (to a 4 year univ.) is smooth. Personally, I wouldn't change anything about my experience at Germanna."
Senior,5,"I enjoyed my experience at Germanna community college. All professors, advisors and transfer counselors are amazing and always there to help with school problems and personal problems as well. There are always opportunities for internships in every major students take. The college is diverse with many friendly people always looking to help others."
Junior,5,"Professors, Advisors, and staff do everything in their power to make sure all students are successful and understand what is being done to get to their career paths. If there is any confusion on anything, after talking to the staff, they will make sure that you understand the process to do what is best for you."
Sophomore,5,"As far as community college goes, it really is not bad. They try to provide a plethora of resources to the students both for academics and personal life. Always hosting events and activities, very inviting."
Sophomore,5,The staff at Germanna Community College are great people that are very dedicated to seeing every student who walks in walk out a successful individual. They really are a group of heroes that don't wear capes and may not be receive as much recognition as they deserve.
Freshman,5,"I have nothing but great things to say about this college, they are very helpful answer all your questions and make the website user friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I love that there is multiple campuses from each other. The bad thing about that is that, the one that is closest to me, only has like freshman year classes. So instead of driving 20 minutes to get there, I must drive over an hour."
Junior,5,Germanna is a wonderful school it has one of the best Nursing programs in the area. I am very honored to have been accepted into the nurising program at such a great school. The professors are amazing and the campuses are very nice and easy to navigate and there is always someone there to help you if you have any questions.
Freshman,5,"What I love about Germanna is they are always so helpful and kind, the staff always make everything as easy as possible."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school and much more than I expected from a community college. The classes and professors are great, and the campus is really nice."
Alum,5,I really liked how flexible GCC was. Not only that but it was a great and friendly environment overall. All of my professors were more than happy to help me and my fellow classmates. They enjoyed their jobs and it truly showed!
Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I was not excited about going to Germanna at first when I saw everybody else going off to universities, but I have saved so much money and I have had some great professors. Additionally, Germanna gave me the opportunity to get work experience while in school, which helped me narrow down what I want my career to be. The campus is nice, most of the professors are very organized and helpful, and the career and transfer center is amazing. I do not regret going to Germanna instead of a university after high school."
Sophomore,5,This school is amazing if you want to save money! The professors are great and really help you when you need it. I was skeptical at first coming here but I wouldn't ask for anything else. The staff and professors really help you into a 4 year school.
Sophomore,5,"Germanna Community College is a wonderful college that provides its students with a variety of opportunities to expand their career as well as provide support for completing classes, such as tutoring."
Junior,5,great university. The people that have worked with me have been so helpful. They seem like they want to help you. This is a huge deal for me as it has not been the easiest road for my schooling.
Freshman,5,I am currently full time HS senior at Germanna dual enrollment. I will be a freshman in Fall 2018. I am working on my associates in general studies and then transferring to Liberty University. I want to be a victim advocate for the FBI.
Sophomore,5,Professors engage very well with the students. There are many ways to get help with anything you are struggling with.
Freshman,5,Germanna community college in Fredericksburg Virginia is really great I have had very good experiences here
Sophomore,5,"Being at Germanna Community College is a great experience. It's local not too far from my house, and I have the opportunity to progress my academics. The Professor's are very helpful, and understanding. With the class sizes being so limit, I feel as if I can concentrate a lot better, also another plus is that you'll have the chance to receive that one-on-one time with the professor if it's needed for extra help. Definitely having a great experience learning!  "
College Junior,5,When I became disabled the professors were wonderful.  I have had a wonderful experience at Germanna.
College Junior,5,The school provides a lot of information and colleges and employers come to our school to recruit the students.
College Junior,5,All of my credits c or better will transfer to a four year college.  There is always some school or employer coming to our school so when you graduate you will have opportunities.
College Junior,5,"My major has just been switched last semester from Children Development to General Studies.  I like that major because it leaves me to choose when I get my bachelors.  I have a small work load due to my disability,  You are reading about a miracle .  In June 2015 I had a stroke and in August 2015 I had open heart surgery.  Because of the programs that Germanna has I am able to attend."
College Junior,5,"I would choose this school again,  why because it is a small college with teachers who really care about my sucess.  I am disabled student and they provide counseling and writing to help me .  The really are interested in you and you don't get that from many colleges that I have experienced."
College Senior,5,It's was not my first choice to go to a community college. but it was the best choice for me and I saved a lot of money with the decision I made.
College Junior,5,The faculty informs us of of all the post-grad and bachelors degree programs that accept Germanna graduates through the Guaranteed Acceptance Program
College Sophomore,5,"Wonderful, if i could afford more than one class at a time I'd be full time!"
College Sophomore,5,Professors are awesome and down to earth.
College Sophomore,5,A nursing degree opens the door to alot of area jobs.
College Sophomore,5,Absolutely love the online course!
College Sophomore,5,"A vast amount of people come to this school, including working adults."
College Sophomore,5,"im currently doing my pre reqs towards nursing. I am an emt , so im luck the facility works well with my life."
College Sophomore,5,All aspects of thIs school are wonderful!
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome college, very nice online programs and easy to attend as a working adult."
College Sophomore,5,They gave me tips and showed me the procedures for the financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,The career center has helped me plan my future for education.
Freshman,4,"Overall for a community college, it's pretty much the best of the best if you're looking for something affordable and provides a good education."
Sophomore,4,"It is a nice school, the campus is not a fancy as some Universities, but the teachers are kind and know what they are teaching . They also are really great about helping you transfer to four- year university when the time comes."
Junior,4,Really good school. Everyone treats each other fairly. Professors always find the time to help the students after or before class.
Freshman,4,"I was unexpectedly forced into online education with the onset of the Covid quarantine, but despite how underprepared everyone was, the transition was relatively smooth. The online lectures could be comparable to an in-person experience, as long as the professor was attentive to questions and encouraged interaction. This comes from someone who is generally uncomfortable figuring out unfamiliar applications and web pages."
Sophomore,4,"Based on my experience, I find Germanna's online classes to be pretty good. It all depends on the professor to be honest. One professor could have the you attend scheduled Zoom meetings, while another could simply upload prerecorded lessons for students to learn on their own pace.

While I personally prefer a scheduled Zoom meeting curriculum, I know that many others prefer a more self-taught approach. Whichever teaching style your professor takes, just know that they, along with other Germanna faculty, are always there to help you adapt  to online learning."
Sophomore,4,"Germanna Community College is a very welcoming community that has a modern, yet laid-back feel to it. All of Germanna's staff and faculty do their best to help you in any way they can. Their dedication to assuring the success of the college's students is what makes Germanna  great."
Alum,4,Staff were always super helpful even when I was stressed/doing things at the last minute. Helped me understand the college process when I knew nothing about it.
Sophomore,4,"I'm not an online study person because I love to connect with my professor and friends in the class which helps me learn faster. However, online classes are fine because it is fully equipped the material for the courses."
Graduate Student,4,"Easy acceptance and welcoming student body and faculty, plenty of clubs and organizations available while still being a two-year college, affordable, and a great insight into what college classes are like"
Sophomore,4,GCC is a great investment and has awesome teachers in the more specialized programs like nursing and engineering. I would love too see the same quality of faculty in the Gen Ed. classes
Sophomore,4,"Every college has its ups and downs, but overall Germanna is a great place to start your college career!"
Sophomore,4,"Germanna is overall a very good community college. There's  plenty of different majors to choose from, the tutoring center and their various services are very helpful, and there's a lot of good professors on Campus. However, there's not that many clubs on Campus. There's not too much that happens on Campus except maybe at the Fredericksburg Campus at times.  They have a good nursing program. Overall, a good community college, great for people who are working, etc."
Freshman,4,"Germanna is a excellent community college and it saves you a lot of money compared to attending a four year college/university. Also, they have great employees to help you with directions, books, and counseling. Furthermore, Germanna has excellent tutoring to help anyone with their classes and it is good for if you need help with essays or just a particular subject. Also, Germanna has a great testing center because they make sure that nobody is cheating on their tests and they have mini lockers to keep your stuff safe. Another great thing that Germanna does is that they have services for orphans and disabled people. Also, they have a food and clothing drives for people who can't afford clothes and food."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely loved that the classes were smaller and you always had a great connection with the professors. For the most part they were all very helpful and knew their class well.
Freshman,4,So far it’s been really great! The staff have been very helpful and friendly! They’ve been very good at communicating with me about what I need.
Freshman,4,Everyone is very willing to help when issues arise - especially when registering for and dropping classes.
Sophomore,4,"They have good nursing program and other program for all kind of majors. It's a good place for those who need to save up money by going to a community college and than transfer later to a 4-year college. There are nice professors and classmates, and they also have great tutoring service for all subjects, for free."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the size of the campus as it is not overwhealming and it’s not too crowded. I feel that it’s a great stepping stone to getting ready for the university life. I simply would just update a couple things or adjust the process certain things are ran.
Freshman,4,"An overall great experience, teachers are great and classes are small, most professors are about helping you fulfill your degree and dream."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my experience here. All of the campus' have the nicest staff, friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have. The teachers were available, knowledgeable, and passionate about the subjects they were teaching."
Sophomore,4,I really loved all of my professors and how involved they were. They were extremely helpful with everything and cared for their students. The financial aid was extremely difficult to deal with as they were not very good at informing people about issues and did not always seem to know what they were talking about. Many people have complained about the financial aid as well.
Freshman,4,"As a two-year community college, Germanna really prepares you for your future. It is my second semester at Germanna and I've loved every second of it. The teachers I've had are amazing and I really feel I learn a lot."
Junior,4,"Germanna Community College has been a great place to start my degree. I was able to balance school, work, and my personal life by taking classes that fit my schedule. Online classes were also an option and the help was there if I needed it in person."
Freshman,4,I would recommend Germanna Community College for any student who is undecided or seeking to transfer to a university for an undergraduate degree. The instructors at Germanna are awesome and really care about the students. The tuition is an affordable alternative to a university for the same courses. Germanna's counselors offer assistance to ensure the classes taken transfer to your school of choice.
Junior,4,I really like Germanna a lot. Everyone is nice and helpful. The school is very diverse. They have an amazing nursing program. They also have 3 campuses.
Sophomore,4,"Germanna is a great place to start to further your education while saving money. My only complaint is the inconsistency with pleasant staff, sometimes I would leave the school beyond impressed by how professional some members could be and other times I felt uncomfortable with how rude some staff members are. However, the good do really outweigh the bad from my experience."
Senior,4,"As far as community colleges go, Germanna has to be one of the best. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and for students that didn't get a whole lot of college prep in high school they are a fantastic intermediate step, always being there for any sort of questions you have."
Sophomore,4,"I love Germanna, there are some pretty great professors. The faculty are very knowledgeable and helpful if they don’t have an answer to your question they will find an answer."
Sophomore,4,"The professors here are generally very concerned about their students future and where their class we lead them after it is done. The staff is friendly and I have always had a positive experience with counseling, financial aid, and the school store. I will miss this place when I transfer."
Freshman,4,I believe the school is a solid option when deciding where to head next. They offer a broad array of topics for study.
Freshman,4,"I like the availability and flexibility from the faculty and staff, all my teachers were very responsive to any emails and I sent and replied promptly too. If anything would need change, I would say the Guidance Office and Financial Aid, as I had not so good experience when speaking with them. I either felt rushed to make a decision or stupid if I did not know the process they had to work with. Otherwise, my actual education and learning experience was quite good."
Freshman,4,"Germanna staff is excellent and the campus is clean and aesthetically pleasing.  The online portal can be intimidating at first, but once you  get used to it, it becomes second nature."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Germanna is a good community college. I have only had a few poor professors. It has served well as a sort of checkpoint before university. As a community college there is no housing offered; however, many people will post ads for roommates. The counselors are very helpful with anything that is needed for transferring. One thing I wish was available is athletic programs. I enjoy participating in sports in my free time; although, there are no organized teams at the community college."
Sophomore,4,"My first year in Germanna wasn’t what I expected. I did not do too well but it was from my own mistakes of not taking my first semester seriously (I was too focused of trying to be a good employee rather than a good student). Never the less, the enrollment process through germanna is fairly simple. My only concern is that the next semester enrollment starts way too early and it makes the deadline for the payment for that next semester even before the current semester has finished. I also had problems with my financial aid being processed on time despite filling my application several months before the start of the semester. But some teachers make the classes really manageable so there isn’t too much stress on their students."
Freshman,4,I enjoy Germanna and I look forward to all my classes that I am enrolled in. Professors generally want the best for you and provide lots of materials to study to become an expert on that subject. One thing i would like to see change is just to have scheduling done easier but that is always a struggle wherever you go. Over all a great place to get started on college especially if you are paying it yourself.
Freshman,4,"Germanna has great professors and friendly, helpful staff. I'm especially pleased with my success coach and my faculty advisor. They have both given me wonderful advice during the time I have been at Germanna! Most of the professors teach in an engaging manner and encourage their students to think critically and to learn as much as they can. One thing I would like to see improve at Germanna is the college social life. The students are friendly, but there are not many social events on campus. Clubs are almost non-existent. Nevertheless, I continue to enjoy my time at Germanna!"
Sophomore,4,"This college is a great school to go to right after high school, especially if you are not ready to attend a four-year university. The professors and students are incredible individuals and they heavily contribute to the great environment offered at this school. The Fredericksburg Area Campus is much bigger than the Locust Grove Campus, but either way Germanna Community College is very accepting and the people there do their very best to help you achieve your goals."
Sophomore,4,Everyone is very considerate and kind. I've always felt very safe on campus even at night whereas other colleges such as NOVA have a higher crime rate.
College Junior,4,Other students are easy going and easy to get along with.  Teachers care about the students and want students to do well
College Student,4,"I think Germanna is a great college, easy way to save money for future schooling and it's closer to home."
College Junior,4,"Great staff, but lacking in other areas. Difficult to navigate the enrolling process, because I live in Stafford, and it does not say anywhere what i need to bring with me (SAT transcripts, etc.). A million trips."
College Junior,4,"I have had a minimal experience so far with Germanna, however, the experience I have had was been wonderful."
College Junior,4,"My experience about online classes has taught me the importance of time management.  Don't be a procastinator.  If you need help reach out to the tutors, they are willing to help you.  One other thing I learned don't take more classes than you can handle."
College Junior,4,"Overall my professors have been great,  the quality of courses were wonderful and the classes that I did attend class on campus.  The professors were  very structured and knowledgeable."
College Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my teachers and classes, plus tuition didn't go up this year! The Locust Grove campus is beautiful. I am proud to be a GCC Bears!"
College Senior,4,There is a large range of classes.
College Senior,4,"There are constant job and career fairs, which are nice."
College Senior,4,The teachers will try to work with the students as much as possible.
College Senior,4,Germanna is a great school.
College Junior,4,"There are many different class times for you to choose from. As long as you do not wait until last minute to schedule your classes, there is a good chance you will get what you what."
College Junior,4,I haven't encountered any problems with my professors.
College Junior,4,"The work load is appropriate for a pre health major. There are internships, you just have to look for them."
College Junior,4,"I like Germanna because it gives me lots of options. Germanna has given me the time to figure out what I really want to study, at a fraction of the cost."
College Junior,4,It's pretty good so far.
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed it so far.
College Senior,4,Many courses available online and in person
College Senior,4,Many opportunities available thanks to the career center
College Senior,4,Short and regular sessions available.
College Senior,4,"All of my credits transferred from another community college after I moved, so there was no frustrations when transferring."
College Senior,4,"I love online courses, because you're able to do the work at any time, as long as it's by the due date. The workload is usually wonderful, and the professors are very helpful, and are usually quick to reply."
College Junior,2,"Germanna does not offer my major, or any majors relating to my field of of study. I am stuck with general ed. until i transfer to a 4 year for Anthropology"
College Sophomore,2,Our student body does not have a lot of involvement.
College Sophomore,2,"Definitely my least favorite part. The application process was quick, but I'm not sure if you don't know what you are doing that the aid office would be much help. This is simply because they seem understaffed, and never pick up the phone. Additionally, I dislike how long it takes for the school to refund your money. I am gauging this by a previous experience, and it is slow. I have also noticed that even though the loan distributor has paid them my loan money, they sit on it and wait to disperse. Kind of unsettling considering many students rely on that money to eat and pay bills. Aid should be first priority. It doesn't take 2-3 weeks to transfer money to a bank account. You reconcile the account and pass it onto the HOD and accountant to make the bulk 24 hour electronic transfer."
College Sophomore,2,"I am disappointed that Germanna does not have an Accounting program. The current program I am in, Business Admin, is too general and doesn't provide enough specialization for added job opportunities. So far, so easy honestly. I'm also not sure why a science with a lab is included in a Business Administration degree."
College Junior,2,I barely received any financial aid.
College Junior,2,"Some professors are terrible some are okay. I have never met a professor that made me think, ""you really care about your students"". Everyone who works in counselling, financial aid, and the welcome center  are always for looking for ways on how they cannot help you. Let’s face the facts, in today's workforce you need a Bachelor’s degree to be successful. This college is only useful for acquiring general education credits cheaply, then transferring."
College Junior,2,"Let's face the facts, in today's workforce you need a Bachelor's degree to be successful. This college is only useful for acquiring general education credits cheaply, then transferring."
College Junior,2,"I pay a ""parking lot maintenance fee"" for online classes."
College Junior,2,"I believe Germanna is best known for their nursing program. This program is quite a scam however. Except for the Veteran's Affairs Hospital, all hospitals in the area require Associate's degree RN's to complete their Bachelor's. I could have saved precious time by completing my general education requirements at Germanna, then transferring to a 4-year college with a nursing program."
College Senior,2,It takes them forever to get back to you with important information.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Go somewhere else if you can avoid coming here. The customer service is bad, and there are so many stupid people that work here. At least some of the professors can do their job, but if you're looking for the ""college experience"" then you may want to point yourself in a different direction."
Recent Alumnus,2,You want to make life long friends? Go on a dating site. No one cares here.  Everyone either already has a family or is waiting to transfer to a four year school.  Student activities is a joke
College Junior,2,"There arent any facilities on campus for sports or anything. All of them consist with some kind of study whether its just classrooms or the library. One of the things I like though, we have a nice size court yard area almost where they like to play movies and really try to motivate the students to interact with one another."
College Senior,2,"Library Is Nice – It is in the middle of no where, I wish they could build a campus closer to me"
College Junior,2,"Needs Improvement – Germanna does not offer many activities, there is a library and a tutoring center for students, which is very helpful. However, it would be wonderful to see more activities and athletics for the student body."
College Junior,2,"Expanding, but at a Slow Rate – Germanna is expanding, but not fast enough. In the Spring of 2008, Germanna facilities were very sufficient, considering the number of enrolled students, however the number of enrolled students is increasing vastly, including a  10% increase in enrollement in one semester. Many students are not recieving the academic guidance and standards they are paying for because the college can not keep up (space and faculty wise) with increasing student body."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Staffs Interest in Prompt Action – The financial aid staff is not interested in your excuses or validated reasons of why something is not going in the correct way. You need to do most of the work yourself, or else the staff will have you jumping through so many hoops you will get dizzy and just quit the process and maybe even your entire plans of receiving and education. DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN! Insist on help; keep going to the financial aid office so they realize this is your life, your education on the line. Get your academic advisor involved (they are wonderful and have your best interest in mind)."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unhappy Camper – Germanna has every potential to be a better resource. Understandably, some of the teachers have this as simply their second jobs, and do not really ""care"" about the students. However, this really reflects on the ability to accomplish education. Also, the support staff is rude and not very helpful, they rarely return calls. Although I have been attending Germanna for a long time, I am only continuing my education there because it is the easiest solution for me at this time."
College Sophomore,2,"Review of College – The campus is nice. The counselors and teachers aren't as helpful as they could be, some are very rude and could care less."
College Senior,2,"The online course consisted of discussion boards that often times drifted painfully off topic. However, I do not believe that this is a reflection on Germanna Community College's academic standing. I think that this is a reflection on the teacher."
College Student,1,"I wouldn't do online classes, a poor way of learning due to basically teaching yourself rather than having an instructor help."
College Sophomore,1,My experience with financial aid was terrible. No one seemed like they could help me. Everyone seemed busy and acted as if they didn't care. It wasn't their problem so they didn't have to worry about it.
College Senior,1,"Germanna has very limited classes, even if you know what you want to take you better hope they are offering it that semester during a time you can make."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Thinking nursing? Look away!! The nursing program offered at Germanna is deplorable! The schedules are constantly changing, nobody teaching the courses are on the same page, the majority of the instructors don't pull their own weight and rely on the few good instructors to carry them, they have accepted far too many students for them to handle (and they continue to accept more and more each semester), the tests are impossible to pass unless you are an excellent test taker, and the coursework is not reflective of the degree earned. On top of all that, after you graduate, expect to wait at least a month before the school sends your transcripts to the State Board to be reviewed and expect to wait at least two months before you can even sit for your board exam. I graduated from this program with honors after working my tail off, but I wouldn't recommend this program to my worst enemy. For all the work done here, I should have spent the extra money and gone to a four year program and received my BSN instead- nowadays it's hard to find a job with just an associates anyways. If you still want to go for an associates for whatever reason, look at NOVA or somewhere else- take Germanna off you your prospective list! So not worth the hassle!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The nursing program offered is deplorable. The schedule is constantly changing, nobody teaching the classes are ever on the same page, the coarsework is extremely heavy, and the only way you can even pass the program is to be an excellent test taker. You can know the information upside down and backwards and still not pass the tests if you don't know how to take a ""Germanna Nursing Program"" test- and there is a reason for this: so their NCLEX pass rates look good! After you graduate from the program, expect to wait over a month for your information to be sent from the school to the State Board of Nursing to be reviewed- so expect to wait at least two months before you can even sit for your board exam. The program has gotten too large for anyone to handle (they are accepting more and more students each semester) and don't have a program designed for the caseload-nor do they have the manpower. With the exception of a few, the instructors/advisors in the program are useless and can be downright mean. With the load of the coursework and the experience you get in clinical, it would be better to spend the extra money and go to a 4-year program and get your BSN-it is starting to be difficult to find a job as an RN with just your associates anyways. If you still want to go for an associates, look at NOVA-please, please, please skip over Germanna! I graduated with honors from the program after working my tail off, but I wouldn't even recommend this program to my worst enemy."
College Freshman,1,"Online Course – I was forced to take an English online course due to damage at the school.  The teacher would put the work out there on one day and it was due the very next.  If you sent an email if you're not understanding something or have a question, they were not answered in time to get the work completed.  I had to drop the course."
College Freshman,1,Not Happy – I am not happy with this school.  It reminds me of high school and the professors are not enthusiastic.  It's hard to listen when someone is speaking in a monotone voice.  The online courses are awful.
Recent Alumnus,1,Online Course Professors – There are few online course professors I encountered that were so strict and basically just throwing loads of schoolwork and homework. They careless if you have other class homework to do.
College Junior,1,"I have yet to determine the real world value of the education I am getting at Germanna Community College. I will have a review about that when I graduate next year and try to get a job in the field of law enforcement. Last year i was ineligible for financial aid and I am waiting on the results for this year. Apparently 29,000 a year is too much earnings for tuition assistance when you can barely pay rent, car insurance, and utilities. I have a GPA of 3.7 and I am a phi theta kappa member and I cannot get any assistance. The way the current system is set up I would be better off if I did not work at all, the irony of it all. I have applied for scholarships and made a lot of effort in that department. I dont understand the logic"
College Freshman,1,"Work is very easy depending on your teacher. Some teachers just fail you if they don't like you. The social life? If you don't have drama in your life, it will find you here."

Freshman,5,I haven’t started in Eureka but I have gotten the tour and the campus is really amazing. The staff was really nice and attending to my questions. When I did move forward to attend the college I ran into a problem on my part and they did their best to help me get through it so I could continue forward.
Freshman,5,As I’ve said I haven’t started in Eureka but I have gotten the tour and the staff was really nice and attending to my questions.
Junior,5,"I personally love the small size and I feel like I am at home. Very personal and everyone knows everyone which makes it easier when your away from home. I’m involved in a sorority for the first time and can’t say enough about the sister hood and working with the community. I’m also in softball which is also a great sisterhood experience and strong bond. I’ve widened my Verizon’s with my education, learned how to budget my time with education, sports, and my sorority and being an independent individual. Love the college experience."
Junior,5,I love the small class sizes. The teachers are very understanding and personal. The small campus really makes it feel like home because you’re able to know everyone. There are always familiar faces around.
Junior,5,"For as small as Eureka is, you get the opportunities, connections, and independence that a larger university has to offer while becoming a well known member of the community and getting the attention from professors and staff that a school like ISU can’t compete with. Since Eureka is privately funded, we they don’t always have the money to upgrade or fix what most schools would consider to be “eye sores” or “historical but outdated.” Eureka’s campus has some amazing rich history, both in the dorm buildings, one of which was built in 1916 and still stands in full use, and the academic buildings, some of which are original to the schools founding in 1855! What Eureka cannot offer in size, it makes up for in personality and genuine character."
Junior,5,I have loved being at Eureka College. Because the school is so small it feels very intimate and the professors are truly invested in the students. The school as a whole is very supportive of all their students and encourages new ideas and community involvement.  For such a small campus there are lots of opportunities to get involved in different clubs and organizations. Overall my experience at Eureka has been very positive.
Junior,5,"I'm just now transferring to Eureka, but I can already see the passion and dedication that the professors and other employees bring to the job. If you are looking for a intimate setting with unmatched academics, this is the place for you!"
Niche User,5,Eureka is definitely unique. I personally love the small town feel of campus. I also really love the balance between the old and new architecture. You feel the history but also the potential to make history there. I think it's ready for a few more updates though. The staff is unbelievably kind and patient. The Opportunities are endless. I'm so excited to go.
Senior,5,"I could not have picked a better college.
This school, while undeniably small, presents its students with huge opportunities to advance and excel in their education. I have yet to take a class with a professor who does not know my name within the first two weeks of school. The class sizes are small, anywhere from 5-35 students, which allows for a very personalized classroom experience. You are not just a ""number"" to your professor like you would be at a bigger school, and this leads you to have great relationships with your professors and peers alike. 
In addition, this college has truly allowed me to broaden my horizons more than I ever thought possible. When I came here, I was incredibly shy, but my professors and peers encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. This led me to join various organizations, take challenging classes, and even go to London for a study abroad trip. 
This school is amazing and has offered me endless opportunities.  I would not hesitate to recommend it!"
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the small class size Eureka has to offer. Because of this, I have not had a single class to this day where a professor has not cared about my grade. You are treated as more than just a number here, however cliche that may sound. The professors really care about you and teach you quality information."
College Sophomore,5,"I have many friends that are involved with Greek life on campus, and they are amazing people. There is no hazing, teasing, or bullying. In fact, most of the Greek life cares more about service and personal development more so than they do partying. While they sure can host a great party, they have more values than just that. Some of my best friends (girls and guys) are involved with the Greek life, and it has inspired me to join soon as well."
College Sophomore,5,"I would not choose another college to go to. I am so happy with my decision to go here. The atmosphere, teachers, and other students have all helped me to grow as a person and become who I want to be. In high school I did not talk much and was not very involved. However, my college makes me feel like I am a part of something, and it has inspired me to strive to become a leader on campus and in life. I love this school and the people in it."
College Sophomore,5,Cops and RAs constantly patrol making sure it's a safe atmosphere
College Freshman,5,I love the experience I have had so far. It's a community feeling that I love.
College Freshman,5,I am enjoying a very aspect of college life. I've met so many new people and stayed on top of all my classes---I'm having a great time.
College Sophomore,5,several scholarship options based on merit and need
College Freshman,5,"Overall, I really enjoy my campus. Ever sense I was younger, I was not into being in a crowded space, which makes Eureka so perfect! Everyone here is so kind, sweet, and loving. One important note is that sense Eureka is a division three school, students can try new activities and are still welcomed with open arms. I love my school!"
College Freshman,5,Better than on-campus dining but there aren't many options in the town. Have to go to other towns around us for food.
College Freshman,5,The professors work hand in hand with the students to prepare them. They give mock interviews and help them set up internships and mentorships around the world
College Freshman,5,I am beyond happy with my program. I intend to be a large animal vet and this is the school to get the education. I have no concern about finding a job in my field.
Senior,4,I like the home feeling because it is only 15 minutes from my hometown. I also like that everyone knows everyone and your professors want to see you succeed.
Junior,4,"Eureka is a great college with a warm atmosphere, a beautiful campus, and a friendly class environment. The remodeled buildings are a great new feature to the campus and provide ample areas for studying and spending time in between classes. The small student body gives a familiar feeling to the campus and helps you make friends easily."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is so friendly on campus including the faculty members. They make themselves known on campus and show up to watch athletic games. I only wish there was better communication about where to go for classes, information that needs to be completed, etc. as an incoming Freshman."
Junior,4,Eureka is a great place to be if you love small towns. The atmosphere is welcoming and quickly become a second home. The professors truly care about you and you are not just a number on a class list.
College Sophomore,4,"I, personally, feel completely safe walking home from work or class at night. There is always a campus police officer who is willing to walk you home if you feel uncomfortable or threatened (neither of which I ever have). To me, campus is very safe, and if someone feels it is not, there are resources to help him or her."
College Sophomore,4,"The older the buildings are, the smaller and more run down they are. However, I live in the newer dorms, which I simply LOVE. There is nothing bad about Alumni or Ivy. However, I do feel feel that the campus' laundry mat (in Ben Major) needs a major upgrade."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is a Division 3 school, so most of the athletes are just regular people. I think that we could use some more student involvement when it comes to having an actual student section, and we are working towards creating one this year."
College Sophomore,4,Proffesors truly want you to care and are avid about you attending class. They expect hard working students who fallow instructions
College Freshman,4,I only use the gym
College Freshman,4,some things i wish I had more help with but it is not something that they know
College Freshman,4,The family connection alumni build serve well as networking for prospective students.
College Sophomore,4,There is no tolerance for underage drinking or drugs
College Sophomore,4,must be invited. bracelet for underage
College Sophomore,4,It has really improved the quality over the years
College Sophomore,4,"While the campus is an older campus, they do a great job updating the residence halls. They have options for people to create floors with a theme such a food or multicultural. They also have single room options where you just share a bathroom with one person. The dorms are within 5 min walking distance to the classes which gives you the option of sleeping in."
College Freshman,4,The parties at eureka are great! In order to get into a party you need to be invited; if your not on the list you will be asked to leave. However this is always a way to make your name present to get on the party lists! They are really chill and safe. There is a cop that comes around and all the under aged freshman and sophomores hold up their wrist bands to show they have not been drinking. There isn't a moment I feel unsafe!
College Freshman,4,There isn't much to do but it's amazing to be here.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of really awesome parties. They also make sure that underage people have a band on so that they cannot drink
College Freshman,4,The majority of people on campus are Greek.  The Greeks are also very involved on campus.  There are not many activities in which there are not at least one Greek member that is involved.
College Freshman,4,The classes themselves are great.  It just stinks that there are only a few professors for each subject.
College Junior,4,"Pretty much the highlight of this school is all the student athletes. 
 "
College Junior,4,Eureka has a solid and heavily enforced drug and alcohol policy. Students who use and get into trouble go through a number of requirements and a probation period prior to being back in good standing.
College Junior,4,"No buses, but lots of students have cars and carpool. Eureka is located between Peoria, with a Charter Bus system, and Bloomington, with a train station and airport."
College Sophomore,4,"Very few drug problems occur on campus, though there are a few people who do participate. It is not a temptation or a regularly seen thing though and i have never been offered or seen drugs personally"
College Sophomore,4,"There is rarely crime on campus because of its small size, Cops from the City of Eureka are contracted to patrol campus everyday of the year regardless if school is in session or not so students always feel safe."
College Junior,4,"Eureka is a small liberal arts college, so there are many opportunities to create strong bonds with professors and build references.  It is an old campus with great character and history."
College Freshman,4,"The academics at Eureka College are very diverse.  We have art, science, math, communication, and many other classes in different subjects. There is a lot to choose from and it is totally worth it!"
College Freshman,4,"I love my school. Psychology is very popular at Eureka College and the professors are highly respected.  Getting my degree will be a lot easier since I have such a great faculty helping me along.  So far there is a fair amount of workload, mostly exams and quizzes."
College Freshman,4,"The class size, professor to student ratio, workload, study areas, and study option are great! I love having a small class size because it makes it easier to pay attention, get to know your professors on a personal basis, and makes it easier to ask questions.  Study areas and study sessions are always readily available.  If you need a tutor, don't hesitate to ask!"
College Freshman,4,"Greek Life is very involved at Eureka College.  They host fun campus wide events, as well the parties the every college has.  There is a variety of sororities and fraternities to choose from, but if you choose not to go Greek, it's not like you are looked down on."
College Junior,4,"Because Eureka College is in a country town, many of the guys and girls are country guys and girls.  Other than that, a lot of the guys are attractive and many of them play sports.  The girls are nice as well and play sports too.  Unfortunately, many of the students on campus are obese, especially those in fraternities and sororities.  You will find a good handful of ""eccentric"" students as well, but they are usually theater or art majors.  Many relationships spark here at Eureka College, many of which go on to get married!  Because it is such a small campus though, your relationship status spreads quickly."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had an internship yet, but I do plan to in a couple years. I am hoping to win one of the scholarships that pays for an internship anywhere of the student's choosing as long as there is an opening. I am just nervous that there won't be enough networking to get me to the one place I want."
College Freshman,4,The people are friendly and willing to talk to anyone that they meet.
College Freshman,4,"If feeling unsafe, we have an on-sight officer to drive us either to our classes or back to the dorms. But our campus is close and quiet that is never needed."
College Senior,4,Eureka College allows students to create their own majors if there isn't one that they're interested in.
College Senior,4,"There is a cop on campus every night and there's relatively no crime. There are always RA's that are around if you need help dealing with a situation as needed. I really like the campus and all the people I've encountered. Overall, Eureka College is a great place to be!"
College Freshman,4,I am double majoring in Art and English.  My adviser is my art teacher and she is very supportive in everything that I am wanting to do.  They make sure they pair you up with the right Major adviser and if not it is allowed to change for someone else.
College Freshman,4,New Building – The freshman girls have the newest building and so the rooms are still nice.  I haven't seen any of the older dorms but the others say that the dorms are okay. The people are friendly and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Safety of EC – Our campus is very safe, I feel right at home at Eureka College.  There is a staff of students and local police that make rounds every night multiple times and that just makes me know I will be alright.  Also, I know that if I have to walk across campus any day of the week at whatever time, I will be safe and not have to watch my back.  Eureka College does a great job of making their students feel safe."
College Sophomore,4,"Its Really a Great Place to Be – Eureka can be a wonderful place to live or a horrible place. It is what you make of it. If you come in leaving all of the high school-like drama behind you and just try to get along with everyone you will have a great time. If you decide you are going to be involved in drama you're going to end up transferring. Eureka is a small campus, everyone knows everything within the hour it happens, so it is best not to get involved in the bad things. If you get past all of this you'll make some of the best friends you could have ever imagined. Eureka is great for that."
College Sophomore,2,He wallet friendly rooms are the equivalent to living in caves due to the lack of lighting. The police that patrol campus are sticklers and will bust you or try to by any means. The laundry rooms have multiple broken down washers and dryers which have not been repaired or even looked at for what seems to be over a year.
College Freshman,2,The off-campus housing is few and far between and most people don't like it.
College Freshman,2,Sometimes they have really good food but it doesn't look good.
College Sophomore,2,More focus on academics not sports
College Junior,2,I never see a cop unless someone is being too noisy
College Junior,2,"No student discounts, all good places to eat are 15+ mins away"
College Junior,2,Not that many places for all students to hang out at. Nothing special about the places that we have.  
College Junior,2,Always have the same things. Never introduce any new dishes.
College Junior,2,Overall I don't enjoy the time I am spending here. I have found that many things are surrounded by racial issues. Its very disappointing. 
College Junior,2,Curriculum is pretty weak. Many advisers will put you in classes that are above your level in school. 
College Junior,2,"Guys on campus are hit or miss. Some can be really nice, well others are just not. Girls are pretty chill actually. Usually friendly."
College Junior,2,"Housing could be updated more, along with many buildings on campus. "
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't any transportation, everyone pretty much drives there own cars.  The only time I have heard of any other transportation around Eureka is when students need rides to train stations around breaks."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few good restaurants in the area around the school.  Like Subway, Hardees and Pizza Hut.  But besides those there are not many options."
College Freshman,2,"Gross and Repetitive – there are always four things on the menu burgers, pizza, sandwiches, and a specialty of the day. almost every day I try the specialty because it is  change from the tasteless that is the food that is served here. When I do not eat in the ""commons"" I fix something in my microwave, which is usually better than the food served. The ""Burgoo"" on the other hand serves starbucks coffee, smoothies,snacks, Ice cream and a lot of not so horrible food."
College Freshman,2,Unsufficient to Students – Every one has problems with the computers. For about 40% of the freshman I talked to they've said that you have to re-log in when you go to another page. With routers every where around campus you cannot seem to get a good signal.
College Sophomore,2,"The sports vary every year. My freshman year, none of the athletic programs were very good but sophomore year we did great. If you want to go to a school where you'll get playing time, Eureka is for you. If you want a school that is always going to be #1, then it might not be the school to go to."
College Sophomore,2,Rural Small town.  Can walk into town.  Need a car for city life.
College Junior,1,No nightlife at all or even any close by. 
College Junior,1,The Wi-fi is horrible. It was out for two week before mid-terms.  
College Sophomore,1,The computers are slow and difficult to use the internet is also slow and is awful.

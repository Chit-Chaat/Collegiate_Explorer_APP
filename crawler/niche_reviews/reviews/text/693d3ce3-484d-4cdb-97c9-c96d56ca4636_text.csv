Niche User,5,"Stanford University is the best university you might want to apply. Not only because of its name and selectiveness, but also because of the diversity that is only experienced at the campus. Their campus is the most diverse in the United States which makes it have a better student life."
Niche User,5,Classes are an experience different from any other. The resources to succeed in your classes makes the university a very capable one to help you achieve your goal.
Sophomore,5,"I love everything here. The architecture, the people, the atmosphere. The classes are a little difficult, but it's worth it."
Graduate Student,5,"There is no other university like it on the planet. The undergrad experience is fantastic--Stanford really makes sure to integrate first year students into campus life. 

Stanford does everything well: academics, extracurriculars, social scene, sports, food, the arts, improv comedy(!), etc. You name it, Stanford does it and does it brilliantly. It even has the best weather!

And don't forget about the grad programs. They are outstanding across the board."
Graduate Student,5,"Brilliant professors. Very accessible through their office hours, and often outside of office hours."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, Stanford is the perfect balance between excellent academics, athletics, and a social atmosphere. One of the most welcoming environments you will ever be in. What separates Stanford from some of its peer institutions is that even though it is an elite university, the students are not elitists in the slightest."
Sophomore,5,"I mean learning online just sucks compared to campus, but that's true for every school. My teachers have been incredibly caring and understanding, and Pass-Fail (I'm writing this Spring of 2020) has been a great opportunity to learn for the sake of learning. The perk to recorded lectures is that you can increase the video speed when the teacher is talking too slow! And it's also super easy to go to events because you just hop on the link and leave if you don't like it."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a sophomore. I had some trouble freshman year, finding my people and deciding what I wanted to do – but now I've found my place here and I love it so so much. While a lot of people love the freshman dorm experience, I'm more of a deep thinker / intellectual type at heart (sounds snobby but idk how else to say it) and my dorm culture largely revolved around partying, hookups, extraversion, small talk, and Instagram. It wasn't until Spring quarter that I found a solid group of friends (outside of my dorm) that I truly connected with. Then pre-sophomore year, during the SoCo program, I made more friends who I truly adore and have had the best times with – smart, creative, hilarious, very grounded people. We baked cookies and made hot chocolate in the winter, drove to SF a few weekends in a row to hike the hills study over coffee and avocado toast. We study regularly in the library together, and stay up til 3am talking. Stanford feels like home, my friends and teachers like family."
Freshman,5,"For lack of better words, Stanford University is a one of a kind university. The cleanliness, architecture, art, and general energy of the campus are all of positivity, engagement, and other things of that sort. Whenever I am there, interacting with the students, faculty, and employees of the various stores and cafes there, it is a very, very welcoming environment. The bookstore has an amazing selection of books, and I always love looking at the selections of readings at its various libaries. Furthermore, every single interaction with professors that I have had, I have enjoyed them and am very much of the belief that they have been for the better. I am truly glad that I will be a part of the incoming Stanford class of 2024."
Freshman,5,Stanford has been an unforgettable experience so far! There are an unlimited number of resources for just about any concern or issue a student might face. Other students breathe new life into the campus on a daily basis with their fresh ideas and the faculty and staff are second to none!
Freshman,5,Due to the current world climate the entire academic portfolio transitioned to an online space. Most professors have done a superb job of taking advantage of assistance from the university to deliver their courses online!
Alum,5,Just the absolute best. Had an amazing experience here and wouldn't have wanted to spend my time in college anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"I took an internship for the Stanford Daily. This was an eight-week internship with Stanford University's student newspaper. Every Monday I would experience a different workshop aimed at teaching key points of what should and shouldn't be done in different branches of journalism. These workshops would also teach you different skills such as graphics, photography, and other multimedia. Every week, I would sign up for an article and throughout the course of the week, I would receive feedback from an editor of the program."
Niche User,5,"Exceptional student body with a great and well-funded campus. The area around it is also great. You get a small-town vibe around it, but you are right next to a giant city, San Francisco, so you get the best of both worlds."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus. Welcoming environment. Location and weather is amazing. Professors are truly interested in their students.  Great diversity in the student population.  Multiple interest groups from sports, arts, politics, service and much more. The exposure to alumni, industry leaders, celebrities, politicians, and regular people who are support and encouraging to expanding your learning is unmatched."
Alum,5,"My undergraduate experience at Stanford University was rich and fulfilling.  I wish I could have stayed longer than the 4 years that I was there.  There is so much to offer and the academics are rigorous whether you are pursuing a degree in STEM or in the liberal arts, and there are an abundance of non-academic pursuits to follow as well, providing for a balanced student life."
Niche User,5,This school is indeed at a very high level and will insure success for your child. There are many courses you can take and there are also a lot of extracurricular activities and clubs that you can join to enjoy our college life.
Freshman,5,"Stanford's motto, ""The wind of freedom blows,"" seems to permeate through all classroom walls, dorm rooms, and dining halls as students at this school are passionate, diligent, and lively. There is definitely a culture distinct to Stanford University, one which embodies free-spirited, unbounded learning. Aside from academics, though, I'd have to say that what makes Stanford unique is its people. Times when I've felt inspired, moved, and at home, were in moments I shared with others in discussions or conversations, whether it was academic or truly frivolous."
Freshman,5,"Stanford is a fun place, their academics are good. Research is the main thing in university, and professors are helpful, don't have ego like some universities."
Niche User,5,It confined me very well and everything was well organized. It has excellent ademics and excellent professors. Everyone there is kind nice and out going. The dorm that I got was clean and smelled nice when I first got there. I got buddy up with a sweat person she is very smart and helps me when I need it. I can go and walk to get food (campus food) and I know I am getting it for a goood price.
Niche User,5,"Stanford is a great university. It has tons of research possibilities and I love that they support students to go study abroad. The campus is great in my opinion and Palo Alto is quite nice, being quiet and perfect for educational entities."
Alum,5,"I loved every aspect of my four years at Stanford, and have no complaints. Thanks to their generous financial aid, I was able to graduate college debt-free."
Senior,5,"I visited the campus when I was in 7th grade, and the experience was surreal. The campus life  and focus on academics inspired my desire to attend Stanford University."
Niche User,5,I like how big the college is and how beautiful the campus is. They have a lot of different majors to choose from. However the acceptance rate is very high.
Junior,5,"Am an exchange student in America and I always hear that it is a good university that everyone wishes to go to, this has made me to like it and have a dream of being there one day in my life."
Niche User,5,Loved my campus visit and tour. I felt like a lot of questions were answered and it wasn't too big of a group.
Niche User,5,Love the campus so much! Always something going on here. Such a good learning environment. Beautiful buildings and nature.
Graduate Student,5,"Everything you hear about Stanford is true. It is one of the best universities you can go to, and not just for the education, but the friendships you form along the way with like-minded individuals."
Niche User,5,It is a very good university. Love the are it's in with the smell of pine tree. The food is great there. There are different options to choose from. Everyone is kind there and people like to include others in activities and they have a nice library and stores to shop at.
Sophomore,5,"Stanford is the greatest place on earth. I feel so at home here and love everything about the campus and life here. The weather is amazing (no snow! or freezing temperatures), people are happier than many other schools, and you have the freedom and flexibility to study anything and switch your major around."
Niche User,5,"Stanford is the best university in the country having surpassed the likes of Harvard and Yale years ago. STEM is the future and no one can match Stanford's undergrad and graduate curriculum; additionally, Stanford is tops or near the top in many liberal arts concentrations. The gorgeous campus, amazing weather, school spirit, sports, and proximity to Silicon Valley and San Francisco are big bonuses. There is a good reason why students, parents, and counselors all name the school as their number one ""Dream School."""
Freshman,5,Great people and academics. Here you get very individualized support on a beautiful campus. I felt right at home as soon as I got here.
Sophomore,5,Great institution with renowned faculty and elite sports. Palo Alto is a good location for startups/tech but not really a college town.
Freshman,5,"Excellent place with excellent people. Outstanding academics, not only in STEM fields but also less commonly known in humanities as well."
Junior,5,"Gotta be the best university in the country. Is there anything this school isn't good at????? Beautiful campus, lots of diversity, great reputation, amazing professors, could go on forever."
Freshman,5,"Stanford students have a reputation for working hard and playing hard. Explore these pages to meet student government leaders, future Olympians, talented artists, political activists, fraternity and sorority presidents, volunteers and avid Cardinal sports fans. More than 600 student organizations drive campus life."
Freshman,5,"The only downside of Stanford is the party scene, and as someone who doesn't party, everything is perfect. The faculty, dorms/housing, and academics are world-class. The facilities are pristine, the campus is beautiful, and even the bathrooms are always clean. Stanford comes with its own prestige, so the return on investment should be great. Companies are always happy to hire someone with a Stanford background."
Niche User,5,"Extremely nice campus, amazing programs, and the food there was incredible! The student-led campus tour was very informative as well!"
Junior,5,"The student to teacher ratio is pretty good for such a big school. The ratio is one teacher to 18 students. Normally this might not be that good but when you consider that Stanford has some of the best teachers in the country, it makes up for the 18 students."
Niche User,5,"Currently, I'm just looking for scholarships to get into Stanford but as far as I've seen, its a great college. There is a lot of diversity, it opens great opportunities and its a great environment."
Freshman,5,"Stanford is an amazing school in a not-so amazing area. The campus is big enough that you never have to leave, which is a positive and a negative thing. The negative thing is the creation of the ""Stanford bubble""--you see the same people, eat the same food, go the same places all the time. But Palo Alto doesn't have much to offer, so it's nice that what we do need is close enough to walk to rather than having to go into the city."
Freshman,5,"There is a beautiful campus; California weather and blue skies, amazing professors, academics, athletics, and facilities. Stanford is the perfect combination of everything you could want in a college- it prepares you for the real world, it's beautiful, the professors and classes are amazing, the facilities are great, and the athletics are unparalleled."
Niche User,5,"Stanford University is a very beautiful campus and the staff and faculty are very nice and are willing to help students at all times. This is a very prestigious University and the biology labs, facilities, and professors live up to the hype and accolades of the school."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful to start and provides many beautiful areas for studying or hanging out with friends. The campus is full of amazing resources including the libraries and professors. The academics are definitely challenging, but worth it. You will be surrounded by people with similar interests and will only push you to work harder in and outside of the classroom."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Stanford. It's a very welcoming place and everyone you meet here is amazing. With such a diverse community, anyone will feel right at home here."
Niche User,5,This place is moreover like a heaven for students. This is a awesome university. Professors are cooperative and staffs are lovely.
Niche User,5,Attending a pre-collegiate program at Stanford University was an amazing experience for me as I immersed myself completely into the atmosphere of the school and explored their many facilities and opportunities.
Niche User,5,The environment was calming and was beautiful. I enjoyed the research opportunities as well as the tutoring opportunities. The people seemed very friendly and the atmosphere overall was very enjoyable.
Niche User,5,Really welcoming when you first get there.The outside is beautiful and so are the dorm rooms.We have a great basketball team and we love to support them.
Niche User,5,"It has amazing programs, and has a safe learning environment full of encouragement from your peers! Great place to go if you still don't know what you want to do while receiving the best education"
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful to start and provides many beautiful areas for studying or hanging out with friends. The campus is full of amazing resources including the libraries and professors. The academics are definitely challenging, but worth it. Go Card!"
Junior,5,Stanford provides a world-class academic setting in a diverse enriching community. It provides with opportunities and experiences to last a lifetime.
Sophomore,5,"Stanford is an amazing school. I just finished my freshman year, and I had almost all classes under 25 students; lectures all break into sections of 15 students or so. Great people, great professors. More diversity than I had ever encountered in my life until now. Oh, and the weather is beautiful too."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and the atmosphere that the individuals created there. The staff assisted me to their fullest potential while touring the campus and its amenities.
Sophomore,5,"A lot of what I expected college to be like came from TV, but arriving at Stanford proved a lot of the cliches wrong. My fears of cramped dorm rooms, dreadful dining hall food, and a drab campus were fully put to rest within my first week of moving in. Beyond that, there has not been a single class that has not enlightened me in some way. The professors are amazing, and their passion for the subject matter is clearly visible throughout every lecture. When your professors are the best in their field, and when they approach every class with the high energy that comes with loving what they're teaching, it's almost impossible to not fall in love with the subject yourself."
Niche User,5,"Amazing School overall. The best of the best program, with prestigious opportunities coming out of school."
Sophomore,5,"I love Stanford. There are so many opportunities and resources here for every student, even those with financial need like myself. Moreover, there is a diverse student body that always provides insights on something new and constantly challenge you to be your best."
Senior,5,"My experience at Stanford has really made me somebody excited about being a life long learner. I have enjoyed every single person I have met, and learned so much from them and the professors that have such a diversity of backgrounds and knowledge."
Alum,5,Great place. I was very fortunate to go there. It's like summer camp for 4 years. Best place ever and it gets better every year.
Freshman,5,"The application process was easy to understand. The campus is beautiful, and they even provided a travel scholarship for me to fly to visit the campus."
Sophomore,4,"It's still okay. The professors are understanding and trying to help as much as they can while still teaching what they need to. Online is just difficult in general, it takes out the social aspects of college."
Graduate Student,4,I love Stanford and everything it has to offer. The people are so inspiring and I am excited to always be a part of the university.
Graduate Student,4,"The online experience has been good. Professors have been very accommodating and understanding. Of course it is difficult to account for every technical issue, but everyone at Stanford is doing their best."
Graduate Student,4,"All of spring quarter 2020 was virtual. All of my professors adapted well to the change, and found ways to engage the class despite the distance."
Graduate Student,4,Excellent school. Your experience is what you make it. If your financial circumstances change be prepared for a lengthy battle with the financial aid office.
Sophomore,4,It is a good school and I found a good community while I was there. There are a couple issues with some of the professors and departments heads and their lack of understanding.
Sophomore,4,"I took all of my Spring quarter courses online. They definitely would have been better in person,  but the professors adapted their curriculums really well and were super accommodating and understanding of the constantly changing circumstances."
Senior,4,"Stanford is isolated: it's a very pretty but sometimes dull campus.  Students rely on bikes: dangerous traffic jams on campus! Pre-Covid, dorm rooms  small and shared: school had little options for those with crazy roommates. Wonderful research opportunities: profs open to exploration of topics of interest. Personalized education: you aren't just a face in the crowd. Library system terrific: they help! Grading is fair, not on a curve.  Pre-Covid: good opportunities for extracurricular activities. Now, fewer. Online courses well put together and University IT very responsive.  The university is trying hard.
Your fellow students are top-notch! That inspires you to put your best effort. Course selection relevant. Be prepared to do a lot of work! Grading is fair and transparent. Expectations clearly established early on. Much of the experience comes from extracurricular and social engagement. But worth the effort!"
Senior,4,"The pluses: small class size; research opportunities; chance to get to know professors; excellent libraries; willingness to help students from different backgrounds; good overseas programs; good job hunting support. Good extracurricular activities (sports, music, drama). Wonderful if you already know where you want to go.
Negative: students determined to get that A!; inconsistent advising; special programs for students you might not hear about and might not be eligible for."
Freshman,4,"I have not had an online experience with Stanford regarding any class matters, but I like how it has digitally handled things like having new admits interacting with one another and continuously updating us with information about the upcoming school year."
Freshman,4,"A lovely place with lovely people and a wonderful support for FLI students!! However, some classes feel a slight bit unorganized. In general, great financial aid and support."
Freshman,4,I really love Stanford. It truly is the best place to be if you want to see academics in work and great athletics on the field
Freshman,4,"Stanford is beautiful, full of opportunity and life and heart and soul. I'm excited to spend my undergraduate years here and I know it will be a transformative experience!"
Freshman,4,Stanford was a great place to sraudy with exceptional teachers and staff. Classes were hard at times but if you managed your time correctly then all was good. As a freshman I was scared at first but then if you open up you can make tons of new friends epecially if you join a sorority.
Niche User,4,"I wish Stanford would change their ways of gaining money, because scams aren't admirable. Overall, however, it's your typical school."
Alum,4,"the university is great, amazing lecturers and party scene. Good sports and facilities. campus food is amazing and this is the best experience I have had as a student"
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Stanford is the resources that it has especially for students who are first generation or low income. It has way more resources than many other colleges I know. One downfall of Stanford is its lack of diversity which is apparent not only in student demographics but also staff and professors. Another downfall of Stanford is its destructive relationship with neighboring communities especially cities like East Palo Alto where the population is largely low-income and non-White. Because of tech companies, the layout of Silicon Valley and Stanford's proximity to tech companies, many families are being displaced by recent Stanford grads and other related workers."
Niche User,4,"Stanford is a private school that costs a lot to attend. But it comes with smaller classes, good professors, and a good overall feel of the school."
Niche User,4,"I frequented Stanford University's campus in Palo Alto, CA since close familial acquaintances attended Stanford. Additionally, as I attended elementary and middle school in PAUSD, I have taken various summer program and participated in activities held at Stanford. From my experiences, Stanford is a warm, welcoming school with a beautiful campus and considerate student body."
Niche User,4,Stanford University is a very lovely college. I went on a visit and they were very attentive and they got interested in what I wanted to do someday and they told me everything I could do with it there and what buildings I would go to. They paved out everything I could want to know and made everything so simple to understand. They had amazing facilities and everyone was so welcoming. They try very hard at everything they do. It would be a great place to go for an aspiring athlete or scholar.
Sophomore,4,Overall fun and good time. Lots of work. Good for most people. Freshman year was amazing. Sophomore year is time to buckle down and grind like most places.
Freshman,4,"Stanford is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome! There is an overwhelming sense of community to be found by anyone from any background, and academics are challenging and prepare you for anything you may want to pursue after college. The atmosphere and school spirit are always lively, and it's an overall great place to be."
Junior,4,"Stanford is a great school because it has a lot of resources and connections. I don't think the academics are harder than any other university, but I think they do a great job in selecting students who have a passion for discovery, creation, and innovation. The experience of being able to learn, grow, and collaborate with these people is the greatest blessing."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my freshman year and have had a wonderful time at Stanford. It's a place where you can be yourself and there will be a welcoming place for you. Classes are top-notch. Student life is diverse, and there are many students who are highly smart yet also down-to-earth and unpretentious about it. It's important, however, to keep in mind that Stanford isn't the perfect palm tree academic paradise its brochures try to make it out to be. There are virtually no good food options on campus, and it's quite hard to get off it. Despite being a diverse place, students often go into their little communities, and those often rarely interact. Stanford admin can oscillate between launching programs that are very welcoming to students, and paying lip service to other issues that are important to students. Overall, if you get in, it's definitely cause for celebration. However, if you don't, it's not  like you've missed your one golden chance. Really, don't sweat it too much."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus at Stanford and the fact that they have their own little city on campus. I think the students who attend are all very unique in their personalities and hobbies, which makes the student body particularly diverse."
Freshman,4,"Stanford is a beautiful campus with excellent facilities and lots of truly accomplished professors. You'll be in awe simply biking to and from class. Other aspects of Stanford didn't turn out to be quite the paradise I expected, but it is still a quality experience overall. Be happy if you get in, but don't sweat over it too much if you don't."
Niche User,4,I have grown up loving and supporting Stanford University. Both my parents are alumni and I was born in the Stanford Medical Center. Ever since I was little I have been amazed at the campus and atmosphere of Stanford. The welcoming community and supportive staff are integral to the feeling of family at the university.
Graduate Student,4,"In Stanford, collaboration comes before competition. Once you have proved worthy of being in Stanford, it is not about what grades you receive and how you are better than someone else purely in academics, but about how you reach out for different experiences, how you enrich yourself with multi-disciplinary research activities, how you participate in year round activities on campus and help each other out in academics. It isn't how much you know, it is how well you use what you know. It doesn't matter what field you are in, Stanford will give you the holistic experience of studying in a University that no one else can. Don't be afraid to apply, I was very afraid, but I took the leap and here I am."
Sophomore,4,"I've really enjoyed Stanford so far. 
Academics are certainly challenging, but rewarding, and students usually aren't excessively stressed about grades. 
Professors are, for the most part, incredibly knowledgeable and care about students, but there are some (particularly those teaching intro classes) who could use some improvement. 
The local area can be a bit expensive and far away (especially without a car).
Currently, the administration is facing a lot of criticism about the school's handling of sexual assault. It's not the best situation, but a lot of the criticism also comes from Stanford's own professors and students, so I do still feel relatively safe and supported on campus."
Niche User,4,"It was a great experience with lots of opportunity. My greatest memories are from here. If I could change one thing, it'd be the increased diversity of the student populations."
College Sophomore,4,"Quality and prevalence is decent, and the best parties take place at the Row. The party scene ranges from all-dorms, small kickbacks, to all-campuses. There are many themed parties and other traditions, which make the experiences more fun and more interesting. The party scene has a tendency to make friendships fast, but it's not for everyone, and you can definitely bond with friends outside of parties."
College Sophomore,4,"The Row is always alive on weekends, and no one will pressure you to party. However, parties are generally fun and uplifting as de-stressers. It's also a perfect time to bond with new friends and meet old friends. Transportation sucks if the party is on the other side of campus. You can't bike if you're drunk because SU police take BUIs seriously, but there is a free transportation for nighttime, 5-SURE, for students who aren't able to drive. Last resort is Uber or Lyft."
College Sophomore,4,"Open Door policy makes drug and alcohol very present. Although freshmen get exceptionally rowdy, it fosters trust and community with the dorm staff.

Nevertheless, after freshman year, people generally grow up and use that policy wisely."
College Sophomore,4,"Having rushed a sorority and not expecting to in the first place, the Greek community is rowdy, but extremely friendly and open. It also depends on what kind of sorority to rush - there are multi cultural ones, and ones that are part of the national association of sororities. In terms of rowdiness, it varies from group to group. The Greek life here is not the one typically stereotyped in movies."
College Sophomore,4,"My freshman year at Stanford was one of great tribulations and joys. My favorite experiences have included last-minute adventures all over our expansive campus, meeting intelligent and genuinely kind students, and learning from passionate experts. 

Although I got accepted through Early Action, I didn't decide to attend until the spring deadline. I was set on a B.S./M.D. program that would enable me to finish my undergraduate studies and medical school in 7 years. I found roommates, and applied for housing. But I couldn't forget the opportunities that Stanford offered me: the chance to be involved with breakthrough research and explore my passions and interests outside of a accelerated medical program. 

This year, I got what I asked for: a challenge. Stanford has challenged me academically, physically, emotionally, and socially. Being here helped me grow up and see that what I envisioned for myself throughout high school can transform and that that was okay. People always ask me if I regret my decision, and I remember the times that I actually did; the times when I was frustrated by low grades, turbulent relationships, or just plain confusion about the future. 

I don't regret my choice, but I'm glad that I don't have a chance to do it all over. Stanford is dubbed the ""Harvard of the West,"" where the California sun shines on easygoing but driven students. Stanford taught me that the college experience will never be perfect - there will be many ups and downs. It's known for its diverse excellence in academics and impressive athletic program - always at the forefront of innovation and at the edge of the next frontier in science and the arts. However, its greatest strength lies in its brilliant yet compassionate community of students and teachers. 

I learned, in a roundabout but wonderful way, that a college experience is what one makes out of it - regardless of where one goes. I plan to not only survive at Stanford, but also thrive."
College Freshman,4,People are just doing what they want to do
College Freshman,4,People are accepting of others and diversity is embraced.
College Freshman,4,It's there just like at every school but Stanford is great
College Sophomore,4,Brock Turner was an isolated incident and doesn't represent the campus culture on health and safety.
College Sophomore,4,Employers do very well in Career Fairs in promoting their name and recruiting potential employees.
College Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed most of my classes, except for the ones where the material is hard, and the professor is made at explaining things."
College Sophomore,4,Students are active in protesting against sexual assault and institutions who don't do enough.
College Sophomore,4,"The buildings are nice and comfortable, sometimes even the architecture and interior design in pretty."
College Sophomore,4,"I felt a little left out for not joining a sorority, but it's not the end of my social life either."
College Sophomore,4,"School spirit is fun during football season, less in Basketball, and non existent in other sports, unless your'e friends with an athlete."
College Junior,4,"Professors could be encouraged to give better lectures, but overall great."
College Junior,4,"Despite the size of campus, I feel that the school does a great job."
College Junior,4,"I would say it's okay, but then I saw the situation at other schools."
College Junior,4,It's nothing like a state school. The Greek life cuts out most of the silly traditions.
College Senior,4,"There are great options every weekend. Some small music events with a casual crowd, some EDM ravy parties, some classic frat parties, and someone going out to bars for sure."
College Senior,4,"While some classes are large and impersonal, those classes always have TAs that are devoted and sections that are small. Professors are world class, though not always world class teachers."
College Senior,4,"While we have the best overall athletic program in the country, much of the school consists of passive fans. Happy when we're doing well but certainly not devoted. It's pretty hard to be on the club teams because there are tons of students who could have bee D1 at another school but chose Stanford instead. IV sports on the other hand are really fun and casual. The atmosphere on football days is pretty awesome"
College Senior,4,"Full disclosure, I'm in a sorority. I love it, I think it has provided me a community unlike anything else at Stanford. Greek life provides much of the social life on campus, though frat parties are open to all and many find other parties they prefer. Those in Greek life love it for the community, the support system, and the extensive network throughout Stanford. 3/7 sororities have houses, and there are 6 housed fraternities. Almost 30% of women are in sororities, and around 20% of men. Stanford tries to downplay it's effect on campus, but the truth is that most social people, though they may find their primary source of fun and community somewhere else, are also involved in a sorority or fraternity"
College Senior,4,"I feel very safe on campus, the location is totally safe"
College Senior,4,"In my experience, absolutely no one feels pressure to drink, and alcohol is generally treated as fun but not vital. More open drinking culture in the dorms through 0 RA need to enforce under 21 rules = very safe, open, and healthy relationship with staff and students regarding alcohol"
College Junior,4,"The school can do their best to provide safety caution, but the individuals have to be aware of the crime themselves."
College Junior,4,"Our buildings on campus are not the newest, but they sure are spacious and convenient."
College Junior,4,"Our team performance is not only nation's top, it also has one of the most renowned fan support"
College Freshman,4,"Though the diversity on campus could certainly be better, I believe that it's better here than at most colleges."
College Freshman,4,"Beyond the prestigious name that Stanford has, the university will put you in contact with the kinds of people who are best positioned to maximize your success. The university wants famous alum after all!"
College Freshman,2,Significantly fewer all-campus parties than there were in recent years due to administrative changes. Students are generally unhappy about this. Also frat parties are wholly unsatisfying in general.
College Freshman,2,"Recently, a lot of changes have been made that seriously impacted students' social lives. While we understand some of the motivation behind these changes, the student body generally agrees that the changes were not the best ways to handle the situations  that prompted them."
College Sophomore,2,"Residential and Dining Enterprises, or RDE, controls.... residential and dining stuff. Since almost everyone lives on campus, or tries to (grad students), they basically control half our lives. However, they really aren't the most helpful organization. No one really tries to live off campus as an undergrad. If you stay beyond your four guaranteed years of housing, however, they do have a site that lets you look for off campus housing though. It's crazy expensive here though! Get some roommates."
College Freshman,2,The University has been very strict this year and limiting the number of all-campus parties that take place on weekends.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Have you ever tried to eat in Palo Alto? If yes, you know why you wouldn't do it the next time. If no, don't start unless you are starving and the nearest kitchen if an hour away. Totally pointless waste of time and money."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Pea-sized rooms that suffer from regular break-ins and overall campus unsafety and got really, really chilly in the winter."
College Sophomore,2,"Okay, so I'm not much of a partier, but I know many people who love partying so I feel I can give both sides.

If you enjoy parties: Frats happen (most) every weekend but are by no means reliably good. Alcohol is the most prevalent drug, but marijuana comes in as a very very close second. Frat parties have ""themes"" like space race, or 80s, or something, and people drink beforehand rather than actually at the frat (not always the case) and then there's a lot of loud music, lights, and grinding. Most people get really drunk as soon as they get a moment to decompress then wind up at frat parties and have a pretty okay time. Big parties like Endless KA or Snowchella or some of the other major all-campuses the frats throw are usually the funnest, everyone seems to enjoy the larger, more publicized frat parties. A lot of people here don't *really* enjoy frat (or frat-style, because row parties at Synergy or French House or whatever are just frat parties without greek letters) parties because they're massive, impersonal, and you have to be a certain level of drunk to enjoy them, but they continue to go to frat parties due to a lack of other things to do. Dorms above frosh level often have to fill out ""party request forms"" in order to have get togethers (cough cough crothers) but closer, smaller, parties with drinking and friends are usually better when possible. Girls/guys in sororities/frats report party life as being much better due to the progressives that they have with each other/within greek life. Going off campus for clubs/bars/parties is not really a thing.

If you aren't into parties: Cardinal Nights occasionally rolls out a really fun event but for the most part is, unfortunately, regarded as a joke. Most social life/night life revolves heavily around drinking. You have to be really active in finding outside activities or people who don't drink (they do exist!) Good news is there isn't really any pressure to drink or do drugs or what have you if you don't wanna."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very expensive - I'd recommend you stick to on campus housing
College Junior,2,They are exclusive and egotistical.
College Junior,2,This area is very expensive.
College Sophomore,2,No one really does this..
College Sophomore,2,"Palo Alto isn't a college town any more, and the restaurants tend to be pretty pricey. But the quality is great, and there are many options if you have the money."
College Senior,2,"its expensive, hard to find, and not close"
College Senior,2,The transcript deadline was confusing. No support.
Recent Alumnus,2,The local town is definitely geared towards locals rather than young adults.
Recent Alumnus,2,Although the external image of Greek life on campus is overall very good the infighting and gossiping between the various organizations is very bad. The Greek life director often fuels rumors and arguments rather than trying to resolve them and is often very biased towards her favorite organizations.
College Freshman,2,"Palo Alto is far too expensive for most students, and because campus is so large, the commute is excessive. Everyone just lives on campus, where there are countless options."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-Campus housing is extremely expensive and inconvenient. In general, everyone lives on campus all four years."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life isn't a status thing at all; if you're Greek, no one cares; if you're not Greek, no one cares. There are only three housed sororities, and around five housed frats, at least two of which will be partying on any given weeknight."
College Senior,2,"Expensive and Competitive – Be prepared to shell out a few hundred bucks for a parking permit. Unfortunately, the permit is only valid near your dorm. If you want to visit a friend or drive accross campus for something during enforement hours, you will have to pay for vistor parking. Some places have sufficient parking spots, but many dorms will force you to walk a little bit when the spaces fill up."
Junior,1,"It is a waste of time. I totally got no support and even if you asked you won't find any. Because English is not my first language and am not a nerd, some Professors  do not respect me. I mean am living my life and I like to not act cleaver, so why the hate. And another complain is that many people do not respect your race. Due to the fact I am not Asian, everybody look at me like I am a useless piece of crab."
Recent Alumnus,1,"One thing may be worse than the ""dining"" at Stanford, and that's the price, the quality and the availability of the off-campus housing. Forget about privacy and prices below $1000 for a crapy room at a shared old and smelly house in the suburbs with a 40 min commute."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The food is really bad at this part of the West coast, and Stanford campus is no exception. Occasionally, you may find something somehow eatable but that's about it. If you have been born and raised in NorCal, than that may be OK for your taste. Otherwise, prepare to suffer."
College Senior,1,I am buying a brand not an education
College Senior,1,they need more rules and enforcement with drinking
College Senior,1,not accepting of difference unless it fits in
College Senior,1,Got nothing and had to take out lots of loans
College Senior,1,Pretentious. Not accepting of differences
College Senior,1,There is very little support for students
College Sophomore,1,The campus police are not very strict. If you're a good kid and you don't drink or do drugs you should be fine but if you do it's not that often that you'll be severely punished.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is crazy packed all the time and it is proof that you don't need to buy a car. It's better to just use the zipcars that are available.
College Sophomore,1,"It is very very difficult to find student affordable off-campus housing. There are a few options, like these small houses that a few seniors or grad students will rent out, that are reasonably priced and located, but most housing in the Palo Alto area is very expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"It's really expensive and a big hassle, just go with a bike unless you really want to drive you car"
College Freshman,1,"Most Bike – As is frequently quoted, there are more bikes at Stanford than students.  That being said, most freshmen/sophomores do not have cars and parking is limited."
College Senior,1,"Awful: Everything's Taken by 9Am – Super limited parking. Students who live on campus can buy monthly/yearly permits that cost roughly $25/month to get spaces near the dorms. You still have to circle for 10 minutes to find a spot. There are commuter permits, only for employees who live off campus(especially the med school) and these always seem to be in the prime places. Very limited visitor parking and very pricey ($1.25/hour), and enforced 8am to 4pm M-F. Parking is free on weekends EXCEPT where marked in tiny lettering on signs. Stanford must get thousands of dollars every year in tickets, because they are *really* aggressive. I have a friend who parked in a permit spot without a permit for 3 min to turn in a homework assignment, and when he came back he had a ticket. During the summer I would sometimes spend literally 45 minutes looking for a parking spot because all the lots were full."
College Sophomore,1,Really Really Expensive – It's Palo Alto. Apartments are hard to come by and very expensive. There is a reason almost everybody lives on campus
College Junior,1,"Please please please don't come if you're looking for relationships that don't stem from random frat party hookups. The dating scene here is absolutely miserable. Yes, it is possible to find the odd nice guy, but watch out - once he finds out he is a hot commodity, he'll be looking to hook up with as many girls as possible instead of dating. For the most part Stanford guys are either arrogant jerks (largest category), completely nerdy (second largest category) or just not interested in having a girlfriend at all (almost all the rest.) The only ""romantic"" interactions between guys and girls happen freshman year at frat parties or...well basically just at frat parties. Why? I honestly think that it is a combination of California laid-back attitudes and the fact that most people here are a little bit selfish and aren't willing to put themselves out there enough to invest in a meaningful relationship yet. Am I a little bit bitter? Yup, but so are most girls I know. Its been 3 years and, despite having boyfriends all through high school, I've been asked out on one date at Stanford. Dating / relationships here just aren't the Stanford way, I guess."
College Junior,1,"Too Crowded! With over 1000 students, we are limited to only so much space during lunch. We can't pass certain areas during lunch so we are confined to only a little space either outside or in the cafeteria where the space is so small and crowded!"

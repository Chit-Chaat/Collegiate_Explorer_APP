Freshman,5,"I did not take online classes, but I heard taking them online are great! The teachers really keep you up to date and stay on top of things!!"
Freshman,5,What I love about Louisiana College is how involved the teachers are in your learning careers. What I would change is how much people care about their athletic programs.
Senior,5,Took classes online throughout my undergrad and due to COVID. Teachers were very helpful with the class and went out of their way to make sure I completed my class.
Freshman,5,"I visited the campus and met some of the people. I also got to attend the BCM, and overall my experience was amazing. The people are so kind, and the Lord is moving on that campus. I'll be attending in the fall."
Freshman,5,I love every second i spend on this campus. The feeling i got when I first stepped onto the campus was better than i ever had on any other campus i toured. the professors and other faculty make the place feel as though i belong there. I could never ask for a better place to spend my college career.
Freshman,5,"Louisiana College offers its student's a very ""at home"" feel to it.  The campus isn't very big but is very well designed to navigate throughout the campus.  The teachers are very friendly and the athletics are very good.  One thing I would like to see change is the cost of tuition ($9000+) but besides that it is a great school."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Louisiana College, and I wish I had more time there. The people are amazing and so welcoming. The faculty and staff genuinely care about the students and truly want the best for them. There are always student activities going on on campus, and there is always ways to get involved.  Louisiana College has helped shaped me into the person I am today, and I am so blessed to be able to be apart of this school."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed how the professors were very sincere in their desire to make every student feel confident in their academic each semester as a dual enrollment student.
Freshman,5,"Louisiana college is a christian based college. The school is really small, which allows the students and teachers grow closer where we all feel like a family."
Junior,5,I love this college. The teachers are amazing and the classes are excellent. I transferred to this college in the fall of 2017 and I have been having a great time.
Senior,5,This school can change your life and make a student get closer to God. It’s a school that is hard but it gets a person ready for the real world. Now it’s some rules and things that make students feel like they have no freedom but other than that it’s a overall great school.
Junior,5,"I loved the environment and how everything is based solely on Christ. It's just a welcoming, caring college and everybody knows who you are."
Freshman,5,The experience is unexplainable because the people there are so amazing and friendly. They really care about their students and our education. They go above and beyond to make sure the students are getting all we need to be successful.
Freshman,5,"Louisiana College has been an excellent experience so far, looking forward to finishing my education here."
Freshman,5,I haven't been on campus much but the campus has plenty wonderful features and teachers who love to have connections with their students
Freshman,5,It is a great small college and It would really help you reach your goal. The people are really nice and the professors are always there to help. The whole experience would be great for a small town girl or boy and you can easily make yourself at home.
Alum,5,"I was not looking forward to going to LC. I didn't want to be close to home and I thought it would be like private school all over again; it wasn't. I can't perfectly explain how great my experience at LC was. I became friends with basically all of my professors and would not have passed were it not for their efforts to ensure that I did. The people at LC, although sometimes cliquey, are wonderful and usually welcoming. The Union Board and other student organizations do their best to make sure there are plenty of opportunities to have fun on campus and our athletes are also pretty awesome as well. It was a great experience that I don't regret at all."
Freshman,5,"Louisiana College is absolutely wonderful. The professors are so helpful and patient with all of their students. People are safe on campus with 24/7 security being on call and located right next to campus. Our Union Board hosts all of the campus' events, which allow the students to interact with each other while being active with the campus. The only thing I would like to change about LC is the amount of parking available for commuters."
Freshman,5,I love it here so much. It's a very at-home atmosphere. Great opportunitry to further my education and grow as a Christian. Professors are very reachable and small class sizes make the learning experience very direct. Everyone at the school is very supportive/helpful and very nice. 
Freshman,5,Louisiana College staff are very generous and welcoming. Everyone smiles and speak like they have known me for years. I attended Welcome Week and the staff taught us a few traditions. We did community service by helping pack food for children who are less fortunate. We had activities to get to know everyone. The campus is nice and easy to get around. I run cross country and track. We have chapel every Tuesday and Thursday. I'm a Christian and the staff are helping me become a better Christian everyday. I love Louisiana College. I get a great education and more knowledge about God.  I don't regret becoming a Wildcat.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely adore Louisiana College! Everything from the type of education, professors and peers, to the environment, and the atmosphere... It's all incredible and incredibly exciting and loving. I love that I can get a top-of-the-line education that is centered around Christ. There is always something fun going on to help get my mind off of my studying, even for a little while. The people are so friendly and inviting! The professors truly care about their students and want them to get the most out of their teaching; they really want them to learn. I have met some of my absolute favorite people at this school and I would never dream of leaving it."
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy the small class.  Gives us more attention and allows more input for the students and from the teacher.
College Freshman,5,"Louisiana College is unique because you are not a statistic, but rather a human being who matters. The professors truly care about the students and want what's best for them. It's an encouraging and fun atmosphere where you don't have to worry about some of the pressures of a ""normal"" college. It's the perfect place for me."
College Freshman,5,I love this college! It's the perfect college for me. It's small and you get to build close friendships. The professors are all super friendly and are all willing to work with you and around your schedule.
College Junior,5,The teachers are awesome and they get to know you and are open to help.
Recent Alumnus,5,Louisiana College's Security do great in helping protect the school. They are always available when needed. The security runs laps around the school numerous times through out the day to make sure there is no violence or theft.
College Freshman,5,God First – One big thing Louisiana College focuses on is putting God first to achieve success.
College Junior,5,"I Love It! Louisiana College is a great school which has teachers that love to teach and that love Jesus. The school prepares the student to be a successful business person, teacher, doctor, pastor, and person in the world through a Christian world view, with the Jesus being the most important thing in life. They are also very accepting of people of other cultures and traditions."
College Junior,5,"We have a great and growing football team, with a new stadium built just last year and sports like softball that won the championship last year, and are nationally ranked. We also have basketball, soccer,tennis, and cross country, all play in div. 3."
College Freshman,5,I live in a small city located in the state of Louisiana. Pineville is quite safe and the community is excellent. The local attitude toward other student is very welcoming. The people here are caring and are willing to lend a hand when someone is in need. There are several places to spend time here. We have a mall and many athletic clubs for those who are in to shopping and fitness.
College Student,5,Coffe and Yogurt. I love that there are quite a few spots to get coffee. There is also an ace spot to get frozen yogurt. It's not expensive either.
College Junior,5,"Drugs Are Low – Drugs and alcohol use are restricted on LC's campus and not an option at school. However some students drink in surrounding areas, but only provide influence to those around them."
College Sophomore,5,"the financial aid office at LC is very helpful, i can go to them at any time.  i receive a good bit of financial aid because of lower income, and they are great about getting me all that i qualify for."
College Sophomore,5,No Drugs – As far as i know there are no drugs at LC.  I have certainly never seen or heard of anyone using drugs.
College Sophomore,5,"LC is a small Christian school, with a small number of students.  With only around 1400 students, the atmosphere is more like a family.  you get to know so many people.  Most students attend LC because this is where they feel that God has lead them.  Also the acedemic quality at LC is much greater than other state schools in our area.  Several medical grad schools look for LC students because they know we have received a good education."
College Sophomore,5,"What Makes My School Unique – My school is very small, so we get to know a lot of people on campus. Classes are small and get to know the teachers on an individual level, some teachers have class dinners at their house. We have a very strong Christian atmosphere and Biblical teaching which allows for a clean campus as well as personal growth in my spiritual life and a deeper relationship level with the students. Louisiana college has a very strong academic program and is above average on education in the fields it offers, specifically in education, nursing, and religion majors."
College Senior,5,"It's small and easy to get around – I love the place! It's small and easy to get around, and everyone is so friendly, and there's always something to do. :)"
College Freshman,5,They give a good variety at our school from religion to art. Would like to see even more varity of majors to expand the schools.
College Freshman,5,Small Campus – LC is a small campus so you can walk to  every class. However the public tranporation in Pineville is horrible but that is not LC's fault.
College Sophomore,5,Small campus community – The campus is small and very warm and welcoming. There is rarely anyone who does not have friends or does not feel accepted.
College Sophomore,5,"This Campus Is One of the Safest Places I Have Ever Been. I have seen students leave purses, backpacks, books, and other personal items in classrooms or the cafeteria, and then go back the next day and find them right where they left them. You can't do that just anywhere!"
College Freshman,5,"Social Lives – My college is very strict. It is a private Christian college, so they try to instill good values in us. They do not let girls and guys hang out in rooms together unless the lights are on and the doors are open. If you got caught doing drugs or drinking they will most likely kick you out!"
College Freshman,5,"My Experience So Far – My experience has been great. I love the classes, and the teachers are really nice. They are always helpful when you get confused. There are no parties because it is a Christian college, so we worship God and focus on our studies."
College Sophomore,5,We don't need any transportation because the campus is so small.
College Sophomore,5,"No Night Life, but Plenty of Raw Material for Fun. Alexandria/Pineville is a typical small Southern city. We have a decent mall, a movie theater, a bowling alley, an art gallery, some parks, plenty of restaurants, and a few bars. People are friendly and the food is good. Everything, and I mean everything, closes by 12. This really isn't a party town, but if you want good clean college fun, this is your place. No one will throw you out of WalMart if you play mission impossible in the sporting goods section. There are plenty of parks for waterballoon wars. And college and highschool sporting events are abundant."
College Freshman,5,"Good Pre-Med Program – We have a good pre-med program, with great teachers that care!"
College Senior,5,"Apts Are Out There – Love my apt at Quail Creek. I moved in quickly, the rent is just right, and I have a wonderful manager and maintenance staff."
College Freshman,5,"Christian College Christian Enviroment – For most students, ""nightlife"" means going to hang out with your friends around campus or at IHOP. There really aren't any bars around school."
College Freshman,5,"Althletic Center Is Legit – We have a new athletic center, with a basketball court, two racket ball courts, bike machines, treadmilles, workout benches, machines, and a Subway restuarant."
College Freshman,5,"Very Strict – Very focused on the Christian values, and expresses these values in the school policies. Keeps things clean, no parties, alcohol, or drugs."
College Freshman,5,"If you live on campus, you will have no need to drive because everything is within ten minutes walking distance. If you are a commuter, there are always plenty of parking places. You may have to walk about 10-15 minutes to get from one side of campus to the other."
College Freshman,5,"No Kind of Drugs, Ever – LC has a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. I feel very safe and protected by campus security."
College Freshman,5,The Student Center Is Awesome. The student center has recently been remodeled and it is great. There are nice televisions and it is a great environment to hang out with fellow classmates.
College Junior,5,"I am a history major at Louisiana College and I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience with a professor. The history department is small, but the professors love what they do and enjoy teaching their content to students. They are highly qualified in what they do. They know their students by name and will stop in the hall to have a normal, non-school related conversation."
College Junior,5,Stepping Block – Louisiana College offers an execellent education. It has execellent professors who truly care about your education as well as your growth with Christ during the course of your experience at LC. It's a great stepping block to where ever you want to go in life. The professors are more than willing to give you references and advice to help you get into your graduate school of choice.
College Junior,5,"No Exceptions – Most of the Athletes that start as a Freshman do not make it to their spring semester at Louisiana College. Louisiana College is a tough private school, and they don't make allowances for the athletes just because they're on varsity. They have to do their classwork just like everybody else. The coachs enforce good grades and Christian conduct. For the players that make it past their freshman year, I believe that they have an excellent experience at Louisiana College."
College Sophomore,5,"It's good enough – We don't need transportation because the campus is so small. There are churches within walking distance, and sometimes my friends and I walk to the snow cone place."
College Sophomore,5,Nice People – I have grown so much spiritually and the people on campus are very nice and caring.
College Senior,5,"Upperclassmen Girls' Housing Is Fantastic – A lot of the girls live in the main dorm all through undergrad -- three floors, four halls, no elevator, communal showers, and only a microwave allowed. I live in the upperclassmen apartments on campus and love it; we have a kitchenette, four separate bedrooms to an apartment, and one bathroom per two bedrooms. It's very quiet and being able to cook is fantastic. There's not as many places to hang out, though, and definitely not as much social scene as the main dorm. If you'd rather study and do well than hang out a lot, the cost of the apartments (charged just like on-campus housing, not monthly, all utilities paid) is definitely worth the expense."
College Senior,5,"They'll Help You Find Ways to Make School Possible – Financial aid is very helpful and getting loans was not as much of a hassle as I thought it would be. If there's a large enrollment of masters' students, they may get backed up, so take care of your financial aid as early as you can. You can talk with someone about your financial aid situation on a walk-in basis.  In my experience, financial aid will do all they can to make it possible for you to go to school here, but it is very helpful if you already have a good idea of what you need to do before registration. A very high percentage of students on campus receive financial aid."
Senior,4,"I initially attended LC to play golf, I played all four years and had a great time. The team might have not been the best, but the teammates I had, I will be friends with them forever. The curriculum was tough, I graduated in Business. My degree was basically a dual major but in one degree. I graduated with in Business Administration with specializations in management and marketing. I do wish that the president would put more money towards the programs to help get more teachers or even give the teachers more options as to how to teach or be active within the class. The school does tend to make budget cuts often, most likely due to the amount of scholarships that they give people to attend. With all that said, it is a private school so they do care about you being there and the teachers will help you to succeed, but it will be difficult."
Sophomore,4,The school is great! I love the people at Louisiana College. The only issue I have is the dorm rooms but that’s getting fixed this summer.
Freshman,4,The classes was small and the teachers helped me  a lot. It was easy for me to get tutoring in any subject I needed help with plus the environment on camps is relaxing when it is not cold.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Louisiana College is a safe, warm environment with friendly people everywhere! I would recommend this college to those that could afford it. I subtracted 1 star because the school is quite expensive, and the offices and admin can be slightly disorganized at times but they are doing their best with so many students on such a small campus."
Junior,4,I love the college it is great for spiritual growth and the education is one of the best. I love the environment of the school and the most helpful students and teachers. It creates unforgettable memories and friendships.
Freshman,4,I like how I am at a school where I know the professors care about me. I love that while attending Louisiana College I can get my education and grow closer to God!
Freshman,4,The campus is very small compared to other schools but it has a very warm and welcoming environment.
Junior,4,"I believe that LC is a pretty great school since new administrator stepped in. Good changes are being made, and we're hoping for more. Please stop painting everything orange and blue though...the benches and swings already look beautiful as wood."
College Freshman,4,"I appreciate the smaller classroom sizes, I feel like it gives students the ability to really get to know our professors and vice versa. Our classes aren't short, but they aren't too long where people start getting tired of listening. There are many interesting courses offered and a wide variety of talented, committed professors. The classes aren't incredibly heavy on work loads, but they definitely aren't ones where you can goof off and still get a good grade."
College Freshman,4,"I never feel threatened or unsafe on campus. I've never heard of any violence happening whatsoever, especially none involving sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,"I love where I dorm. It isn't the best, there are definite faults, but overall I really enjoy living in Cottingham!"
College Junior,4,My value of a degree from Louisiana College would be an honor.  In my opinion it's one of the best and hardest colleges in Louisiana.  The teachers are very helpful in helping me with job interviews and future job options.
College Junior,4,"The sports and athletes at my school always support one another.  I played softball at my school and the football, baseball, basketball and tennis teams came to every game and supported us from start to finish.  We did the same for other sports.  It is one of the best atmospheres."
College Junior,4,"It is a great Christian atmosphere, and that is what I love the most.  The faculty and staff are very helpful and always willing to work with you.  My favorite thing about school is how close everyone is; I love going to chapel and worshipping our heavenly Father."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of my professors are great.  However, there are a few that I feel like did not present their teaching well.  test did not correspond with the subject matter"
College Sophomore,4,"For most sports, student involvement is good.  Football and baseball are by far the favorite of all sports on campus."
College Freshman,4,Security on campus is above adequate. There is little to no sexual assault or even assault in general. I personally believe that this is due to the restriction of alcohol and tobacco on campus.
College Freshman,4,"The career services on campus are wonderful. There are many successful alumni of Lousiana College, a completing high honors in their respective fields. The nursing pass rate of the BESI is 93%. The education here is high quality and extremely challenging. Often times, education majors have jobs offers before they ever graduate."
College Freshman,4,"There is a very wide variety of courses with highly qualified professors. The classes are fairly small which makes it easier to be more personal with your professors, getting help more frequently. The professors are always willing to help."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is awesome! It makes going to class much easier, especially at 8 AM. It's fun being so close to all your friends, and not having to drive to their houses. It's also much cheaper than living in an apartment."
College Freshman,4,"I love the athletics here, as well as the facilities. The coaches are Godly people who guide the athletes in the direction of the Lord. The sporting events are very fun to attend and the student body is completely supportive of the teams."
College Freshman,4,The school is great the professors know they're fields & are very passionate about their careers & are very helpful with any courses you are taking.
College Freshman,4,I like my school and think that i fit in very well.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoyed being close to my friends all day every day. It's easier to get to classes, and I enjoy the atmosphere during the school day and at night in the dorms."
College Junior,4,the people on campus are great to know and they are friendly.
College Junior,4,It is like a small town no one messes with any one.
College Junior,4,I love my major. the work is hard and challenging but still good.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is secure it is very small so not much could really happen without people knowing about it.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus at Louisiana College is great. Especially if students like to be in a small community. The school isn't to big nor to small and lets the students stay focused with there studies. Louisiana College also has a great student union (The Student Center) where any student can find tons of help for their preferred major. The students can also find a burger shack (The Grille), a coffee shop (Java City), post office, bookstore, nurse and the game room. This is the most popular place to hang out if living on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,Parking on campus is not a huge deal. Next to every building on the campus there is a parking lot next to it. If anything that is to look out for is the parking lot by the English Village apartments. It is made of dirt and gravel.
College Junior,4,The atmosphere is nice and most students know each other.  There is a mall and parks to go to.  There is also a movie theatre.
College Junior,4,"As a private school, they give a lot of financial aid to students.  Most of the time everything goes smoothly."
College Junior,4,"The Pre-Med Department at school is fantastic! Professors have an ""open-door"" policy and are always there to help! The curriculum is very challenging but they are certainly preparing students for the future."
College Sophomore,4,Seems Good – I have not had an internship yet but my friends that are older have and they seem to be getting along fine with it. I do know if you are in education you have a great hook up for student teaching and a great portal is opened there. Overall it is good.
College Sophomore,4,"Easy Access – If you need to use a computer on campus, they are very easy to access. The only problem with the computers in the library is they are on the top floor and the printer is on the bottom. And the. You have to pay for each page, so it's just a little pain. But they all have Microsoft Word installed for all the needs you may have as far as school work goes."
College Freshman,4,sometimes heavy rains come for several hours but in average the weather here is beautiful.
College Freshman,4,Rarely have days that it gets cold enough to snow but when we did have ice class was cancelled. The campus looks beautiful with its covering of pine trees everywhere especially in spring. The pollin is bad for a lot of people's allergies though.
College Freshman,4,"Safe and Secure – Louisiana College is relatively small and secure.  The campus security is always present and people are always traveling in the area.I feel safe on campus, because of the home-bound security."
College Junior,4,Secure and Lots of Limits – I felt safe always at LC. The security is 24 hour and always riding around. LC has a small campus so crime is no issue. The dorm doors are locked at midnight every night so that a member of the opposite sex cant sneak in. Pineville has a very low crime rate. Small baptist town in central louisiana.
College Junior,4,"Professors Are Always Availiable and Work With You. Being a psych major has its benefits at LC. The teachers are hands on, and some own their own practice. The faculty is always available during the week. Pretty standard work load with classes like abnormal psychology and developmental psychology. Louisiana College is a religious school so there is a psychology in religion class offered. The curriculum makes it easy to juggle the psych major and any minor of your choosing. The classes are a little cramped but at LC you are more than just a number."
College Sophomore,4,"Small school, great atmosphere, great family-like campus!"
College Sophomore,4,"The weather is usually pretty great. It gets pretty warm in the spring and summer, and doesn't get too cold in the winter. It doesn't really rain or storm alot either, but if it does definately wear your rainboots because the sidewalks are terrible!"
College Junior,4,Sports Are Growing and Great – The sports at LC are on the rise. Our winning football team continues to grow and welcome recruits. Our ladies softball and basketball is the best in the country in their division. Areas lacking is soccer and some school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,"Why My School Is Unique – the teachers here are very nice. they truly care about their students and even call them to make sure they are okay. they truly want you to succeed. the campus has a very good atmosphere. the programs are great, and everyone is kind for the most part"
College Freshman,4,"Quite, Small Town, Great People – Pineville is a small town across the river from a somewhat larger city.  The atmosphere here is great. There is plenty to do and its close to home."
College Freshman,4,Profs Really a Care About What We Think – I'm attending Louisiana College. My professors are great.  They really listen to what we have to say and our ideas to make our department better.  As a student I have been a part of major changes to my department.
College Freshman,4,Game Room – Game room is pretty much the only thing to do at night around campus
College Junior,4,"Rain, Rain, Rain – It rains a lot here, but it doesn't really deter us from class very often. There are a few spots on campus that can get pretty swamped, but they're easily avoidable. We just slip on our rain boots and go. The only silly weather thing is ""snow."" We have had several ""snow days"" in the past year and it's kind of ridiculous because we never get more than two inches and it always melts a couple hours after the sun comes up. I mean, it's kinda cool for class to get cancelled, but it's not cool when our teachers change our syllabus to compensate."
College Senior,4,"Pretty Good. Even if I don't like what's being served, there's always other food to grab, and I usually do like what's being served, so no problem! The cooking staff is great."
College Freshman,4,"Go Campus Life and Science! I feel like campus life is above average. The atmosphere is really positive. What keeps me here is the amazing science department. It is by far the best in the state. It is tough, but I know I will have no problem getting into to a graduate school and will be overly prepared."
College Freshman,4,"Good Campus Security – We have the occasional vandalized car, but I would say I feel pretty safe."
College Sophomore,4,Its Always Fun – this campus is always fun. even though there is not much to do in pineville we still have fun
College Freshman,4,"Biology Major – I absolutely love my professors. They are very nice and will meet with you anytime you need help on a certain subject. My school has a very good science program, so the classes are hard. But I know they will pay off in the long run."
College Freshman,4,"I was eligible for work study, so I had no real financial aid problems to deal with. They do offer a plan where you can pay your tuition monthly instead of in one huge sum and that is very helpful!"
College Freshman,4,Guys and Girls Have Manners – The people here are so nice. I never have to open a door for myself because the other students are courteous and will hold the door open for me. I get greeted every morning with a smile and a good morning from people I don't even know!
College Senior,4,This part of the nation hardly ever experiences school closures and the accessibility of the dorms makes it easy to get around campus during the cold or rain.
College Sophomore,4,"Great for the Size of the Town. Restaurants, fast and slow food, are abundant in the area. Every common fast food chain is represented, from Sonic to Arby's to DQ. There is also a surprising number of sit-down restaurants. Italian, Chinese, Japanese, American, BBQ, etc. Nobody gives student discounts, but prices aren't bad. Check out Atwood's Bakery on McArthur. It's a great little spot for lunch, coffee, or sweets."
College Sophomore,4,"Acceptance With Moral Standards – As a Baptist College, LC officially accepts any identities and beliefs that are not considered immoral. There is reasonable ethnic diversity in the student body, including many foreign students. Individuals from all social classes fit comfortably into the social scene. The majority of the students and professors are Republican, Christian, and Baptist; however, freedom of expression regarding political and religious beliefs is protected. Homosexuality is considered sinful by the college, and students can be expelled from the college for practicing homosexual behavior in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"New student's experience – So far I have really enjoyed school.  The first semester took some getting used to, but that's with any adjustment from high school.  The professors here are great.  Most of them really want to work with you to help you achieve.  The facilities are not amazing, but the atmosphere is inviting."
College Freshman,4,"We have racial diversity when it comes to athletics.  Most of the basketball team is African American, whereas most of the soccer team is white with a couple hispanics and one Indian.  Our school is accepting of all the races, even though it is a little biased as far as religious views go because it is a Baptist College.  But many of the professors are Calvinist.  Either way, the school is tolerant of different religions, but the students that come here that are not Baptist have to be aware that this is a Private Baptist College, therefore everything is mainly geared towards Baptists."
Graduate Student,2,Professors were rude when miscommunications arose. I was not satisfied with my online learning experience during the TEACH program. Coursework was relatively easy to understand and self-explanatory; however I was not pleased with how one of the professors spoke to me via email when I needed clarification for something.
Graduate Student,2,"I attended Louisiana College for the TEACH Program, a graduate level teaching certification program. While enrolled, the staff was often rude when I had questions. I struggled in the program as a first year teacher and the advisors were not supportive at all, at times were very rude to me via email, and all but told me I was not competent to be an educator. I ended up dropping out of the program and enrolling in a different one that has been a much better experience. I personally had a horrible experience going through this program and would not recommend it to anyone that does not have prior teaching experience."
College Sophomore,2,The School gives you good scholarships but the school is still very expensive
College Junior,2,"I havent had a tour of the campus yet, so i cant comment on that either"
College Junior,2,I am still dealing with it so i cant really comment on it yet.
College Junior,2,it just depends on the day of the week. its kind of hit and miss.
College Sophomore,2,"All teams are average, with many intramural programs. The coaches are sub-par."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty Nasty Stuff – Overall the food is not very good. The servers are slow and there is not much variety. Weekends are the worse. I'd rather not eat on campus at all. The hours of the cafeteria are not good either. Closing at 5:30 on the weekends? Really? Horrible.
College Freshman,2,"Mostly Good but Repetitive – Most of the time the food is okay but it has no flavor and the same thing gets old after awhile, needs more variety,"
College Freshman,2,"There's not a variety of place to choose from when attending Louisiana College.  Hattie B's serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner to students living on campus and Grille Works in the student center is also available.  If anything I'd prefer to eat off campus, the food may get old after awhile."
College Sophomore,2,You have to be 21 or a living with your parents if you want to live ff campus. Parking on campus is atrocious and a nightmare. Cost of dorms doesnt live up to what it should be.
College Junior,2,Close to School – There is not a lot of options for off campus housing. But the apartments that are nearby are relatively cheap and close to the school.
College Sophomore,2,I have only used the computers located in the library. The computers in there are so slow! You would think you're back in the dark ages. I hate them!
College Freshman,2,"Not a Very Bumpin' Town – There's not too much to do off campus. Thankfully there is plenty happening on campus. We usually hit the movies on Tuesdays. Other than that, we pretty much go to Walmart when things get boring."
College Senior,2,"We Need More Activities – Night life could really be improved. We have some organizations, gatherings, and events every so often, but the interest level is generally low. It is also hard for commuters to go to the events at night and it would be nice if more mandatory events could be scheduled earlier and more fun events scheduled more often. People generally have to carpool or go together somewhere off campus because the local area is not well diverse for fun activities."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Life – It is really expensive to live on campus. The dorms are not the best and it could be better for the cost of the school. The social atmosphere is ok. The cost of the school to me is too much for the quality of the food we get in the cafe, the dorm, etc."
College Senior,2,"Places to eat: Po-Boy Express, Los Portales, Chili's, IHOP, Applebees, Logans, Cracker Barrel, Outback, Copelands, Johnny Carinos, Ryans, Cajun Landing, Huddle House, Fast food restaurants
None really offer student discounts, Kalideoscoops (and ice cream shop) offers a 10% discount with Student ID"
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Quarters – The dorms and apartments are in need of improvement, but the atmosphere is quite pleasant."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing Special – Unique ... well, this is the first day in the last week that the internet has worked."
College Freshman,2,"Too Slow – The computer lab at school is great.  It has plenty of up to date computers.  Sadly, this does no good because the network is EXTREMELY slow.  The internet takes forever to use and is frequently down.  Also, there is no wireless access and IT is never available."
College Sophomore,1,"I am  just glad that the year is over and I have moved my daugther to another college.  As a Christian Mom, this was a financial mistake to attend,  Many classes she was required to take for her major are of no use, and it is anything but a Christian atmosphere.   I know there are good people on the campus and true Christians, but nothing like I thought it would be.    Looking forward to a new year in a new place."
College Sophomore,1,They have failed their health inspection two years in a row.
College Sophomore,1,"The off-campus housing is horrendous. Many students I know have to pay exorbitant rent, for low-quality housing. That said, most of the on campus housing is not much better. In the small town of Pineville, many student have to look into apartment complexes that are 30+ minutes away from the school."
College Sophomore,1,Louisiana College is a small college so everyone knows everyone.  Most guys and girls that go there play sports.
College Senior,1,Greek is only taught in classes for Biblical scholars majors!!!
College Sophomore,1,"There is only a few greek clubs that i know of only because i attended a academic fair. otherwise, i never see any evidence of greek clubs at my school"
College Junior,1,Doesn't Exist – There is none that I'm aware of.
College Sophomore,1,"LC is not that much diverse. There are different races, but the only reason some of the races are here is because of sports."
College Senior,1,"What Greek life? LC had a couple of sororities/fraternities, but none of them are active any more. There is no Greek housing."
College Sophomore,1,the dorms are really old and outdated. they are always needing maintanence and it is a big reason why people don't come here
College Sophomore,1,"Tudor Hall – It is understandable that the students have to pay a large price for the college because it is a private institution, but when the college gets desperate and recruits people who could not give a rip about the college mission and are only here to play a sport and get laid, the dorms end up reflecting the character of the people who live in it.  Tudor Hall's standards are very unacceptable at this point because of the nasty people doing nasty things to the building.  One cleaning lady had to ask for a transfer to a different dorm building because it was too much for her.  The only reason it isn't rated an F is because there are a few good young men who have stepped up to take the challenge of making the dorm a better place."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Unless You're Over 21 or Married – The college does not allow students to live off campus unless they are over 21 or are married. Reasonably priced houses or appartments are available for students in either of those categories. The school does not provide help with finding off campus housing, but any individual member of the faculty would probably be willing to help a student find housing."
College Sophomore,1,"Wow...it's like a war zone – The parking lots here look like the streets of Berlin in 1945. Maintenance will patch them once somebody blows out the suspension in their cars... but they use Quick-rete, so the potholes reappear once a bus or truck drives over them."
College Sophomore,1,"There is NOTHING to do around here, except go to Wal-Mart. There is only one bar within 50 miles, and on campus there is nothing but occasional recitals and intramural sports."
College Freshman,1,There is one soroity on campus but no one ever hears anything about it.
College Freshman,1,"Dining Possibilities – Louisiana College has next to no dining possibilities. The cafeteria has 5 dining options, but not only are there no healthy options, but the cafeteria is only open for two and half hours for each meal. Monday through Thursday it closes for the day at 7:00 p.m. On Fridays it closes at 6:00 p.m., and on the weekends it is only open 11:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. As a working college student, lunch Monday through Thursday is generally the only meal that I have an opportunity to eat in there. There is also a place called The Den. The Den is a fast-food restaurant located in the Student Center. It is open until 10:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, but closes at 6:00 p.m. on Friday and does not reopen until 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The Den also costs money, and it is not included in the $1200 meal plan unless you add $50, $75, or $125 Cat Cash."
College Freshman,1,I'm not sure that LC even has any Greek life. It would be a surprise to me.
College Senior,1,"Internet Problems – The internet at Louisiana College is horrible. Our bandwidth is slower than dial-up. We cannot access the wireless internet that is installed on campus. They have put alot of money into the internet, but they have not finished the project that they started."
College Sophomore,1,Very limited choices. And they stole our trays to save money but didn't lower prices any.
College Freshman,1,Too Strictness and Like to Get Money – there a lot of rule at school. The door have to be open if a guy in the girl roo and there a fine if you feed the animal which is 50 buck. but if you hit some one it 25. And if you miss a dorm meetin it 25 bucks. the school is all about getting money.

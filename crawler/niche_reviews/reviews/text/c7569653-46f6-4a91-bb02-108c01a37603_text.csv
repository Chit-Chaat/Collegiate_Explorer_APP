Even if my grade is a 100% my professors will write a sentence or two on why I received that grade. They don't just give check marks, they are intentional about making me a better student and encouraging me. Each course lasts 5 weeks which is helpful for me to be able to focus on one class at a time. The classes are challenging yet doable."
Senior,4,"I plan to attend OCU this coming fall and I have visited the college several times. My experience with staying overnight really made me excited about attending school here. The staff and students are amazing and the atmosphere is friendly and it feels good to be around others, who are Christians and love Jesus as much as I do."

Niche User,4,"Through dual enrollment, I have taken four courses through Ohio Christian University. The courses were well taught, and had a reasonable work load. I've had a little bit of trouble with some of the professors (not answering emails or reviewing my papers on time). Additionally, their online tests do not always work right. However, I have loved the experience so far. Even with the minor issues, I've decided to major there in 2019. Visiting the campus really sealed the deal. The staff are so nice and helpful. The campus is beautiful and extremely safe. They offer quality education for a reasonable price. Also, their scholarships will be of great aid to myself."
Senior,4,"Depending on your major, OCU can offer either a satisfactory or challenging path to complete your degree.  I entered OCU to earn a degree in English. Unfortunately, the degree is so new that the elective selection is poor while senior standard classes need further development and better organization. For example, in the last three weeks of my Senior Capatone class the instructor disappeared and the weekly handouts were incomplete.  With that said, it’s imperative that potential students ensure that their majors have been established at OCU before enrolling.  On the bright side, in classes where the instructors and materials are prepared the classes run smoothly."
Sophomore,4,Very helpful advisers. Fast pace. The professors are fairly easy and can work with you. The school is expensive.
Sophomore,4,I've had a good experience at Ohio Christian University so far. The professors are some of the most caring people around and they care about their students.
Niche User,4,Ohio Christian University is very close-knit. I like how small it is. The people are very nice there.
Freshman,4,"It was a dream of mine to attend OCU. Now that I am a student, they have not let me down. The staff and professors have been incredibly friendly and extremely helpful. I am maintaining a 4.0 GPA and I know it has a lot to do with the quality of education I am receiving. 

I am very grateful for the opportunity to pursue my dreams, I know that a top-notch education is imperative and I believe I am receiving one. I have had a few annoyances including some slow responses from one or two of my professors and a few other minor communication issues that I've experienced while attending OCU."
Freshman,4,Ohio Christian University staff was very attentive to my needs. Helped me to get enrolled quickly and easily.  The instructors are very friendly and informative with assignments. The tuition is also very adorable.
Freshman,4,I am still in Ohio Christian University.  I really like it so far because of the way they take Christian values and teach you how to apply them in your everyday life no matter where you are or what kind of religion someone else believes.  I don't know what I would change.  The teacher I have so far is awesome!!!
Sophomore,4,"I have had a wonderful powerful and spiritual learning experience! I've learned so much already about Christianity and the bible. I have learned excellent life skills such as financial freedom, Christian time management and so much more that I was never taught in my 22 years of living. The only negative aspect of OCU is the financial aid. The couple semesters I've been here it has been a hassle getting my financial aid situated. That is the only very thing I would love to change or improve in their system."
Niche User,4,I'm so excited to start my 2017-2018 year here!!!!! I am looking forward to the God changing experiences.
Freshman,4,I wouldn't change anything about OCU.  This is an excellent school that I would recommend to everyone.  They have excellent curriculum and the instructors are great.  They offer a great selection of degree offerings and they truly care about the student.

College Junior,4,Value is excellent. The school has a good reputation. Career prospects are good   The quality of the graduates are definitely above average
College Senior,4,"I chose the AGS program because I was able to attend school in the evenings after work. After I had children I was able to start taking classes online so that I could have more time at home with them. The transition was very easy, the advisers make things so easy. I wouldn't have been able to attend a traditional college at this point in my life because of work and family. The thing I like most about OCU is that biblical principals are incorporated in every topic."
College Senior,4,There are several academic options at OCU. I am a transfer student so I was impressed that they received ALL of  my previous hours from two different schools.
College Sophomore,4,"Enrolling in my school was an easy process. I had an advisor contact me through text messages since I work through the day and can't talk on the phone. Anytime I needed help with the process he was available to help. I work in the substance abuse field, and I have a history of drug addiction as well. Since I've started my classes, it has helped me communicate with the clients better and I'm working towards a degree in the field of study that is already a huge part of my life. I'm also receiving an education in scripture, which I love. The discussion board allows me to communicate with the other students in class, and I've been taught how to effectively communicate with my peers as well as staff. My instructor is easy to reach if I have an issue with an assignment, and she compliments the work I do weekly. Overall, I'm extremely happy with choosing this school and I would choose it again if given the chance."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a new college student as an adult, applying for the online courses were so easy. Everyone that has helped me form the very beginning did everything I needed. I do not attend on campus, so all my knowledge for online courses."
College Freshman,4,There is plenty of professors and study places and help sessions for certain classes and some classes help with certain assignments. Porfessors also help answer any question you may have with an exam or test or paper you have taken.
College Freshman,4,The security on campus is very good. There are many security guys and some students who work in the security office that walk around campus making sure everything is fine and nothing suspicious is going on. plus there is police car from the circleville police station always on campus. In the security room is many cameras monitoring entrances to some buildings and at night security makes sure to lock doors to all buildings on campus.
College Freshman,4,They have many chances for career days and alumni opportunities and career service classes to help you get ready for future job interviews and helpful tips on writing a professional resume for jobs.
College Freshman,4,The best thing I love about Ohio Christian University is that it's so small of a community that my professors are not only scholars teaching a class but are good christian people that want very much to help you succeed and leave with a bright hope and chance for your future. There are some students that dislike certain professors or classes but from what I've experienced so far is a great way for those who want to excel in their field and have a professor or student/friend helping guide or encourage you towards your goal in god's plan.

College Junior,4,"I live in a suite with one other roommate. We share a bathroom with two other girls so it is very easy for all of us. The cost is high, but college costs are usually high. Most people are very kind and will always talk to you, if they no you or not. We have a very friendly atmosphere!"
College Junior,4,"The financial aid office has helped me out a lot! They stay on top of things like calling when a payment is due that I may have forgotten about. However, I am still working with them to get more financial aid that I will need to finish school."

Recent Alumnus,4,"Good selection of local restaurants, nearby shopping & social/community activities despite the small size of the town."
College Junior,4,Sports is an important part of campus life. I play on the basketball team and being involved with that consumes a lot of my time.
Freshman,2,"ONLINE learning.   

They have professors all over the country that are working not just for OCU but many other colleges, to the point they get confused as to what systems OCU uses. There is little interaction on anything, I find the course work far more difficult than the last college I attended.

The STUDENT LOANS rules they have in place is where they truly plummet to the worst of the worst.  Many of us attending college get student loans to not only pay for school, but also room & board, so that we can take on a full load and still pay for rent/utilities/food etc.   This school receives YOUR MONEY, and then SITS ON IT for 2.5 months.  They WILL NOT release YOUR MONEY until you get through 2 months worth of courses.  Which completely defeats the purpose of the loans to begin with and makes it untenable for ANY student relying on these loans for room & board.  A cruel, really poorly thought out system, which frankly I find despicable especially coming from a Christian university."
Senior,2,I am in my last three classes before graduation  which I should have already  have finished  but they  did not  alert me of what was going on even after I  would  call and ask question I was told I had enough money and I did not.  I have finish my capstone classes and paid for graduation  so disappointed with this school 
Recent Alumnus,2,"Athletes are given top priority and preferential treatment, other students are 'left out in the cold' by administration."
College Junior,2,I use my own computer due to my late study schedule. Others are not available when I need them.
College Junior,2,Not really any provided other than to ball games. Students have to provide their own transportation.
College Sophomore,2,Old and out dated windows computers.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very simple, and we are not challenged very much."
College Sophomore,2,They don't off any scholarships. That is why I am looking for scholarships and grants.
College Junior,2,I constantly am on their case.
College Sophomore,2,"The computers on campus are not the best. I am more in to Macs, but all of the computers on campus are PCs. Being a mac user, it is difficult to adjust to when having to use the school provided computers."
College Sophomore,2,As a freshman its inevitable. You will have parking problems. It gets better every year but there is very limited space so definately plan on parking early if youre a commuter.
College Junior,2,"For being such a small school I think our diversity is alright, but honestly sometimes I wish there were more of a variety of people to interact with."
College Student,2,Circleville Pumpkin Show – There isnt a whole lot to do. the circleville pumpkin show that happens once a year is about it. I mean there are bowling alleys and fast food but nothing else.
College Student,2,"Not Raeally Much That Here – I do not live on campus, but for all I know, there isn't much of that going on here."
College Freshman,2,There needs to be more computers and better acess to them.
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek life here at OCU. It's a smaller campus so it is not needed or demanded by the student body
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do off campus when it gets dark out.
College Sophomore,1,This is a Christian University.

College Junior,1,"Once-weekly transportation to Wal-mart is provided. For anything else, you're on your own."
College Sophomore,1,"Clubbing, drinking, partying, sex, smoking, and other drugs are illegal on campus or off. If you get caught, they kick you out and don't refund your money."
College Sophomore,1,Campus Food – the cafeteria and cafe are the only places to eat ON campus. The food is so so depending on the meal.
College Sophomore,1,You Provide Your Own. If you do not have a car you have to find someone who does to take you anywhere off campus. If you do have a car you have to use your own. If you live on the off campus guys dorm the school gives you a $100 gas card to last you all semester...you usually run out mid way through the semester
College Sophomore,1,"Frats and Sororities Aren't Allowed on Campus. OCU is a dry, sex, party, drug free campus. They don't have Frats or sororities."

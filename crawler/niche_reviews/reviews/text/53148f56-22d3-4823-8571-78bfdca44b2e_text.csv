Junior,5,Xavier is absolutely amazing. It is the perfect size that when you walk around the campus you will at least see one person you know but also still not know many people. The average class size is 20 people so the professors know you and get to know you personally. You also get all the Big East D1 sports and hype. If you were looking for a sign to come here- This is it.
Junior,5,The professors have been super good and accommodating. A lot of our classes are hybrid and in-person still.
Niche User,5,So far the online learning experience has been great with few errors. I would say that the university is doing it's best in light of the Corona Virus.
Niche User,5,I've found all staff and professors to be at the top of there game when it comes to student learning and outcomes.
Alum,5,My experience at Xavier was wonderful! All of my professors were helpful and seemed genuinely interested in my education. I never met a bad student! All of my peers were down to earth and happy to be there

Freshman,5,"During my time at Xavier University, I've gained new friendships, connections, and support. I loved the orientation process, which was throughout four days. Small group leaders showed us around the campus, talked to us about diversity, gender identity, sexuality, sex signals, and more topics. The professors are very nice and easy to ask questions to. Xavier prides itself on equality, and is true to their motto: All for One, One for All."
Alum,5,The administration is there to support you through whatever you need. Counselors are available for free if needed. There is support on all levels at this school.
Junior,5,Xavier University is a gem of a school. When I decided to go here I had just had a bad experience trying to find a school and Xavier welcomed me with open arms. I will always push family and friends to attend this university as it has provided me with the skills to survive in the real world I know they will do the same for anyone and everyone else the attends.
Graduate Student,5,"The admission process is awesome, the staff is so up to par,  Very helpful staff. The accelerated program allows students to achieve their goals in lesser time. The program is expensive, but if you take into account the amount of money and time you save with education, you actually save money in long term."
Niche User,5,"I loved the beautiful campus, the size, the food, and the atmosphere felt like somewhere I would love to be during college. They have a vibrant campus life and many great majors to choose from."
Niche User,5,"Xavier University has been the perfect fit for me as an adult returning for a second Bachelors Degree. The admission counselor was so helpful in guiding me through all of the steps to make sure everything was in order before I began. Since starting the program I have had help from professors, guidance counselors, and even a life coach to ensure all of my needs are met in order to have a successful education here at Xavier University!"
Niche User,5,Xavier University is a beautiful campus from the inside and out. It is very student success oriented and staff members are really helpful and kind to newcomers.
Freshman,5,I love Xavier. It is a very tight community. All the people here are very happy and loving and it is very lively on campus. I really enjoy being here and having many people surrounding me with positivity.
Freshman,5,I love xavier so far! It is so much fun. The campus is so nice and very safy. Everyone is super welcoming and the activities on campus are so fun. The professors are all great and very smart. I have not had a bad class  so far and I have met so many great people. The area is not great but it isn't too hard to find something to do.
Freshman,5,I have not yet started at this university but from my research and speaking with all of my advisers I am certain to gain a great experience while attending Xavier University.
Graduate Student,5,"They have the major I want, the campus is beautiful, even though it’s 80% catholic the people their is nice. They have nice programs, they have sports events and it’s my dream college."
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school! As with all universities, you get out what you put in. Because it is a smaller school with a smaller party scene, you have to put yourself out there to make friends. But, there are a ton of amazing clubs and organizations, and the University focuses a lot on inclusion. The small class size is amazing, and the business professors especially are incredibly well qualified."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent curriculum, nice dorms, good student life, close to downtown Cincinnati where there is a lot of culture."
Freshman,5,"Xavier is a wonderful school. First, the campus may be small but it gives a homey feel. The campus is beautiful and the landscaping is always blossoming. Next, most of the classes are a fairly short walk, making that dreadful walk in the cold a little more bearable. To continue, the student life is very accepting of everyone and people are always there to support you. Xavier puts on many events throughout the school year that connects you with other students and pairs your with life long friends."
Freshman,5,Xavier is a very inclusive campus that has everything you could possibly want. The smaller population is fantastic and makes you feel like you are really a part of a community. The school spirit is like no other-- basketball makes us crazy-- and there are just so many opportunities to find where you belong. The small classes are great and you really feel like your professors care about you.
Niche User,5,"The community is warm and tight-knit, the campus is beautiful. I haven't committed to the university due to financial concerns, but I already feel as though I'm part of the family."
Freshman,5,"Amazing college, small yet in a great location. I have never felt unsafe while  ion campus, everyone is super friendly. The professors, for the most part are amazing. I could not have made a better decision on where to spend the next four years of my life while in school."
Alum,5,"Amazing school, tight knit community, great professors, beautiful campus, awesome basketball team. Loved everything about my experience at Xavier."
Junior,5,"Everyone was so inviting and made you feel like you belonged. The food is always delicious with tons of options every day. They change up the food all the time, so you never get bored with what you are eating. They have multiple different activities set up by the Resident Assistants to keep the students involved in the school from a spa day to make ice cream sundaes. The dorms are incredibly clean with a great deal of storage, the dorms are pretty big as well and always cleaned."
Junior,5,Xavier is an outstanding school with so many great opportunities. I chose Xavier due to family like aspect of staff and other students. The campus is gorgeous and and always expanding making it better for all students. I feel very safe when walking around campus especially as a female.
Senior,5,"Xavier is an incredibly good school with all sorts of benefits. I wouldn't trade my education there for anything, but I will go into the pros and cons. If you are someone who knows what you want to do (aka have a passion) find a school that has more resources than Xavier. XU is a private institution meaning it has a little bit of everything, but for instance STEM resources are poor. The personality and the people here are what separates this school from others. The one-on-one connection I have with professors have opened so many opportunities and my friends I will keep for life."
Sophomore,5,"One of the major reasons I chose to attend Xavier was because class sizes are small. I am an auditory learner and have had great experience learning at Xavier. Teachers are able to give quality instruction and dedicate more time to teaching. Teachers want to see us succeed at Xavier and being in a small class allows me to collaborate with my peers better.  Another reason I rate it excellent is because when I have had questions, insecurities about my classes or time management counselors have been available to help  with my needs at anytime.  No appointment needed. I feel safe and have met many students I can call friends and will be life long friends."
Freshman,5,"I attended Xavier University’s Destination X program and the entire experience gave me gave me some peace of mind when it came to attending a PWI. As for attending as of today I haven’t even started classes so I will unfortunately be unable to share my experience as a full time student at Xavier at this time. However, I will say that during the college selection process Xavier stood out the most to me because of how engaging they were which really made me feel wanted as an individual. I will be starting classes in Fall 2019 and I can’t wait to start!!!"
Freshman,5,"Xavier is a place that no matter who you are you will fit in, meet new friends, and try new things to have the best college experience that you can imagine."
Sophomore,5,"Xavier University in Ohio is an amazing and diverse college located in Ohio.  I am in my first year at Xavier and I can't rav enough about it.  I have 3 counselors assigned to me that help me with registering for courses, help me keep on track, and provide career counseling.  The atmosphere is a close community and the basketball team is outstanding!  We have a saying at Xavier, ""one for all and all for one."" We are Xavier and we believe in giving back to the community.  I am in the business school and there are so many opportunities for me and the professors go by a first name basis. Student life is booming, the sports facilities are top notch with a new HUB center opening this fall. Campus is safe, dorms are great, and food is outstanding!"
Sophomore,5,I loved the welcoming atmosphere at Xavier. I felt like part of the community after my first week being on campus. I got involved with sports and clubs which helped me build meaningful relationships.
Senior,5,It has been great to be able to take a class that are fun and allow me to grow as a student. The class sizes are small and teachers are fun to learn from.
Sophomore,5,"Xavier University is a school that is very far from home for me. I grew up in a small surf town in the Bay Area in California. Xavier immediately felt like home after the first few days of attending the school. Everyone is friendly, driven, and has fun. The professors are outstanding and care about their students. Class sizes are small, so you get a more intimate relationship with each professor. They learn a lot about you and gear the class towards the strengths of each and every student. Xavier has amazing recreational sports teams, clubs, and an awesome cafeteria in comparison to most colleges. There are lots of places to study and focus on your education while getting the full ""college experience."""
Sophomore,5,Really enjoying my time at X. From the basketball games to the amazing professors I wouldnt want to be anywhere else.
Senior,5,"I love being a student at Xavier University, mostly for educational purposes. The school does a great job at hiring professors that have real experience and have great connections that get you prepared for life after college. The campus is beautiful and very clean which I love! However, it's not diverse which is one of the things I don't like about it. And if you're looking to party its not really a party school but there are universities nearby with great parties. Overall it is a great school to go to!"
Freshman,5,Manresa orientation is awesome. So helpful meeting new people. The movecrew helped get us situated into the dorms much faster than i thought. The campus is very welcoming
Freshman,5,"Xavier University is a Jesuit university in Cincinnati and Norwood, Ohio. It is the sixth-oldest Catholic and fourth-oldest Jesuit university in the United States. Xavier has an undergraduate enrollment of 4,485 students and graduate enrollment of 2,165. It is primarily an undergraduate, liberal arts institution."
Junior,5,It’s a small school with a good community once you go out and try to meet people. I had a difficult start but the advisors and other teacher try to help. The course work is hard but you have help.
Alum,5,"Nicest people anywhere, the athletes, the artsy people and many in between.  Cincinnati has fun places to go and lots of opportunities. The professors are open minded and help bring out the best in students. I made life long friends there."
Senior,5,I love being a student at Xavier University! Everyone is very nice and friendly. The staff and the professors are very supportive and help you in any way that they can. The students that I attend classes with are really encouraging and we really support one another. Everyone wants everyone else to succeed. The atmosphere here is awesome!
Graduate Student,5,"Xavier is a place of high regard in terms of academics. I have been to every division 1 NCAA school in Ohio and Xavier is by far the most appealing visually, the most elite and their academics are elite"
Freshman,5,Xavier is an amazing place that is truly invested in educating their students inside the classroom and equips their students with the knowledge of how to change the world outside the classroom.
Graduate Student,5,I am really enjoying the courses I am taking to pursue Masters in Clinical Counseling. The professors are great as well.
Niche User,5,I like the feel of the community and the overall campus vibe.  I enjoyed auditing two classes when I spent the weekend there with a current student.  I am currently applying to begin at Xavier fall of 2019 as a freshman.
Alum,5,Xavier is an excellent college. It provides a challenging education while growing you as a whole person. The campus has grown in the past few years with many new buildings and state of the art areas to study and learn.
Freshman,5,"Xavier is a great university... and a great investment in my future.   The move-in and orientation experience was meaningful, memorable and helped ease the transition.  Upperclassmen made us feel welcomed and accepted.   This university cares about the individual and wants each of us to make a difference in our world, now and in the future.   Books are included in the tuition!    There is a pizza ATM.    Need I say more?"
Sophomore,5,Xavier has gave me the opportunity to discover my passions and implement them into my professional purpose.
Niche User,5,"Xavier is such a wonderful place to be! Every time I enter the campus, I feel like I’m home. Cincinnati is the perfect place to find internships, jobs, etc., + it’s home to the wonderful Skyline Chili."
Niche User,5,"Xavier University is a school that's located in my home town of Cincinnati, Ohio. Xavier is known for it's academics, campus life and athletics. As far as I know there's never been any real safety issues. The campus is set inside beautiful surroundings. The school is also very spirited, so enjoying sport activities is a fun and exciting experience. It's also veteran friendly which is a plus, since I'm a disabled veteran."
Graduate Student,5,I have just applied to Xavier. The admission process was exceptional and had great interaction with the department head.
Freshman,5,"such a good experience, so much fun. Made many new friends and had an amazing time. I definitely feel I made the right decision."
Senior,5,Xavier is an amazing school in an amazing g city. I loved it so much that I have returned for a second degree. The campus has expanded beautifully over the years and the atmosphere is welcoming. Teachers are very accessible and there are always things to do on Campus. The sports teams are also amazing and games are fun to attend! There are a lot of resources to help further your academic life and to help prepare for life after college.
Graduate Student,5,"The culture of Xavier is clearly based on moral base and although there are students of many faiths, the general principles of goodness pervade the campus.  Students are friendly and volunteering is an integrated part of student life."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the campus. I am very excited to be attending XU this coming fall. I have many friends that are already on campus and they constantly talk of how much they love it on campus. It seems like a wonderful atmosphere filled with service, community, and great friendships. I cannot wait to pursuit community service activities once I am on campus this fall. I plan on joining the cheer team to cheer on their #4 nationally ranked basketball team."
Freshman,5,The community at Xavier is great. The opportunities are endless and the staff is wonderful. The biggest drawback is the cost of attendance.
Sophomore,5,"I really like the environment around Xavier because I always feel like there is someone to meet on campus. I also like how every day I walk around, I see someone I know. It has a real home-like feel, and I immediately felt like I belonged!"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Xavier University has changed my view of the stereotypical college seen on TV. Xavier is friendly community where everyone engages in student activities like athletics and activities put on by different clubs. Xavier is my home away from home.
Niche User,5,"I am currently a senior in high school and recently went on a visit at Xavier. The campus was absolutely beautiful and all of the students were kind and willing to share about their experiences. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and gave us many personal stories when describing life on campus. There is a perfect combination of academics and athletics, which I feel is what a college should strive to be."
Niche User,5,Xavier was a short but great experience. If I could afford it I would have stayed and even lived on campus to have a better campus life experience.
Freshman,4,"So far, the online classes with Xavier University is sailing smoothly. The professors makes it very clear if their class is hybrid (in person and online), or if it's one or the other. I can hear my professors talk clearly when I'm in a Zoom meeting, and it's easy for me to still follow along. Of course, I focus best when I'm in a classroom, but with times like these, I've learned to adjust and be thankful that technology exists for reasons like these."
Junior,4,"I have loved being at Xavier. The professors have been really amazing in my experience and the community is really strong. Basketball games are super exciting, but if you’re looking for a big football school X is not for you. We take our academics pretty seriously but also know how to have a good time. I truly believe that there is something for everyone at Xavier, and I would not change the friendships I’ve made or the experiences I’ve had."
Junior,4,I think Xavier handled the situation very well. They have let us know what resources are available to us and they personally called each student to see how we were doing and if they could help in any way.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Xavier is a good university. Diversity, safety, food, and housing need to be improved. Campus food is being monopolized by one company despite student protests. The school has a very small international student population. The school boasts that class sizes are small however, classes are about 30 students until you get into higher level classes in junior or senior year. Overall, the school is a classic small, religious university."
Sophomore,4,Xavier University has a great campus and good teachers who want to help you succeed. The cafeteria food isn't great and there aren't a lot of food options. Other than that I give it a 10/10.
Alum,4,"NOt a bad school. Overall, kept lots of people out of trouble because lack of partying/night life. Academics are good and campus is small so it's easy to get everywhere. Very expensive, but gives good scholarships."
Freshman,4,"I love Xavier they really value education, morals , and ethics. Xavier University makes sure that all of there students are trying there best to succeed by providing a 24/7 student center late access to buildings and very flexible office hours provided by the professors. Morally Xavier is great this is a school that practices a lot of helping the community they push student involved actives and the school really wants you to enjoy and have a clear mind abut then university and ethics, Xavier University is a Catholic school but they do not push anything in the students they also provide many other services at the chapel for Jewish persons and Christians. Xavier is a great place to be you will defiantly have a great time here."
Freshman,4,"Xavier University is a very ""homelike"" campus where they focus on inclusion. Each professor that I have met have tried to make me feel welcomed and always try and give a helping hand regardless of what they are doing. Furthermore, my experience has been very positive due to the various opportunities which the university provides me from internships and leisure activities. What I would like to see change is for the school to be a bit more diverse. I would like to see more Africans on campus that are placed in high positions."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about Xavier university is that the faculty actually seem to care about your success. Whether they actually will or not, they at least make you feel like they truly care that you succeed and they’ll do whatever they can to help you in that success.  I also enjoy how beautiful and well kept the campus is, and the food in the caf is very yummy."
Sophomore,4,"I really like that Xavier is a smaller school. Everything is close by and it's great that the classes are small enough to get to know your professor and your classmates. I've really enjoyed most of my classes and my professors as well. It's pretty easy to get involved with student activities and clubs, although it can be hard to get off campus if you don't have a car."
Niche User,4,"When I toured Xavier University, it was everything I had hoped for and more! I have no complaints. It is everything a University should be."
Senior,4,"Overall, Xavier offers a rigorous curriculum that is intellectually stimulating, helping students to gain key critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate themselves effectively. The professors are all very knowledgable and very willing to work with students. The Jesuit identity is evident from the moment you walk on campus, with plenty of service opportunities both on and off campus. The biggest thing to consider right now is the size — the student population is growing, making for more crowded dorms and classrooms and scattering some of the resources. Overall, though, Xavier is a great option."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Xavier thus far has been great ! The professors and students on the campus are very friendly and not afraid to help one another. The campus has a welcoming and home-like feeling to it. What really stood out to me as freshman coming into Xavier was the amount of programs and clubs they had to offer. With a wide-range of programs and clubs almost anyone can find they belong on campus and the help / counsel they need.
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and the people there are so wonderful. Most of the professors are really good. Sometimes I wish there was more fruit variety.
Sophomore,4,"I think the Xavier University has a great and welcoming atmosphere. There is always stuff to do around campus and lots to get involved in. I was a transfer student from a small college with not much to do around the area. So transferring to Xavier (which is located in the big city of Cincinnati) was a great change fro me and gave me a bigger sense of community. Academics can be challenging at this school varied upon your major, but like all colleges it is very manageable! Overall, great experience at Xavier."
Sophomore,4,The community feel of Xavier is one of my favorite things. Everyone is so friendly and you meet so many new people and develop so many friendships. The professors are amazing and truly care about you as a student in and out of the classroom. I love Xavier.
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University is an amazing environment for students to create connections, gain a higher education and experience growth. The size of this university allows for incredibly accessible resources. Xavier thrives on supporting the students through their education but also their overall well-being. The emphasis on community at Xavier is huge. The support of faculty, residential assistants and fellow students is immense. One thing that makes Xavier university truly feel like home are the basketball games. Cintas is always sold out for every game and it is the place where students, faculty, alumni and everyone in between come together to cheer on our muskies. GO X!"
Sophomore,4,"Most professors are understanding and do a nice job of instructing.  There are a few professors who are too smart to explain material to students, consequently creating a stressful experience.  SI's are a great resource and there are many clubs and activities for students to get involved in."
Alum,4,"I loved Xavier.  You are not just another number there.  Instead, you are in small classes with smart and available professors.  I do wish the school did more to help me find employment upon graduation.  I think they do an excellent job with some majors but I majored in English and I never felt like I was given a ton of direction on what came next.  But the environment is fantastic, the people are great, and I can't imagine going anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"I like the wide variety of classes offered at Xavier. The professors are very nice, however not all on the same page with the terms at Xavier. The food is suspect with only one dining hall, it would be nice to have some more options on campus. Athletics are very good and campus is really nice when maintained, which it typically is. Dorms are average, but the location of them is very good."
Junior,4,The professors are all amazing and helpful. I have had very few professors who weren't willing to put effort into their jobs. The people at Xavier are from all over the country and it is easy to meet people who live on the other end of the country than you.
Freshman,4,"Xavier is a good school and honestly I love being there, but one thing I wish could change is the double standard that exist within every teacher, not only at Xavier, but everywhere, that students should take care of themselves but sc cool work should also come first."
Niche User,4,I liked that there was an honors dormitory filled with student athletes and honors program students.
Sophomore,4,"I love Xavier so far, it is the perfect fit for me and my major! I feel very at home when I am Xavier. GO X!"
Sophomore,4,I am transferring to Xavier University. I fell in love with the campus and what the university offers for its students. The admissions staff and everyone I got involved with in my own transfer process were more than helpful and really demonstrated that me becoming a student was as important to them as it was for me.
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my first year at Xavier. I definitely loved the first semester from then the second semester because more people are open to meeting new people during the first semester. The second was a little rough since people had fallen into cliques since a lot of people are mentally still stuck in high school, but that's everywhere. I would highly recommend joining a club sport as it is an instant group of friends. Don't let this discourage you though! There will be cliquey people everywhere. Also if you are looking to party, I wouldn't choose Xavier. You can find parties, but most are overcrowded and get shut down."
Freshman,4,"Xavier is a great place to break your mold and figure who you want to with the school itself making you crazy. The faculty here are some of the most caring that you will meet and that goes with the general vibe, caring. Ive meet some great friends here that I know I could never forget. The only issue with the school is how mundane it can be. but that could just be my experience."
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University is a diverse, accepting, and rigorous college. The professors here are always willing to help you through hard classes, they know their students on a first name basis which makes it easier to talk to them. The dorms are always cleaned, even living in a community style bathroom I have never experienced a problem. The social scene here is good, on weekends students usually go downtown Cincinnati which is only ten minutes away, and also basketball games are a huge thing here. All the sports teams are good and it is a big deal here. The students and faculty are also very accepting and we have a lot of diverse clubs that anyone can join. Some things I would change about Xavier is to have Fraternity and Sorority houses, and also it is pretty expensive to come here, but other than that I love this school and I would recommend coming here."
Freshman,4,Xavier is a great school that truly feels like home. It's small enough to where you actually get to know the people around you but big enough to where you still get to experience many different types of people.
Freshman,4,i liked how small the school is but they keep getting larger and large classes which is making the school size bigger.
Sophomore,4,"Xavier is a close knit community that truly cares for one another. The feeling of ""being home"" is the top reason that students say they chose this school I couldn't agree more. The professors care, the students care, and the campus cares. Academics are rigorous but the class sizes are reasonable so it's easy to get to know your professors and peers. There are so many opportunities for growth - internships, study abroad, panel talks, etc. What more could you ask for? A challenging curriculum with the appropriate tools to succeed. Go X!"
Junior,4,I like that it is a small campus. The classes are smaller so you actually feel like you matter and you're able to form relationships with classmates and professors.
Freshman,4,"Xavier is a very great place to be. People are very friendly and I, for the most part feel very safe on campus. There are quite a few things to get involved in which is awesome. It is also great to see everyone come together for basketball games. XU is a great community."
Freshman,4,"Its a very good school with a focus on the liberal arts. Your curriculum starts off taking one of everything and then you start on your focus. It is not far from Downtown Cincy, and only about a 5 minute drive from UC. There's always something going on with the student body so you'll never be bored!"
Freshman,4,"Xavier University is a school that truly cares.  I don't say that just because I'm a student, I say that because this school has an atmosphere of community and acceptance.  Don't be thrown off by the Jesuit title.  It scared me a little bit at first too, but I do not feel pressured or intimidated by other students or staff.  This place is truly an environment of solidarity and acceptance for all kinds of people from all walks of life."
Freshman,4,Xavier University is such a great school. They offer so many programs for students to get involved in. The professors all make it a point to learn your name and get to know you. They want all their student to come to their office hours and talk. The basketball games are so much fun and all the students are so enthusiastic. Xavier overall is a great school and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.
Sophomore,4,"When I first applied to Xavier, I had every intention of pursuing an Occupational Therapy degree. Then I decided to come in as a freshman undecided. Xavier was great helping me decide what I wanted to major in. Its important to remember that because it is a Jesuit and liberal arts university that the Core Curriculum is a little more extensive. Those classes can honestly be rough unless its something that you really are interested in. However, now I am an Early Childhood Education major and the program is incredible. The faculty and professors really want what is best for you as a student and future independent adult. I have met some of the best friends of a lifetime here and the basketball scene is always a blast. Go X!"
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University is a Jesuit University. I am a second semester sophomore and I have loves almost every minuet of it. In my first semester of my first year, I was not liking the school so much. I wanted to transfer to Ball State so I could be with all of my friends. Then I realized second semester that I was being dramatic and I needed to toughen up and get it together. So that is what I did. I made more friends and went to more campus events and everything was great from then on out. Now, this year I have a job that I like, I was a mentor for three incoming freshmen, I am more involved on campus and I am happy as ever."
Freshman,4,"Xavier University provides a big school's commodities while on a small campus. Everyone who works here is friendly and helpful, especially the cafeteria workers. All of my professors are also willing to help with problems, even ones not relating to the class."
Junior,4,"Great school, great mission and great core values. Professors are generally accepting and easy going with the exception of a few, this is normal though. The students are needy, entitled and prejudice. Racism is embedded in their genes, they do it and don't even know it. They can't define it or fathom it but act it out in every possible way."
Sophomore,4,"Xavier University provides a pretty decent balance between challenging courses and professors who care about your development and success. It's warm hearted atmosphere is noticed everywhere as classmates hold doors open for one another, share a coffee after class, or even form study groups for classes. Don't worry, we know how to have fun too! There are so many clubs and organizations, as well as intramural or club sports. And, plenty of students venture to the local bars, pubs, and breweries off campus."
Graduate Student,4,"I really like my first semester at Xavier.  It has a more community-based MBA program than the one I found at the University of Cincinnati.  In fact, Xavier's entire student body is more community-based."
Freshman,4,"Xavier University is excellent overall. The orientation program, Manresa, is one of a kind and made me feel right at home. Professors are very accomodating and campus itself is gorgeous. The only thing that I would change, is that I wish we had a football team."
College Sophomore,4,"Great teachers, great people, great nightlife, and great sports."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small catholic school the scene is pretty good. Some underclassmen might find it difficult to get into parties at first, but just make friends with upperclassmen and you'll be in. The day party scene could use some improvement, but there are some awesome parties at night. There is a decent chunk of students who are not into partying, but that does not stop the even bigger chunk of students who are into partying from having a good time. If you want to party, get in the right crowd, stay positive, get a fake id, and make the party happen. In the end, a school's party scene is only as good as the students make it. 

Xavier does not deserve a reputation as a non-partying school."
College Sophomore,4,"Xavier does not deserve the reputation it gets. It's not a big state school, but for a small Jesuit school it's great. It may be hard to get into parties as a freshman, but it gets much easier later on. Plus, there are a ton of great bars and clubs in Cincy for the college crowd, especially in Mt. Adams."
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity here on campus is probably very similar, maybe even more diverse, than the diversity of America."
College Sophomore,4,Every hall has its own unique character.
College Sophomore,4,Great D1 sports. Also a wide variety of Intramurals.
College Sophomore,4,Definitely a great school. There's really something here for everyone.
College Freshman,4,"Xavier university is a community you can never afford to miss with people around ready to answer your questions anyday , anytime."
College Freshman,4,I feel extremely safe on campus. There are always police around campus if you ever need anything and the blue lights are there in case of emergencies. The police do a great job of keeping the students informed on any safety issues that are going on  around campus
College Freshman,4,"All professors are extremely helpful and willing to meet with you whenever you need. Courses can be difficult, especially science courses. But the work is definitely worth it!"
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is a great way to stay connected with everything on campus and is very convenient for walking to classes and the cafeteria. Dorms are cleaned frequently and well. Personally, I've heard the best things about Husman Hall, and I lived there and I loved it."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very safe. The cops constantly patrol to make sure everything is in order.
College Freshman,4,"I love Xavier! The people are very welcoming, everyone hangs out with everyone, despite the grade level. The professors help you out until you succeed, and it isn't a party school so you can get your work done at all time."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at my school are really big in varsity sports when it comes to basketball and soccer (our teams are pretty amazing). We even have a club just for fan support for all sports and events called X-treme fans, they paint their bodies for almost every game, even if it's in the winter."
College Freshman,4,"Cincinnati has a lot to offer. It's not all super easy to get to for those that do not have a car, but its plentiful and fun!"
College Freshman,4,"I do not live in the campus dorms, so I'm sure there is a lot that I miss at night. However, I have many friends that I hang out with on campus/in their dorms, so I'm pretty confident in stating that we do not have too many students overusing alcohol, but that there are policies in place in case they would."
College Freshman,4,"While it may take our police 20 minutes to get to you, we have a great campus and seldom need their assistance."
Alum,2,"We were suppose to be treated like adults as this is our second education, but we were not.  very unorganized and inconsistent."
Alum,2,"I was in the ABSN program with Xavier.  As some of the staff is very supportive and caring, others are not.  There are staff members that do not want to see you succeed, that change assignments at the last minute, that speak to you in a condescending fashion.  They are inconsistent with grading and will take points away for things that are not in the rubric or syllabus.  It is difficult to maintain consistency with the program, and as expensive as the program is, they should be professional and spot on with the education.  They are not.  There are a few that do care, but for the most part it is a money trap, and you are not treated like a human being.  you will be responsible for learning via broken links on modules and Youtube, but be prepared to find your own resources for formatting APA because the Youtube and website links are not accepted."
Freshman,2,"I came to xavier from the new england area.  I find myself at this school with very little to nothing to do.  The people here are very cliquey and the professors here are hit or miss.  I got an on campus job to try to kill free time.  This school isn't a terrible school, however you have to be ok with not having even a moderate party scene, because as a freshman it won't be very fun."
Sophomore,2,Professors are tenured and therefore tend to be older and cannot relate to the students. They assign a lot of work without properly explaining it and are not typically available for help as soon as you need it. Very Unorganized in helping students and even telling students who to go to for help or how to schedule classes.
College Freshman,2,The housing as well as the dining are too expensive and they kick you out right after semesters.
College Senior,2,There are rich white people everywhere. The minority students tend to hang out in groups with similar people.
College Freshman,2,"The school offers a great Career Development office, however the employers who come to campus seem to not possess any power to recruit prospective students. A degree from Xavier will have a significant impact on a person who chooses to remain in Ohio for employment, but otherwise the degree from the school may not have a major impact outside of state. The city itself offers plenty of opportunity. Corporate Kroger, Macy's, and Procter and Gamble are located in downtown Cincinnati. The alumni network reflects Xavier being a small school."
College Freshman,2,"Xavier needs more of a Greek life on campus. There are a few historically black Greeks on campus such as the Alphas, AKA's, and Deltas. The few Greeks have had social events for Greeks and Non- Greeks. However, Non-greek students do not have much knowledge of what Greeks really are. There are no fraternity nor sorority houses around the campus, which I find very unfortunate because there no parties."
College Freshman,2,"I am unsure whether it is Xavier, but college is not what I expected it to be. I am excelling pretty well academically  thus far with obtaining a 3.8 my first semester, but my experience is not great. The quality of student at Xavier is poor. Students do not seem motivated, nor are they very smart. The basketball team is very good and attracts a lot of attention, but during the offseason there is not much one can do on campus. If I had to choose a college over again, it would not be Xavier."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot to do. Not a very lively campus.
College Freshman,2,They're out to catch kids that are doing anything wrong. Cops are always parked along the route from parties to campus so don't stumble otherwise they'll ticket you. Cops break up parties by 12 almost every time. Res Life is run by a bunch of power hungry 50 year olds there to yell at you like a parent then make you cough up $100+ for each violation.
College Freshman,2,"Living at Xavier University my freshman year was not what I expected at all. I was hoping for a very fun, social freshman year, making tons of friends and memories. Not what I got at all. I only have two good friends that I know I can trust with anything, all the other friends I have come into contact with are fake, liars, and stealers. The housing process is not enjoyable because they try to fit as many people in a room that is ONLY designed for TWO people. The safety of some the rooms are questionable. The dorm halls are not sociable at all, everyone stays in their room and keeps quiet for the most part. Some RA's are more relaxed and others are FISHING for trouble. THE SOCIAL LIFE SUCKS. At most colleges, there is always a last resort or something you can do if nothing else is going on. At Xavier, there is rarely ever anything going on. I myself know a lot of people, and usually when there is no parties at Xavier, everyone stays in their dorm and ""chills"": EW no fun. There have been only a few good parties. At all the parties, ALL of xavier;s campus is there, everyone from your classes is there. NOT FUN SEEING the same people all the time. Overall, my freshman experience at Xavier University has been a 3/10. There are many improvements that need to be made."
College Freshman,2,The school does not guarantee housing to juniors or seniors so you are forced to find a house.  The houses are scarce and you need to know someone in order to get a house
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of parties on a day to day basis and the cops bust the parties that do happen pretty quick
College Freshman,2,Off-Campus options are available but the neighborhood around campus is not the safest. Most houses are the same uniform design
College Freshman,2,Campus housing is average definitely could be worst but there is very little sense of community at Xavier
College Freshman,2,"Almost every student accepted gets a presidential scholarship of an amount of $10,000+ BUT people who don't need full rides or most of their education paid for get more than enough financial aid. I did not get enough and they are not willing to give me more. This situation stresses me out more than the actual school work because it is all I think about. It isn't fair. I love this school and I want to go here so bad, but the financial part is a big thing I have to consider about my future. My biggest advice is to find scholarships elsewhere."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do on campus. The parties are busted early in the night and overly packed every single time. It is annoying and hard to do something outside your building.
College Freshman,2,It's hard to deal with the same old out of the hat ideas that I can figure out alone. When I need advice they have given me the same options that I already knew about and I'm struggling. Still. Those offices give me anxiety.
College Sophomore,2,The only Greek Life we have is black sororities and fraternities. Mostly sororities. Barely noticeable and small.
College Freshman,2,"Trying to be a vegetarian or vegan in Cincinnati is near impossible. Between their famous skyline chili, famous Cincinnati dog, and pasta I found it very hard to be even healthy. I've mainly stuck to my school for that very reason, only because they are legally obligated to have a salad bar. Thanks Michelle Obama."
College Sophomore,2,"There is virtually no Greek life on campus, excluding the academic clubs, which do not have any off campus housing."
College Senior,2,"The cost for a parking permit is stupidly high, so I used to ride my bike to class."
College Freshman,2,"It is too strict at times. Many of the RAs/Hall Directors and teachers go above and beyond their job. In the college setting where we need to learn things for ourselves it is very annoying. They try very hard to be our parents.

Typically, unless you are being crazy the cops let you go and that is awesome because they understand it is just college!"
College Freshman,2,Off campus dining is not in walking distance and most places are general fast food that does not give student discounts. On and off campus dinning needs a lot of work.
College Freshman,2,"On campus dining is expensive so I rarely eat in the dining hall because I didn't purchase a meal plan. There are a handful of other places to eat, and why there isn't a huge variety these places are generally fairly priced."
College Freshman,2,"The shuttle is either great or horrible. The Cinci Metro is good but kind of terrifying if you're not used to public transportation, and finding the right stop is confusing since there are a ton that surround campus. Taxis are expensive but available."
College Freshman,2,"It isn't hard to get a scholarship the first year wasn't hard, but it's a pain in the you-know-what after that. Also, the people at the financial aid office aren't very helpful at all...basically they just give you a website to look for outside scholarships (which I could have done myself)."
College Freshman,2,"Bascially if you don't get a spot in R1, you have to park all the way behind Cohen and walk back."
College Freshman,2,the local atmosphere can be good at times but I'm often wanting to explore which is hard when the school doesn't really openly present those opportunities 
College Junior,2,"The food is not very good. Also, the cafeteria closes at 8 p.m. so many students become hungry at night."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't a lot of off-campus dining options near Xavier. You may have to drive 5-10 minutes to find an area that has diverse food options. But there are a few places such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Chipotle, City BBQ, and Donatos who take X-cash and are fairly close."
College Freshman,2,"Cincinnati is a decent town, but the area around campus is very unsafe. I fear my safety when I am off campus."
College Sophomore,2,There are alot of different houses to choose from and alot of different locations.  The only issue is the safety factor since Xavier's campus is not located in the best of neighborhoods
College Junior,2,The food on Xavier's campus is below par.  The majority of the food is very unhealthy and unappealing.
College Sophomore,2,Xavier didn't do that much.  You just fill out the FAFSA on your own
College Freshman,2,"Eff the hill. R-2 and R-3 are synonymous with HELL. Parking is an ordeal, because there are very few decent parking spaces. And once those fill up, you're stuck parking up on the hill and having to trek back down. But we're spoiled, because that's probably the normal distance at bigger schools."
College Freshman,2,"So. Slow. If you plan on using one of the many computers around campus, prepare to wait 43534534 hours for it to log you on. Seriously. But once you finally get logged on, they aren't too miserably slow."
College Freshman,2,"There is always enough parking on campus, however, the majority of it is relatively far away from central campus.  Everyone always hopes to get a spot in the smaller R1 parking lot because it is not as far of a hike.  The R2 lot is farther away and can be nerve racking to walk back from alone if you get back to campus later at night."
College Freshman,2,Not Much – There are multiple house parties every weekend but they get busted up pretty quickly and walking in the cold sucks.
Freshman,1,"DO NOT ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY. I have had the worst depression since attending Xavier University. If you want absolutely no social life, then come to Xavier. The RA and Hall Directors are useless. There is only one dining hall on campus, that won't even serve food throughout the day. After 2:00 pm there is no hot food served, no lunch. Not to mention, the serious alcohol problem at this school, due to the fact that the students are bored out of their mind. There are absolutely NO social activities, so do not plan on making any friends. Brockman Hall is the oldest housing on campus, that smells horrific with a disgusting communal bathroom. I have tried multiple times to move and the RA and Hall Director simply do not want to work. They have given 0 effort into accommodating me, especially given the steep price to attend this university. The local area is horrific as well, many of my friends have been mugged or are fearful of being mugged around once you step foot off campus."
Niche User,1,"If you are not a straight, white male from an affluent family, I would not go here. I frankly would be scared to send a daughter here (due to the nastiness of the guys that go to this school). Likewise, racism is prevalent throughout the student body, although the school tries to cover it up. The basketball team is cool and brings name recognition, but the school uses it as their only marketing tool, because frankly there isn't anything else that is that great about Xavier. I transferred out after my freshman year and wish I would have left sooner."
College Freshman,1,"nothing to do, in a bad area with nothing in walking distance."
College Freshman,1,I wish Xavier had Greek life! The campus would be so much more fun and the social atmosphere would be a lot better because there are virtually no ways to make new friends...
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life on campus, just academic fraternities"
College Freshman,1,"The sport management program here is brand new but the dean of the program gives out false information to recruit you. Many students were told sport management was in the business school but it is not, then students go on to transfer to the business school and it costs $1,500 more a year to be in the College of Business. Plus the core classes makes it nearly impossible to double major in Sport Management and a business degree unless you take 6-7 classes a semester or consider paying for summer classes"
College Freshman,1,Campus is not too strict but they give out a lot of tickets
College Freshman,1,Not much to do and the don't walk back to campus alone at night
College Senior,1,"the costs and expenses associated with college materials are extremely high, just ridiculous."
Recent Alumnus,1,"As much as someone pays to go to X and as much expanding as they're doing, they NEED to be building more parking."
College Freshman,1,"My program, Speech Language Pathology, is not offered here. It is one of the main reasons I am transferring. 

Before I chose to transfer I talked to the allied health director and she said tons of students change schools for this major so I do not know why it has not been added to the curriculum."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you are a business or nursing major, you do not have many good options."
College Freshman,1,"There are not many close spots at all. I know R1 does not have many spots but I have heard many students say they never use their car on a day to day basis, only to go home for breaks, and they take the R1 spots and sit there all semester. Because parking is so limited there needs to be regulations against this. I also think they need to open up spots better. For example, if students in Brockman could park behind the building it would be much more convenient. They should give you a parking spot number with your pass so you have a set spot and they should make more parking closer to the dorms. The 10 minute walk to my car and the walk back with groceries makes it a chore to leave campus because it takes a long time."
College Freshman,1,There are only a couple black Greek communities. We are not allowed to have the common white Greek houses/groups and this upsets a lot of people. Many people think Greek Life would be a great addition to our campus atmosphere and night life.
College Sophomore,1,We are big on basketball
College Freshman,1,Cincinnati weather is completely unpredictable
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are tons of off-campus dining options (restaurants, fast food, etc) within a few short miles of campus, but there's hardly anything within walking distance, which is really too bad."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate Xavier's Parking. Commuter students are allowed to park in the lots closest to the dorms and classes. The parking passes are ridiculously expensive, and depending on where the violation is, so is the parking ticket. The students who live on campus have to park in the farthest parking lots on the campus. The allotted parking spots during school events like basketball games is confusing, and complicated. It is almost impossible to find a spot during school hours, so you would have to arrive at least 20 minutes early."
College Senior,1,"There is usually parking for commuter students. However, during basketball season, student parking is given away to people with season tickets. Students are forced to park farther away.. even at night when it is not safe."
College Freshman,1,Xavier University hides many things from the public. There was a guy that raped three girls but they refused to kick out. I had numerous problems with the school. The school does not follow its own handbook and if offered money will break the laws.

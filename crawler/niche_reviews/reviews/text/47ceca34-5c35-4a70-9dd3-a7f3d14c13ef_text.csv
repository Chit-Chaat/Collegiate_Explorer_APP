Freshman,5,"I really like the collaboration that I have with other students, my professors, and my TAs/mentors. MIT has so many academic tutoring programs that I enjoy attending. Also, I love the different independent research opportunities and clubs that I'm in. These really help me progress in my career development and give me some social time with others outside of class."
Junior,5,"The original transition was a bit tough for some of my classes, though others were just fine. I am not an engineering major so the content and presentation of the courses wasn't too different than expected."
Junior,5,"Going into MIT I though I was smart - really smart, but I later found out that, yes, while I am smart, everyone else here is SUPER smart. This can go two ways - you can fall victim to imposter syndrome (believing you don't belong, you're not good enough) or you can rise to the occasion and leverage your peers and upperclassmen friends. That is what makes MIT - the people here are unlike people you've ever met. They're supportive, helpful, passionate, and they CARE about you more than you think. MIT is a tough place and it will put you in your place, but it does that to everyone. The playing field is even, there's no grading on a ""curve"" and we're not too competitive with each other (when it comes to classes). Your friends will help you with psets, career advise, clubs, and everything else - just as you would help them too. MIT is its own beautiful community with a home for everyone."
Junior,5,"Very good college for the learning point of view. Diversified culture, campus is cool and professors here are highly talented."
Freshman,5,"The student body is so passionate and self driven. They push me to be a better student. The opportunities gained from attending MIT are immense. I have also found a great community of people here, and feel that the classes, though rigorous, are truly preparing me to do great things in the world."
Niche User,5,I just didn't go there to study but I would like to apply for a scholarship to go there. Why else would someone like to have a scholarship?
Niche User,5,How close you are with the cutting edge of technology on a constant basis is an exhilarating feeling that you get when you arrive there.
Freshman,5,MIT provides a wonderful place to call home. There is nothing I would even dream of changing. Attending was the best choice I have ever made.
Niche User,5,"Because the noble prize winners becomes professors and influence or instructors within it's own university. Also, the academic equipment was so very fascinating and amazing on being advanced and technical to using in the modern ages."
Freshman,5,"MIT is full of great opportunities. They really let their students experience education hands-on. Within months of studying here, I was able to pick up new skills and have access to various tools in the many makerspaces. The first-year experience has also been designed to ease the transition from high school to university.

The campus and food might not be the best, but that's not what university is for anyway. I think MIT remains the top science/engineering school in the world."
Alum,5,"MIT was the most difficult four years of my life. At times, I was not sure that I would survive the academic rigor, but I did, and I even excelled. MIT pushes you hard so that you learn to harness your intellect and push back. It is also humbling to know your limits and work to push your own boundaries. It is not for the fain of heart. My experience was mildly traumatizing, but I would repeat those four years in a heartbeat."
Alum,5,"I think MIT is the best school in terms of academic. Just wow! The teacher are knowledgeable, the subject are so damn hard but worth it, I like everything about MIT."
Sophomore,5,"From my first year here, I can safely say it is an amazing school overall. MIT has a variety of STEM based degrees to offer, though MIT is well known for its Engineering/Sciences it also provides and excellent courses in Humanities and Business. In my first year here my only viable complaint is the food, everything else is fantastic. If given the opportunity MIT will be a fantastic school to spend you next four years."
Junior,5,"MIT is an outstanding university with numerous and diverse opportunities in research and academics. Classes at MIT are indeed difficult, with homework and associated studying consuming a large chunk of time. The beauty of this is that it pushes students to go above and beyond their previous understanding of what they believed themselves to be capable of. Additionally, the explorative and creative atmosphere which springs from the vibrancy of the student body and the faculty is second to none. There are so many chances to do great things at MIT, even as an undergrad!"
Junior,5,"MIT is a challenging but supportive environment. Everyone here agrees that the best thing about it is the people - you're all struggling together, but at least you're together. The professors, especially those for freshmen, are really concerned for students and care that they are learning the material. There are a lot of opportunities for social activities such as dance, acapella, and sports."
Junior,5,"I have found my home at this school. While it is challenging, it has pushed me to understand the hard work that is required for success. There are plenty of extracurricular activities I can participate in to supplement my learning, and the location of the campus relative to Boston is perfect for exploration of the city. I know that my experience here will only have a positive impact on what I am capable of doing in the future."
Niche User,5,You should learn about it for yourself; everyone's experience is different thus it's impossible to quantify it on this website.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy it here. There is always something fun to do, be it a club or one-time activity, and the people are great."
Graduate Student,5,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a fantastic school that offers students an opportunity to explore anything. The staff is second to none and always encourage students to challenge themselves in whatever it is they are passionate about. Walking down the halls, you feel the energy and passion from students. The students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology live and breathe Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Everyone on campus is there to make the world a better place and that is what makes MIT so special. Everyone is highly intelligent and capable, but it’s the common desire to give back that makes the campus."
Niche User,5,This college is the best in the world. It sets you up for any job of your choosing. It not only provides opportunities for growth academically but socially as well.
Alum,5,"What I love about MIT is how it is a microcosm of the world where everyone is judged primarily by merit. For students who come from a relatively poor background like me, it's great to see a school where you can't easily pay your way in."
Niche User,5,"MIT is a great place to be. Its environment fosters innovation, creativity, and curiosity. Not only is the faculty and education world-class, but being with the best peers pushes one to be better. The quirky culture is also nice; one will certainly find his place in this great community."
Niche User,5,It has alot of facilities and there's all the required tools to make an idea come true And it's simply the best college in it's field that any hard working student want to Study in it .
Freshman,5,"MIT will challenge you in ways that you have never been challenged before, in its effort to mold you into the future leaders of tomorrow and helping you discover your true potentials. It may be a difficult journey, but it'll be worth it at the end."
Sophomore,5,"Great school. Great people. Great city. 
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Boston is one of the greatest cities to live in and MIT is the school to go to for top education where you will be challenged."
College Junior,5,"I have never been to a place that I have simultaneously loved and hated as much as MIT. I have been challenged in every way, and it has made a stronger person coming out of the other side. I have made some of the best friends here and met some of the smartest and most interesting people as well. Coming out of sophomore year I had never felt more inadequate, I was a B-C student for the first time in my life, failed a class, and got rejected from a dozen companies. When I finally landed an internship I went in expecting to be woefully unprepared based on my class performance. That's when I realized that struggling at MIT was flying anywhere else. The real workforce felt so easy and I barely felt challenged even as I got assigned to more and more projects. MIT's the first place that made me feel stupid, but it also made me realize that comparing myself to others is a terrible way to measure success and that I needed to be the best I could be (which compared to the rest of the world was pretty good.) In short. IHTFP (both meanings)."
Recent Alumnus,5,"By far, the best school in the nation, and the world, not just for engineering, but for business, architecture, economics. MIT graduates go onto shape the world in ways never thought possible."
Recent Alumnus,5,Ranked the best University in the World for the last six years running
College Sophomore,5,Getting a degree from this school means a lot and can really influence and help career prospect after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my dorm, the building is beautiful and the people are wonderful. Each dorm has its own culture and because of that, all types of people can find their place and the type of people they want to surround themselves with."
College Freshman,5,The quality of employers recruiting on campus is high
College Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere of creative and super-smart students.
College Sophomore,5,"MIT really prepares the student for their career.  A manifold of opportunities to explore areas of interest, with a definite push to get a job."
College Junior,5,The opportunities to get involved in innovative projects and work with outstanding professionals.
College Junior,5,"Everyone knows MIT really whips you into shape. Nothing is guaranteed. It is up to you to decide the type of life you'll lead after school, but MIT gives you the tools necessary to be successful and get hired."
College Junior,5,"Greek life at MIT gives you amazing opportunity to grow, learn, and have fun. It's pretty much a perfect balance of helping the community and the occasional scandal."
College Junior,5,"I think what makes the experience so amazing is having the opportunity to meet people with brilliant minds and passionate, caring hearts."
College Sophomore,5,"MIT is wonderful, it opens a lot of doors that otherwise would remain closed."
College Sophomore,5,"There are opportunities everywhere, I've gotten job offers just by saying I go to MIT"
College Sophomore,5,MIT is awesome and fun
Freshman,4,"While everyone that I've met has been absolutely supportive in my academics and extracurricular activities, I've been slightly struggling because of time zone differences (ALL of my classes are synchronous) and I don't get to talk to people in person, which is of course more of an overall online university issue."
Senior,4,"I've had a somewhat unique experience at MIT because unlike the majority of students, I'm not an engineering major. (GASP!) I majored in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (essentially neuroscience) and minored in Anthropology. I adored both of those departments - the classes, the teachers, the admins, the research opportunities. I know some other majors like chemical engineering are more difficult and aren't quite as adored by their students. 

If you ask a student what there favorite part about MIT is, 90% of the time they will say the people. Being a specialized and somewhat quirky school, students at MIT have so much in common. Usually, that commonality is a passion to make a difference, openmindedness/acceptance, and a desire to play hard when not studying. Our student groups are varied and vibrant and our party scene is known as the best in Boston, but ultimately, we thrive on our close-knit community and appreciation for one another."
Sophomore,4,"There are many great opportunities to pursue your interests and achieve personal growth. Between the clubs, classes, research opportunities, and other resources, everyone is sure to find an area that fits their interest. 

Some potential areas for improvement might be financial aid packages and fostering social connections. The first point is fairly straightforward, but the latter is a bit more nuanced. Though their are many clubs and groups,  I wish there were even more opportunities for students to connect with one another and meet new people to find their community."
Sophomore,4,"Had a great freshman year. Great dorms, decent food, amazing professors. First semester was on a Pass/No Record grading system which was a huge help to me as I had come from a small public school with very few AP classes. Very good student community at this college as well. Everyone is willing to help one another."
Freshman,4,"The opportunities and resources provided by MIT are amazing. What I love the most is the range of choice students have when it comes to classes, student organizations, study abroad opportunities, research, etc. The dorms are also unique and have their own diverse cultures, so students can find a living community where they feel like they belong."
Niche User,4,"The campus is great, the staff/professors are excellent. Amazing place to gain STEM skills and research. Only con is the area is quite crowded."
College Junior,4,"26 fraternities, so there's one for everyone. Being in a fraternity isn't hard, but the top fraternities are as good as they come. Very nice houses in great locations in Boston and Cambridge. Chi Phi, Sigma Chi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon throw some of the best parties in Boston, each with their own unique vibe."
College Junior,4,"I am a member of a varsity athletic team here, and while attendance isn't great for our events that doesn't mean we don't win games and have an awesome team. My best friends are on my team."
Recent Alumnus,4,MIT administration and the MIT police department work hard to ensure its students feel safe.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great value, considering you don't have to do housekeeping, and as a junior or senior you can easily obtain your own room."
College Sophomore,4,Classes are difficult but you get a lot out of them. Class sizes are good. Variety very good.
College Sophomore,4,"People like the Greek life here, it's pretty chill and no one judges you if you are or aren't part of it yourself."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is extremely challenging, and really pushes you to your limits. However, the people there make it worth the hard work and help you along the way, allowing for a really rewarding experience. If I had to choose all over again, I would still stand by my choice and pick my school."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy so far.
College Freshman,4,The Campus Police really try to help students.
College Freshman,4,"I got my third choice of dorm, but it is working out OK."
College Freshman,4,"I love the swimming requirement, and the physical education facilities are great."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very willing to listen and help students learn - individual quirks/administrative proficiency are the only problems.
College Sophomore,4,I am very satisfied with my current dorm - Simmons Hall.  Great building and people who reside in it.
College Senior,4,"I live on the east side of campus, which could not be more convenient--very close to classes and to the T (subway). In my dorm, specific halls form close communities with decades of traditions. This is fun and engaging, but people tend to form groups/cliques and are often rude to each other because we have no explicit rules about how to treat other members of our hall."
College Senior,4,"As a humanities and science major, my academic experience at MIT isn't the most usual. The academic environment tends to undervalue these fields, but the people in them, especially in SHASS (School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) really care about their fields. The main thing I'd change about MIT, and have been trying to change for the past 3 years, is out culture around suffering. Many students wear their suffering as a badge of pride and vie to work the most, sleep the least, and be most 'hosed,' from firehose. We devalue mental health and self-care, and students often think others will look down on them for asking for help. Those facets of MIT need to change, but I've seen people at the Institute who care and are working on this, so I have very much hope for the future of my school."
College Junior,4,"Other than the fact that our campus is open to anyone, I feel safe walking alone late at night or any time."
College Junior,4,"Despite the occasional fire alarm, living in a dorm was great. You get to choose who you live near in some of the dorms and form a strong community with the people around you. Each section or lounge gets funds to spend however they want to help facilitate that. The dorms are larger than at any other school."
College Junior,4,"For being a D3 school, we have fairly nice facilities. Our gym for the general student body is nicer than the one designated for varsity athletes. Our fields, particularly baseball, softball, and football, could really use an upgrade and it would be cool if more people attended our games, but you can't really expect more from students who are so busy with school and their own extracurriculars. Outside of attendance, people show amazing amounts of support over social media."
College Junior,4,MIT has top-notch academics. Some professors aren't great lecturers though.
College Junior,4,"I've had a hard time in my internship search, but the company who did hire me this summer is really impressed with MIT."
College Junior,4,I feel safe and feel that MIT is very aware of issues and active in addressing them.
College Junior,4,I'm a Varsity Athlete and I love my coaches and team!
College Sophomore,4,Professors are in general helpful and approachable. Courses are insightful.
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is pretty great, health services and mit police are good."
College Sophomore,4,"The community atmosphere is exceptional, the facilities can leave some to be desired."
College Sophomore,4,"FSILGs are a huge part of MIT, each with their own unique atmosphere and culture."
College Sophomore,4,MIT is a really cool place where you have the opportunity to explore whatever interests you and your explorations are supported.
College Sophomore,4,"It's clean, nice, and social"
College Freshman,4,Sports and Athletics are not a focus here but students are extremely passionate about them as well.
College Freshman,4,"They have tons of athletic facilities that students, clubs, and athletes can all use for recreation and training! I think it's more than enough for the demand."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, however I never really see police around.  I mainly feel safe because I do not travel alone and I trust the people around me."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is surprisingly big on MIT campus for the guys.  The frats really put in a lot of time for their brothers and people they know, helping with homework and providing study breaks for fun.  Sorority life, on the other hand, seems pretty big due to the amount of girls in the sororities, but they do not play as much of a big impact as the fraternities.  There is not a big difference in Greeks and non-Greeks."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics is not a priority at MIT, so most of the students don't pay attention to them.  However, there is a lot of school spirit for big events.  Many students are involved in sports whether they are in club sports or varsity sports."
College Senior,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus. MITPD are always around when you need them.
College Senior,4,"If you want Greek life, it's there. If you don't, it's not a big deal. About 1/2 of guys on campus are in fraternities and 1/3 of girls."
College Freshman,4,"MIT Medical provides for basic medical needs, if you sprain an ankle, need medication, etc."
College Freshman,4,"The aspects of campus housing are largely dependent on the dorm you choose. That being said, as opposed to most other colleges, housing options are much more lenient and students are given much more freedom to choose where they feel the most comfortable living and whom they would like to live with."
College Freshman,4,The Greek life you choose at MIT is largely dependent on the community you join. Most fraternities however are not the stereotypical kind of hardcore party-goers.
College Sophomore,4,I'm a non-Greek but most Greeks I know enjoy it and they do a lot of cool things
College Freshman,4,They do a lot for the mental and physical health. There are also a lot of support services.
College Freshman,4,They have the facilities for students to do nearly any exercise they want
College Freshman,4,"It has been great so far, the academics are near perfect. The only downside is the workload, the cost of attending, and living on your own in an expensive city."
College Sophomore,4,People can go out whenever they want.
College Sophomore,4,People can party all the time if they want...
College Sophomore,4,"We're only D3, but our teams are pretty darn good!"
College Sophomore,4,They expect you to learn a lot on your own.
College Sophomore,4,I hate the weather. Snow sucks.
College Freshman,4,"Campus feels super safe most of the time and there are quick alerts for odd situations. Beware of the open campus policy at 3AM, however. Ask police to escort you if you ever feel unsafe. I've never heard of any incidents, though."
College Freshman,4,"There's a lot of variety, but it's up to you to take advantage of it."
College Freshman,4,"The school forces you to take athletic courses, and there's a wide variety to choose from. Outside of class, each dorm has a gym (the quality varies) and the main gym, the Z-Center, is open most of the day. The Z-Center has a lot of equipment available to all students except when class or sports are in session in during the workday and from five to seven (even then, it's possible/likely that only a part of that area is in use, depending on what you want)."
College Freshman,4,"MIT is a great place when it comes to interdisciplinary studies. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, since I just wanted to do a lot of things, but the collaborative spirit all around campus and especially in the Media Lab eventually led me to realize I could do a lot of it.

The people are wonderful and probably what makes MIT so unique. Everyone wants to learn or advance their fields, both professors and students. There are few who are complacent, which is mostly a great thing."
College Sophomore,4,It is totally challenging but the opportunities are great!!!
College Sophomore,4,The classes are pretty difficult the students at MIT are generally nice people and like to help others out if they're struggling.
College Freshman,4,"The classes may be difficult and the atmosphere may be intense, but the people at my school are great. They make up for any downside caused by the intense academic environment and more."
College Sophomore,2,"Though many do participate in sports, it isn't very important in our school's culture as academics always comes first."
College Sophomore,2,People don't care enough to go to the sports games
College Freshman,2,I wish athletics were a big part of MIT. We don't even have a real football stadium which is sad since I am from texas and football and marching bands are huge there.
College Sophomore,2,Very few people go to varsity games. Many of friends did not even know MIT had a football team.
College Junior,2,"I feel like the sports teams actually do well, but the problem is that there isn't much school spirit. The fact that I don't even really know how the teams are doing is a testament to this statement."
College Senior,2,"Despite claims that the school provides for all need, it doesn't."
College Freshman,2,"New England, what can I say "
College Sophomore,2,The weather is awful and makes everyone depressed. Nobody comes to Boston for the weather.
College Freshman,2,It's really cold here. It's really humid when you arrive in the summer and impossible to not be sweaty but then it freezes around the middle of October and snows a lot.
College Junior,2,"WTF Boston – The weather in Boston is ridiculous. It'll go from 40 degrees one day to 60 the next. Thankfully, most of the buildings are connected via a tunnel system so even on rainy/ snowy days it's easy to get to class without too much hassle. We rarely get snow days, which is tough."
College Sophomore,2,"I Mean... You're in Boston – It's Boston. You didn't choose to go to University of Miami. It's cold. It's wet. The sun doesn't shine too often. It snows. I love Boston, but I didn't come here expecting to sunbathe..."
College Junior,2,Very Cold – The weather gets pretty bad in the winter and it can become extremely cold.
College Sophomore,2,"Easy for people with REALLY low income. Hard for middle class to get any scholarships, so most financial aid generally comes from other programs."
College Junior,2,"Not Great – I don't drive, but i know very few people who do, unless they live in greek housing with its own parking, because parking is in short supply and very expensive in Boston in general.
But you don't need a car on campus, because bus and subway system is so great, plus most places students want to go to are in walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,"No Meal Plan – Dining options are not very good. The dining halls are only open for dinner from 5:30-8:30. Only two are open on Fridays and Saturdays. Although the meals themselves are good and accommodate nearly every dining style, students have to pay by meal, which costs about $8. I suppose students have the option to save money by cooking for themselves but when in a time crunch, its not very convenient."
College Sophomore,2,"Might as Well Go Out – Dining is difficult at MIT. I often find myself going off-campus for meals and such. Off-Campus dining is great, though :)"
College Senior,1,Campus dining is overpriced and not really high quality.
College Junior,1,It's very expensive - about 12 dollars per meal on average.  Food is not great.  Meal plans are required if you live in a dorm with a dining hall.
College Junior,1,It's a pretty small campus so not much need for a car at all really.  Permits are expensive and there are very few parking lots.  Having a car might not get you any closer to classes than you would be if you just walked from your dorm.
College Sophomore,1,"There is only parking available on the street, or in paid parking garages."
College Freshman,1,"You really don't need a car on campus. Parking spaces are limited, and it's much more convenient to walk and take public transportation."
College Junior,1,"No One Really Has a Car – A car is not really necessary at MIT. The T, the main mode of transportation, is very convenient, whether in bus or subway form.  There is a T subway stop  right next to campus and the buses run through the middle of campus.  You can cheaply and easily get to pretty  much anywhere you would like to go in Cambridge or Boston via the T.  There is some minimal parking on campus and the Greek houses, but it really is not necessary."
College Sophomore,1,"There are almost no parking spaces, and to get those that do exist, you need to obtain a very expensive yearly parking permit. In fact, MIT subsidizing people NOT getting parking permits by offering discounted monthly T-passes for example."

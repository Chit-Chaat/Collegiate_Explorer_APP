Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online yet, but for the upcoming semester, the staff has been helpful with any questions I have had."
Alum,5,"I really loved my experience at Vanguard. All of the staff and faculty are very intentional with their students, and I feel like it is a great Christian community. There have been so many moments on campus that changed my life, and I would recommend Vanguard to anyone looking for a private christian college community."
Junior,5,My expeirence at Vanguard has been nothing short of amazing. Ive met so many incredible people and have grown in my faith and as a person in so many aspects of life. Unfortunately it is very expensive and my family is unable to pay for all of the tuition. I would love to be able to continue to attend in the fall but I will need to find many scholarships to help pay.
Junior,5,Online learning was very difficult for me because I had trouble focusing because I live in the garage of my mothers home.
Junior,5,"I love Vanguard. Great school and awesome professors. Love the campus environment, you will definitely find your life long best friends at Vanguard"
Sophomore,5,"My learning experience at Vanguard has been amazing. The professors there are very involved and care. The school is small enough that the professors remember your name in class. I feel that I have been pushed in the classroom, and have come out greatly educated."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is small, however has a great location. It's 15 minutes to the Newport Beach shore! On campus community is very friendly between student and professors. Events are also very exciting, especially games inside our gym, or as we call it, ""The Pit"". The campus has a a brand new cafeteria and recreational center that is open to all students, not to mention a great coffee shop!"
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Vanguard University. The campus is small but you feel like you are part of a family. Everyone is there for you, including the professors. Whether its trials or tribulations, everyone is along the ride with you.  I was always looking forward to attending my classes and being with my friends. Friends that I will have for a lifetime. It was a great experience and I am happy that i attended this great university."
Alum,5,"I loved Vanguard because the people I met there were life-impacting. From my roommates, to my friends, professors and mentors I enjoyed everything I learned in relationship with people at Vanguard. I felt very cared for as a student and supported in my education, career, and well being."
Alum,5,This is an amazing Biblically based school. I was surprised at how the professors were so caring. I did an online degree in early childhood and it was seamless and a great experience. I would recommend Vanguard.
Sophomore,5,"I think that everyone, including counselors, advisors and professors are very thoughtful and supportive when it comes to our education. They really worry about our wellbeing and work hard to meet our needs and assist in whatever way they can. I am overall very pleased with the help I receive from them."
Freshman,5,This is my first year at Vanguard University and so far I'm enjoying every moment. I'm a Biology major and I look forward to my classes and learning from my amazing professors. At Vanguard everyone treat you like family due to the small class sizes and everyone has been so helpful.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience through transitioning from an undergraduate student from Cal State Dominguez Hills to a graduate student at Vanguard University has been the best decision I made. Vanguard University offers Clinical Psychology, which has always interested me. Therefore, I got more involved into persuading my degree there because the school requires for us to do practicum, 30 sessions one on one therapy for students and being a private school the classes are small. Due to this the professors tend to pay more attention to their students and reach out to you when your are struggling. By so far, I really enjoy attending Vanguard because their is a diversity of students from different cultural beliefs."
Freshman,5,"Being a Christian, I love how Christ-centered Vanguard is. Morals and Jesus are at the center of every class, learning objective, goal, event, etc. The staff genuinely cares for not only your knowledge of the subject but your emotional intelligence and mental wellbeing. They will never say no to a prayer request or question and are very welcoming."
Freshman,5,I love Vanguard! I'm currently a Freshman here and everything has been great. Everyone is really nice to each other here and I can't wait to participate in more fun events and activities!
Graduate Student,5,"Vanguard University offers an intimate Clinical Psychology program with a small group of teachers that follow you through your whole program. The learning is rich and specific to the art of conducting therapy and serving others through a therapeutic role. The advisers for the Graduate Psych program are present, consistent, and help students achieve success."
Junior,5,"As I enter my third year, I am sure that I made the right decision to come to Vanguard. It has made me feel at home and every professor is ready to help you in anything you need. Everyone there makes you feel welcome and doesn’t look down upon you. God has become the center of Vanguard and it shows His love."
Sophomore,5,It’s full of diversity and the professors are great. All willing to help out students to the fullest.
Junior,5,"This is a place that I knew was a home to me very quickly. It is a beautiful area and literally has so many things to do and its 15-10 mins away from Disneyland. It's also a small, but intimate campus meaning you get to actually connect with the campus and most importantly the professors. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed that the school was pretty small, so I was able to get a very personal enrollment process. A member from the Admissions office was very helpful, constantly contacting me with deadlines and available for me if I had any questions. I would change how long it took to get help, pass the admissions office. The whole process was easy and helpful, it just took a little longer than expected to fully complete the process."
Freshman,5,Vanguard University gave me the opportunity of being recruited to the men's soccer team. Every time I visit the campus it makes me want to succeed more with dreams and aspirations of becoming a doctor. The education and athletics at Vanguard will allow me to excel and become as successful as I have always wanted to be.
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere and the surrounding area. The beach is really close and fun to go enjoy and relax at for some down time. The campus is smaller but very nice and everyone is very friendly.
Freshman,5,I loved the small community because it was tight-knit and provided a great support system. I love Vanguard!
Freshman,5,"Vanguard University has become home for me. The people here are so welcoming especially the staff. My professors pray before they start class, and they are also more than willing to help you out. They have so many fun events and clubs to get involved with. Overall, Vanguard is a great university for those who want to continue their education and grow in their relationship with God."
Alum,5,"One of the best choices I made was attending Vanguard University. The professors, location, and student life were by far the highlights of my time there. The school is really advanced in the musical arts and inspired many great musicians I know. The liberal arts education allowed for an expansion of my worldview and taught me to be an independent and nimble thinker. The staff genuinely cared about me, and I still have personal relationships with professors and staff over a decade later. At Vanguard, I met many of my closest friends and my best friend, my wife. Overall, if you are looking for a school where you will be known, encouraged to discover your unique calling, and inspired to participate in God's mission as you are equipped in your vocation, Vanguard is a wonderful choice."
Freshman,5,Vanguard University is amazing! Everyone is so kind and easy to talk. Not even kidding you can walk to anyone and have a conversation. The Professors are great and are open to having one on one meetings if you need help with anything. Around the campus is beautiful and the beach is near by.
Sophomore,5,Vanguard University is WONDERFUl school! Its staff/faculty are all amazing people who are very helpful and they are extremely dedicated to each student. As I am currently entering the second half of my sophomore year here I can confidently say that I love this school. From being openly God driven to the simple and sweet encouraging students everywhere on campus I cannot express much impactful each day here is. God is currently moving in a mighty way on the campus. There is an immense hunger for God and so many opportunities to help/serve yourself and the community here. Each day is purposeful with a neverending reminder that with God ALL IS POSSIBLE!
Sophomore,5,"I love this school, the professor want to see you make and will go back he extra to help. Only thing I would change is the financial  aid process"
Alum,5,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at the school. The greatest aspect is without a doubt, the faculty. They will spend their free time mentoring you, helping you and guiding you. They are truly the most enriching part of the experience there. The student life is average. The diversity is very poor. However, the academics and professor truly make all the difference if you reach out to them and invest your time with them. The school at times makes questionable choices by cutting academic programs to build new facilities, but if you can get your foot into the door into one of their good programs, it is worth your time and money."
Niche User,5,Vanguard University is a beautiful university that centers around christian beliefs. The school cares about the students. There are many resources on campus that are geared toward the student's success. Professors are always able and willing to assist students if they are in need of help or just asking extra questions outside of class. The campus is located right next door to the police department. For students walking around campus after dusk they have safety officers that will escort the students back to their dorms or to the library.
Sophomore,5,"Vanguard University is an amazing place to have an education.  The professors are all amazing and very personable.  Vanguard is truly focused on helping students grow their knowledge to be able to pursue careers, but they are also focused on growing the students as people."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my Freshman year at Vanguard and it is an awesome school. They gave me the opportunity to grow, the professors are willing to spend time not only in class but outside of class either answering questions or doing life with me and the staff is awesome. I got the opportunity to go abroad and spent a month in Italy getting two classes out of the way. It's not a party school which helps me to keep my focus on school and it's a small campus so it's easy to get around."
Sophomore,5,Vanguard University is an amazing campus with great student life. A diverse campus where everyone knows one another. Professors and staff are always willing to meet and speak with students. A small campus with a good variety of off campus restaurants down the street.
Sophomore,5,"Vanguard University has been a home away from home this past year. There are many great qualities about the school, such as small class size. The class sizes make it easier to learn and get assistance from professors as needed. Another benefit is the small campus. This makes it  difficult to get lot in the crowd. The best thing about Vanguard is the community. I was immediately surrounded by people genuinely cared about my life and wanted to be apart of it and help me along the way.  Whether it is a professor or a peer, there will always be someone who will grab coffee with you and talk about life. The friends you make at Vanguard will be with you for life."
Sophomore,5,"I've only completed my freshman year at Vanguard, but I am absolutely in love with this University! Not only have I received incredible education in this past school year, but I have been given some of my best friends, whose friendships I know will last for years to come!"
Freshman,5,The school is a very small and beautiful campus. The location is perfect too because it isn’t very close to the beach.
Freshman,5,"Amazing school, with teachers who actually care about their students. Campus is beautiful. it is 5 minutes from the beach."
Niche User,5,I will be attending next year as a freshman at Vanguard and every interaction I have had with the school has been extraordinarily wonderful.
Freshman,5,Vanguard is a campus in which every student is received with open arms and is treated with great hospitality. Each student should view Vanguard as their second home.
Graduate Student,5,Very easy process and military friendly. The staff is knowledgeable and respond to questions immediately. Everything was explained and easy to understand there were no delays.
Niche User,5,"My one visit at Vanguard was a great impression for me because I became more confident to apply and potentially become a part of the Lions family at Vanguard. They were able to make a good impression on me, and they showed us around their campus, which is openly Christian. They literally have their own church in the center of their campus, they serve good food, and they have pretty good athletics. Their resources are openly available, their staff is very friendly and helpful, and they even have their own campus patrol. Because of such a good impression, I now have Vanguard as one of my top choices to attend for university."
Freshman,5,"Vanguard University is quite the experience. It is a campus that is filled with lost spirits with the desire of hope. What I mean by this is, many come to Vanguard with broken pieces or just completely unsure of who they are but after being on campus they quickly realize that God has strategically placed them right where they are. Vanguard is filled with bright life's willing to take on the world with the sole flame of Jesus with-in them. If there was anything that should be changed with-in Vanguard it is definitely towards the food being provided. It is not that the food is bad, it just could be better. If all a campus needs to improve is foodservice, they must be doing something right. Vanguard is a home to many people who have discovered who they are. It is a school that not only excels with excellent professors and campus life, but a school that takes your purpose and morphs it into a future."
Freshman,5,"Vanguard is a great, Christian university. They have many programs that people can participate in based on their interests that range from sports to human trafficking prevention."
Freshman,5,"I like how the campus is small and everyone knows each other, it makes it very easy to get one on one help from professors."
Freshman,5,Your experience here at Vanguard will be a life changing experience in your life time. The diversity and the love that everyone has for each other is nothing short than amazing.
Sophomore,5,"Vanguard has amazing people, I have made great friends and I have enjoyed my time there. They make you feel welcome and the professors try their best to include everyone."
Sophomore,5,"Love the environment, and the Christian community. Such a small school, but it fits with my personality."
Freshman,5,"i loved Vanguard because the community is so heart warming, they are the type of school that want you to succeed and you matter to them so much."
Sophomore,5,Vanguard is amazing! This can only be said because I made it that way for myself. It is a small school but the people here are grand. Excellent Professors and staff. I wish it was a little more diverse but the students are still from various areas and walks of life. Finding friends that you connect with and joining school activities makes the strange and boring moments fade away!
Freshman,5,"I have no bad thoughts about Vanguard. The location there is perfect, the staff is so helpful, and you are guaranteed to graduate in 4 years!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Vanguard! The people are so kind, the staff and faculty are helpful, and the all around atmosphere is peaceful. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do. The cafeteria food could definitely be a little better!"
Freshman,5,Choosing to attend Vanguard was probably the best decision of my life. The school has really impacted my life in a good way. The community is very welcoming and it feels like home.
Graduate Student,5,What I loved most about Vanguard were the Professors and the close knit community embeded at Vanguard. The sense of unity and spiritually geared courses lead one to a greater sense of self and endurance in achieving one's goals for the sake of bettering our society.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love it here, it's everything that I could've hoped for. It's perfect for you if you want a small, Christian university. There are so many things to do in the area that you're never bored. The professors are very engaged with the students and are easy to reach out to."
Niche User,5,Amazing Campus! The professors seem great and many people to look forward to seeing. I love the diversity and the personal relationships everyone has with one another. I know that if I have the chance to attend this university I will be more than blessed the second I step on that campus. It is also a great school for any kind of liberal arts of Christian major. You will learn a great deal of information that you won't be able to find anywhere else. The campus is beautiful and always so clean. Thank God for an institution such as this.
Freshman,5,"Everything about Vanguard is beautiful. The community is so tight and well put together that it makes it impossible to not make friends, its the best college experience with small class sizes and professors that truly invest and care about your education. Being a Lion is one of the best moments in my life and I'm so proud to be part of this school."
Freshman,5,"I currently attend Vanguard and I could not be happier with my experience here! Everyone is so nice and it truly is a tight community. The staff is always willing to help you and are incredibly understanding. The classes are great, the people are great, and so is the social life"
Freshman,5,Vanguard University a university that focuses on forming a community and bringing everyone together to exalt our Lord and Savior. The purpose of this college is to integrate our education with the Christian worldview which has helped me figure out how I should live outside in the world.
College Freshman,5,"They have the best administration and students, everyone is so welcoming and loving. God trully moves through each class and everything the community is doing."
College Senior,5,Since drinking and doing drugs is not aloud in campus there have not been a large amount of sexual assault on campus it is taken very serious by staff and students
Junior,4,I am currently enrolled as a Junior at Vanguard University of Southern California. I have attended Vanguard University since my freshman year and have counted each year as a great blessing and milestone in my transition to independent adulthood.
Freshman,4,Vanguard University of Southern California is a small school with a very positive environment. The staff is very welcoming.
Alum,4,"Vanguard is not an entirely online school naturally, but it is doing its best during the COVID-19 situation."
Junior,4,"Online is good. Not really equipped to be an online school. However, the school does what it can to make sure everyone is getting a Christ-centered experience."
Freshman,4,"Vanguard is such a great community. If anything this school has a family feel to it. Everybody is super close because of the small size. The environment is a little hard to adapt to because of the fact that there was construction and often would change the campus feel. Somethings to look forward to when attending are Mock rock which is a lip sync competition between the classes. Shine which is our Wednesday night worship every week, and week of champs for the boys. Week of champs is literally a floor verse floor Olympic style event where the floors compete with each other for the championship and bragging rights. There are a lot of cool places around campus to hang out. Some cons to this school are the size. At times vanguard lacks that fresh new feel. It sometime feels routine. The gym was kind of upsetting being a major sports fan and a former athlete. Lastly the cafe. Though the new cafeteria is awesome, the old cafe was like vanguard diamond gem. So many memories were made there"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending this school and I am enjoying the fact that this is a Christian institution, meaning that faith is integrated with many of the subjects. I also love how there is a closeness among the students, including them encouraging and praying for each other. A few things I would like to see change is lowering of tuition to a more affordable amount and an increase in diversity."
Niche User,4,At Vanguard University there are a lot of friendly people. It is a nice school but their is not that much diversity. The campus is nice though and it is near the beach and Disneyland amusement park.
Senior,4,"Being in the class of 2020 at VU is very special. Vanguard has really grown me as a person because it’s taught me to integrate my faith into my practical life. From caring professors who mentor, to peers who earnestly listen, I can say I love this school. The presence of the spirit is strong in the chapels and this school has caused me to fall more in love with Jesus. One suggestion I have going forth is a concern involving parking, the library not being open on Saturday, and the fact that there’s no AC/heat in upperclassmen dorms. Other than that, I look forward to graduating and seeing what God has next for me!"
Freshman,4,This school is a unique school that is a friendly community and will provide all the help a student needs. This school is a campus that welcomes their students with their determined staff that want to see their students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I am a returning student to Vanguard University of Southern California. This upcoming fall I am happy to say I will be coming back as a sophomore. Vanguard University has proven to be an excellent school with diligent professors and tons of welcoming, excited students. Christianity is  highly taught on campus and all are encouraged to step deeper in their faith and walk with God. The campus is very nice and well kept despite the current construction for the new Student-Life building. If you are looking for an on-campus party seen, Vanguard, is definitely not your place. The city of Costa Mesa is very good for those who like to explore. The campus is an excellent distance from the beach, amusement parks, and many tourist attractions."
Sophomore,4,I'm currently going to this school still getting used to college life. The school is trying very hard to include everyone at the school. Professors are very good at making sure to help students. Always available when it's needed.
Sophomore,4,"This school is really good with academics, and learning more about being closer to God. This school has taught me to become closer with him. At first it was hard for me to find that relationship with him, but with all of those pastors and professors speaking about him was truly inspiring to me.  The students and staff are very friendly and care about one another. This makes me have a good experience at Vanguard so far."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the professors and community at Vanguard! However, there are of course a few things they could work on. The tuition is unfortunately very expensive as well as living on campus. Living on campus has been an amazing experience. However, it is also expensive."
Sophomore,4,I like that VU makes Christian Values of upmost importance in the staff and academics of the school. The campus is BEAUTIFUL and relatively small so the longest walks to class will not exceed more than a few minutes.
Senior,4,I think vanguard is a good private university to go to. They are pretty generous with their scholarships for students. The one thing I would like to see change in is the parking. We should have a parking structure added on the campus so that students don’t have to scramble to make it to class on time.
Freshman,4,It is  a very nice and beautiful school. All the students and faculty are supportive and have good positive vibes.
Freshman,4,"there is a bunch of construction and the food is not great, but the teachers care and the community is wonderful."
Sophomore,4,It creates an strong sense of who you want o become and will do anything to get you to graduate on time and has a strong religion afiliation. will make you feel like you belong but the food is the only thing but it is still an great school
Sophomore,4,"The professors, as well as other staff members, are highly intentional and caring when it comes to the students and even alumni of their university. It is often encouraged that students grab a coffee or meet with professors outside of class so that they may get to know you for the person that you are. When a friendship is achieved between professor and student usually the professor is more understanding when a family emergency occurs.  The counselors provide four-year plan guidelines that remove the stress of deciding which courses to enroll in. Campus life is very calm given that this is a private Christian university, in that there are no major parties but rather an emphasis on mental well being and academic achievement. As a resident, I would say my life has been relatively stress-free in that I am able to meet with professors outside of class at any hour."
Junior,4,"I love the overall environment, their morals on balancing quality education with Christian values. Even with this, I would like to see stronger diversity within the students, primarily in the African-American sector."
Junior,4,I like a vanguard University because the school is a great community and support system. Faculty and students are awesome and inspiring.
Sophomore,4,Vanguard University is a very welcoming place that encourages students to strive to be the best that they can be. The Christian environment is also very much appreciated. I have enjoyed my time here so far.
Freshman,4,"The one thing that i love about this school is the community. No matter who you are people come up to you and talk to you and love on you without even knowing you. I remember my first time coming to Vanguard and my first reaction was wow the people here are being too nice, but i began to realize that just how this campus in and it helped me transition easier into the college life."
Alum,4,"Vanguard University is a hidden gem. Although the school does not possess all the standard amenities provided by state universities, the humble setting offers the opportunity to foster relationships with faculty and staff that mirrors the bond that existed between Plato and Socrates. It's intimate. It's personal."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus. It is safe, close to the police station. There are many things to do here. The campus is small and the professors care about the students. They take time out of their schedule to try and help the students. Things that should change is to have more club involvement or clubs around campus. A little more diversity could be good, although they say there is diversity but most people are Caucasian. Most people here are also friendly and in this college there is SI and tutors that help you if you're struggling in classes"
Sophomore,4,"Attending a small Christian university is great since the professors actually care and help you out. Financial aid is also good, which is one of the reasons why I am attending Vanguard. I believe the college experience here is different from a public school but overall you get the experience you want."
Sophomore,4,"I feel like Vanguard is an excellent small college in a great location. The professors are engaging and competent, however, the college could be more organized in their accounting office."
Freshman,4,"I love how welcoming the environment. On the first day I moved in, I was immediately welcomed by people with friendly looking faces and constantly saying how happy they were to see that I was here at Vanguard. I also love how some of the classes are fairly small so I feel welcomed to express an opinion I have. The cafeteria food is alright, though I wish they had more gluten free options than they do right now. Other than that, Vanguard University is a very welcoming school for anyone and everyone."
Freshman,4,"My experience here at Vanguard University, I would say is very good. I'm learning new traditions. meeting new people, and making a difference where ever I go. The professors are very nice, and work with you on a personal one-on-one level. It is a great institution that is growing each and everyday."
Freshman,4,Such a helpful and caring place to live and study!!! Love it here! The people are so nice and they geniunely care for your success. There are so many opportunities to plug yourself in and become involved in the community!
Senior,4,"I attend Vanguard University and I am an involved student athlete. At Vanguard people are given many opportunities to succeed, but it is all about the work that the student is willing to put in. There are small class sizes, therefore it is easier for the professor to know you and help you individually; you are a name, not a number at this University. Knowing my professors on such personal basis makes it easier for me to understand and connect to the subject I am learning."
Sophomore,4,"Vanguard is great for students who want a small school with small class sizes and attention from their professors. In general, you won't receive the typical ""college experience"" as Vanguard doesn't really feel like a college campus. Not a ton going on in the way of activity, but there are lots of ways to get involved in the school. You will be required to attend church 30 times a semester at the school, so roughly twice a week, so be warned if this is not for you. The education itself is phenomenal and it feels like they really designed there programs with the students in mind. Overall, it's a good school, though not as amazing as what you could find elsewhere"
Freshman,4,"Vanguard University is a small private Christian University. The campus is very clean, the people are friendly, and the teachers genuinely care about their classes and get to know the students."
Freshman,4,Vanguard is a great place to attend. The campus is really beautiful and everyone here is so nice. From what i have heard the athletics are good. Two pitchers from here were drafted to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Every teacher likes to take the time with each student and make themselves accessible so every students can get one on one time. Everyone likes to go to chapel and just be themselves. Vanguard is a place where you can really be yourself because everyone is so accepting.  
College Junior,4,Professors are approachable and easy to talk to if a question needs to be answered. Most classes range from 20 to 30 students.
College Junior,4,"The university has a strong campus security; therefore, students should feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,"The professors are cool there will be some you wont like or wont like you, but that is life.. The calsses are small and teachers know each individual student most don't care if you bring technology to class.. The registration for classes is always a hassle, but we register before we go on break so we never have to worry about forgetting to do it. Depending on the class and teacher will determine work load. I hardly ever study"
College Senior,4,You get a lot of connections
College Senior,4,"I think all courses are great and I do believe that some professors have favorites, but I love some of the classes and teachers want you to communicate and succeed."
College Sophomore,4,I love all my proffessors.
College Sophomore,4,All of the sports at Vanguard are exceptional.
College Freshman,4,Small and you feel noticed and not just a number. Students and professors are very friendly. School is nice and clean and the air is always fresh.
College Senior,4,I am very busy with my program but I will support
College Sophomore,4,I think that I will be successful with the help from vanguard.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy all of my classes.
College Sophomore,4,I have had no problems with it.
College Sophomore,4,I love being close to friends and enjoying campus life.
College Freshman,4,the faculty cares a lot about students futures.
College Freshman,4,Sports are very important at USC
College Freshman,4,Having the fire department and police station by my school makes me feel safe.
College Freshman,4,"I made an account with the career center, and I receive email updates about possible career options on campus, which is what I wanted."
College Freshman,4,All the professors want their students to succeed.  They are committed to helping their students understand the material well and provide their contact information so that they can be reached easily.  Class sizes are much smaller than other schools which is perfect for me.
College Freshman,4,The social atmosphere at the dorms is friendly and encouraging.  Dorm price is reasonable for the most part.
College Freshman,4,"Whenever there are big, important games happening, the students advertise them and encourage students to watch.  They even ask students to wear white to support too."
College Freshman,4,My school has a motivating and encouraging atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,The police department is next to the school so its a very safe environment.
College Freshman,4,The career center is very helpful. They help you with your resume and give you interview tips.
College Junior,4,"Vanguard had not been my first choice when I was considering which college to attend, but the longer I've been here, the more I've fallen in love with the school.  The community is absolutely fantastic.  I have made such amazing friendships here, both with students and professors.  Academics are decent, but the school's strength is in its camaraderie among the people. During my time here, not only have I learned from the courses I have taken, but I have also learned many lessons about life that cannot be taught in a classroom.   I love being a student here.  Lots of fun, very safe, easy to make friends and get plugged in, awesome professors who truly care about their students, wonderful location.  Vanguard is 10 minutes from the beach and 15 minutes from Disneyland!  I love it here."
College Sophomore,4,My professors are amazing and very involved and interested in my academic success!
College Sophomore,4,I love my school and the community I'm apart of.
Alum,2,The cost was way too high for what you get out of it. The teachers and staff are very friendly and good people but the programs are lacking.
Freshman,2,It was hard online because you lose the feel of being in class and often became distracted or have no intent or motivation to be there
College Freshman,2,Vanguard doesn't have a Greek life.
College Freshman,2,Ii. Was getting blame for things I did not do being bulled of the color of my race by the females in my dorm  called races names
College Freshman,2,"With being in Orange County, living is very expensive especially for a college student."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, I knew more than the advisors for aid."
College Junior,2,"Even if we're of legal age, students are not allowed to drink (even off campus or on break). This seems unfair to me since I believe sometimes alcohol can be a part of a cultural experience. Drinking probably does cut down on sexual assaults on campus but at the same time being so strict on alcohol just means students become more crafty on how to get around the rules."
Recent Alumnus,2,a lot of room for improvement
College Sophomore,2,it is a small school so there isn't much jobs on campus
Recent Alumnus,2,there is no nightlife on campus. go off campus somewhere for the nightlife fun
College Sophomore,2,There is not many options for transportation.
College Sophomore,2,Drugs and alcohol are hardly seen on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are willing to spend a LOT of money on housing, it's better to live on campus. Housing in Orange County is spendy."
College Freshman,2,"Eh, the food is not the best. You get tired of it, fast. However, there are tons of food places around campus."
College Junior,2,"The facilities do need to be upgraded. There are several newer buildings, however there are also a lot of older temporary style buildings that I feel should be replaced, considering the amount of money it cost to attend Vanguard."
College Junior,2,"Since more and more kids keep attending the school each year their are fewer and fewer parking spaces. I haven't had a car on campus yet, so this year might be a little frustrating for me trying to park"
College Sophomore,2,"if you're into sitting in your dorm all every weekend, Vanguard is the place for you."
College Sophomore,2,"awful. 
the cafe has no variety..we have a salad bar with lettuce that tastes like it's never been rinsed.
 they don't believe in any seasoning or flavor. 
grilled chicken, every night. 
One time, we had turkey burgers for dinner and the next morning they used the buns to make french toast, yeah seeds and all.
HORRIBLE!"
College Junior,2,"They have a financial adi office, but I still felt just as lost applying for financial aid or how to get it."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, the campus building are pretty old and small. We don't have a nice gym like most colleges and there is only one option for eating. We also have a small store for things like chips, candy, and other small snacks. The bookstore is relatively small, but it has most essentials. The student government plans lots of events, some are popular others not so much. The sporting events are usually well attended by students."
Alum,1,I’m tired. I’ve finally paid off the school after I was kicked out from financial troubles and now they say that I have no units or credit acquired. At this point this school has been the worst decision of my life and I’m just so tired now.
College Freshman,1,There are not party's that include any form of legal substances at my school.
College Freshman,1,They did not help  me at all
College Freshman,1,They wasn't trying to her my side of things so I left the college
College Freshman,1,Ii was liked out for a white girl threatened me and she didn't get kicked out I don't think that's a fair she was bulling me
College Freshman,1,I just felt like it was rasisum involved
College Freshman,1,They didn't treat me far the students we're very rasist
College Junior,1,There is no greek life which is unfortunate. I wish there was.
College Junior,1,"From what I've seen there is no ""party scene"" here in Costa Mesa. There are mostly bars nearby and no really good places to dance unless you drive to LA or San Diego."
College Freshman,1,"It's a Christian school, so any other religion won't be tolerated.  Also, if your sexual orientation is anything but heterosexual, you are banned from practicing it during your tenure at the school.  Student's are not allowed to engage in homosexuality at all.  In terms of political beliefs, most people are very socially conservative, and not accepting of other beliefs."
College Freshman,1,"The actual freshman dorms are horrible.  The Laguna building is actually the most unsafe building in the city of Costa Mesa.  There is no air conditioning so it gets really hot, the furniture is very poorly constructed, there is no recycling on campus at all, the elevators are broken most of the time, and the rooms are literally falling apart.  My shower door actually came unhinged as I was opening it and fell off of the shower.  The social atmosphere in the dorms is what you make of it, but it really depends on your floor.  Hopefully you have chill people who aren't going to rat to your RA about your life, but in most cases that's not true.  Hopefully your RA is chill but the chances of that happening are slim."
College Freshman,1,"Residence Life is the absolute worst.  They're literally just out to get everybody.  If you go to Vanguard look forward to random room searches, strict no drinking/drugs policy, strict no tobacco policy, and strict no public dancing policy."
College Freshman,1,there is not greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is NOT a party scene
Recent Alumnus,1,not any I was eligible for
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking for a school with a party scene - Vanguard is not your school.  We do have social lives, and enjoy parties, dancing, hanging out... but let’s just say that we are sober and enjoying one another’s company more than the substance."
Recent Alumnus,1,we don't have greek life. I wish we did!
College Freshman,1,No greek life at all.
College Freshman,1,we don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,"The school is very serious about drug use, drinking, or any partying for that matter. You sign a code of contact at the beginning of the year saying you wont engage in sexual activity before marriage, drinking, or drug use. The school enforces this contract very strictly and if you are busted you pay the consequences."

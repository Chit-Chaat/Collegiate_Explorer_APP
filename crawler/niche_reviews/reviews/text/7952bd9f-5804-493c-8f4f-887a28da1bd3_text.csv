Senior,5,"When covid hit the professors did their best to have the transition to online classes go smoothly while making sure their students health, mental and physical, we okay and all their needs were being meant."
Senior,5,My experience at Mount Holyoke was excellent. I grew so much as a person while having the best time of my life there. All the students and faculty are so friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,5,Mount Holyoke is a great school with some excellent faculty! People are super friendly and it is very easy to make friends. The academics side is good and you have a lot of options to choose your courses and explore your interests!  The campus is beautiful. Would totally recommend MHC
Sophomore,5,"I think professors did what they could. Considering the situation we are all in, I would not complain about anything!"
Niche User,5,"I was interested in Mount Holyoke because my mom went there. We toured, and I like it there a lot, enough to apply there. I applied early decision, and I was accepted! Yay! I like the college's atmosphere, and the traditions. I also know that I will be challenged there."
Alum,5,"At Mount Holyoke, the professors are incredibly smart and have the ability to teach on a level that is both challenging and nurturing. It is small enough that I felt a presence on campus and large enough that I felt I was part of a greater community. The students here are kind and considerate and treat each other with respect."
Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke College has such an accepting and welcoming community. Everyone here is super friendly, and there's no shortage of student clubs and organizations to get involved with. All my professors are engaging and responsive, and they push me to do my best. The food is really nice -- anyone who complains about it doesn't know what college food is usually like, imo. The dorms do vary by size and location, but I'm very happy with where I ended up (Torrey). I was wary of coming here at first, because I wanted to stay in-state, but now I couldn't be happier with my choice. Even though I'm far from my family, Mount Holyoke has become my MoHome!"
Sophomore,5,I love the opportunity to take courses at any of the five colleges which Mount Holyoke College is a part of. It opens up many options to choose from and take a variety of interesting courses.
Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke really feels like my dream school. It is a lovely campus, with plenty to keep you busy. Everyone is extremely welcoming and willing to help you with anything you need help with. I cannot wait to spend the next four years here!"
Junior,5,"Mount Holyoke College is  a truly wonderful learning and living environment. The community is supportive and collaborative, which pushes students to enjoy learning and take risks. Faculty care about student success and work closely with students in and out of the classroom. The campus is beautiful, with old and new buildings that match the overall feel of the college."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Holyoke has excellent classes and professors, however, the school could hire more professors to make it easier to get into classes (shorten the waitlists). Many of the professors are very dedicated to their research and teaching. The school could also be more transparent about their diversity initiative and have more ways of incorporating the diversity into the life of the campus instead of leaving that for the 'diversity' to do."
Junior,5,"I love Mount Holyoke College (MHC) more and more with each school year! As a physics and dance double-major, I have spent much time in both departments. While I cannot say that they have exceeded my expectations, I have enjoyed studying in both. The individuals that I have met, mainly through dance, have become some of my closest friends. MHC students are open-minded, intelligent, and diverse. The school is far from perfect and has much room for improvement. For one, it can do a better job in being transparent with its students when it comes to alerting us about campus safety, specifically considering our recent issues. I would also appreciate if MHC made a better effort to unite students from different backgrounds."
Sophomore,5,"I’ve never felt more at home than I do at Mount Holyoke. The classes are academically challenging, without being so overwhelming that you don’t have time for other activities. The professors are accessible, know a lot about what they teach, and really care about their students succeeding. It isn’t a major party school, but they aren’t nonexistent. Athletics also exist and you can be a part of it if you want, but it’s not an enormous facet like it is at other schools.
If you’re looking for a school with a gorgeous campus, accepting environment, great academics, and an AWESOME dining hall then look no further. South Hadley is a small town, but I love how cozy and safe feeling it is. Plus, the PVTA can take you to busier nearby towns when you want to get away or Boston isn’t far. Some dorms are better than others, but they’re still good. Overall, as students we really have it good here and I am proud to have chosen to attend."
Alum,5,"Mount Holyoke provides a rigorous, intellectually stimulating undergraduate experience on a gorgeous campus in an area with 40,000 students. Women learn to be thoughtful leaders and are well prepared for elite graduate schools and careers in both corporate and not-for-profit organizations. As the oldest women's college in the country, the school has a huge and diverse community of alumnae that stand ready to help any young graduate make their mark on the world. South Hadley is a sleepy town, with a big window on the whole world, due to the college's large international student population and the popularity of studying overseas during one or two semesters. I loved it."
Alum,5,"Graduated 4 years ago, still recalling my time there with great fondness. Mount Holyoke is truly a special place, where a strong sisterhood is actively fostered by the various traditions that Mount Holyoke strives to keep. The academics is absolutely rigorous, and I am still constantly in touch with my professors, who have become mentors in life. I understand as a single sex college, Mount Holyoke (along with others) are struggling to define themselves in this time and age. But I truly believe the single sex environment helps women find their own voice and realize we are capable of everything."
Senior,5,"Mount Holyoke is an amazing college filled with amazing people. The opportunities for personal growth and community betterment are vast and varied. While not perfect for everyone, every woman-aligned individual should consider Mount Holyoke, where every aspect of your life can flourish."
Alum,5,It's an empowering environment where you are encouraged to step out of your comfort zone. Many caring professors even after graduation!
Sophomore,5,"It took me a semester to actually figure out what I was doing, but I eventually found out what was going on, where things were, and people I could hang out with. The education is absolutely stellar. I've been made to think about things that I never would have thought about, and think about other things in ways that I would not have. The academics are unmatched. It is hard, but if you like a challenge, you will be challenged. If you haven't fit in anywhere, that simple fact will make you fit in at MHC, but you will still maintain  your uniqueness."
Sophomore,5,"The student body, for the most part, is passionate, caring, and active. They speak out, even when it means speaking out against the administration."
Freshman,5,It is very welcoming and the professors care for you. The professors want to see you succeed and will help you. They notice when you are not in class. You are a name and not a number.
Senior,5,Mount Holyoke is a good school. The campus has very diverse students who are willing to share their stories. I got learn about the world through the students I have met here.
Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke is such an amazing and supportive place. The professors our outstanding and the students are so kind, genuine, and passionate. I really feel like I am becoming a better person every day I am here."
Alum,5,"Mount Holyoke is not for everyone, but as a nascent liberal academically-minded feminist, it was the perfect place for me to explore my identity and politics in a friendly, safe, and welcoming space. Professors were amazing. It was a bit of a cocoon, for better or for worse - by my final semester, I was very ready to leave - but in retrospect, I could not have picked a better college for me. It will always have a place in my heart."
Alum,5,"I went to Mount Holyoke even though it is a women’s college but ended up valuing it so deeply because it is a women’s college.  I learned to use my voice.  I learned to work hard.   I felt valued, supported, and challenged all at once.  Mount Holyoke truly changed the course of my life.  I am deeply grateful."
Alum,5,Wonderful place to explore interests and encounter challenging ideas; academically rigorous; tight-knit community steeped in tradition; very small and self-selective.
Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke College is a top notch women's college that offers diversity and supurb academics. The professors are amazing, knowledgeable and make each class interesting. Everyone going to Mount Holyoke takes their academics very seriously and are accepting and friendly. The campus is beautiful and there is a lot of history within this small college. I would highly recommend to any woman who wants a quality education to go to Mount Holyoke College."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Holyoke College has a beautiful campus and an even more beautiful community. Every student I have met is engaged in their coursework, active in both the community and the world, and is supportive to each other. The teachers ensure you get a wonderful education during your time there and go above and beyond."
Sophomore,5,"I'm big on academics so that is what I based my rating on. The counselors know how to guide students into the right direction in terms of what career they see themselves occupying; if students are not sure of their path, there are a plethora of classes to take to figure it out. Besides the academics, there are Division 3 sports and recreational sports including basketball, volleyball, field hockey, and many others. The location of the school is more on the suburban side but there are buses that come everyday (some free ones!) that take students off campus and into more city atmospheres. In addition, students can take classes at other schools in the area that not only count for credit but allow for students to make more friends."
Junior,5,"Mount Holyoke College is an oasis of learning in itself. It is a wonderful environment for all types of people, especially because of its liberal environment. It is a space to explore self-identity and to be accepted in every step of the way. It is a place where your academic passions across the board meet, as requirements for completing a major are well-paced and there is plenty of space to explore passions outside your major. The campus is relatively small and accessible from all residence halls. Faculty and staff are renowed and more available to students here than anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Holyoke College is a lovely, accepting institution. It creates a beautiful community of bright students who engage in rigorous academic discourse in and out of the classroom. Though at times the administration is a bit self-serving and secretive, all the positives outweigh this part. My only suggestion is that they make good on their promise of being a liberal and progressive institution by becoming a sanctuary campus and divesting from fossil fuels. But otherwise it is a great place for a student wanting an academic challenge and looking for a loving community that will be supportive and understanding no matter your background."
Freshman,5,"At Mount Holyoke College, everyone is really nice and the academics are of high ranking. You are introduced to new programs and connections with other colleges as well. They also have a variety of majors and courses to choose from and along with it comes helpful advising and encouragement form peers and staff.  During the day, you see the seasonal change in the environment around and breathe in the fresh air. Also, to help with stress, professors are amazing with helping with whatever you need."
Freshman,5,"I 'm coming as a freshman; however, I have visited campus and meet some of the students and faculty members.  They all were very welcoming to students  in the program I attended. They atmosphere is very friendly and peaceful. Professors allowed us to attend their classes and we were able to ask questions. Overall, an excellent experience, and I can't wait till I become an official freshman."
Sophomore,5,"Mount Holyoke provides multiple opportunities for students to thrive academically. Internships, study abroad, research opportunities, Mount Holyoke has it all!"
Alum,5,"Mount Holyoke College is a liberal arts college located in South Hadley, MA. Its student community is comprised of people from across the world and from all different backgrounds and identities. The thing they have in common is a striving for excellence and a pursuit for justice and ethical practices. The professors employed at MHC are incredibly qualified on the whole, and give ample instruction and direction to students. MHC is also a part of the 5-College Consortium, which allows students to take courses at the neighboring Smith College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and University of Massachusetts, Amherst."
Sophomore,5,"I just completed my first year at Mount Holyoke and I really love it there. The professors really care about their students, and the campus is beautiful."
Senior,5,"Mount Holyoke College is the best decision I have ever made! There is a huge variety in terms of nightlife on campus and off. Whatever Mount Holyoke and South Hadley lack, the other college towns and schools make up for. The best professors you'll find. Great sense of community. Wonderful traditions. It feels like a summer camp with homework."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Mount Holyoke has been exemplary so far! The academics are hard, but fair. The professors are dedicated to their work and their students, and most of the people are genuinely excited to learn and change the world."
Niche User,5,"Mount Holyoke is a fantastic women's college in Massachusetts. I visited in March 2015, and I had a wonderful experience. Campus is beautiful, the people are friendly, our tour guide was extremely competent, and I came away feeling inspired."
Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke College is an amazing institution. The faculty and staff are amazing, the students are brilliant, and the campus and facilities are wonderful. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love every single professor I've had and I've enjoyed every class, even one's outside of my major that I was taking just to fill a requirement. Only thing is - I wish there was a larger variety of classes offered."
College Sophomore,5,I feel unbelievably safe on my campus because it is a small women's college in a rural area.
College Junior,5,"While Mount Holyoke College is far from perfect, it has been a place where I feel physically and emotionally safe; the things that matter most to me are the things that the school offers: kind students of diverse backgrounds and identities, academic support, physical safety initiatives, and basic needs of daily living (food, water, living space) are all met.  These are the things that matter most to me that I have been satisfied with at Mount Holyoke College.  I absolutely love the athletics program, which is another important piece of the experience to me.  The fact that I have been able to compete alongside like-minded caring individuals towards a common goal of teamwork and success has been a privilege to me that I greatly appreciate.  After I leave MHC, I will have these friends who I met on and off the athletic fields.  The relationships will surely remain even after I graduate, which is very valuable to me.  This ability to make lasting connections with kind, inspiring, likeminded and caring individuals is an aspect of the school that I will forever me thankful for no matter what minor flaws the institution has."
College Junior,5,"I am so fortunate to be able to be a varsity athlete at Mount Holyoke College, and I am grateful for all of the athletic opportunities available for students like myself."
College Junior,5,I never thought that I would enjoy school as much as I do at Mount Holyoke.
College Junior,5,"Very diverse along every dimension except politically, although if your party is inherently exclusive to minorities I don't really think it should count."
College Junior,5,"I've chosen a very in-demand field, but I've heard from other students that it's fairly easy to find a good job in their fields as well."
College Junior,5,Couldn't be any more grateful that I was able to transfer to this amazing school.
College Junior,5,"Probably the only thing students are afraid of when walking across campus at night is the ghost of a past student, rumored to haunt the campus."
College Junior,5,"Some dorms are better than others, but even the ""bad"" dorms are for sure way above the national average."
College Junior,5,The athletic facility is very new and updated.
College Junior,5,"I was a transfer student and I can't begin to explain how much better my life is going to Mount Holyoke. I'm challenged, intrigued, and happy."
College Junior,5,Great diversity as far as nationality/identity goes. Very liberal campus.
College Junior,5,"Great classes, small size, brilliant professors who are kind and welcoming."
College Junior,5,"We live in palaces, practically. Love my dorm, second year running."
College Junior,5,Can't imagine myself anywhere else.
College Junior,5,I've never felt unsafe on campus. I study in the library past 12am almost every night and have never felt uncomfortable walking back to my dorm alone. MHC feels like a safe haven.
College Freshman,5,"In one of my classes, international students made up 99% of the class. People have varying religious, political, sexual and gendered views but everyone is accepted, except when some people try to pretend to be very ""woke""."
College Freshman,5,"If you don't drink, you'll still have as much fun even more than those that do. Also, drug use is frowned upon even by the student body, except for weed and tobacco cigarettes, so if you are caught with any hard substances you'll get in serious trouble."
College Freshman,5,"Mount Holyoke's campus housing is by far the most beautiful I have ever seen. Many of the buildings are older and have a lot of character. Despite the age of the buildings, they are updated on the inside without losing any of the charm. Doubles range in size, but most are fairly large. Many of the singles are also on the larger side. The housing system is very practical, and the Residential Life staff tries very hard to place compatible roommates together. The campus housing is also very unique, in that several housing buildings contain dining halls within them. The Residential Life staff who reside in the dorms are known as Community Advisers, and they create such a positive sense of community within their respective halls and floors."
College Freshman,5,"I have not been at Mount Holyoke College very long, but already I feel as though the college has made me into a better person. The academics have challenged me intellectually, and have made me expand my boundaries. The professors truly want their students to get more out of class than just a good grade. They want everyone to move out of their comfort zones and learn beyond the materials. As a women's college, Mount Holyoke is very empowering and truly believes in the value of all the students there. It has been so accepting of every student, not regardless of, but because of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin. The diversity of Mount Holyoke is something the school prides itself on in addition to academic success. Both of these characteristics of the school have challenged my general belief systems, and made me think more about the state of the world, and what I can do to change it. As a first-year student, Mount Holyoke is already empowering me to confront injustices, and make a change for the better."
Sophomore,4,"Mount Holyoke College is a great historically women liberal arts college that has great academics, and an amazing community, a strong athletic program, and a fun dining hall."
Sophomore,4,I found my home here at mount holyoke. The people I met for classmates and professors were amazing and the community is really what made Mount Holyoke special. The team of faculty is sometimes hard to communicate with.
Freshman,4,"Establishing myself at MHC was pretty easy, people were very friendly and understanding  with me coming in. I was scared being away from my family and home, but I grew and found another place to call home in MHC, and the students and professors became my family."
Freshman,4,"The online classes I took were not meant to be online. because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the campus closed down, forcing all classes to go online. it was hard at first as it was very unexpected for the professors making them less prepared and difficult. but, as weeks went by, it slowly got easier as I entered a routine."
Sophomore,4,"It is a PWI and I would love for a greater emphasis on diversity and inclusion, and not just for show, but rather to create a lasting change where Black and Brown voices are heard and prioritized just as much as White voices. I love the campus, the classes, and most of the professors are great and really understanding, the area can be quite boring, and the party scene is not that great. Most people take the PVTA to Northampton or Amherst for parties, events, and general outings."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed my 1.5 semesters but often found my time on campus to be very lonely. It does have a very beautiful campus  and the counseling services were very good and attentive.
Sophomore,4,"I love MHC. Students here are able to take initiative and play an active role in forming their education. I would, however, like to see financial aid become a bit more inclusive."
Alum,4,"MHC is a truly unique experience! As a historically women's college, it provides students with many wonderful traditions, as well as loads of opportunities that traditionally co-ed schools do not offer. Minority voices are held in higher regard, and students take charge of their own futures. The administration could use some turnover, as it does not fully and/or accurately represent the student body. Some departments (STEM) receive more funding than others, which is unfortunate, but predictable. However, I found the community to be wonderfully passionate and loving."
Freshman,4,"I love how safe I feel at school! There are so many resources for students to tap into, and the campus is GORGEOUS. I constantly feel lucky for being there. It took less than a month to be calling the campus home! 

You can feel some divides between some student groups, but you find your tribe after getting used to the environment. I often find myself forgetting I go to a gender-inclusive college!"
Sophomore,4,"Mount Holyoke is a great community. The classes can be challenging but the professors care about your success and will help you along the way. My main issue is dining, the food is alright but it is never properly labeled which has led to allergic reactions or just people eating things that is against their beliefs. Also, because the buildings are old things are often broken or there are a lot of bugs."
Alum,4,I really liked my time there. The psychology department was nice and I was able to access some research opportunities there.
Freshman,4,"Mount Holyoke College is an incredibly tight knit and supportive community. The dining hall food is gourmet with lots of variety and the trees and nature surrounding it is gorgeous. My only complaint is that the location of the school is not in a typical college town, so ordering pizza is difficult because there aren't too many places nearby."
Freshman,4,"Overall good. academics are challenging but I learn a lot. food is really bad. the campus is really beautiful, esp in the fall even in the winter when it snows outside."
Freshman,4,I like the athletic department and how much they genuinely care about you as a student and an athlete. I would like to see better financial aid!
Freshman,4,"Before arriving at Mount Holyoke, my thoughts on Mount Holyoke were neutral as I knew only the basics of the college. I only knew my roommates name, my advisor and my the classes I had registered for. Over the course of freshman year, I have realized how grateful I am to be attending this school."
Senior,4,There are a lot of unique experiences here. It offers a tough curriculum and a community of intellectuals. A great women's college.
Alum,4,"I am so thankful for my experience at MHC! I graduated a few months ago and am missing its beautiful campus, dedicated and motivated students, caring professors, and the over-all learning/classroom experience."
Freshman,4,"The professors are excellent teachers, and very caring about each student. In terms of grading, they tend to be rigorous but fair. The college environment generally is also multicultural and very supportive. However, the location is quite isolated and there is very little to do outside of campus."
Freshman,4,"August 31st, 2018 I officially became a Freshman at MHC and it's currently September 26, 2018, almost a month into my ""Firstie"" experience, and I have really made the right choice in coming here from South Florida. From the people I've met and the friends I've made to the amazing vegan food in the Dining Commons (A.K.A Super Blanche), my experience here has been nothing short of stimulating. My classes are mostly small, my largest class has over 30 students, my residence hall and dorm are large and inviting. Everyone here is kind and accepting and you can really feel and see the community. I also work in the Dining Commons 3x a week, for Work Study, and it is manageable and fits perfectly into my schedule. There are regular parties and events both on and off campus and the PVTA takes students almost everywhere. Anyone considering MHC or not sure if it's the place for them should do as much research as possible, and feel free to contact me personally >> brayn22a@mtholyoke.edu"
Sophomore,4,"Mount Holyoke is an incredible college that I’m lucky to attend. In my first year of attending Mhc, I’ve done incredible things and I’m excited to see where my next three years take me."
Sophomore,4,"Mount Holyoke is a gorgeous school with an incredible academic program, historic traditions, and of course, M&C's. As a historically women's college, I thought I would miss being at a co-ed school. However, this is not the case. I love being in an environment I feel comfortable in and was able to make friends I really care about. I am giving Mount Holyoke a 4 out of 5 stars because, although I love it, it still has its issues. I wish Mount Holyoke had a more diverse faculty, especially in regards to the history program. I also wish that I had received more financial aid, though many people I know are very happy with the amount they receieved."
Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed the atmosphere of non competitiveness with other students. The only one you're agains is yourself to achieve higher standards than previously. The campus is beautiful and there are many small study areas that are perfect hunker down in.
Freshman,4,Mount Holyoke College is an amazing school for those seeking a liberal arts education. Students are given the opportunity to take different types of classes and explore the various departments at the college. Class sizes are small which allows for more one on one time with professors who make the time to get to know you. The Mount Holyoke College community is accepting of individuals from all backgrounds which fosters a good living-learning relationship among students at the college.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Mount Holyoke was overall very good. I played varsity basketball and was very connected with the athletics on campus. It is a very diverse school with a lot of great people.
Freshman,4,"I have only been here for two months, but I am very confident that I made the right decision in coming here. The campus is absolutely gorgeous. MHC is consistently ranked in the top 10 for best campus and nicest dorms. Professors here want to be here teaching and helping their students. There are so many programs throughout the week to make MHC students more successful in their classes, internships, interviews, and future jobs. We have over 100 clubs, so there is something for everyone. Traditions such as Mountain Day, Founders Day, Elfing, First Year Plants, and Pangy Day enrich the campus and connect current students to past generations. Attending a women's college and specifically MHC has bolstered my confidence and self esteem."
Freshman,4,I love MoHo for its diversity and career education but don’t put me in a double room that is as big as a single room.
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful - both in the fall and winter. It's basically like going to Hogwarts. Mount Holyoke is also very generous with financial aid, especially for international students as they're also working towards increasing the diversity on campus. I genuinely prefer the small class sizes in contrast to the large lecture halls in other colleges because the professors actually get to know their students and vice versa which comes in handy when it comes to letter of recommendations."
Sophomore,4,"Good school. Interesting vibe, and had a hard first semester, but when I figure out how to go off campus on the weekend, joined a sports team it became a lot better."
Senior,4,Mount Holyoke is a great school if you're looking for  community and academics. The area is pretty quiet though but you can go into Amherst or Northampton to do more.
Sophomore,4,Mount Holyoke is an incredibly diverse and inclusive community. My experience here has been nothing but positive. The academics are interesting and challenging and the professors are easy to talk to.
Sophomore,4,"Mount Holyoke is a liberal environment with more conservative administration. Its a really good school for academics, but get to be studying all the time. There is a stress culture here. The student body is wonderful, but the administration is not so wonderful. If you have a problem that needs to be solved get ready to be aggravated.  Also housing is mostly singles and doubles. The rooms are nice for some of the dorms, others are very small and uncomfortable. I wish that they had more suite/ apartment living. Another thing is when you randomly get assigned a roommate, its a hit or complete miss and then its nearly impossible to try and move because of roommate complications."
Sophomore,4,I like the type of people I meet at Mount Holyoke. I would like to see a change in the school's form of support to help its students in the Accessibility's department.
College Sophomore,4,My best experience ever. Love Mandelles.
College Sophomore,4,My college is great. I am a transfer student so I am pretty consent with my choice now. This college has a really friendly community.
College Sophomore,4,The best part about this school is its intellectually engaging atmosphere and the strong sense of community and empowerment that comes from experiencing life at an all women's college. I gleaned a lot of useful knowledege from interactive class discussions. The teachers are quite helpful and supportive and I have made great friends!
College Sophomore,4,"The experience in dorms can vary widely. I had a great room in my first year with a window seat, a beautiful view and a building with a dining hall. Many of the rooms have beautiful features and no dorm is more than 10 minutes from the center of campus. There can be unusually small rooms, but many rooms are much bigger than you'd expect a dorm room to be. I love the social atmosphere of dorm life because there's always someone you know in common spaces, but even the party dorms are mellow enough for people like me who need quiet."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the accepting, safe environment at my school. I've met amazing people and had great experiences with all of my professors and staff that I've encountered. I get the impression that my school genuinely cares about me as a student across all departments. The only downsides to my college are the distance from my home and the high cost of tuition."
College Junior,4,"Mount Holyoke College has a strong alumni network from what I have heard.  Currently, I do not have a lot of knowledge about employers recruiting on campus or the career services.  This is something that I plan to look into as an upperclassman this upcoming academic year."
College Junior,4,"The Lottery process is somewhat confusing, especially for first-year students choosing for their sophomore year room assignments.  I have also found that certain Community Advisors are more lenient on rules than others and do not enforce rules consistently.  However, a lot of Community Advisors are great and helpful while encouraging a social atmosphere through hall and/or floor events for residents to attend."
College Junior,4,"It depends on what you're looking for. There's an *amazing* queer party scene that's inclusive to those who aren't queer, but you won't find a lot of dorm parties with boys."
College Junior,4,I haven't really heard of anyone doing anything besides weed.
College Junior,4,Alumnae network is top notch. Career center is definitely a useful tool.
College Junior,4,"Great Title IV protections, beautiful facilities that are accessible to athletes, non athletes and the at-large community."
College Junior,4,"I always miss MHC over breaks. The professors care about students and want them to succeed. MHC is definitely not an easy school, getting straight As requires a lot of hard work and dedication."
College Junior,4,"I love living on campus! There are amazing dorms and there are also dorms that are a little rustic. I have been a Community Advisor, so I loved being able to see how the residential buildings bring people closer. I've made so many new friends only because of my housing."
College Junior,4,"As I am halfway done with college, I have realized that I love Mount Holyoke. The campus is beautiful and everyone is very supportive and understanding. The teachers care about their students, from an academic and a personal standpoint. It can sometimes feel small, but the local bus system (PVTA) can take you off campus to the other colleges in the consortium or it can take you to the nearby towns (Amherst and Northampton). Mount Holyoke has made me more confident."
College Sophomore,4,"This school has made me realize things about myself that I wasn't aware of before college. I am more accepting, more articulate, and more empowered due to my first year here. I feel supported by my peers and professors everyday."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are really dedicated t teaching, atleast so far in my experience but they do give a lot of work! And some professors tend to have this skewed impression that only their class matters. But just be prepared to study, think and you'll be fine. And you can still have fun on some weekends too. But rarely, if ever, do you see people going out for parties during the week."
College Freshman,4,"Things are generally safe here,obviously don't leave your stuff unattended for too long but there's a 5% chance it would go missing. Campus Police installed these blue help signals around campus and tbh I go to my dorm ,which is the farthest, at 2am and still feel very safe but just be attentive and alert."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are not the central focus at Mount Holyoke, but they are greatly supported by students, staff, the administration, and even the faculty. There's never a shortage of involvement on and off the field for student athletes, whose teams of choice are treated equally and respectfully. The athletics facility is well-maintained, and offers high-quality equipment for teams. The school prides itself on its equestrian center, which is ranked as one of the best facilities in the country. Fans support both varsity and club sports with the same level of enthusiasm. As a rider for Mount Holyoke, I have found that the attention given to sports teams is more than adequate without taking away from the other parts of campus culture that deserve to be regarded with great care."
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus police are highly responsive and available. They have a number of programs designed to educate students about sexual assault, personal safety, and self-defense. A significant number of crimes on campus involve students from off-campus and alcohol at cross-campus parties. I feel pretty safe on campus and in the dorm. However, coming from a big city background, I don't think you should drop your guard when walking alone even in the most idylic setting."
College Sophomore,4,"This school falls into a ""baby ivy"" zone that allows access to top grad schools. The alumnae associate is intensely committed. I am only now exploring the possibilities of off-campus internships and school connections."
College Sophomore,4,"My time at Mt. Holyoke has proved that I am able to meet the emotional and intellectual challenges that happen at college and come up with my own solutions. I have learned to self-advocate, to live diplomatically with others, and to find my place in a highly energized pool of incredibly intelligent, strong-willed women. I find my classes and instructors challenging and our intellectual interactions pleasurable. The school has built a live-work space for us that bonds us in our standards of excellence as much as in sentimental ties to time and place."
College Student,4,Um... I think drug kind of is impossible to absolutely eliminated
College Student,4,"We have a lot of sports here. Horsemanship, golf and a lot of other games."
College Student,4,"I have to say that Mount Holyoke is a super amazing college, which give me extraordinary experience out of classes. Doing something like newspapers, video and internship."
College Student,4,It's an all girls school and it is safe and comfortable for all of the women
College Student,4,Getting a job it's difficult and there a strong connection with the alumni and a lot of support
College Freshman,4,The athletic facilities are really good. Just ask an instructor if you don't know how to use them and you'll be fine. Oha and they're open a lot and you don't have to pay.
College Freshman,4,"I've never heard of any crimes being committed on campus. I feel very safe, even walking alone at night on campus."
Sophomore,2,It was a very hard transition from regular classes to online classes. I hope it gets better for Fall 2020 semester.
Freshman,2,"Mount Holyoke College is admittedly academically rigorous. Professors are prone to assign a lot of readings, you're expected to 100% commit to studying. Slacking off will result in poor grades. Nonetheless, the problem I have with Mount Holyoke is its student body's intolerance toward people with different political affiliations. It's fascinating that those who constantly propagate the idea of inclusivity fail to uphold it themselves. The diversity of thoughts are often times villanized if they aren't in accordance with popular opinions (leftism). The school administration mostly avoids this due to fear of controversy. I find it disheartening that there is no direct support from the school itself, a college that promises to offer a rigorous, well-rounded education. I have been lucky enough to be taught by tolerant professors while I am aware that some professors cannot maintain their neutrality when the conversation is politicized."
Freshman,2,"Almost done with my first year at Mount Holyoke and not sure if I will be returning. Academics are not challenging—my high school courses were much harder. Professors are good and do care, which is why I gave two stars instead of one. Social life is absymal.  I have met very few people I want to be friends with, which I haven’t struggled with in the past. Many people are very, very odd or lack a personality, to a comical extent. Anyone remotely normal is vapid and shallow. There’s absolutely nothing to do here and the buses take so long that going off campus is too much of a hassle. If you don’t regularly party or use dating apps, there is absolutely no way to meet guys. If you are on the fence about MHC itself, an all-female environment, or don’t like partaking in cults, do not attend. Sit through the classes and see if they’re your cup of tea. For some people, this is the perfect environment. For me, every day here is hell."
Senior,2,"The academics are great, but the department requirements and lack of diverse courses and lack of  diverse course times makes it nearly impossible to finish your major. The administration is against you, they are very cheap and do not listen to the student body or student government. 
Financial aid will screw you btw. Although MHC says they will meet 100% need-based aid, they are the one who decided how much you need, which will be very little. You will come out of MHC with the same amount of loans as anywhere else BE WARNED."
Freshman,2,"My experience at Mount Holyoke has in no way lived up to my expectations.  Mount Holyoke is a great school for many people, but for a very specific type of person. I was excited for such a high degree of diversity, however, be warned that everyone at this school thinks/acts/feels very similarly. Yes, there is a lot of racial, ethnical,  sexual, and gendered diversity but that does not mean that there is diversity of opinion/thought. There is a prominent movement for inclusion which is great but I find it to be an ""up in your face"" movement where students spend a whole lot of time pointing fingers and not enough time truly embracing their college experience. Also, the school is incredible about emphasizing self-care which is so important for college students. Yet, this movement eliminates opportunities to take risks, and this vibe is especially annoying in the athletic department as the sport that I am a member of is very recreational."
College Sophomore,2,"The issues I take with Mount Holyoke are not in the school itself. The campus is stunning, the kind of place you'd be proud to point to and say, ""that's where I go."" The professors take the time to know their students--I took an Anthro lecture my first semester and the professor made a point of meeting with each of the 40+ students individually and talking with us about our interests. 

That being said, I don't know if it's the administration or the other students driving this, but the environment there is incredibly isolating if you do not subscribe to a very specific set of beliefs. I came from a small town, where I considered myself politically liberal and a feminist. Upon attending Mount Holyoke, I was unsure what to think. At Convocation, it was announced that Mount Holyoke would begin accepting applications from transwomen and anyone who identified as a woman or non-binary, etc. I didn't exactly know what this meant but, as the school year had not begun yet, I didn't think too much of it. 

As the semester progressed, I began to realize what this meant for me. I was constantly being asked what my preferred gender pronouns were, and told to check my cis privilege. At various org meetings, I learned that in a certain light, discussing menstruation could be transphobic. I was called a kink-shamer for my controversial belief that BDSM is abuse. I finished out the semester feeling alone and more out of place than I had ever felt in my life. Then it was announced that the student body would cease to perform 'The Vagina Monologues' on V-Day because 'not all women have vaginas.' That's when I decided I would not be returning. 

Mount Holyoke is a beautiful school, but it is extremely disheartening that America's first women's college is no longer a safe space for women to speak freely as women. If you're not 100% on board with queer theory or identity politics, maybe reconsider attending."
College Sophomore,2,"It's just the few places: Iya, Johnny's and the Froyo place."
College Sophomore,2,I usually go off campus for frat parties and house parties because on campus people call campus police too often to break up a party (even during weekends).
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are more than 100 years old, poorly maintained and not well-heated. During winter, icy layers will be seen glazing over windows in dorm rooms, making it impossibly cold to live in; what's more ridiculous is that even under these circumstances, personal heaters are not allowed. The only good dorm is Creighton, the newest dorm (built in 2008)."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many parties here.
College Freshman,2,"No one really lives off-campus here. Mount Holyoke housing is good enough that no one really feels any need/desire to live off-campus, but if you do want to there are a couple of houses/options nearby."
College Freshman,2,Everyone lives on campus so no one really needs to look into off campus housing- it's unnecessary
College Freshman,2,There's hardly a party scene. Chapin parties are said to be the best but that's only if you pregame in someone's dorm. Parties are best at one of the other Five Colleges
College Freshman,2,South Hadley is a small town and very rural. If you want to go out anywhere you could take the local PVTA bus but I'd recommend bringing your own car. The food in the Village Commons in town is decent but you get bored of it.
College Sophomore,2,"Not that many people participate, but the team members do get to know each other well. Sports is not a big thing and our teams aren't that strong."
College Sophomore,2,"Food is very restricting. It's frustrating that you can only get food at certain times and that you are forced to have a meal plan. Even if you wanted to cook your own food, the grocery store is very far and it's hard to find a kitchen to cook in."
College Freshman,2,"I have never heard a story of a student feeling pressured to drink at gatherings. In fact, most students at Mount Holyoke refrain from the ""party atmospheres"" that would involve dangerous drugs or too much alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"The school recommends that students live on campus all 4 years. This isn't a problem as most Seniors and Juniors get singles. There aren't many apartment options for moving off campus, and most students choose to enjoy the wonderful dorms for all 4 years."
College Freshman,2,"Winter is truly truly horrible and you have to be prepared. The spring and the summer are gorgeous, and this campus comes alive during those times, but the weather is dismal in the winter."
College Freshman,2,"Its not that its not fun sometimes, because it is, but its just a little lame. Dorm parties are fairly dull and uniform and are usually either very very gay or are for straight girls to pregame before they go off campus looking for men.

Parties thrown in the campus center almost universally suck, but parties thrown in Chapin auditorium can be somewhat fun. Drag Ball is a good, quirky, queer time and certainly embraces an amazing piece of MHC's unique culture, and the parties thrown by MCHASA have amazing music, a more ""party"" feel and attract lots of guys. 

Just know a couple of things about this place. A: the party scene on campus is predominantly queer, if that doesn't jive with you and you want to meet men, be ready to go off campus. B: Expect no true ragers on this campus. You can find them at other schools, but the few that have happened here have been outliers, rather than the norm."
College Sophomore,2,"What is there is pretty good, but there aren't that many options."
College Freshman,2,It is very difficult to get off-campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes there are great parties on campus--however, only the student org hosted parties. In dorm parties are very bad. But it is not hard to get to parties at Amherst College or the University of Mass, Amherst."
College Sophomore,2,You really need to go to other campus or travel a bit to get to bars
College Sophomore,2,"There is a couple of shops across the street, that are kinda nice. The town is really cute. But there is not much to do and where kinda isolated. If you drive or take a bus for an hour then you can get to places with some stuff to do."
College Sophomore,2,Rarely seen and if seen at some parties but not usually done by mount holyoke students but rather other college students from the local area.
College Sophomore,2,I am not from the area so I don't have a lot of experience with housing in the Western Massachusetts area but I do know that it is a mainly residential campus. Most students besides the Francis Perkins Scholars live on campus and it will be more expensive to try find off-campus housing.
College Sophomore,2,"Its a womens college so the quality of guys is very poor, but the girls are pretty average I guess."
College Junior,2,"I am not a fan of our night life, at all,  I am not a party person and the parties aren't the best. There are 4 kinds of parties at Mount Holyoke.

The Network:
The network is an org on campus that hosts black light parties and plays house music.

MHACASA - Mount Holyoke African and Caribbean Student Association
They have very popular parties that draw out guys from all of the colleges and people off campus. They play a lot of African and Caribbean Music. (there will be a LOT of guys there)

APAU
Their parties are similar MHACASA....but not really. MHACASA draws more people. They mainly play ""black culture"" music.(there will be guys there...but not as many guys as there would be at MHACASA parties.)

Academic buildings
Very grungy parties in academic buildings. People get wasted and make a mess of themselves.(you will not meet ANY guys at these parties)

Dorms:
There are dorm room parties and those can be cool...but there are also parties that are hosted in some of the common rooms and those parties are...interesting. People drink-non-stop and smoke up a chimney. By far the grosses parties, ever. (you will not meet any guys at these parties... the guys there, there might be one or two, are probably with someone.


The nightlife is my least favorite part about the school. I do not attend this parties. I have only attended these parties long enough to decide it wasn't my thing. Some people really enjoy the parties."
College Freshman,2,There are buses that take you to all the other 5 colleges on a regular bases. But they take a long time to get everywhere. Its about a 45 minute bus ride to get anywhere. Its better to have a car/ be friends with someone with a car.
College Freshman,2,"Athletics aren't a huge part of the social scene.  Within the athletic department, athletics are popular, but they aren't really well recognized by the other students.  Certain sports do attract more fans and attention than others, but there isn't a huge athletic following."
College Freshman,2,If you are 21 you can go to bars that arn't that far away but since it is a woman's college the parties are mostly off campus.
College Freshman,2,I found that the math and science classes were very challenging because the professors relied heavily on our previous knowledge which was minimal because they were 100 level classes. Then the majority of our grade was based on the tests which provoked not only previous knowledge but complete understanding and application of complex ideas introduced in class. Students should know going into the class that it is more self taught rather than professor taught.     
College Sophomore,2,"Greatly Improved – Honestly, this is one of the most expensive colleges in the country. Even though my financial aid packet covered half my tuition, it still isn't enough. And they DON'T change your financial aid as the years go by. I know multiple people, including myself, whose income has gone down due to multiple problems. No matter how many times you call or go down to the office to talk to them, they do not care. They keep pushing for you to take the semester off and get a job to save money, which honestly is not a option for many of us. If you are an international student, you have a better chance at getting more money because they pride themselves on having a ""diversity of students"" and ""international community"". Domestic students-we are left out of the financial aid decisions."
College Sophomore,2,"less drugs than most colleges – if you want drugs, you'll find them. if not, you may never even see or hear about them."
College Senior,2,"Students Are Not Crazy About Sports – Unfortunately, varsity athletes often do not get the credit they deserve and games are not well-attended. Our athletics teams are average at best. The Equestrian team is competitive. Oddly for a women's college there is no softball team. Lacrosse, field hockey and crew are popular as is the rugby team (club sport). There are no intramural sports and limited offerings for club sports. Overall we have an ok program for women's athletics, but if you're looking for a more competitive athletics scene and one where students show up to the games, I suggest looking elsewhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Dry Campus – They are pretty strict about drinking or drug use.  It's a dry campus, so no alcohol is permitted unless it is permitted by the school (student org parties, etc).  It's not a part school, and most students are pretty good about following the rules."
College Sophomore,2,"Its So-So – Although there are parties at the college, they tend to get boring after a while.Most would probably go off campus to nearby colleges to party or have fun as the bus runs quite late into the night."
College Freshman,2,"Entertainment Is There If You Go Looking – South Hadley is awful, but the five college area provides things to do if you're willing to search for them."
College Sophomore,2,"If You Have a Car, You're Set – Being that I'm from NYC, the local atmosphere of Mount Holyoke (in South Hadley, aka the middle of no where) is a bit dry. Most social events are in campus and there are some off campus but the city buses that run through our campus and nearby towns aren't frequent enough. But like I said, if you have car, you'll be fine... that is until gas prices go up."
College Sophomore,1,The school only allows a small number of upperclassmen to live off campus each year to maintain their full room and board earning.
College Senior,1,no social life on campus if you're not connect to a specific type of mount holyoke group ...
College Senior,1,"they really don't provide financial aid support for those who need it. my family contribution was no where near realistic which is why i now have thousands of dollars in debt. they also should make it VERY clear to student who have a sibling in an undergrad that your financial aid will decrease if you sibling graduates. the financial aid process seems very sneaky and I have warned prospective students to weigh all of their options before coming to this school especially if financial aid is an important factor. they don't seem to care if you're struggling financially as student and it's a shame that I had to pay so much money for ""an education"" 

total B.S."
College Freshman,1,There are not off campus dining options...?
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,No off campus housing really. If you're lucky you might be able to but it's rare. Most people live on campus all four years
College Sophomore,1,There's pretty much two restaurants- a chinese restaurant and a japanese restaurant. That's it. There's a crappy mexican place and an expensive restaurant. Not a lot of options at all.
College Freshman,1,Amherst and UMass are your best options to party.
College Freshman,1,I don't think there are really any off-campus options.
College Senior,1,"This is a single-sex institution, so there are little to no guys. Sometimes men from the other campuses come by to take classes that are offered her, but for the most part there are none here. 

If you want to meet guys, you can go off campus to Amherst, Hampshire or UMass, but there is no guarantee that you will meet someone you want to be friends with."
College Freshman,1,I really do not like it here. I do not fit in and am transferring next year because it is too small and I do not enjoy being at a women's college due to drama. 
College Freshman,1,"It's a women's college, therefore there are very few to none guys on campus."
College Freshman,1,I hate it here. It's very boring. There is absolutely nothing to do.
College Freshman,1,I received no financial aid or scholarship money and the school is very expensive.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no nightlife at my school. You have to go off campus.
College Freshman,1,It's extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter.
College Freshman,1,"The school can feel isolated at times. However, there is a free bus to the other four colleges in the five college consortium so that is a good thing, it always students to leave campus when they want or need to. The town of South Hadley is not a very vibrant place, but again, it is relatively easy to visit the surrounding towns and the other schools. "
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"Very few off campus options, but living on campus is great!"
College Junior,1,"NONE.  None... None. South Hadley is literally a ghost town.  There's nothing to do, especially if you don't have a car or if you don't feel like using it very often.  Thankfully, we have the PVTA - a bus which takes students to the other campuses for free (though getting to Smith is very annoying) - so you can travel to Amherst if you need proof that stores, culture, other humans, brand-name companies, etc. DO STILL EXIST.  Long story short: if you're a city girl, stay far away from Mount Holyoke, or get used to isolation, and lots of it.  At least you can see the stars every night!"

Junior,5,It's a very good school from the teachers to the campus. Every student is excepted and treated like a family.
Junior,5,Online is just as good as in person learning. Everyone is involved and the teachers take their time and make sure you understand everything that is going on in class. Since COVID 19 shut us down for the spring semester I didn't miss a beat with online.
Freshman,5,Mansfield University is a small school that provides much more than meets the eye. From top notch resident halls to amazing teachers who are willing to go above and beyond to ensure the success of students.
Junior,5,"Mansfield is a great school. I am so happy with the education I am receiving. The campus offers us students a lot to do during the semester.
Both my parents went there and are successful in their profession. 
I am very happy that I chose mansfield"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Mansfield University! The professors are very interpersonal and are willing to work with you and your schedule! The campus is nice and small and clean. Housing is super nice! The only thing I would change is to provide more activities on campus because it can get boring at times
Senior,5,The staff at Mansfield University are incredibly knowledgeable and have so much to offer their students. The faculty of the nutrition department has helped me to not only navigate my undergraduate studies but have also worked to prepare me for graduate school.
Alum,5,"Mansfield University was a great school to attend.  I loved everything about it from my schedule to my courses.  Its in a small town where you can walk downtown easily if you are living on campus.  Campus is small enough that you can get from one side to the other in plenty of time between your classes without having to worry or rush.  The only complaint I ever had while be there was the parking.  We had to park on top of what we call ""cardiac hill"".  Its a very steep hill that people have a hard time getting up if they don't want to wait for the shuttle bus.  Even my car had trouble getting up the hill in bad weather.  Other than that hill Mansfield University was great!"
Sophomore,5,I enjoy how small classes are; the professors actually know you by name and can have intellectual debate rather than students just being one in a sea of faces.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Mansfield University has been amazing so far; The community is very open and caring, students and teachers always available to assist and help one another"
Junior,5,I wasn’t planning on attending Mansfield. I applied last minute as a transfer student and I got in. I transferred with a degree from a two year school and the transition from that to MU was smooth. I really like it here and everyone in the Math and CS department were very helpful. The students in my major help one another. The diversity is great and the school is small and personable which is what I like. The only downfall is that you have to have a car to get to the good stuff. The nearest cities with malls and stores are Williamsport and Elmira.
Senior,5,I have flourished while attending Mansfield! I love it and it certainly has prepared me for Graduate school
Senior,5,I loved this school because of my department! The psychology department gave me more than enough tools to take my education to the next level so I am starting my Master's degree. They are always available when needed and give honest but respectable advice in any situation I have had.
Niche User,5,Early in my experience and have been a HS visitor and camper experiencing many college days and camp.  Love this University!
Freshman,5,"What I like about Mansfield University is how much the teachers care about you education , they are always there to help out when we need it . Also , there is diversity on campus everyone get along there is no racial discrimination going on . The parties are also fun there is none that ends in drama at all . Academic wise there is a lot of resources when you need it most ."
Freshman,5,I like that it’s away from trouble and one thing about the place everybody is cool. One thing i would Say is the sports
Freshman,5,"Manfield University is not just a place to further my education, it is another home. The atmosphere is welcoming and the professors are genuine! They want you to be your best self and be successful."
Freshman,5,"Coming from the poverty-stricken area in Philadelphia to the small town of Mansfield was a big change for me and a breath of fresh air. It allowed me to grow, and develop a new way of thinking and really understand myself. Plus the campus staff and students are willing to help you every step of the way."
Freshman,5,"Mansfield University is a wonderful school to attend. The professors there truly want every student who is applying themselves to succeed. They are also really helpful to those that ask for it. The staff is also really helpful. Instead of it feeling like a school, it feels like a supportive family driving you to success."
Niche User,5,This campus really has it all. The atmosphere here is wonderful and inviting. The layout of the campus is set up very well and the newly built dorms make it even nicer!
Freshman,5,"Mansfield University is the home to over 3,000 students. The university has a small, safe campus that is diverse.The campus offers many student activities as well as events in the hut. The professors are very helpful and go out of their way to help students succeed. Overall a positive experience. My first semester went smoothly."
Sophomore,5,I fell in love with the school the very first day I went there as a high school student. It's more out in the country but is surrounded by a small town and is also not too far from the Arnot shopping mall. The learning experience here is great. The teachers are all willing to help you and are required to have office hours where they are available for students to come in and talk. This small school makes the experiences feel homey and there is never a dull moment because of all the activities offered.
Freshman,5,"Transferring to Mansfield from Corning Community was the best thing I ever did! Mansfield is amazing, professors are great and love their students! Everyone is amazing and great! Love to meet new people and get involved. Overall Mansfield is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"I have been attending Mansfield for one semester, and I find that this college is the perfect fit for me. This university is small, but yet not to small. It is the perfect size. Mansfield facility recently went on a strike, but the president of the university wanted to make sure that the students wouldn't suffer. Mansfield cares about the education that the students receive, and their facility members as well."
College Freshman,5,I enjoy this school with their elite music program
College Senior,5,I have multiple work study jobs on campus and love each of them. My advisor is helping me find an internship and the career center is very helpful with finding a job after graduation.
College Sophomore,5,Mansfield has great connections for when I go out into the world looking for a music education job! Mansfield is great at networking and especially known for music!
College Sophomore,5,"I love Mansfield. As a Music major I've found some remarkable people in my field of study as both peers and professors during my time here. Class sizes are small, in fact I believe the largest class I was ever in had maybe forty people. Really a great education at an affordable price!"
College Sophomore,5,Mansfield is one of the safest schools in the country.  I think there has been a total of three major crimes in the last few years! Crime is virtually zero and the police for is extremely kind!
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are incredible! Each one comes with a private bathroom and microfridge. (That's a microwave and a fridge.) Then from there you can get rooms with a wall dividing it, thus giving you essentially your own room and mini living room. Living on campus is quite luxurious when compared to other universities."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the environment of nurturing I've found at Mansfield University.  I am in a very competitive major, yet all of my classmates go out of their way to make sure we all succeed.  Depending on the program you are interested in Mansfield may be a cheaper, severely underrated yet wonderful choice!"
College Sophomore,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. The police station is very close by and I have never really felt unsafe on campus. The crime is pretty limited and is posted on the daily crime log. The offenses typically deal with some sort of drug charges, and not anything violent."
College Sophomore,5,"I adore the dorms. I think it's just so amazing that every dorm room has its own bathroom that is so convenient. The dorms have a lot of good qualities, from ample study rooms, to tv's and laundry rooms, they are excellent. The dorms are in a pretty good proximity as compared to various on campus buildings such as Manser or the gym. Although the dorms are a bit pricy, they are well worth the cost for all of the luxuries provided."
College Student,5,"The security on campus is amazing, this is one of the bigger reasons I chose Mansfield. I have never felt unsafe while on campus and there is a police station in the middle of our campus that have real police officer's. There are little stations all over campus that you can push a button and it will eminently contact the police and campus police as well as the ambulance. Also the dorms are not able to be accessed without your student id car, or key. the elevators will only take you to your floor and the bottom floor exit/entry"
College Student,5,"Even with the bigger sized classes the professors will take their time to get to know you, you most certainly are not just a number in the classrooms! More specific classes tend to be smaller and have less students and makes it easier to learn, get to communicate with your professor, and preform well in class."
College Student,5,"Mansfield builds you up for your graduation and it it required to either get an internship, or do some sort of independent study for your senior year. They help you along with this process and most people who I know, that graduated from Mansfield had a job right out of college!"
College Student,5,"No other school that I met with had housing as nice, or homey as the housing at Mansfield. You are given different options pertaining to the dorm that you stay in and the perks are amazing! The dorms are remodeled every 5 years, so the one I will be in is brand new! They provide enough that makes your life easier so that college is a smoother ride and your dorm life will not get in the way of your studies!"
College Student,5,"The campus is like a community and the teachers are apart of the community like setting, not just students. The teachers and staff are extremely involved and care about your performance  at school and success for the future. I never feel as though I am unsafe and from the first time I visited the University; I knew it was the school for me."
College Student,5,"Very secure dorms, emergency stations everywhere."
College Junior,5,"Brand new buildings, great amenities, absolutely love Einstein's"
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy my school and my professors are helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"I really do love this school. It's a nice, small environment where everyone knows your name. The only issue is the prices of food. When you don't have time to go to the cafeteria, the food court is your second best option. But with a meal plan of $4.72, you can only really get a hamburger (just a hamburger), or spaghetti with a drink, or just a 6 inch sub...you get my point."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is extremely nice and comforting. They all try to make you feel at home!
College Senior,5,"There is so much diversity at Mansfield University.  If you're into guys who are into Magic, you're set.  Into guys that are into sports?  You're all set!  Into guys that are really into math?  You've got it.  There are all body types and personalitly types on campus here - male and female."
College Freshman,5,I love the dorms at Mansfield.
College Freshman,5,professors are great and class sizes are small
College Freshman,5,"Dorms are new and apartment style, staff are very friendly and helpful, small town so not as many social activites within the community, housing process is easy and the cost is average."
College Senior,5,The dorms are brand new and they are gorgeous. Lots of room type options.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love my program! We are like our own family!
College Junior,5,"I grew up in a small town, and I just love the fact that I attend college in a small town. The people in town are always so welcoming to the college students and they do their best to help us feel at home when we are here. While there is not a whole lot to do off campus (there's only bowling and you have to go to the next town over to see a movie), I love window shopping while walking around town. One of my favorite places to go is Night and Day Cafe, although I did not get the chance to walk down there this past semester."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are so great!! They are enthusiastic in getting you enthusiastic about school, learning and your major!!!"
College Student,5,I haven't really experienced this
College Student,5,Its nice to be able to have a job.
College Junior,5,I am a Liberal Studies major therefore it was easy to switch from a Chemistry major over.
College Junior,5,"Chemistry is my field of study. The professors are very knowledgeable and actively try to get to know their students. There are research opportunities for all students in the major as well, which is awesome. It is also great that nearly all of the professors in this major are active with the school's chemclub and actively try to make meetings and plan events with the club."
College Senior,5,"The social work program at Mansfield University is highly acclaimed. When I graduated with my Bachelors degree I was already done with half of my Masters degree. I only needed 34 more credits to achieve my masters. The workload was average. The unique aspect to MU SWK program was there were mnay classes that had counseling practices, roll plays and activities to do and accomplish within the community."
College Senior,5,"There is no pay but honestly who gets paid to go to school.  The school provides a list of possible internships that have already been approved by the school. Finding an internship was very easy. There hours required for undergraduate is 500 hours. The responsibilities were to write up a weekly journal entry, write a final analysis of your personal internship, and attending  five seminar classes. The internship I had was at a High School in a 12.1.1 contained classroom. Twelve students with one teacher and one aide. I counseled individuals and small groups as well as handled crisis issues as they arose."
College Senior,5,"Yes, if I had to do it all over again I would. My career goals is to work in a school system with any/all ages of children.

I do not have any concerns."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my program at MU. Music Education is very demanding, but not any more that it will be when I go out into the work force which I really appreciate. I think that MU is getting me ready for a real job and I love that!"
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are great here at MU. I am not just their students but also their friends. The curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the workload is what you make it. You decide if you want to work hard for your education or slide by."
College Junior,5,Mansfield is one of the safest schools in the country. 
Sophomore,4,"Mansfield University is a nice school. The professors are nice, the classes are small (if that's what you like), dorms are nice, and the campus is pretty. Faculty are kind, helpful, understanding, and fair. Overall it's a decent school."
Sophomore,4,I love that Mansfield is a small college campus and the classes/ cafes are easy to get to. The food is pretty good and the staff is very friendly. The only thing I don't  like about it is that if you don't have a car there's not much you can do outside of the campus. Also the app for the campus shuttle is not always accurate.
Sophomore,4,"As a current student enrolled at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania, I would feel comfortable telling prospective student's about the positive aspects  of the campus community as a whole. This past fall, 2019 we had recently gotten a president who is going up and beyond for our campus which is really doing a great turn around for MU. Something I would suggest to changing is adding more Master Degree programs for the student's."
Sophomore,4,I admire my experience at Mansfield because it is a very hands-on campus. The school is fairly small so all the students are o. The professors and staff are also very involved in the students' personal and academic development.
Niche User,4,"I went to visit the place twice and I instantly fell in love. I love the area, the programs they offer, the connections with students, I can't wait to attend this fall!"
Junior,4,"I was 25 and working a part time I did not enjoy and decided to give college another try. Mansfield was a local college to me, but offered a degrees I was interested in. The location of MU is great for anyone wanting to pursue a career in outdoor recreation, geology, environmental studies etc because it sits in the mountains of Pennsylvania surrounded by many State parks and wonderful natural settings. The atmosphere of the school is close knit. Classes are smaller in number and you are able to have a personal relationship with the professors. The library is big and beautiful one of my favorite locations on campus. The town of Mansfield is small but nice. Just down the road you have a Main Street with a local cafe, bars, and some small shops. All faculty at MU is more than willing to help."
Senior,4,"Mansfield is a great school but is currently struggling with enrollment. In terms of change, I think for the good of the school that it needs to begin recruiting from more rural areas that would house potential students that would love the mountain atmosphere. As a school overall, the food is fine, the dorms are great. There is a lack of activities, but mostly because no one at the school attends them (Usually in the winter because its too cold). I love MU personally"
Alum,4,"They have a great Science Department with very strong reputable professors. Small town feel. Always seem to have a lot of activities going on, but didn't care for the school outside of the science building."
Sophomore,4,"It is a nice school because it is small and very home-y. However, the power goes out often and the school's food options are limited if you have a food allergy or sensitivity."
Junior,4,I like how well laid out the campus is. It is easy to get to your classes and the campus is centered around the library!
Freshman,4,"Overall, Mansfield has been a great college experience. While there are things that need to be adjusted, the campus itself is nice, and the people are great. The professors really care about the students and create a more personal learning environment."
Sophomore,4,I fell in love with Mansfield. It is the size of a private school but costs the same as a state school. I chose Mansfield because the teachers are phenomenal and always there to help students succeed. The only thing I would change is the hilly campus but on the bright side my calves look great.
Freshman,4,"Mansfield was my first choice in schools. Most of my class sizes are smaller then I had in high school so you get to know you professors. If you have worries about living somewhere with a bunch of people you do not know there are many different types of dorm rooms but the over all rule for all the dorms is you never share a bathroom with more then one person. I have problems with sleeping with noise so I was concerned about having a room mate so I applied for a C unit. A C unit is a dorm with two bed rooms in one dorm. If this is not what your looking for there are other options. You have your standard dorm, a dorm that is basically two standard dorms smushed together with a sitting area and the a C unit times two. At some point I can not remember what year you can apply for a dorm that is basically an apartment. I love Mansfield and I hope if anyone reads this looking into the school they will love it too."
Freshman,4,I like the overall placement of Mansfield university. Its placed in an area that is more wooded and for people who like to be outdoors.
Sophomore,4,I would say that Mansfield University is a decent school to attend.  It is a nice campus and has nice faculty.
Freshman,4,"The professors really care about you and the dorms are beautiful! The dorms are so cozy, the food is great."
Freshman,4,"Mansfield University, nestled in the mountains of northern Pennsylvania, has a lot to offer. Besides the beautiful, calming scenery of the mountains and valleys, the college is vibrant and full of life. To say it is the best place in the world is impossible, because you go to schools like this to learn the skills that will let you go to the greatest places in the world."
Freshman,4,"So far I am enjoying myself on campus. There are a ton of groups to join, and a numerous amount of activities going on almost everyday! The teachers are very understanding so far in my experience, and as long as you put forth the effort of the work, you are more than likely to get a good grade!"
College Senior,4,I love most of my professors. I enjoy the well-rounded liberal arts education. Work study was my favorite.
College Senior,4,I have never felt threatened on campus. I can go for a walk in the middle of the night and still feel safe. The police are very present on campus.
College Senior,4,I love the new dorms. Suite life is the best kind of housing. I lived in suites for two years.
College Sophomore,4,My experience at my school so far has been a great one. The students are very outgoing and seem very serious about their academics.What makes the university very unique is that faculty cares about the well being of the student and will do what is necessary to help them succeed. There are also a great number of clubs and activities available for students who are willing to be apart. I have went to different events and thought they were well thought out and put together. I will definitely participate into more festivities or even think of some myself.
College Junior,4,People are generally accepting and tolerant. Study body is composed of mostly white students. LGBT students are typically accepted and not ostracized.
College Sophomore,4,Our security measures are actually annoying because of how effective they are. Each of our buildings are secure after dark and our dorms are locked except to students all year round.
College Sophomore,4,"There has only been about three courses that i did not appreciate, due to inconsideration on the teachers end. However, aside from thse's classes, i have enjoyed my experience learning from such great professors."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are very affordable and worth while. Each room is kept clean before entry into the dorms, as well as the facilities within the building. Residence life help create community bonding with different themes for the floors, events and activities that happen nearly every week, or hosting floor meetings to actually communicate with the other students on your floor."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is very active with campus life. It's not just about the parties and social gatherings, but more for what they do for the community. Each Greek shows they're philanthropic side, a couple of times a semester which promotes that they care for those around them and not that parties are their prime focus. Non-Greeks that say that they hate us don't typically understand how we work or what we do. However, there is a good chunk of our Non-Greek community that are supportive."
College Sophomore,4,"Mansfield University is a very calm school. As long as you have yourself organized, you can succeed. It is a very small school with a little under 2,000 students per year, which allows the professors to spend more individual time with their students."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel safe and there is proper lighting and a help safety station if needed.
Recent Alumnus,4,The resources are there to help.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Small classes, one on one attention. Great school!"
College Sophomore,4,From what I've seen the Greek life at Mansfield is very service oriented.  Great bunch of people!
College Junior,4,"There is always support from the students. For some sports it maybe less then others, but there is always some students that attend the sporting events to cheer on friends, classmates, and their school."
College Junior,4,My experience at Mansfield University thus far has been pretty great. The professors are always wanting the very best for their students. When help is needed they are always there. They like for the students to strive for the best and they will help as much as possible.
College Sophomore,4,"Even though I have had a few classes I was not too fond of, the teachers have always at least seemed knowledgeable in their fields. There are a variety of courses offered, however, sometimes that could get a bit complicated because certain classes are only taught in certain semesters. It is important to remain mindful of that fact when planning out classes. The class sizes are relatively small compared to other universities. The size really depends on a number of factors like if it is a gen-ed or how often it is taught."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had to look too far into an internship/career opportunity yet, but the career center does seem helpful in aiding the journey of where students would like to go. I attended a seminar on the process of applying to graduate schools and found it to be very informative. In addition, there often opportunities in which employers come from outside the campus to talk about their places of business"
College Sophomore,4,"Personally I am not involved in any sort of Greek life and have limited knowledge of anything surrounding it. However, I have seen some nice things result from greek life. There have been many friendships formed and when the sororities/fraternities do some kind of volunteering based project, it always seems successful and well organized. I believe greek housing is available on campus (I think 4th floor Spruce) and obviously off campus."
College Sophomore,4,"There are some very talented teams within the school (softball, track & field, field hockey, etc.) The fan support most likely fluctuates depending on the teams level of ability. That being said, I am sure there are still some hardcore fans that go to every game. One piece that should be slightly modified, however, is advertising the sporting events a bit more. It seemed as though sometimes I would not hear about a sporting event that took place until it was either starting or over."
College Sophomore,4,"Although as with many other colleges it certainly has its flaws, it has lived up to its expectations of being a friendly and home-like environment.There are so many friendly faculty members who are always willing to help. It still amazes me how involved not only the teachers are in various extra-curricular activities, but also the President of the University."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of the professors are okay, but some of them are bullheaded."
College Sophomore,4,Campus police are never too far away when needed.
College Student,4,"Every one is involved even if they do not play a sport, the game nights are always attended by faculty and staff. even if someone doesn't want to be on a team that is at the college level and just wants to do a sport for fun and on there free time, there are so many clubs to get involved in, or you can even make your own!"
College Student,4,Love being here and is totally worth it.
College Student,4,"Nice housing units, horrible internet in them."
College Freshman,4,We have our own police system here on campus to help prevent crimes from happening.
College Freshman,4,"The courses and professors are fair and willing to work with you, if you put in the effort."
College Freshman,4,People don't really talk to each other in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,The Greek life here is very open and inviting.
College Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere that my school gives me.
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on campus, lots of blue lights."
College Junior,4,Met amazing people and professors here who have made a huge impact on me.  The class size is small which is great because it allows you to interact with your peers and professor.
College Junior,4,The professors have an open door policy and are very helpful.  The school atmosphere feels like home and is comforting.
College Freshman,4,The campus environment feels safe because of the central location and visibility of security staff and measures.
College Freshman,4,The career center and its emphasis on internship programs will help improve my job prospects.
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are small and conducive to the learning environment.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are pleasant and very comfortable to live in.
College Sophomore,4,I am involved in music Ed and the classes for my curriculum is good. Professor are helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I am very hopeful that I find a job in my field of study and I inow my school will help me with this process
College Sophomore,4,My class size is good. I enjoy my professors they seem to care about my schooling
College Sophomore,4,Love having a bathroom and only sharing with one other person
Sophomore,2,"The teachers are absolutely amazing however the rest of the staff is absolutely horrible. They don’t answer you and when they do it’s with attitude. Melinda Phillips is absolutely no help when it comes to accommodations and makes you feel little for searching said accommodations. The food is completely inedible as well. They make good food for visitation days but other than that expect undercooked meat, cold food, hair in your good, and literal garbage in your food. The professors are the only thing that make this campus worth it."
Alum,2,"I was enrolled in the Radiologic Technology program Mansfield University has to offer. All I have to say is, if you like being bossed around all day and completing uneducation tasks all day then apply ( for example, taking care of laundry bins, wiping down rooms, walking patients to and from the waiting room/emergency room). This program and the reality of the clincial expirence must be re-eavluated."
Alum,2,"When I was a student at Mansfield University, my first two years we’re vastly different from my last two years. I realized looking back how naive I was throughout some of the experience. Because the campus is so small, and most majors are secluded to various buildings it feels way more like a high school than a college. It also doesn’t help that some professors think it is okay to meddle into people’s lives and start their own drama. Even though there are many not so good professors there, there are also some great ones. There were 3 or 4 professors that helped me so much throughout my college experience and I am still in contact with them to this day. Those few good professors taught me more than I ever could have imagined. If you want to get a good education, have a specific major in mind, and want a real college experience, DO NOT GO HERE. If you don’t know what you want to do yet, but want to get a college degree, then sure, go to Mansfield."
Freshman,2,My time at Mansfield has had it's ups and downs. I entered the university as an Environmental Science major and would recommend anyone looking at going for a geoscience major to take a look at Mansfield. The professors are very nice here with a few exceptions. The food is alright but unsurprisingly declines through out the semester. The dorms here are very nice and are probably one of the best parts alongside the beautiful campus. I recommend looking at other colleges before deciding on Mansfield as the quality of education is a little poor. I decided to transfer from Mansfield for a variety of reasons including these ones.
College Senior,2,Everything related to the Business department at Mansfield is poor.  The only internship that really comes about is with State Farm and there is hardly an alumni network.  I hardly ever hear of employers recruiting on campus and the career center is hardly accesible to students.
College Senior,2,"In order to do anything worthwhile, you have to travel about half an hour to a neighboring town.  That being said, you have Horseheads, NY with the Arnot Mall; Corning with the Corning Gaffer District; and Williamsport with the Lycoming Mall."
College Freshman,2,Upper Manser food is not good.  Lower Manser and Einsteins has some better tasting food but it is more expensive than upper.
College Freshman,2,There are not many places to eat off-campus. The town is small so there are few options.
College Freshman,2,"It's a small school, so not many options."
College Freshman,2,"I don't party, and the only parties I hear about are not where I want to be."
College Junior,2,"My school seems to offer greek life or community service-based scholarships, mainly. The community isn't really fond of us college kids, and the greeks don't really do anything too special here, so this is a little silly to me. I lost a scholarship from my high school because the paperwork got lost. So, getting financial aide anywhere but through the university (unless you are greek and/or into community service) is a good idea."
College Freshman,2,"If parties are going on, I would have no idea. Nobody tells me. Besides, I'm usually off doing homework anyway."
College Junior,2,"There's school spirit, but not much attention to sports. Some teams are good, some teams are horrible. Too much money is given to them for their performance--or lack thereof--and not enough attention. There's a separation between athletes and other students (at least so I think). I've attended a few sporting events, and most of the others that attend are other athletes, friends of athletes, and families of athletes (if applicable). Athletic facilities, nonetheless, are pretty good because they get most of the student activity fees (controversy behind this). A decent amount of the athletes I met have an egocentric viewpoint in life."
College Senior,2,Only when a student begs and  shows all of their private finances can they then maybe get a scholarship.
College Senior,2,The shuttle is never on time and the students have to wait out in the elements while waiting.
College Senior,2,"There are a few pizza places, mcdonalds and only onre decent restaurant that was sit down."
College Sophomore,2,I don't like Greek life at my school and I don't plan on ever rushing for a fraternity or sorority.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather has its ups and downs, making class difficult to get to at times."
College Sophomore,2,Not much to do around town. but the scenery is real nice if you just enjoy watching it.
College Sophomore,2,"Theres no where to eat late night, not even in the town of mansfield"
College Junior,2,"Network reliability isn't always good, the wifi doesn't work around all the campus and tech services are slow with replys to help you.  Printing is pretty pricy."
College Freshman,2,"It's okay, nothing I would ever want to look into, considering the brand new gorgeous dorms."
College Freshman,2,The wifi is only available in the new dorms and some of the buildings. But good luck getting it to work.
College Freshman,2,"The dining options are not the best. Going off campus isn't exactly the best either. There's a McDonald's, Taco Bell, and a KFC. That's about it. "
College Freshman,2,"The guys here are mostly just average, with a few gems. "
College Freshman,2,"The parking is limited, and the police (the town's police station is on campus..) hand out tickets like they're candy, so be cautious. "
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of my school. The people here do not present individuality and seem to do whatever everyone else is doing. They have no respect for their floormates and for anyone for that matter. I do not associate with the general population here.
College Sophomore,2,"I have not gotten into any Greek life, but from what I have seen it is fun because they are always doing something together. There are times when they will do events to make a positive effect on the school. "
College Sophomore,2,"I would give the parking situation at the school 2 stars had it not been for the cost. The parking is a hassle past a certain time, and also, sometimes there are not enough spots for all the commuters. When events come around, there is no parking at all for students. I chose to give the parking 3 stars because the permit only costs me 20 dollars for being a commuter. So, compared to other schools, it is a good deal, even though the parking is not always the best."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is not the best, but it is very satisfying and tastes good to me. The food costs are not terrible. It can get on the expensive side depending on where on campus you go, but other places are very convenient."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is not terrible, but it is not the best either. During the fall and spring, the weather is great. It is time to cozy up to a sweatshirt in the fall and in the spring it is t-shirt time. The downfall comes during the winter. The winters can get pretty harsh. The snow makes it difficult to get to school sometimes and with snow, it is easy to slip and fall. "
College Junior,2,"The school has had several issues with financial aid. Their department does not communicate with the other departments and can cause many students hassle. However, they do award a decent amount of money when they get their act together."
College Junior,2,"Because of the constant construction of campus, and the lack of available parking spaces, on campus parking at Mansfield is a mess. It is difficult to see where the lines are while the roads are covered in mud, and there are not enough parking spaces for all of those who own a parking pass."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mansfield is a great University because of its small size and atmosphere but is lacking highly in night life and things to do for students off of campus. The university does a great job in offering all sorts of activities and clubs for students to join. Many many students just want to dance.. plain and simple.. Thursday, Friday, Saturday... Dance Dance dance.  I think someone could make a killing if they set up the right scene in Mansfield."
College Sophomore,2,"The mountie bus is never on time, and some drivers drive where ever they please."
College Sophomore,2,"I watched a drug deal happen right in front of me, and I was almost raped but got away.  While that fun experience was happening the guy told me that if I was hanging out with the basketball player that I was with earlier that night that I would definitely be raped by him and everyone else on the team.  That was comforting.  Then at a SAFE meeting I was told that it can take years to prove that you have been raped and put them in jail, and since I got away without much happening there was close to nothing that could be done."
College Freshman,2,The Hut has student funded shows every thursday night. underage drinking seems to be quite popular on campus and around the campus.
College Junior,2,"Mansfield University is located in a rural area in the northern Pennsylvania mountains. There is a shuttle bus that can take students to local places such as Walmart, Dollar General and other places nearby, however if the student wishes to venture off the campus premises further into the community or other places, the options decrease drastically. Aside from the campus shuttle bus, there is a county shuttle which runs on Saturdays which can take students to malls (There are two malls an hour in each direction and the county bus alternates going to each mall every other weekend). Beyond that, students without their own form of transportation would have a difficult time traveling off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Other than the commons, there's not a lot of options for students."
College Junior,2,There isn't much to do because it is such a small town but if you have good friends/know where parties are you will be fine.
College Freshman,2,"There are a couple apartment complexes and some neighborhoods, but most kids at Mansfield live on campus because the lack of housing off-campus. Most of the houses in the town are owned by Mansfield natives."
College Junior,2,Mansfield is not really known for any of there sports in my opinion.
College Freshman,2,"The parking is a very difficult, if your a freshman in the old dorms you have to park up on cardiac which is all the way on top of a hill. If you park at the lower spots you are more likely to get a fine unless you have a specific ticket saying your aloud."
College Freshman,2,Mansfield is a very rural town there is a few things to do but if your used to going to the mall once a week you will be amazed that the mall is an hour away!!
College Freshman,2,Parking is very limited and it can be hard to find a spot. Underclassmen get the worst parking options.
College Sophomore,2,"The track team does very well, the basketball and baseball teams are also fairly good. The reason that the school receives a C is that the football team is a sprint football team. It is hard to rally the school around a team that barely wins and only exists so that the marching band has a place to compete."
College Junior,2,"I did not like living on campus, mostly because I hate germs and like privacy. I have been best friends with my roommate forever,however, being crammed in one room wasn't great. I like that Mansfield has suites now, but I didn't get a chance to experience them. I love living off campus in my own apartment. I make my own food ever night, which is way better the the school food, it is cheaper to live off campus, and I do not share my bathroom with a floor filled with girls. The room was never repaired, every dorm was always falling apart, in addition it was not the cleanly. Like I said I didnt experience the suites but I heard they are way better, but I still recommend getting an apartment."
Recent Alumnus,2,"You definitely need a car if you plan to go anywhere. There is a shuttle that runs but the times are inconvenient. Parking is extremely far away, even if you're a commuter. When I lived on campus it wasn't that bad because I would just take the shuttle up to the parking lot, but living off campus and trying to find a parking spot is extremely hard."
College Freshman,2,"It gets pretty cold up here in the mountains. Proper clothing is necessary to not freeze, and make sure you do not have to drive when it snows."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall consists of mostly carbs, noodles, chicken, pasta. The food can eventually get boring, and is designed to make you gain weight."
College Junior,2,"There are a different ethnicities at the school, but since it's in the country I'd have to say there are mostly white people. Lesbian, Gays, Transgender, and Bi-sexual people are also on our campus and they are many more supporters for them than haters. Discrimination is not predominantly present on campus which makes diversity welcomed here."
College Junior,2,"Unless you are residing in the new dorm building, Oak and Hickory, which has their own parking lot, your car is going to be fr away from your building. It will take you at least 15 minutes to get to your car no matter which of the 2 parking lots it is in because you must either go across the entire campus or climb up Cardiac Hill to reach your vehicle. It's not convient at all, but it's only $50 for a parking pass no matter what year you are so it could be worse."
College Junior,2,"Don't get me wrong, there is the rare case of clear skies and warm weather, but like I said that is rare. It's always windy on campus and it could be sunny for one second and storming the next. It snows a good amount, so be ure to pack warm clothes if you are visiting. Classes are far away from the dorms so be prepared for inclimate weather everyday."
College Senior,2,I can never seem to get the amount of finiancial aid I need the first time around. I have to call in every year just so I can get all my aid I need. Even other people have problems with getting aid and help finding aid. In the end it seems they get what is needed for aid. It really is a process and takes time and a lot of phone calls.
College Junior,2,Campus Police Ticketing – There is plenty of parking on campus but how strict the campus police are is unreasonable. They ticket for every little parking offense even when you've only been parked somewhere for a few minutes. They should really back off.
College Senior,2,"The basketball team is great and the gym is always packed. Besides that, sports aren't huge. There is only a sprint football team, that always loses. Other sports get moderate attendance but people don't really get excited about anything except basketball."
College Senior,2,What a Hassle – There was problems with my financial aid every year. The financial aid people are not always helpful and kind of rude. But it always got sorted out in the end.
College Freshman,2,"I would say the the food/menu at the main dining hall Manser is terrible. Their is usually no simple meat, if their is it is covered in unnessecary items. Also they must serve breakfast for dinner 3 times a week..."
College Senior,2,"Could Be Better – With distant parking and police as bored as you are during the weekends, 2 minutes after midnight on sunday if your parked someplace your not, expect a ticket. The dorms are fairly strict as well, with new security cameras installed giving the bored RA's something to do now too, namely bust you doing anything, even hanging around a lounge with some friends."
College Senior,2,"They are two gyms,one for the average person hitting the gym and one for the athletes to train, the hut which is kind of like the nght club on campus, library, dining hall, police station, very basic places that a college would have."
Alum,1,"I would highly suggest AGAINST going to Mansfield University for any health science related major. The second you leave the campus for your clinical expirences, you are immediatley forgetten. Especially during the unforseen circumstances we are currently facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this school treated the situation very unprofessionally towards the health science majors and left us all in the dark. Mansfield failed to share and include any information to the Sayre students on how our eductaion was going to be affected and how the whole thing will eventually play out. Our graduation ceremony (for Radiology majors) was taken away and were kept enrolled for 3 extra weeks past our orginal graduation date causing our summer tution to be at an even higher price. It is very poor school for an average education, although they will convince you how great their health science majors are. Look elsewhere. Do not waste your time and money on Mansfield University."
Alum,1,"MU has the “highest safety” rating of all the schools in PA, largely due to the fact that many Title IX cases were disregarded and dismissed to save the reputation of the school. If you are a victim of any kind of assault, the administration will not provide any sort of legal or traumatic support. I would not recommend this school to anyone due to the hell they put victims through because they would rather protect their reputation than protect their students."
Freshman,1,"Mansfield seems great at first. 
But don’t let it fool you it sucks. 
It’s like a bad 80s movie but set in 2019. There’s nothing to do 
The food sucks because sedexo literally couldn’t care about students health. 
The entire university is on a giant hill and never shovels in time for 8:30 classes. 
The people are all people who peak in high school and don’t want to get better at anything. The professors are the worst. They do not care about the students. It is like a high school 
There are favorites and attendance is mandatory for every class no matter the circumstance. 

You would think a state school would give more aid because it’s cheaper 
Mansfield doesn’t and after first semester good luck finding money.

All in all look somewhere else. The music department tells you it’s just like a conservatory but odds are you’ll end up paying less for a better program at a conservatory."
Freshman,1,"This school is a joke. Their music program is awful, as the professors will breathe down your next and tell you to quit your long-term job because “music is your life now”. Or the music professors will tell you how much of a disappointment you are, or fail you for Piano I because they didn’t like who you got your information on what was on the tests from. Some of the students are nice, but everyone acts like they’re better than everyone else, especially in the music department. There are bullies and rude people galore. It’s so easy to get in, and the school doesn’t care about whether or not you succeed, they just want numbers. At least most of the staff in Manser is incredibly nice, and the dorms are decent. You have to go to Elmira or Williamsport if you actually want to do anything, and the party scene is basically exclusive to only the Greek kids, they barely invite anyone outside of them."
Freshman,1,I would not recommend this school it is very boring up here and the enrollment numbers are on the decline. The only reason why this school is still running is because they are able to bring in kids from Philadelphia. The upper manser food is horrible and the lower manser food is better but you will go through your 250$ of flex fast because they are stingy when they swipe your card. They will overcharge you. When you visit here don’t get fooled by the good looking dorms that’s the only positive thing about this school. There is no college life up here and the parties are whack. Look at other state schools not this one. Also they will literally accept anyone that’s how desperate they are as a school to increase enrollment numbers so don’t stress about not getting in. I don’t even think I applied and I got in. Transferring to another state school was the best decision I ever made.
College Senior,1,"Campus police had wrongly accussed me of assult due to having the same name as a non-student.  Sadly, they already knew that the other girl was a non-student but continued to accuse me as a student.  It was a bit ridiculous - our addresses were in close proximity- but about 40 minutes away from each other."
College Senior,1,"Mansfield University is built on a mountain so no mater where you are going there is a up hill and a down hill so on rainy, snow, or ice the hills are very dangerous."
College Junior,1,The parking is horrible.  The school is on a hill so you have to park either all the way at the top and walk down to class or park at the bottom and walk all the way up to class.  You get ticketed for parking over night on the streets and the campus police are very strict.
College Junior,1,"There aren't any clubs, and there are very few bars.  There is a walmart though."
College Freshman,1,"There's only one main street, nothing special on it. There are two bars in town, again, nothing exciting. Very, very dry campus. It's very hard to find a (good) party."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to eat off campus. 
College Freshman,1,Guys only want to hook up and girls stick to what they know. Terrible.
College Freshman,1,Sodexo is terrible and I hope never to have to deal with food like this ever again.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Campus living has been very terrible.  They are trying to improve it but taking short cuts every chance they get.  The old dorms don't have wifi, only have laundry in creepy basements, and not to mention the nasty smells in Maple!! The new dorms are terrible for the sake of the paint peeling off the wall. Live off campus as soon as you can! It is well worth your while."
College Sophomore,1,"The recent increase of natural gas drilling in the area drove up housing costs, almost tripling rent. Houses for rent are decent and livable. Most of them are old and hard on the wallet to heat in the winter. Best bet is to get 2-3 other people to live with to help split the rent."
College Sophomore,1,the internet is very slow and likes to go out alot.
College Sophomore,1,"Commuter parking is far away from almost all of the buildings.  There is limited parking for commuters, and most of the lots that were marked as Commuter/Employee is now only for Employees. This makes it difficult to get to classes on time, unless you arrive ridiculously early to allow for a search for a spot and a 10 minute walk to the buildings, unless you get lucky and find a parking spot next to the building your class is in."
College Junior,1,"Mansfield University is a predominately white university. There is a very small percentage of African American students and the population of Asian, Indian, Spanish, etc  is even less. There are about 5 or 6  Asian international students at the campus every semester usually from China and there are about 3 international students for other places such as Africa or Europe."
College Freshman,1,Most of the school is white. We do have our handful of other races but the percentage of people are white.
College Freshman,1,The food is extremely subpar. They have the same type of food every night even though they claim that things will be changing.

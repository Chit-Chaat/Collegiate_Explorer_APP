Freshman,5,"I spent 2 years looking for the perfect college. time after time I went online and everything I found was way to large, too many parties or just not what I was looking for. My major as an occupational therapy assistant narrowed down my search and I ended up finding Central Penn College. I went for a visit and knew it was everything I was looking for it was small, a close knit community, no parties and so much student life! Central Penn was the only college that I applied to which was very risky but I got in!! With the program and the scheduling at Central Penn I will be able to finish in 1.5 years and get right into the work field. I`m so glad to say that I go to Central Penn College! The one thing that frustrates me at the moment is the schedule and the fact that I have to go to school over the summer but when I am working and everyone I graduated with still has 2 years if college it will all pay off!"
Freshman,5,I love how helpful everyone is at this college from advisors to professors to financial aid. I was always so worried about going to college due to not knowing if anyone was going to help me or if i was gonna be lost and on my own. Well I'm glad I took a chance with central Penn it was the best decision I made because the whole school is there every step of the way.

College Junior,5,"Being at my specific major in my school is great.  The Professors here are so helpful and really have no problem in challenging your mind, you are able to do hands on learning in the process of doing your book work.  I really enjoy how our Professor went above and beyond to set up a crime scene for us to investigate which related to our investigative writing course.  I learned how to write a report, a search warrant, as well as properly describing your evidence findings.  The workload could go both ways, it could be heavy as well as having light work it all depends on the class and the Professor.  I do enjoy this facility, although it is small and it is not half the size of the main campus, this facility offers as much as possible for their students in able to succeed it is small but BIG in concentrating on their students success. Along with this, they go above and beyond your expectations, where they do their best to assist you in your job search and internship, I have not yet graduated but I have spoken to past students whom have told me of their personal experiences."
College Senior,5,The application process was very tough to get into the PTA program. It feels good to be amongst the most elite students pursuing my major. The program is well-known in the community and job pursuit after graduation should be a piece of cake.

I have been completely satisfied with the administration, professors, and classmates as all encourage success. The online program is convenient and easy to navigate."
Junior,4,"I like how the class sizes at Central Penn College are fairly small. There aren't really any large lecture halls. This enables the students to have a better relationship with each professor. I think that Central Penn College could improve on its club sports offerings as they are pretty slim. Overall, Central Penn College offers a great learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"The overall experience at Central Penn Business School has been an educational growth. I'm half way into my second term and professors,  academic experience has grown forward."

Recent Alumnus,4,"Central Penn requires every student to have internships in order to graduate, and the passing rate of the licensure exam for PTA program is high, thankfully :)"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The workload is heavy for my program, PTA. I have had to cut out most of my social time (except for school itself) in order to finish homework. Yet, tutors are available from upper classmen, and teachers are always willing to stop and answer a question."
College Freshman,4,"It is very convenient for me because as an independent student going back after been out of school for such a long time, they place me in exactly the classes i needed and i am able to fucos on what i really need from my major to all the credit that i need to graduated."
College Freshman,4,"It is really great because i am 24 years old and i just recently went back to school and it is amazing because i do 50% of my classes online and the rest on campus. That works out great because i can still have a job and i can do the work at my own pace, also the school was really understudying with me going back to school after have been out for so long and they were able to place me in classes that provided me with the refreshments courses that i need it."

College Junior,4,Student here a Central  Pennsylvania College are very involved in the school; it's a lot of school spirit and the students support every event that the school holds. The students are very outgoing and helpful the help other students when it is necessary. The student body is small but is getting bigger as the years go on because the school is slowly growing as a whole and more students is encourage by other students to continue to attend here because it's a good school overall
College Junior,4,My school is a very small school there is only 10-15 students including me in basically all my classes. I get a chance to have one on one time with my professors when I need it. My school works around my life schedule. The staff and administrators are very helpful. They are always around during office hours and sometimes after offices hours for students who take night classes. I really love Central Pennsylvania College it's like a home to me and the people are very caring and lovely and they treat everybody like family
College Freshman,4,"I believe the person who assisted me with enrollment, Melissa, was very, very helpfuland patient..."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid was very successful in helping with aid/grants for education

College Junior,4,The average student is looking to get a degree and find a real career in that field.
College Junior,4,"My major does not have a lot of people in it, so the core classes are smaller. On the other hand, there are a lot of classes that are part of other programs, so there tend to be more in those classes."
College Junior,4,"The library is small, but the selection is good and tends towards professional works, mainly dealing with the programs on the school."
College Junior,4,There is no limit on how much students can print. The wireless network is fast and very reliable.
College Junior,4,"It is definetly worth my money.  There are no hidden fees and I feel that this school compared to the one I was attending in the past is  not as expensive.  The people in the financial office are very helpful, straighfoward.  Tips that I would give is... ALWAYS TURN IN YOUR DOCUMENTS ON THE DUE DATE...ALWAYS!!"
College Junior,4,"I do feel that this school has so much to offer current and future students.  I did attend a tech school, where I did not receive half of the help that CPC has offered to me.  I have a great opportunity to be successful in life, all thanks to Central Penn College.  I made the right choice."
College Junior,4,"Our computer lab is always available for us to use, we have printers on campus that are available to us, and the network use is fast, and reliable.  I have not had a problem with it at all."
College Junior,4,"Being here for two years, I have learn how to live the student life.  I do have a growing family where it does become tuff to manage both in life.  I do feel that Central Penn is pretty flexible because they offer online classes where you can work at your own speed and time, but you have to make sure you make your deadlines. I did not have any problems with transferring any credits.  I have had previous frustrations, but it was more with how to manage my life as an adult college student.  It is not easy, but if it was easy everyone would be walking around with a degree right? You have to work hard in life in able to enjoy the fruits that will be offered at the end."
College Junior,4,"I feel that this is the school for me.  I love Cetral Penn, their staff, and our Professors.  Their curriculum is easy to follow, their registration if you need help, you bet they will be there for you to help you in any way they possibly can, the workload depends on your Professor, I personally do not find to bad it could become overwhelming at first where it is important for you to have good time managment and preparation.  I am currently a work study student, where not only I am gaining knowledge in the ""Office"" world, I am also learning how to help other students like me."
College Sophomore,4,I have not yet started my college career at Central Penn College but I have been there many of times and have observed many of the classroom settings.  This college seems like a great choice for me.  It is a very diverse and career oriented school that has a lot of professors willing to help you and get to know you.  They take the time out of their day to make sure you are up to speed and on your way to success!
College Senior,4,"Central Penn is a very small and tight knit campus. The campus is beautiful, people are all friendly, and students are very presentable as they dress in attire dependent on their major."
College Senior,4,"The labs are new and improved. Technology fees are somewhat high, but depending on your major it might be worth it. They have TV's in classrooms to get a close up view of what the professor is showing you."
College Senior,4,"Central Penn offers some very unique programs. The PTA program is accelerated, which is very nice for non-traditional students. Central Penn tries to offer degrees that prepare you for a good job so that your hard work does pay off."
College Senior,4,My whole experience has been great. My professors have worked with me if need be and have always been there for help. My advisor has also done all she could to answer any questions and make sure I was on the right path. I would choose Central Penn all over again.
College Senior,4,"I love having online classes. The professors are still always there for help, you get just as much student interaction as you would in a physical class. Doing classes online gives you the flexibility to live a normal life while attending school."
College Senior,4,My financial aid process was way too easy. The office answered any questions I had and kept me up to date on when it was time to re-apply for things. The staff was great.
College Senior,4,"My professors have been great! They work with you, are always there to answer questions and have never expected more than they know you can handle."
College Senior,4,"The workload is perfect for someone like me who is a mother of 2 young boys. You learn enough for you to get a grasp on each class, but they don't go overboard so that you are overloaded with too much. I've found that a lot of outside companies rely on Central Penn as well when they are looking for new employees."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The computer lab is good a little on the dated side. There where plenty of computers even if it is hard to find a open lab. As for printing is was great, it was free and unlimited."
Recent Alumnus,4,the two biggest things that set this school apart from others are the staff being in the field of the class they are teaching. The second thing is that the school is very hands on which helps in the learning process.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was a science major, the classes where great I was able to get my phlebotomy and medical assistant certification. The labs where very hands on, but got the information that you needed to learn across."
College Junior,4,"I love all my professors because they help me with whatever i need help with, they are really into helping their students achieve their goals. They make sure they have time on their hands during school hours and after school hours to help and talk to students. The class registration is easy because our advisers take time out of their day to make an appointment for each student so they can sit down and help them one-by-one to registrate for the following semester."
College Junior,4,"The online class i took was easy even through I did not have a professor in front of my breaking down the subject to me step by step, my online professor made me feel like I was in a class room. If i did not understand the assignment of the day, they had a number/ email where we could call them anytime of the day and they will walk me through the steps over the phone . even through the work online was harder, then the work in traditional classes, it was easy.  I still learned from the experience it was another challenge I completed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I dislike the social aspect of online courses. There is little to no personal face to face contact with online courses, and that face to face contact means a lot to me."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nonw of them ever work theres always something wrong with these computer and they spend most money on computers, but they don't even work"
Recent Alumnus,2,The problem that I have is that if there is a large lump some of money you owe to the school they don't giving you enough time to come up with they money and they act like everyone has this the money in there back pocket.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is worth my money i just wish they would have more activities,but i wish i would have received more financial aid to buy book with the remaining money"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The teachers give you office hours to attend for more help, and you may get help from the school library, but the students are not that open for tutoring."
Recent Alumnus,2,My school provides hands on learning and internship but is not that bid of a campus so it do not have that many actives to be involved in
College Senior,2,"We have no athletic center, and only one student center. We have a small library, not many campus activities. But the campus looks pretty nice overall"
College Senior,2,"The school is very strict about what classes they choose to accept, and if they do not offer a specific course they won't except it.  This in turn increases students tuition as they are forced to take them from the school.  The school also offers very few scholarships, and provides minimal financial aid."
College Junior,2,Get It Done and Over With – One good thing about Central Penn College is that it is an excellerated program.  I will have completed my bachelor's degree in 2 years.  For someone who does not enjoy school but understands the value of a degree this is great.  The unfortunate part is that the credits are useless at any other school so make sure that Central Penn is where you want to be 110%.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Like earlier stated, Its hard picking classeds because alot of the classes run at the same time."
College Junior,2,"personally, college is going to be a very expensive process but its all worth it if your getting a education your paying for. i receive many scholarships from my college, but as advance towards my degree my financial aid as become a great expense."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't think its fair, because the much work you put in to your academic work, it is not expectable"
College Freshman,1,My school does not offer the same programs and activities as other universities or colleges. Unless your an honor student or into playing basketball finding entertainment outside the classroom will be very hard. The only thing my school offers is parties thrown by the students.
College Freshman,1,I choose this school because in the tour everything seemed so perfect and fun. But when I actually attended it wasn't what it seemed. The people were very rude and loud which made the atmosphere feel very uncomfortable. Also the school doesn't provide and activities or sports other than basketball. I'm a outgoing person so I liked to get involved in everything so I was disappointed   when I found out this school didn't offer much. Also they separate the upperclassman from the freshman I mean I understand the concept of this idea but I was looking forward to meeting new people of all different ages. Also the programs and classes they offer here are not accepted at other universities.

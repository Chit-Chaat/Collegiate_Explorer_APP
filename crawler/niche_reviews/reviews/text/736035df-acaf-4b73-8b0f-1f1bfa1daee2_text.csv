Alum,5,I did not take any online classes as a student but have had friends and relatives who did and have heard it was very well done.
Alum,5,My Principia College experience was outstanding.  It prepared me for future careers and gave me the tools and confidence to compete in the workforce.  The atmosphere on campus is great with little pressure to participate in the party scene.  Professors care and help you succeed.  As a DIII NCAA school the athletics were fun and competitive. Highly recommend this college.
Alum,5,Did not take online classes so I can't talk about them - I do know others who did and I guess it depends which course you took.
Alum,5,"Never thought a small mid-western college would be right, but fabulous instructor-led study abroads, tons of clubs, oldest student-run political/academic conference in U.S., students learn in real-world on and off campus (archeological digs, research, stipends to help with low or non-paying internships) - it's AMAZING!"
Senior,5,I love the variety offered and the ability to participate in multiple things. The athetics are really wonderful and the small class sizes allow for more personal learning.
Sophomore,5,"I am still attending Principia College and it is amazing. The academic atmosphere is amazing, and all of the professors are there to help you succeed in the time after you graduate. The community is also safe and friendly."
Freshman,5,Principia College offers a supportive and welcoming environment. Almost all students have the opportunity to go on abroad's and take internships. Principia's education provides a truly welcoming and uplifting approach to learning.
Sophomore,5,"I grew up attending public schools and knew I wanted to attend a small liberal arts college. I selected this school because (a) I grew up in Christian Science and like the religion, and (b) I am NOT into partying. At all. Some people party here (quietly), but most do not. I'm currently a Sophomore and love it here. I play on the soccer team and have two different jobs, and keep very busy. I didn't think I'd attend a college with only 500 students, since my high school had 1200 students, but I feel very comfortable here. Sometimes it gets  super-quiet here on weekends, but I've always been able to find someone to hang out with. Go Panthers!"
College Sophomore,5,"What I love about my school is that is is a close, tight-knit community. We all know and support each other in our daily endeavors. Being at a small school also allows for a lot of opportunities--trying new athletics, having multiple extra-curricular activities, working one on one with visiting professionals, and participating in more involved abroad programs. I could never choose another school because this is my family."
College Sophomore,5,The campus really does a great job of making everyone feel safe and healthy.
College Sophomore,5,"The weather is amazing, and since the dorms are relatively close to classes, even bad weather is hardly worth a fuss."
College Sophomore,5,"As a school specifically designed for Christian Scientists, we boast a great deal of diversity in everything but religion."
College Sophomore,5,Principia College is really ahead of other campuses as far as beauty and eco-friendliness.
College Sophomore,5,"Drinking is strongly discouraged. Smoking is forbidden, and anything else is strictly prohibited."
College Student,5,"Plenty of activities daily, friendly atmosphere, scenic location."
College Student,5,International students from across the world make up about 20% of the student body.
Junior,4,Only did remote learning due to Covid-19. Teachers were very flexible and supportive of the transition.
Junior,4,"Great college when it comes to opportunities for exploration ~ tons of clubs, abroads, and other extracurriculars"
College Sophomore,4,"Each house has their own computer labs, while theres also a number of computer labs within the school buildings."
College Sophomore,4,The restriction of the religion certainly shows in the great quality of the guys on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't own a car, so I'm not a great judge, but it seems to be fine."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere, the location, and the education are all excellent, but sometimes the education and the financial situation is frustrating."
College Sophomore,4,"The education is outstanding, but a lot of the times it can get really challenging and frustrating when you can't seem to keep up."
College Sophomore,4,"Drinking at any age is discouraged, and drug use is forbidden. In contrast, everyone is very friendly, and it creates an honest, safe environment."
College Sophomore,4,"Network reliability is high, speed is average, and they encourage every student to at least have access to the provided email system."
College Freshman,4,"Principia has rules against drug use, and most people follow it. The only drug you will find is weed, which a small amount of students use. Alcohol is generally more common at Principia, though compared to other schools is still very rare. As far a pressure, there is none."
College Junior,4,"Religious Liberal Arts – Since Principia College is a Liberal Arts College, it offers specific majors and does not offer some majors that other colleges might. The professors are all very interested in the subjects that they teach and really do work extremely hard to make it the best experience they can for their students. The campus is small, so it is an easy commute from class to class or dorm to class. It is easy to register and academic advisors make it much easier to make sure your schedule will be possible for you to follow without getting too deep in class work and commitments. It is possible to create a special major, but there is a process, and those who choose to do so are students who really care about that major topic. Popular areas of study are mass communications, math, business administration, education and biology."
College Sophomore,4,"The overall campus consists of 11 non residential buildings: 2 athletic facilities, 4 class buildings, a library, 2 art studios, an auditorium, a dining hall. The facilities at the college that I currently attend are very nicely kept. Our library is really nice there are numerous places to go and have that quieter setting to do some studying. That being said, not only do you have the opportunity to study in the library but you also have the opportunity to find a classroom to just study in because the buildings where classes are held are open 24 hours that includes the art studios. There are two athletic facilities. One is where basketball games are held and the other things like swim meets and indoor track. The athletic facilities are very nice inside and out but unfortunately neither is open 24 hours. The campus is really small and the community is just as small which could be a plus but just as easily a minus. The experience you have on a campus and in a community like this one is every bit of much of what you bring to the table."
College Student,4,"Great Campus – 2600 acre campus on bluffs overlooking Mississippi, located in very small, historic village, religion shared by everyone on campus makes for a great atmosphere."
College Student,4,"Moral Standards – Strong Moral Standards are upheld, though any harsh actions are justified by the school code."
College Student,4,"Pretty Good – The Dining Hall is fine, the meals are sometimes repetitive but the main courses are usually good and theres always plenty of other option.  The Pub offers an alternative for meals as well as the famous Pub shake.  The Convenience Store is great for snacks, especially at late hours."
College Sophomore,4,There are enough parking spots for everyone. There are tickets if you don't get a pass. You only need a car going to and from school
College Junior,4,"Amazing Abroads! The abroads are amazing and they go all over the world.  They are affordable since they use your regular tuition to pay for the abroad (including classes, meals, board, and whatever traveling the group does while there), and they are wonderfully in-depth and all of them (while geared more towards a certain major) are open to all majors."
College Sophomore,4,"Good Stuff – There are three places to get food on campus, the Howard Center Dining Hall, the Piasa Pub, and the Piasa Convenience Store. Each has its own unique flair. The dining hall has a good variety of meals, though thoroughly chicken based. The Pub serves fast food style food at a not so fast rate, though the pre-made wraps are delicious. The convenience store has quite a variety of food and a lot is organic! Unfortunately, it is very overpriced so I take my business mostly to the other two."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really a Greek-specific life on campus.
College Freshman,2,"House Hours – Since this is a religious school there are house hours to prevent extra marital sex on campus, on weeknights once it becomes midnight all opposite sexes must be out of each others rooms.On weekends opposite sexes must be out by 2am. Alcohol is also prohibited on campus (religious reasons)."
College Sophomore,2,"Living Off Campus Is Not Possible – Unless the family has grown up in the area, all students board. The location of the college is very remote. But I feel it's easier to keep in touch with friends because they all live on campus. But there are times when it gets hard when wanting to get off campus. Since the locations of the college is so removed from the surrounding cities, going out is often a luxury."
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife is strongly discouraged for students on campus.

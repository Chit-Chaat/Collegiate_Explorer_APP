Freshman,5,"Missouri Valley College has been great so far. The staff have been really helpful and friendly. The small town feel is what I like the most, everything is right there and it is not to busy."
Senior,5,This school has offered me so much when it comes to find myself as a person. The staff is incredible and hard working. The purpose of the school is to get the students to succeed which I think is phenomenal. I have loved my past 3 years at this school
Sophomore,5,I had a great experience playing Volleyball and studying at Missouri Valley College. The Culture and the community gave me a sense of belonging and the professors help and support you academically. I have experience a vast mixture of activities that have allowed me to explore and embrace different cultures.
Niche User,5,Coming from a small school the class sizes are perfect!  Not overwhelming like at the bigger universities.
Junior,5,The environment is so nice and the professors are great and always willing to help. The campus has a great potential to grow and become a really nice place to stay.
Junior,5,"All the classroom sizes are small, which means teachers will know you personally. The teachers are their to help during school time and outside of school including late nights and weekends. All of the classes that are offered are directed towards your major or degree program,"
Freshman,5,I love just about everything about the school. Education is definitely a number one at the school. Tutors are available when needed.  Athletes are very well taken care of. We do community service at the school. I met great friends. Professors are very informative. it feels like a home away from home.
Freshman,5,Well my experience in Missouri was great for my first time being away from home. Don't think their are any changes to be made.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Missouri Valley College is awesome. Being an incoming freshman coming from Texas it was hard to do that transition. But when I stepped foot on campus and started going to class the professors helped me so much. The professors were convienent and available and guided me to become successful in they're class. The atmosphere is great, everyone is kind and sweet and always has a smile on they're face no matter what time of the day it was. All the activities on campus were so fun and the community is very involved and we help the community a lot. I even joined a church and the church came to pick me and my teammates up and they became my second parents from home & they also helped me when I became really sick. Even home sick.  I rate Missouri Valley College beyond the stars. If you're looking for a small college town, quiet,loving, with awesome spirit Missouri Valley College is the college to go to! I love it!"
Freshman,5,M favorite part about Missouri Valley USB the size of the school. It's real small so you can really make that's connection with your professors and fellow students. The classes have about 20/25 students in them so you basically know everyone. And the teachers are so welcoming.
College Freshman,5,"The courses and professors here are amazing. Great courses, great professors, great variety of courses and professors. Very small class sizes, but that is what I love about Valley"
College Freshman,5,My school experience has bee been. I would recommend it to any prospecting students.
College Freshman,5,The quality and variety of courses are great. Professors make sure students are understanding and if they aren't they set up times available to talk. Classes are small and I think it is the best.
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities have good quality and are very good for average students. Fan support/ school spirit is huge at Missouri Valley.
College Freshman,5,"I love it here at Valley, the people here are very welcoming and encourage involvement. The school is very diverse. The teaching here is excellent and the class sizes are very beneficial for the best amount of student success."
College Sophomore,5,Administration is the best!! They are very intelligent in their area of study and helpful with any arising issue!
College Freshman,5,It's just a small school. Everything is a 3 min. walk away.
College Sophomore,5,The best part about the education program at Missouri Valley is the size of the classes. They're small classes so there is a lot of interaction with the teacher. I enjoy the program and the workload is not extremely stressful.
College Sophomore,5,Most of the students come from the same type of area that I do so they dress about the same. There are a lot of student athletes here that I can easily relate with.
College Sophomore,5,I'm happy with the physical education program that I have chosen to pursue. I would like to be a P.E. teacher and a basketball coach after I complete my schooling. I am not worried about finding an education job after graduation.
Senior,4,"Due to being on a smaller campus, I have been able to have AMAZING 1-on-1 opportunities. I have met the best mentors and my teachers actually care about my future. I have been able to gain an immense amount of leadership and people skills to help me in my future career of law."
Senior,4,I took online classes the summer after my sophomore year in 2019 and it was extremely simple and easy to navigate. I learned all that I needed to know in the allocated 8 weeks!
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity and how many friends you can make from all around the world. I love the sports. The one thing I would change is the location
Senior,4,"The staff made it pretty simple so that the students were able to succeed in their courses. My field of study was very supportive and understanding. Although online course were a challenge for not only professors but students as well, overall we all adjusted."
Sophomore,4,"So far my college  experience  has been everything I pretty much expect coming from a year break for school altogether. Before I even thought about giving college a try, I continued to work at a small sub shop, making as much money as I could to support my mom and my little brother. I told myself that if I was to go to school, I would need to apply myself and prioritize grades and education over fun. And so my first year I kept my head in the books along with staying focused on the court as a team member of the varsity volleyball team, and I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I feel because I’m out pretty much in the middle of nowhere, I can easily focus on what I need to do in order to graduate. There’s no city to explore or go out into, not much partying for me, and no overwhelming pressure from others to make wrong choices. As long as I continue to put school first and get that degree, I know the rest of my college experience will make me become successful in the future"
Niche User,4,I went for a visit  for a volleyball scholarship. I liked the fact that it was a small college and a small town. The coaches were personable and seemed to care about me. They also were worried about me as a student. Getting my degree is just as important to me as playing volleyball. I liked there student to teacher ratio. If I could change anything it would be upgraded dorms. Making them more modern would make transitioning from home to school easier
Niche User,4,My experience with Missouri Valley College has been great so far. I learn new and cool things through my older sister who goes to college there. I can't wait to go to college. I'm hoping to be accepted by Missouri Valley College.
Alum,4,"Small- family oriented campus. Majority of students are on athletic/academic scholarships. Residents and families are very supportive of sporting events.  Being that it is a small town there are very limited choices in restaurant and eating options, especially when family and friends come to town. There have been upgrades to the campus i.e the student center and the smoothie/juice bar. I"
Senior,4,"It is a small school with a wide variety of people. All of the buildings are walking distance, which means you can wake up at 7:55 to make it to your 8 am. Everyone plays a sport so everyone understands the ""I have practice"" excuse. The teachers know your name and getting help is easily achievable. There is a lot to do with so many sports teams and the school is big on school spirit. A unique experience. The only downfall is the town is so small."
Junior,4,"From my visiting the school, I can see that there is a lot of people who are willing to be invested in the school not only in academics but in sports, getting acquainted with everyone, and just overall having a good time."
Junior,4,"Coming here was the best decision I ever made! It is a nice little university where students are people rather than numbers and the professors are able to have one on one will all their students outside of class. The atmosphere here is amazing! The only thing that this place could use is some remodeling on the older dorm/housing establishments to make the college look more presentable. Other than that, Missouri Valley College is the best place to go if you are an athlete or someone who is considering a fine arts major!"
Sophomore,4,"I loved the size of the campus as well the friendliness as soon as you step foot  campus. The admissions office made me feel welcome and enthused that I was interested in attending. The professors are incredibly accommodating and truly want their students to succeed. Being an athletics centered school the teachers are willing to work around those schedules. Even if you are not understanding the subject material teachers and faculty are understanding and willing to go out of their way to ensure that you do understand. Because it is a private college it is a bit more on the pricer side and that can be worrisome and stressful.  The diversity on this small campus is truly incredible, we have people from all over the world attending and playing sports. The campus is a bit aged and therefore the dorms are as well unfortunately but the academic buildings are even older and it gives them an architecturally aged beauty."
Freshman,4,"My experience here at moval has been great so far. I call it a very small school with very big opportunities. The diversity here at Missouri Valley is among the most that I have ever witnessed. The teachers and professors are serious about the education of every student here. The staff are very welcoming. They accept you for who you are and focuses their attention on helping students excell. The environment is healthy overall. I feel safe here for the most part.  Of course negative things tend to happen but that's expected at almost any post-secondary establishment. Missouri Valley is also big on sports recruiting. This is a wonderful place to progress as an athlete and show competitiveness at the NAIA level. If you are on search for a small or private college in the Midwest, I would recommend Missouri Valley College to be one your top options to choose from. Valley Will Roll!"
Freshman,4,"Missouri Valley College is a good college if you're looking for a more personal school. We're a private college that has roughly two-thousand students in attendance. The professors actually care about your success, and you're more than just a number. There are also a lot of things that you can do on campus. I would like to see the college update their athletic facilities, however. I also would like to see them pay for player packs of athletes like other colleges do."
Freshman,4,So far I cant complain to much. I really enjoy the school. The best part about the school is the athletics. there are roughly 1500 students and 1300 of those students are athletes. The environment is really relaxing and I haven't met anyone I don't get along with. Missouri valley is overall a great place so far.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the school environment and class sizes, teachers usually know your names"
College Student,4,I am not in Greek but I would like to be and I think it would be very enjoyable.
College Freshman,4,"Campus safety and security is great, there has not been any crime"
College Freshman,4,Athletics is super important here at Valley. Our sports teams are ranked high in the nation. Our fans are amazing.
College Freshman,4,Alpha sigma alpha girls are the best. TKE guys are dicks. alpha sig guys are weird. Theta Phi girls are rude.
College Freshman,4,It's a great place! Everyone is very friendly and I joined Greek life making my campus experience so much better!
College Freshman,4,Everyone I believe is required to have internship hours for their senior seminar class and teachers are available to help with anything needed.
College Freshman,4,We don't have a lot of greek housing available and the greek life isn't the most diverse but they are very welcoming and what they stand for is great.
Recent Alumnus,4,I was a charter member of my chapter under Zeta Phi Bet Sorority INC.
College Senior,4,"This school can be a real culture shock to many people, I myself was shocked, it is a really small school, and the town isn't much bigger. Over 70% of students are athletes so classes consistently get out at the same time every day so students can go to practice. If you are a science major all of your classes really happen in 1 building. This school is really good though because of how small it is, class sizes are usually under 20, this means you can get a lot of 1 on 1 with professors to get help and they are really open to helping you to succeed. They have a nice new gym and are working in adding in more student activities. So if you are from a big city or large university it takes time getting use to the fact you see everyone on campus most days, but I have found that is a good thing in the help you can get from it."
College Sophomore,4,"I go to Missouri Valley College where almost all of the students that attend here are athletes. I think that this is unique because I am not only majoring in athletic training, but I am also an athlete my self that plays for this college."
College Freshman,4,"The guys on campus are mostly athletes, they are all cool people to hang around and have fun with. As for the ladies on campus they are like the guys on campus when it comes to athletics, they are very attractive. As for the way everyone dresses, I would say its not bad at all they dress the way they want but there is nothing inappropriate. Relationships aren't that bad either mostly everyone is talking with someone so I would say that part is good as well."
College Sophomore,4,We have students from almost all over the world. Us American students are greatly interested in meeting and learning about new cultures
College Senior,4,There is a large number of diverse students on campus. Everyone gets along with everyone. Nobody is an outcast by there ethnicity.
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity on campus is outstanding, there are so many different kinds of people who come from all around the world and they bring so much to the school."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics at my school are very important to all of the students and families, the school spirit is amazing and keeps the games interesting."
College Junior,4,I can only speak for the mass communications and athletic training majors but the professors are great and connected with their students. They make themselves very available for assistance and guide you through the program.
College Sophomore,4,Sports is what this school does. I know we have top coaches and athletic trainers helping all of the student athletes. How else could we have three women wrestle in the Olympics from our school?
College Sophomore,4,The food is delicious. And I'm so thankful they have a salad bar! Plus the desserts are always great!
College Freshman,4,the athletics at are school are very competitive we all practice a lot and we are involved a lot with helping with nascar and dinners the lions club puts on. Our performance is good and still progressing. i am a fan to all sports and cheer on both teams because i beleive in all to enjoy their time in their sport. the facilities are good and clean. There are no factors
College Freshman,4,There are lots of different cultures here and races the only challenges are they get more attention because they cannot speek english well so they get more help and the challenges are being able to understand them. The economic background is average and political beleifs democrat/ republican. The religion is Catholic
College Freshman,4,"It's a very good academic institution, generally you will have classes with a small number of students. the professors here are great and they are happy to teach and you can reach them with ease."
College Freshman,4,I'm only a freshman right now but as far as the classes needed towards my major I've been satisfied. I like my Intro to Education courses as well as my math courses.
College Freshman,4,"It's close to the school and free, but the parking spaces are small."
College Freshman,4,The professors are amazing and really know and care about you personally.
Senior,2,I liked the diverse campus that allowed you to meet people from all over the globe and that are playing all sorts of sports. They had good professors and and average classrooms. Would like to see the campus add safety measures like campus emergency buttons and such.
Sophomore,2,"Small, some teachers care. Food is terrible most days, not much school support for sports. Not much to do in the area accept got to mcdonalds at 11pm. Party scene non existent."
College Student,2,Everyonce in awhile you see campus police drive around other than that i have not seen them.
College Student,2,For being a sports college alot of students are here because of sports scholorships our fan support is poor our school spirit is poor and not many people show up to the games.
College Freshman,2,I pay way too much money to have windows that do not close and heaters that do not work
College Freshman,2,Our gym doesn't have air conditioning and it's so hot in there. During pre season we take ice bathes outside in these buckets.
College Junior,2,"If you're not an athlete, the school doesn't care about you. Athletics are held way above academics at Missouri Valley."
College Senior,2,People will not usually let a college student rent an apartment.
College Senior,2,"There is a lot of options, but it's hard to find one that best fits my needs. I always go to the cafeteria praying that it will be a good day."
College Sophomore,2,when you are needing to complete extra work at a local company without transportation it is very hard. also when needing to go to get household items for your dorm it gets hard without a ride.
College Sophomore,2,I've came across a lot of new friends from being on this campus for two years already and just observing the drug usage is just sad. the people who you wouldn't assume to do drugs are actively doing drugs.
College Sophomore,2,"In Missouri, you never know what the weather wants to do. some days it will be nice and sunny and then all of a sudden clouds come then starts raining sometimes even snowing.  it affects the campus greatly by making it difficult for some students to walk to the cafeteria to eat."
College Freshman,2,I like small towns but this is just a town where people stay to themselves unless it's old people at McDonald's
College Freshman,2,Too many guys over girls. This means the Bro to Pull ratio is off and guys become competitive and it's like high school bull shit. The girls are not much. Yes you have your dimes here and there but they are already snatched up by a guy or are too conceded for their own good.
College Freshman,2,"They say that this is a liberal arts college, but it doesn't seem like they have anyone very talented or offer more majors to draw more students."
College Freshman,2,The only thing that is good is breakfast..
College Senior,2,There are not many options to choose from. The places that are good are thirty minutes away from campus. The places around campus are not very good and not within walking distance if you do not have a car
College Sophomore,2,Facilities aren't the best but sports are a big part of the school. 
College Sophomore,2,Campus staff are helpful. Options are not very good. 
College Junior,2,"There is nothing to eat off campus other than Pizza Hut, Applebee's, and some small town door"
College Senior,1,There is literally one place to go in town.
College Senior,1,"It is a school that values only athetles, and for that reason, education is put aside."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is the worst head of security in the nation. Instead of addressing real problems and taking care of them she  looks for minuscule meaningless problems to make persons in the department look better at their jobs, meanwhile people's rooms are getting robbed with no implications."
Recent Alumnus,1,It's awful. I started training more through my sport than I ever have in my life and yet have hardly progressed physically because of the poor quality food offered at the on campus cafe (there's only 1). The only other places around are fast food joints and an Applebee's.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The dorms smell bad. Don't live on campus. The surrounding area is also very poor. The only upside is that it is dirt cheap to live there, mainly because no one on earth wants to live in Marshall. No food, nothing to do, you train in the worst facilities and not to mention, the school is run by the most ignorant jerks I have ever met. Especially dean of students, the RA directors, and most definitely the security lady. I urge any prospective students to not come to valley, save your time and money because you will probably transfer (note the bottom 10% retention rate in the US) it's not worth the experience."
College Junior,1,There is nothing to do but go to Walmart and Applebee's in Marshall but it keeps you focused on school
College Junior,1,The school needs a student center where kids can hang out between classes. More buildings need to be equipped with wifi and the gym should have a/c.
College Junior,1,The school is very outdated but trying to make improvements
Recent Alumnus,1,the dining is always the same dirty dishes. So you always have to search for the clean ones. You can never leave with food for reasons that are not explained. There are no late night options.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is always some form of drugs that are being done on campus
College Freshman,1,"I haven't noticed a push for academic success here. It is a tier 4 so it isn't too expected, the school thrives off the athletes."
College Freshman,1,No one is outgoing or interesting. Dead campus with little activity
Recent Alumnus,1,If you want to party this is not the school to go to. The night life is terrible the females don't want to dance with anybody. An the males always out number the females. Which is just a battle over attention. The music is alright nothing special I feel I could DJ better off my iPod.

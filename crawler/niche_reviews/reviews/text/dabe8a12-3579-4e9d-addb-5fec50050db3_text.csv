Freshman,5,"I worried that Olin probably couldn't provide the same hands-on experience in its hybrid classes as it's well known for. In some ways this is slightly true because most of our machine work will take place when shops open up, but Olin is still very conceptually hands on, meaning that there are very few lectures and most learning comes through collaboration and in depth projects"
Freshman,5,I was honestly quite worried about how isolating the pandemic was going to make my first year of college - I have been pleasantly surprised that Olin's small student population has allowed for a much more open social environment than it likely would have been at a larger college. People are also mostly very friendly and open to chatting
Freshman,5,"Great community brings both a sense of family and feeling supported in all your endeavors. The faculty and staff are so dedicated to their work, and the students are incredibly smart and kind -- there is an endless number of opportunities for each student given the small size of the school, and each student will be able to find and learn the things they want to learn and achieve. The mission to ""do good in the world"" is a presence that is often not found at other technical schools."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love this school. Though it's small the people here are so excepting and caring and its like a huge family here. Everyone is always willing to help each other out and you're constantly encouraged to purse what you're passionate about.
Freshman,5,"Olin is a wonderful place to learn how to work effectively as an engineer, with a really unique culture and without giving up interests outside of engineering."
Sophomore,5,"Olin gives you a really unique undergrad experience. If you're motivated but want to get away from the stress of tests, this is the place for you."
Sophomore,5,"Olin is a wonderful community for students who are eager to connect with other engineers, and enjoy a hands on engineering experience that encourages students to learn how to teach themselves the necessary skills for any engineering endeavor they wish to take.  The workload is definitely intense, and you come to be very grateful that ""minimum viable products"" exist, as the difficulty and intensity of most projects are typically determined by the students' themselves. The staff is super friendly. If you like small schools and getting to really know your peers, being in a class of 90-90 students definitely encourages that, and by engineering school standards we are definitely a fairly diverse student body (with a completely even gender split)."
Junior,5,"I love the collaborative atmosphere at Olin; people will often help you out even if you don't know each other personally.

The professors are 110% invested in teaching and in seeing their students succeed, and will often put in overtime to make sure you're doing alright.

Lots of on-campus resources, from free on-demand ColonyCare therapy to a fully equipped machine shop. The administration is sometimes distant and inscrutable, but they do care about listening to the students and including their feedback in the way the school runs.

You'll get lots of opportunities for internships while at Olin (particularly in software, although Olin has been making an effort to diversify recruiting companies)

Downsides of Olin include a tendency to never leave campus (getting to downtown Boston is a bit of a pain without a car) and a culture of overwork (whether through passion for projects or sheer habit)."
Sophomore,5,"Olin College of Engineering is a one of a kind place to learn engineering. It teaches in a hands on, do-learning style  heaving focusing on the technical but also on the ""soft skills"" of engineering. Students are constantly collaborating on group projects. It is close knit community and the professors really seem to care about you and what you are learning. No proffesor gets tenure so the experimental mindset keeps curriculum fresh.  Students here can also cross register at both Wellesey and Babson to take Liberal Arts, and Entrepreneurship classes."
College Sophomore,5,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOY MY SCHOOLING, EASY APPROACH"
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. Because we are such a small school, an unfamiliar face is recognized immediately. Babson Public Safety is always patrolling campus; I can often see a car from my dorm window."
College Freshman,5,"Our food gets a lot of crap from people even though it is some of the best in the country. We are a school of 350 students, so we do not have multiple dining halls. The one that we do have has puts out multitudes of vegetarian, vegan, gluten and allergy free options, and there is always something for someone. The kitchen staff is friendly and will gladly give you anything you ask for (they made me cupcakes on my birthday!), and they are always open to suggestions on how to improve the dining experience. Every Olin student is on an unlimited meal plan, which includes unlimited swipes at neighbor colleges Babson, Wellesley, and Brandeis, so if you are ever cross-registered you do not need to worry about food."
College Freshman,5,"Olin has a different admission process. There are two rounds of admission: round one, which is based off of the typical common application, and round two, where applicants passing round one are invited to campus for an assessment process called Candidate's Weekend. After Candidate's Weekend, all ""numbers"" concerning the applicant such as test scores and gpa are disregarded and the applicant is evaluated based on his/her ""fit"" for Olin. This allows the admissions team to build a class that really works together."
College Freshman,5,"The administration understands that we are college students who are going to do college student things. As long as there is no property damage or physical harm, we are generally left to our own devices. Everyone at Olin looks out for eachother, so nothing like that ever happens anyway."
College Freshman,5,Everyone who goes to Olin gets a half tuition scholarship valued at over 90000 dollars over four years. Everyone.
College Freshman,5,"Every double gets their own bathroom, microwave, and fridge. And we get control over the air conditioning. Seriously - that's awesome. The rooms are pretty spacious and the buildings are well maintained. The dorm atmosphere is incredible as well - there are always people doing something cool in one of the lounges, whether it's playing a game, watching a movie, or just hanging out."
College Freshman,5,"The people at Olin are unlike anyone else. To get a real idea of what it's like, you really need to visit. The honor code is a huge part of student life. Because of that and the small student population, the community is super close, which we all love. "
College Freshman,5,"Although I've only taken one class in my possible major, I'm already happy with it. "
College Freshman,5,Olin automatically gives any accepted student a half tuition scholarship. 
College Freshman,5,"Both guys and girls are pretty nerdy, but we love that. Everyone is passionate about something, and everyone's excited about their academics. Relationships vary a lot, so you can do whatever you're comfortable with. Social life is vibrant, and almost everyone is fairly outgoing and excited to meet and talk to each other. Olin is really small (350ish people) but I personally think that's great, though it does limit the number of people you can meet on campus. Babson and Wellesley are both right next door thought, so there's no shortage of people off campus"
College Freshman,5,"Our dorms are the best. Seriously. They're both less than 15 years old, and they're kept super clean. Our dorm rooms are huge, and each room gets their own bathroom with a toilet and a shower. Each room comes stocked with a microfridge, 2 beds, 2 desks, and 2 rolly chairs :) Dorms are less than a 2 minute walk to classes or food. Social atmosphere is the amazing. Great dorm culture, and great R2s (our version of RAs)."
College Freshman,5,"Advantages of going to engineering-only school: Fabulous technology. IT is great, printing is free and accessible, internet is fast and reliable. The laptop that the school requires comes loaded with all the software you'll need for most classes at Olin. "
College Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing. They're all so engaging, and the students get to help review applications for new professors and professors who want to return. They're all uber qualified for their positions, and also really want you to succeed. Because Olin is so small, the professors have no trouble knowing everyone's names. The workload is not for the faint-of-heart, but the students and faculty are there to help you get through it. The curriculum is unique to Olin, so we have strange classes. An example of this is Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World as a required first semester freshman course. This course combines calculus, physics, and programming into one class. The goal of this sort of class is to provide real world application to education. Almost all classes are project based, and tests are few and far between. "
College Freshman,5,"Workload at Olin is insane. However, because of our unique do-learn style, the work is so much fun. I'll be up till 2am working on a project, but it'll be with 4 other people building a hopping kangaroo and a game for fourth graders (who will be the ones grading the project). All the students have to be extremely self-driven and motivated, but it's so rewarding. Team projects are also big here, which is comparable to the real business world. Students aren't competitive at all. Everyone is really good at different things, and will help you out in their area of expertise. "
College Freshman,5,The honor code means that I can trust pretty much everyone on campus. The community is super close and everyone knows everyone. The people are the coolest I've met anywhere and the academics are so strong and not competitive at all. Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you. I could not be more happy.
College Junior,5,Olin College is usually very safe. There is no pressure to do drugs or drink if you don't want to. Help is usually available and provided when needed.
College Freshman,5,"Nothing is more important at this school than safety. There is no crime at all on campus; nothing has ever been reported stolen. I never feel in danger because I personally know every student. You can immediately recognize someone who doesn't go here; unless they seemed obviously accompanied by an Oliner, they are asked there purpose here. We share a police department with a neighboring college. They rarely come over here unless called (just because we're so chill). If there was an issue, I have trust in them."
College Freshman,5,Free parking! There are always a lot of empty parking spaces.
College Freshman,5,"Dorm rooms are huge. Freshmen are required to live in doubles at West Hall, but upperclassmen can choose to live in doubles (at West or East Hall) or suites (East Hall) by a lottery system. There however is an exception to live in a single."
College Freshman,5,The food is delicious! I believe the food was rated #8 in the nation by Princeton Review at one point.
College Freshman,5,There's an abundant amount of resources for students to use. The facilities like labs and machine shops are also world-class because they are fairly new.
College Freshman,5,"There is a computer lab at Olin, which has very high specs. All students are issued laptops which are very powerful for applications like Solidworks and MATLAB. "
College Freshman,5,"Students go to neighboring Babson College's clinic for health services. The workers there are friendly, helpful and efficient. The only drawback is that you'd have to make an appointment 24 hours in advance during peak times."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are genuinely passionate in their field and enjoy teaching their students. They really want them to succeed, and they encourage students to visit them in their office. The course work for classes are generally project-oriented, which may be a plus for some or a negative for others. The courses and research opportunities are not as diverse as a huge university, but the quality of education for the opportunities they have is world-class."
College Sophomore,5,All students must live on campus. The rooms are very big and each double or suite has one or two bathrooms. There are team study rooms and lounges. Doors are left open and unlocked. Valuables are safely left in the open.
College Freshman,5,"Unnervingly Safe – People don't even lock their doors. Also, the campus police don't come into the dorms unless there's an emergency and they get called. Even if they do, they usually will look the other way unless you're the direct cause of the emergency situation. The students do a fantastic job of looking after one another."
College Freshman,5,"Achieves the Perfect Balance – Everything about the academics of Olin is perfectly balanced. Professors are incredibly nice, helpful, and easy to talk to. They genuinely care about you and your work, and are always available to help you both in and out of class if needed.

The first semester curriculum is amazing. With a mix of design, modeling, and physics, as well as a humanities class of choice, you get to experience many forms of engineering at once. The workload is really on a personal basis. If you are a good student who can manage your time, it will seem like there is very little work at all. For example, I did almost all my work during the day, so I never had any homework to do at night, giving me plenty of free time. However, as a project based school, there will be many times that you will work for days on a single project with others. Don't expect to slack off, because if you do, both you and your group will pay for it."
College Junior,5,"Having a Car Is Easy and Super Helpful – With such a small campus it doesn't really matter where you park and there are always spaces somewhere. Parking for up to one car is free, and tickets are fairly rare. It is super useful to have a car."
College Junior,5,"We Have Alot of Freedom – We value our honor code tremendously. It serves to establish a standard of behavior, and to protect students. Rare  instances of cheating are dealt with fairness and understanding striving for the best outcome. The school tries not to get impinge on our social lives. Underage drinking is common, but very safe."
College Freshman,5,"Olin is a pretty small school, but the dorms are huge. Freshmen and sophmores are almost entirely in doubles with their own bathrooms. Upperclassmen usually move to suites with large lounges, two bathrooms, and six individual rooms. Just about everyone lives on campus all four years."
College Freshman,4,"We are right outside of Boston. It's not hard to go into the city for the day using Boston public transit. The surrounding suburbs are all very wealthy and nicely kept, but they don't have much besides restaurants."
College Freshman,4,"There are quite a few restaurants in the surrounding area, they just require a car or bike to get to them. Prices are a bit on the expensive side, but nothing with bankrupt you. Also, Dominoes delivers!"
College Freshman,4,"Needham and Wellesley are both pretty close, and both have reasonably priced, high quality food. "
College Freshman,4,"Olin doesn't have Greek life, we're too small for that. "
College Freshman,4,"Olin is extremely accepting of everyone, especially with regard to sexual orientation. There isn't much racial diversity"
College Freshman,4,Needham and Wellesley are both nice little towns with all the essentials and a couple good restaurants each. 
College Freshman,4,"The honor code is not to be messed with. It's the basis of student life at Olin and everyone really respects it and abides by it, which is a lot of the reason that my college is as amazing as it is. "
College Freshman,4,"I'm planning on going into general engineering, possibly concentrating in Design, but I haven't decided for sure yet. You aren;t required to declare your major until partway through sophomore year."
College Freshman,4,"There are only three majors at Olin- Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and General Engineering. If you choose to go the general engineering route, you can pick what you want to concentrate in- Computing, Robotics, Bio, Design, or you can design your own concentration with the support of the faculty. "
College Freshman,4,"It's typical New England weather- decent amount of snow, lovely fall colors, nice and warm in the spring and summer. "
College Freshman,4,"Because the college is so new, the buildings are also really new. State of the art technology, great classrooms, and the best dorms I've ever seen. Athletics aren't super popular, so we've only got some soccer fields when it comes to sport complexes. However, we have access to the college next door's sport complexes. Students usually hang out in the dorms in their free time, but since there's only two dorms you still see everyone. "
College Freshman,4,"Somewhat frustrating because we share health services and security with the college next door, but I've never felt the slightest bit unsafe on campus. The honor code means nothing gets stolen. Someone once found $20 in the dorm and pinned it up on the bulletin board. It sat there for 2 weeks before it was claimed. "
College Freshman,4,"Students all take care of each other, and there's no pressure at all. "
College Freshman,4,"At the beginning of freshman year, you buy a school-sponsored computer. For the next four years, you have unlimited IT access to fix them if they break AND a ton of software including but not limited too: MATLAB, solidwords, and the entire adobe suite (all which you use regularly in your classes). 
As we all are computer nerds, some people complain of the lack of support for non-school-sponsored laptops (i.e. Macs or even operating systems like linux). There are a good portion of people like that however, and they have ironed out most of the details of making everything work out."
College Freshman,4,"The food is really good. The dining hall is always willing to make gluten-free or vegetarian versions of the options upon request. There are tons of vegetarian, vegan, and meat varieties everyday. In the past, it has tended to get repetitive (just because we are a small school), but this semester all the food seems to be different. If you do get tired of the food, Olin students have unlimited access to the larger and a bit more diverse Babson dining hall."
College Sophomore,4,The administration leaves it to the students to obey the Honor Code. The students are treated like adults.
College Junior,4,There are lots of places to eat around the town and quite a bit of them offer student discounts and weekend deals. Wellesley/Needham are pricey towns though so you do end up spending quite a bit for a meal as a college student.
College Junior,4,"Really Safe – Alcohol's not forbidden, smokers are rarely seen. Our school's really good with taking care of one another since we're such a small school so drinking environment's really safe, unless students from near-by colleges who come to our parties try to put drugs into alcohol. Those stupid kids get thrown out of our parties once they get caught though."
College Junior,4,Olin gives merit scholarship to EVERYONE. Everyone gets half off tuition for all four years.
College Freshman,4,"Half-Tuition, What's Not to Love? Every Olin student gets half of tuition just for making it through the selection process. On top of that there's need-based financial aid. Going to the financial aid office is super easy (and if you go more than once, they'll know you by name...and ask how your summer's been.)"
Sophomore,2,"There are three words that I would use to describe Olin: cliquey, isolating, and superficial.

People are too wrapped up in work and their own little social bubbles to be bothered to ask people how they are doing, how their day has been, etc. I have seen people move tables at lunch and leave an individual person behind just to sit next to their 'friends'. 

It's shameful because people describe Olin as an accepting, supporting environment. I've found this to be true among the faculty and staff, but less so among the student body. If you have other interests beyond engineering (art, music, writing), you better have enough money to afford a car to get off campus.

Overall, the environment is reminiscent of a Silicon Valley boarding school. The 'techie' culture is overwhelmingly strong, people form cliques quickly and can be viciously cruel (I've seen friend groups change over the past year, but not by much), and people tend to be significantly more well-off than average."
College Junior,2,"Olin College is located in a suburb town. There are some stores and restaurants downtown and in the neighboring town. It's not super exciting, but there is easy access to the trains that can take students into Boston."
College Junior,2,"Sports Are Very Much an Extra Curricular – We don't have any NCAA teams because of our scholarship, and no  one would really have time to devote to that anyway. We do have a few pretty active rec teams such as ultimate Frisbee and soccer. We can also participate in Babson sports such as rugby and hockey. It's super easy to join and tons of fun."
College Freshman,2,"It's New England – Winters are...gross. There is a huge amount of snow, and then lots of freezing rain and fog and more snow. On the other hand spring and fall are absolutely gorgeous."
Senior,1,"If you are coming here ONLY for an engineering education, Olin is ok. If you want any kind of social life beyond drinking till passing out in the dorm lounges or if you have any interests beyond engineering, don't come here.

Olin, simply put, is poorly managed. They lost half of their endowment from the last recession. They have already mentioned they will cut things because of the current recession. According to a faculty member I'm close with, they need to remove half-tuition scholarships for EVERYONE, including current students, to stay financially secure. 

Combined with a sucky social scene, lack of opportunities beyond engineering, and the prevalence of wealthy & privileged kids who are out of touch with reality, I'd say almost any institution that has an engineering school is better than this. I hate to say it but Olin should not be as competitive to get into as it is. I went here for 4 years and will likely land the same job as if I had gone to a cheaper state school."

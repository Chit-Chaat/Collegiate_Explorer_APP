Sophomore,5,"So far, it's been a wonderful experience at New Mexico Highland University, the educational experience has been wonderful in comparison to where I came from. The professors are really nice and they want the best of each of their students. If there is anything I would want to change, it is going to be that student should get more involved in the events or activities that takes place in the school, but overall, New Mexico Highland University  has been a great choice and I will definitely encourage people to attend."
Junior,5,Great program and amazing professors who work well with students. Good resources available and there is always someone available to help when needed.
Senior,5,"I love the online courses for the RN-BSN bridge. The instructors are very helpful, and it’s easy to keep up with classes while concurrent working two jobs. I am so close to getting my degree and I’ve only just started. I like that you take two classes at a time. Taking two classes at a time helps keep me from feeling overwhelmed. I like that you also have the option to drop down to one class at a time if needed, but I feel that taking two classes every eight weeks is something achievable."
Graduate Student,5,I am a graduate student and attend the branch in Rio Rancho and online classes. I like the small campus and small classes. You get to know your classmates and professors well.
Niche User,5,"Highlands University is a very good school and offers a dual credit program to high school students, which is how I learned about them. They help students achieve their goals and have a reasonable price for their studies."
Graduate Student,5,"New Mexico Highlands University is a place where I have enhanced my learning thanks to great professors and administration. Everyone with who I have interacted with at the university has been very resourceful and supportive. New Mexico Highlands University has many great diverse majors from where to choose from. The tuition is very affordable, and the education is excellent. While the Albuquerque campus may sometimes seem small, it provides a great learning environment, in which classes are smaller and the students have space for interaction. Many times, the Albuquerque campus offers “teach-ins” during lunch hours, in which students can learn about different subjects affecting the community."
Freshman,5,"Highlands is home to those looking for a family outside family. I'm an international student and culture shock is bound to affect me here in the U.S. but so far, it has been cool and I mean that both literally and figuratively(the snow and the cold are still new to me). It's interesting to have friends who think it's cool to come from my home country even amidst the horrible stereotypes coating the name, Nigeria. 
The city is not as large as some popular places but there's almost always something to do. Highlands makes sure to host exciting events that allow students to connect with each other. 
The learning environment is also on point. The professors are there to help with anything from school work to personal/emotional issues. At Highlands, everyone and anyone can be of help."
Graduate Student,5,NMHU is a good university to attend if you want a college experience. The professors are very knowledgeable and ready to help students.
Graduate Student,5,"It was the best school I grew from as an individual.  It gave me the tools to find life and understand what the world is about and how to function as an employee and human.  I learned what I need to function, but now I am ready to learn more and help other students understand what the world is all about and how to continue helping others"
Sophomore,5,I loved how the professors worked with me when I had some trouble with my work and were willing to work with my schedule.
Graduate Student,5,"New Mexico Highlands has been a great place for me. I love the fact there is a campus in Albuquerque for the Social Work program. I have been attending this school for two years, and received my bachelors from them."
Alum,5,"I received my degree via the online RN-BSN program. I had wonderful instructors who were very helpful and professional. The lectures were available to watch live or at a later time, which was very convenient. I was able to complete the program while working full time and maintaining a home life. I did not attend classes on campus so I cannot attest to the campus life."
Freshman,5,It is very good they are always willing to help. They are very kind people inside school and out. They are wanting all there kids to suceed in what they do. If i ever needed help i could go to highland because they are always wanting to help there student. I really dont have anything bad to say becasue they are very helpful caring and are willing to do everything to help there students pass and they also keep a very safe environment for the students
Junior,5,New Mexico Highlands University is an excellent institution. I have received all the support needed to be a successful student.
Junior,5,"Their dedication to their students. They are one of the top schools for social work, which is my major. The support they give to the students is amazing, their academics are excellent. Your professors do everything to help the students get the best understanding of the material."
Sophomore,5,Professors are very professional and care about teaching. Teacher to student ratio is small so you are able to learn more. The tuition is affordable and have students from all over the country.
Freshman,5,"Highlands has helped me feel like I am at home, and if I need someone's help  to not feel afraid to ask."
Graduate Student,5,"Honestly, I think this is one of the best schools we have in New Mexico and compared to other schools its affordable. Teachers are challenging but overall they communicate very well with the students except one teacher. We all have that one teacher who takes forever to grade"
Sophomore,5,"so far it has been amazing coming to this school.kits affordable for what you get here, great work environment, small campus, one on one with the teachers its great! your not just a number here you are a person who matters!"
Recent Alumnus,5,This institution is very multicultural
Recent Alumnus,5,This is not a problem at this institution.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Excellent instructors, interesting classes taught by people who love to teach their subjects. Very informative and involved with all students."
Recent Alumnus,5,Security officers that have become familiar to students attending make me feel more safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,"So far it has been an honor to learn from all of my instructors! New Mexico Highlands - Higher Education Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico is a beautiful new facility. Faculty is very helpful, security officers present makes me feel safe."
College Junior,5,I played pokemon go at 2:30 am and didn't feel unsafe at all. I have always thought of campus as a 9.5 out of 10 on safety.
College Junior,5,I value my degree from NMHU. I agree with those who call it the Harvard of the southwest.
College Junior,5,I love the school. I have grown so much as a person and made amazing connections because of the opportunists given to me at NMHU.
College Sophomore,5,The professors were always willing to lend a helping hand
College Senior,5,"In being a student at NMHU since 2010 as a Freshman and now as a Graduate Student, I would have to say that had it not been for the staff and faculty at Highlands I have no idea where I would be. Thanks to Highlands I also have a strong social circle and networking system that was created by the diverse student population on the campus."
College Junior,5,"The parties are lit, the underage nightlife is very fun and available. All the parties and bars are within walking distance to campus."
College Junior,5,There is lots of diversity on campus from LBGTQ* to international students we have various cultures and try to keep an open mind.
College Junior,5,Professors and courses at Highlands are great. They are understanding and they work with you to help you understand the material. They are always around when needed and try to keep flexiable hours in case students need to meet with them. Class size has never been a problem the most I think I ever had in a class were like around 50 and it was a lecture for Psychology and History. And they were taught with Iclickers so it was easy to participate without having to do it in front of everyone.
College Junior,5,Personally I feel very safe on campus. I do not own a car thus I have to walk to and from campus to my house and I am fine doing it and do not worry about it being dark.
College Sophomore,5,"The quality of the courses is high. I learn a lot from them in my first year. Mostly, the professors were great. I learned a lot from all of them, but one seemed to have a problem with my spiritual beliefs. 95% of classes are around the capacity of 25 students. Lectures are easy to follow, also. There are many interesting courses at this school, many of which are hands-on."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is small. I have professors that care on whether or not I succeed. I am not just a number at this school. 95% of classes are small enough for the teachers to learn everybodys' names. The relationship the professors have with the students are nothing short of personable, yet still extremely professional. Fellow students come from many different backgrounds, and, for the most part, are extremely social. Probably the greatest thing about NMHU is that it is quite cheap in regards to tuition."
College Junior,5,"As a first generation college student, the staff at New Mexico Highlands University made it easy to understand the application process. I have enjoyed the knowledge that my instructors have shared with me."
College Freshman,5,There are the typical parties where you go to a house to dance and drink. Then there are parties where people go into the mountains build a fire and dance and drink. They're both fun though.
College Freshman,5,Great to meet new friends and turn up!!!!
College Freshman,5,The professors here are really close to their students. I like how they interact with the students even when they are not taking that class anymore. Class sizes are the best its about eleven students to one teacher. This give students that one on one action with the teachers. They also offering a hand to help and its just an amazing experience.
College Junior,5,No on-campus housing so no drugs allowed or visible.
College Sophomore,5,Emergency poles at almost ever building. Campus police are always patrolling around campus and in dorms. I feel extremely safe!!
College Sophomore,5,"The RA's are nice, dorms are very clean. Average school rules. Takes no more than 5 minutes to walk to any class."
College Junior,5,"Superior parking, always plenty of room, spots are right outside the building."
College Junior,5,Computer use and access is excellent at my campus.
College Junior,5,This does not appear to be an issue at our campus.
College Freshman,5,I have not had a internship yet but by what i have heard the internships are very helpful and pay great!
Recent Alumnus,5,i would say this school is very modern and it has a very educated system and the teachers are very knowledgeable! the new mexico highlands is highly recommended!!!!!!!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,"i was very focused, and my teachers are very percipient!"
College Senior,5,The staff is very helpful in all aspects of your education.
College Senior,5,The school is in a great location and it presents a friendly atmosphere.
College Junior,5,"The weather is ALWAYS beautiful here.  We get to enjoy all four seasons throughout the year in northern New Mexico.  During the winter we get about 1'-2' of snow at a time but it melts fast, and during the summer it rarely gets about 85 degrees outside."
College Freshman,5,"This campus has a early waring, if a student is going to fail a class."
College Junior,5,Our campus is well lit and very small so it is safe as far as I can tell
College Sophomore,5,"There are some old facilities, but they are well kept and have a ton of personality because of the age. The whole place is geared for many people of any different interest, and growing. They are working to make the campus bigger and more modern all the time."
College Student,5,The people are so nice here! Everyone waves at each other when driving by and the plaza is really close to the campus so if you want a pizza or just a nice walk you can go at anytime of the day and have no worries. There isn't much to do here however you could go to the hot springs which is really nice. There's always other people there If your social. There's JCs pizza which is really good pizza for a low price. The town really gets into football games and tailgates for some of the really big games
College Student,5,"I love the weather! There's beautiful rain in mid summer to fall, it snows one day and the next it's nice and sunny. And there are lots of warm days in Vegas where you can wear shorts or a thin sweater. Also the day after it snows they have people that go and clean the side walks so that you don't slip and fall from the ice. Good clean up crew!"
College Junior,5,NMHU offers great guidance for success in your college career. My freshman year I joined a learning community for Elementary Education. With the support of other students and teachers in the learning community I was able to stay focused on my degree.
College Junior,5,I feel very safe in the school it is well lit and in a good area
College Junior,5,The NMHU campus in Albuquerque is mostly alternative education so it is a more mature student working in the day who are studying Social Work so it is a more positive atmosphere.
College Senior,5,They just refurbrished the parking lot. It's beautiful.
Sophomore,4,I took some class online has it been an amazing experience utilizing this form of learning open up more valuable experience
Sophomore,4,Nmhu is a good student that has diversity and it allow all student not to feel far from home both international and home students
Senior,4,"NMHU is a good school serving the population of New Mexico as well as students from abroad.
I would like to see a greater effort to support and provide classes that accommodate non-traditional students. If classes were provided with several time slots available it would benefit the nontraditional student. This would enhance the overall experience of college life for this population and allow for greater success in degree completion rates overall. 
Additionally, I would like to see greater diversity in graduate degree area of study options within several programs. Specifically, within the social work program, there is a very limited range of areas of focus. Due to our ever-changing dynamic global realities, it is important that university areas of focus at the graduate level respond appropriately to the clear need for more diverse specialization."
Freshman,4,"Something I like about New Mexico Highlands University is how everyone at the school is very helpful. If you are in need of assistance, they are always willing to help. Something they can improve on would be the food."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my time at New Mexico Highlands. I am a student-athlete and I am very grateful for the approachability and flexibility that the professors have for not just athletes, but for all students. The town of Las Vegas is small, but if you are willing to adventure and look for fun things to do there is no shortage. Improvements can always be made in order to better student life at Highlands, and one aspect that could be improved is the access to food as well as quality in the cafeteria more consistent. The cafeteria will be hit or miss on the day, and I think that being improved will tremendously help student enjoyment at the University."
Senior,4,"My experience with NMHU has been amazing! The professors are outstanding.  The class sizes are small which I love because I have more one to one interaction with the professor. One thing I would like to change would be the communication between departments. To get some things done, its more of a run around because there is barely any communication. Overall, academically, I love attending NMHU."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty at the campus in Farmington NM are very helpful. Working with financial aid has been a little trying as they do not have an office here, you have to contact them in LasVegas NM. Financial Aid cannot help through email or over the phone with some issues.

Summer Keeler EA"
Junior,4,I like my experience with Highlands. I would like to see that they work a little more on the people who aren't at the main campus. The only main person to talk to is at the campus and usually the people for the other districts need to call the campus for help.
Junior,4,"I enjoy my classes and the professors are great. I do however wish the administration, financial aid and human resources departments would be more organized. Being on campus is enjoyable. I do not like having to pay thousands of dollars in tuition and the locals get to enjoy the same student benefits for 2 or 3 dollars."
Graduate Student,4,I have found that New Mexico Highlands University is located in a community of people waiting for the community to be revived. The graduates and future employable men and women have the leadership skills to incrementally revive this city.
Freshman,4,"Welcoming campus with a lot of life in it. Great diversity, with helpful professors. I have not ran into any problems so far"
Junior,4,i love Highlands. a small campus gets your closer with your professors as well as getting to know your faculty. they learn about you ad how to help you! i have learned so much just by knowing my professors.
Graduate Student,4,The tuition is very affordable. I wish there were more programs offered off site. The one thing I do not like is the fact that we are required to take summer classes off campus because they are not offered in the spring or fall off campus.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very understanding about personal issues. If you are having personal problems, and you inform them about it they will cut you some slack on the due dates. But if you don't talk to them they won't help you."
Senior,4,More organized with classes and offer more classes that would deal with outside real world situations.
Graduate Student,4,I have been with NM Highlands University for almost 3 years. I would recommend this school to others. The school of social work is very welcoming and open to diversity.
Alum,4,"Professors care and want you to be successful, the campus is a small little community and most people get along well, There are many things to do around if you are into the outdoors, and the town is nice, but it is small. People care about you!"
Sophomore,4,"New Mexico Highlands University is a great school to come to if you want to meet new people and listen to their views on the world and experience their culture. We attract people from all over the world whether it be from Jamaica, Germany, England, China, or Africa. The professors here are very professional and straight forward, but will always be there for you if you ask for their help. If for some reason you can't get a hold of your professor(s), we have many different places where you can go to find the help you need. The food is catered in the cafeteria by A'viands, but if you don't want to eat the food there, there is always Einstein's Bagels or the local places to eat in town. "
Senior,4,"New Mexico Highlands University is a great school for those living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I love that it offers students the opportunity to get a Bachelors or Graduate degree. Instead of having to drive all the way to Las Vegas, New Mexico, students from all over the state can take classes from their computer or at a Higher Learning Center where teachers are on a TV screen. This is convenient in so many ways. "
College Sophomore,4,Everything about the school is great the quality of courses is good i like the classes that i have taken. they have really help me with future classes to get a further understanding. the class sizes are very small which is great they give me a opportunity to ask more questions to get me a clear understanding
College Sophomore,4,The student safety is very great i understand that we can seek help in many different ways and i love that
College Sophomore,4,i only attend when i can but they are very great
College Sophomore,4,This school is very unique. Teachers are great
Recent Alumnus,4,"The quality of last years Social Worker Spring Fair was very disappointing. Recruitment fair needed at the NMHU-HEC Santa Fe, NM branch for BSW programs and a seperate jop/internship fair for MSW programs."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I do not attend classes on the main campus, however I believe NMHU's most popular sport is football. Go Cowboys!!"
College Junior,4,I lived and worked on campus and loved it!
College Junior,4,I enjoy the professors. They are great people. You get the 101 experience and have open door.
College Junior,4,Everyone is accepting. If they are not they don't get involve.
College Junior,4,I love the small class room settings and how you get the 101 interactions with the professors.
College Junior,4,People are very friendly and everyone is always willing to help one another. I love how many computer labs we have on campus and the fact that they are free printing is amazing.
College Sophomore,4,Meet a lot of new people
College Sophomore,4,Small school but professors help a lot when a student needs it
College Senior,4,The professors really care about you succeeding.
College Senior,4,I feel like Highlands perpared you for whatever your next step is.
College Senior,4,"Greeks on campus are very involved,  a sorrority even won club of the year."
College Senior,4,This school gives you the ability to succeed if you are driven to.
College Senior,4,There needs to be more options as far as programs
College Senior,4,My department was very helpful when it came to locating an internship.
College Junior,4,Overall my experience with my academics has been great. I feel that I have learned a lot from my time at Highlands. I feel that my degree has value and that I have not only learned but have gained valuable experience in being a leader. I know that if I need help with my career I have people and resources I can use because I attended Highlands. My career center has allowed my to further my way into a career by finding internships and conferences that I could attend such as HACU which helps young Hispanic individuals. Overall my education has been lit!
College Junior,4,"Living on campus was fun, you get to make friends and you get to meet a lot of people who attend the school. The dorms are spacious depending on where you live on campus and almost all the dorms are singles so you get your own room. The RAS bug a little but let you do your own thing for the most part. The price was decent and for a room to yourself I think it was great. VCH is the best option it is the newest dorm and has two kitchen you can use and it has a bunch of washers and dryers. I thought it was fun and it is Co-ed which is always a plus."
College Junior,4,The athletics on campus are great. There are a variety of sports that we can attend. The Vatos Rugby team is nationally ranked and there games are very fun to attend.
College Junior,4,"Overall my experience has been great. I have made many connections not only with my professors but with administrators as well. The campus and town are friendly and they are LGBTQ* friendly and like to have events that include everyone. There are places on campus where you can get tutoring for almost every subject, where you can go and do homework, hang out and make friends. There are lots of places on campus where you can get help for anything you may be experiencing."
College Junior,4,financial aid process was a headache.
College Junior,4,"I do not have a lot of input about campus'sports, because all of my classes are done online."
College Junior,4,I really have learned so much from my professors.
College Sophomore,4,"Mostly, NMHU is a great school to move someone into a career relatively early. The career services department tries to assist students in any way possible to find them a career lined up with their major."
College Sophomore,4,The city is relatively small. I feel very safe walking around campus alone.
College Sophomore,4,"I stayed in Melody Hall last year. Though there was an air conditioning problem, I made good friends due to the social atmosphere. Also, staying on campus gives you better opportunities to be involved in campus life."
College Senior,4,I have had a range if instructors.  A very diverse area  the teachers are if all different races and ethnicities
College Senior,4,I love the classes and my classmates. I owe a summer if courses before I can enter masters program.  I enjoy having night classes and I have net many awesome teachers.
College Freshman,4,I haven't experienced any problems
College Freshman,4,"I have had a positive experience here at Highlands.  I'm doing well in classes and have a great support system that includes friends, teachers, and coaches."
College Freshman,4,Alumni are a big part of Highlands
College Freshman,4,The school just got all new wrestling mats and a new custom locker room.  It's the best wrestling room I have ever been in.
College Freshman,4,I have had a great first year.  Classes are easy to get into and teachers care about you.
College Sophomore,4,the class sizes are perfect and professors are very helpful when help is needed.
College Sophomore,4,"due to the fact that my school is small, the class size is small o your professors get to know you by your name and they are very helpful when help is needed. overall the campus is really nice and people are all friendly"
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. Campus security presence is well known you can see campus security almost every where on campus at all times of the day. The one problem I see if very loud people in the dorm parking lots at night that make me feel unsafe as a female walking into my dorm alone after my evening classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,Good education.  Good instructors.  Interesting classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,Interesting classes.  Great instructors.  Good education.
Freshman,2,"I would like the school to help out their students more especially out of states students it seems as if out of state students get no help unless you play a sport.Coming to this school has put me in debt i would have to get two jobs just to cover money issues.This school is poor on income everything is far away, transportation sucks you get no help really. I don like how they allow anyone on campus that is a safety"
Freshman,2,"My experience at New Mexico was not as good thought it will be. For me being a athlete I know the program is rebuilding and it takes time. I like that at New Mexico Highlands that it is party school so you can concentrate on you studies with out it being distraction. I will like to see the athletic program, the campus, and the dorms change at New Mexico Highlands."
College Junior,2,There could be more options.
College Senior,2,Ensuring that students are safe and having rules in places is great. What makes the living experience the absolute worse is that the RA's and RD's treat student like children and are constantly looking for any little reason to charge or write some one up. The dorm living should encourage students to be social and help create a better community in each residence hall.
College Senior,2,There needs to be more options and more involvement.
College Senior,2,"I Honestly have had classmates show up to class drunk or high even for a final. if they want it, they can get it regardless."
College Junior,2,I have had too many bad experiences at this school to even remember the good ones.
College Junior,2,"I have had a bad experience with almost every department on campus. It started with a business office lady telling me that I shouldn't be there because I couldn't afford it, my financial aid hadn't even come in yet.They then stopped sending the statements to my parents house so they couldn't pay. Two weeks after the end of the semester we got a bill for what was left to pay. Then I was withdrawn from the wrong class, and finally my math professor didn't give a damn for half a semester then quit. We got a new teacher who crammed an entire semester into two months, I can't cram before a test, why should I cram an entire semester into two months?"
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process took all summer. Someone in the office lost some of my paperwork so I had to resubmit it. On the first week I met with a financial aid advisor and she kept telling me that I couldn't afford that school and she couldn't seem to get it through her head that my scholarships hadn't come in yet. Talk about RUDE!
College Senior,2,"I have a 4.0 GPA and am 18 credits away from getting my degree yet my college refuses to grant me any type of finical aid,"
College Senior,2,"very small community, no life."
College Senior,2,"My internship was not a great experience, it gave me a sour taste for teaching!"
College Senior,2,"If I could choose a different school, I would, but I am so far into my studies that it is not an option. The faculty is the worst on main campus, very rude, don't return e-mails in a timely manner. I think the instructors are pretty good, very friendly and knowledgeable, but some could retire! I hope to hang in their and finish my master degree and get out fast! Good luck to everyone!"
College Sophomore,2,"New Mexico, you would think it's warm all the time but mostly cold because we are in the northern part. Temperature is usually in the 20's in the winter. Lowest I experienced was -9F."
College Junior,2,"The student population is diverse racially, but politically it's quite conservative."
College Junior,2,Not much diversity; mostly just Mexican food.
Recent Alumnus,2,Small town = bad economy.
College Senior,2,Small town so very limited nightlife. Mostly local bars. 
College Sophomore,2,"Las Vegas, New Mexico is full on criminals especially thefts."
College Sophomore,2,"Call and check on your aid, make sure they have all the paper work they need, if you get audited be ready with your earnings paper. But them main thing is to keep calling financial aid at the school your attending until it comes in and keep an eye on it to make sure they only take what their suppose too."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't go to school on campus so I don't feel like I should say anything about things on main campus, but I do take on-line and ITV classes. I think they need some help in the teacher area. I had a history teacher that didn't do his job and his TA never did give me back my exams and discussions so I don't know how they came up with my grade. I might have done better then what they put down or maybe worse there's no way of knowing without the work. I think the TA got behind on grading the papers and the professor just gave out grades as he saw fit regardless of how a student did."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not enough core classes, no sciences unless you want to go to school on Saturday for 8 hours for one class. The cost is unbelievable. I can go to Luna Community College and take 4 classes for less than what it cost for one class at New Mexico Highlands. Then they have a history teacher that thinks you can write three essay's, multiply choice, and filling in the blank questions in 50 minutes. It could have been interesting if he would have tried. Plus I never did get my exams or discussion assignments back to even know how he came up with my grade."
College Sophomore,2,internet is slow here but it eventually works
College Sophomore,2,Better than the dorms but most houses don't have electricity or wash machines. There is a laundry mat down the road.
College Sophomore,2,Always freezing at night. Even in the early fall and spring its below freezing at night and warm in the day. October-March is cold in the day.
College Sophomore,2,Campus police are not very helpful. They'd rather bust people for a little bit of weed or alcohol rather than catching all the rapists and vandalizers here.
College Senior,2,I have found a problem with the social works program. I have found individuals that are not helpful with the program.
College Freshman,2,The level of professionalism at Highlands University between students and staff can at times be contradictory. The staff asks for students to be professional yet themselves lack the very thing they ask.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of diversity at Highlands. A majority of the students are athletes.
College Junior,2,"Myself personally being involved in Greek life I would recommend others to get involved. We help the community and host events on campus. The only reason I gave NMHU Greek life a ""C"" is because it is really small. For example, there are only a few sororities and fraternities to join and there is no Greek housing."
College Junior,2,"NMHU's campus lacks excitement. Yes, there is clubs to join and games to attend, but the school needs more excitement."
College Freshman,2,Well there is no direct transportation llinked to Highlands other than school event stuff. There are public transportation's but you have to make an appointment.
College Freshman,2,I havent noticed to many fraterniitys or sororities
College Freshman,2,The only thing is to stay on top of it and fill out fasfa asap
College Junior,2,I feel like some of my professors teach well and some I learn nothing from. Some are too strict and some are to easy. I want to be a fitness trainer and love athletics but am worried about when I go out into the real world. Will I know what I am doing?
College Junior,2,There are plenty of places driving distance but not every one has cars. The apartments that are close are older and there are not many.
College Sophomore,2,I Couldn't Find Any – As I was trying to find housing off campus it seemed impossible that is the reason why I'm staying in the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,I would give the campsus dining a C because there are only two places to eat on campus.
College Student,2,"Every school has its groups! Athletes, Nerds, etc."
College Freshman,2,The process for me getting into the ocupational therapy major is very difficult. They do not offer the program but its the only school I can afford to attend. It would be nice if there was more medical field majors. Admission is through GPA if your good on grades then your good on becoming what you always wanted to be.
Senior,1,"Attending this school has been the worst experience of my life. If you are thinking about doing any distance learning DO NOT DO IT. SAVE YOURSELF. Learning via ZOOM may work for some but for the most part, it requires a lot more work from students with very little support from admin. I can't speak to taking classes on a campus but the distance learning option is not a great one. Find a different university that actually cares about their student's success and supports there goals rather than breaks their souls."
Junior,1,"I thought there was so much wrong with this school from the very beginning. From the way I was treated in the business office on my very first day, to the teacher who refused to help me then drop me from his class even though it was very clear I was struggling."
Graduate Student,1,"Most teachers do their best to provide a solid education amidst the troubling incompetence of the administration (except maybe that drunk professor in the Albuquerque social work program). For example, they still have academic calendars from two years ago on the website because IT is just as lazy as the rest of them. Yes, it is a cheap school, and the saying that you get what you pay for is definitely true here. If you just want a piece of paper, and you can handle the constant aggravation of dealing with the ignorance of the staff and administration, and you do not mind the animal and human abuse in the hellhole of Las Vegas, NM, this is the school for you. If you are not Hispanic, be prepared for the intense/dangerous ethnic prejudice of teachers, staff, and locals. If you want an education, competent efficient staff, and an inspiring social scene, go to a real school. This place is a joke."
College Sophomore,1,I really dont get involved with things but i would like to join in some way i can
Recent Alumnus,1,NMHU does not have Greek Life activities.
College Junior,1,"Its horrible, the RA's are the absolute worst and love the fact that they have 'power'."
College Sophomore,1,"Had some good friends, met some of the worst people in my life here also. I have no respect for the dean or faculty. Nobody knows what they are doing. You can get away with a lot here and also get in trouble for things you didn't even do. Unfair accusations and consequences. People from the town are really sketchy. One word that descirbes this school best: TRASHY"
College Sophomore,1,The WIFI is really slow or sometimes non-existent especially in the dorms. ITS information technology service (computer tech crew) cannot catch criminals at all. You need a fast network if you expect students to get work done!
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly one story houses and shacks. Almost all houses are cheap. Many people don't have utilities and there are laundry mats for a reason, most houses don't have laundry machines. It's just such a poor area I can't even believe there is a college in a town like this."
College Sophomore,1,"If you're a girl and you get caught smoking weed or drinking in the dorms, they might let you go only if you snitch someone out. Guys almost always don't have a chance. If you make friends with the cops maybe it will be easier. I've been called a skank by a cocky police there. I heard if you're a campus security they will let you drink in the dorms or drink with you which is totally not fair. They can do whatever they want and stake on around campus to purposely try to hunt down students doing anything wrong like even peeing outside. It's getting ridiculous. My friends have also been harassed by them. The RAs are annoying and always give you room checks and depending on which one, they make people leave at 11."
College Sophomore,1,"There are like 3 bars in the town. No clubs, you have to drive 2 hours for that. The most ratchet parties. Poor people drunk on the streets at night, gangsters and mental patients so don't walk home drunk."
College Sophomore,1,Food serving size is small. Little to no vegetarian options on a daily basis. Lot's of grease. Disgusting people work there that don't wash their hands and drop food on the floor but use it anyway.
College Sophomore,1,"The school has nothing else to offer but the football team which sucked this year!!! The most disgusting individuals with assault, drug, rape, and even gang murder charges are recruited. They vandalize everything and rape the students. One guy got away with throwing a chair at a campus police because he was one of the best football players. It really isn't fair that the dean of students would let this happen but punish other students for exposing the school for its wrong doings in other ways. People in the student counsel have tried to get the dean fired, in return he got kicked out of the student counsel and didn't attend the school the next year. He doesn't care about the sexual assault that goes on from recruiting many uneducated gangsters just because they are good at playing sports!!"
College Sophomore,1,"You really just don't even have to try at this school. Community colleges are much easier than this ""University."" They seriously need to be investigated."
College Sophomore,1,"I would never come here again. I've met nice people and had lots of fun but the school should not be labeled an actually college institution and should not be accredited because of how easy it is to slack off but still get a good grade while learning absolutely nothing!! I can't copy and paste links here but search for a news article that says ""Teachers who graduated from NMHU have students with lower tests scores."" I took a 3 credits independent study and got an A when I didn't do anything because the teacher didn't make me do anything even when I kept asking. That was easy for me but even more unprofessional than things high school teachers do."
College Sophomore,1,"Look on the NMHU confessions twitter, the facebook page was so bad it repeatedly got taken down. Look at other student reviews, instagram photos tagged #NMHU and trust me you will find little things about how the students act. People say it is a bunch of children in grow up bodies. Probably because it's a 100% acceptance rate and it's a cheap tuition so you get cheap people."
College Sophomore,1,There are no taxis in the entire town. You have to walk everywhere if you don't have a car. Maybe campus police will give you a ride across campus if you really need one.
College Sophomore,1,"They tried to say I didn't pay and the same thing happened to a few people I know. I believe the school tries to steal some money from students and if they notice, they fix it and pretend like it never happened."
College Sophomore,1,The vandalized safety buttons don't help much. People get harassed and sexually assaulted all the time on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"*Unprofessional faculty who do things like give a student the entire set of keys to a building and all the rooms in it.

*Unreasonable dean who cares more about the school's reputation than the student's safety. He also covers up crime statistics.

*Campus police who harass you (been called a skank by one) and try to make you their snitches by putting you in dangerous situations. I believe our rights at this school can be easily violated.

*Mental patients who walk into the dorms and threaten the safety of the students

*A football team full of guys with assault, rape and even one gang murder charge. Look it up for yourself!

*Prejudice against white people in the town because it is mostly Mexicans

*Lots of gangsters in the town, lots of poverty

*No Greek life

*Poor engineering in the new student center. It may look nice but it the floor moves under your feet and it is built cheaply. Things break all the time.

*School steals money from students without them noticing because they have a low budget for everything.

I could go on forever...."
College Freshman,1,you need your own car to get around because everything is so far
College Junior,1,There is no night life.
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't think we have any.
College Sophomore,1,You need to have your own car to get around.
College Sophomore,1,Cars get vandalized or broken into all the time because nobody watches the cameras and some campus police even say they don't work.
College Sophomore,1,The football team is really bad this year and they have a bad reputation because they all come from inner cities or poor areas and have criminal records.
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly Mexican food, not much of a variety unless you want to buy healthy vegetables and cook them yourself."
College Sophomore,1,"Annoying, campus police harass you."
College Sophomore,1,Not many clothing stores and everything closes super early
College Sophomore,1,Most cameras don't work or can't be replayed. Hardly any criminals get caught. The dean covers up most of the incidences and fails to report them to the cleary act.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police and security do it too! If they catch you, you'll go to court while they sit there and smoke your weed :D"
College Sophomore,1,Lousy professors that remind me of high school teachers.
College Sophomore,1,Math programs like ARMAS suck. Nobody knows what they're doing.
College Sophomore,1,"Boring town with a bunch of trashy and weird people. Ratchet parties, lots of sluts, lots of gangsters, sex soliciting on campus, and LOTS of rape!"
College Sophomore,1,Clubs are 2 hours away in Albuquerque. Sketchy bars in town. Don't walk home alone.
College Sophomore,1,Fake grass with vomit on it from drunken party people. No flowers or gardens. Vandalized lights and other property.
College Senior,1,"I have had the worst experiences with my financial aid office, due to a failing grade they denied me financial assistance and i have been paying for school myself. My school is very political if your a football player and failed all or one of your classes they grant you financial assistance because of politics but a single mother like myself doesn't have the same equal opportunities. Its not what you know its who you know!!!"
College Junior,1,There are no night clubs in the area the closest is two hours away exception is Dick's but students rarely go because almost always townies and older people attend.
College Junior,1,Professors lack organization in courses often are basis because of students background. This is known because professors normally judge students based on their color as well where their parents come from. It's the most popular question professors ask students. They also lack confidence in students all shows in body language and their speech.
College Sophomore,1,"I was a returning student after 4+ years, and the staff didn't take me very seriously. It took several weeks to know if I was awarded financial aid. You must call everyday to find out if you have been awarded or not, the staff will rarely contact you. If you had a job within the past year, it is nearly impossible to receive financial aid. The staff in financial aid weren't very helpful, but when it came to applying for a loan, I had more help than I could handle."

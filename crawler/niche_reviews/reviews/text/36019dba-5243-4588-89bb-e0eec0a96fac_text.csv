Junior,5,"Taking classes online a Texas Southern was interesting, I had to make the transition due to COVID-19. Over the online platform, the classes did get a bit overwhelming, there was a big difference from being in the lecture hall and there were also professors that increased the work load to insure that all students were participating,."
Senior,5,"online is pretty awesome, you have direct contact with the Dean of students as well as your advisors, they answer back relatively fast."
Sophomore,5,Texas Southern University is by far one of the best colleges to go to especially if you would want to attend an HBCU(Historically Black College University). I am currently majoring in Athletic training and this school also offers a really good program that is mainly focused on the aspect and hands-on knowledge about athletic training.

Senior,5,"My experience with attending Texas Southern University has been a great one, I've joined three on-campus organizations that all work in unison to push my education further and help me obtain my goal on going to medical school."
Senior,5,Since Covid-19 the online experience was shaky and new. The new way of learning experience was highly adjustable and gave rise to better use of time management skills.
Senior,5,"Online classes started when Covid-19 began to spread. Although it wasn't for long, my professors were understanding and patient with the online transition. They were constantly on standby to answer and be of help to all questions. They were also concerned about about our health and well-being, while also making sure all material was learned."
Senior,5,"What I love most about Texas Southern University is that everyone is always open and welcoming. The staff and students want you to succeed no matter how challenging the task may be. There is constant support and motivation, along with numerous organizations to join. I've been a student for the past 4 years and my school helped build my confidence, pushed me beyond my comfort zone while also letting me know I'm not alone and I can do anything I want in this world. It shows me there aren't any limits to my dreams because there's nothing I can't do. I have developed mentorships that has helped me reach beyond my school. If I had a chance to change where I went to school, I wouldn't."

Freshman,5,"My school is  amazing by giving us the education we need to become excellent. Texas Southern opens my eyes to the real world, showing me why it’s important to know how to communicate with others whom are not in the same culture, religion or language as me. If you get a chance to go on this great opportunity us it, because it will open many doors in your life."

Everyone at Texas Southern University is very welcoming , and friendly. The campus is very divers, and everyone is full of life. I was always told that Professors don't take time to learn names. Well, my Professors are very helpful, and understanding they take their time to learn each and everyone of us. The staff throughout the campus are very direct and always available at assisting us. Another thing I strongly admire about Texas Southern University is the campus life. You'd think it'll be very complicated to make friends at college, well I disagree. I've meet so many students that we don't even know each others names, but we speak every time we see one another. That's what you call a friendly environment, where nobody feels left out. One thing I believe my college should improve on is communication. As students we should always be alert on whats going."
Alum,5,My experience was invaluable! I was challenged and fully ready for my career! The professors are completely invested and truly care for their students.

Sophomore,5,I love that the teachers want their students to be successful. I love the Ocean of Soul Band and all the music teachers.
Junior,5,"My experience with Texas Southern University has been a long one and i have to say that i would do it over and start from this university and finish with it. I decided when i graduated high school that i wanted to go there, but I ended up going to a different university instead, that was a  big mistake on my part, but i am glad i am back. The classes there are small and i like that about it, it helps the professors get to know their students and interact well with the classes. The change I would like to see is the cost of textbooks go down and parking options should be more cheaper than what they are as well."
Sophomore,5,I would like to see more food options at my school! We are a very diverse school and I appreciate that as a whole the school is very inclusive in everything. They don't discriminate and they're very inviting. The overall environment and atmosphere is friendly. Professors are super kind and willing to help all students who show interest. The Social atmosphere is great too. Almost all students are approachable and friendly. The courses aren't that difficult but they are not easy either. As long as you put in the effort you are most likely to get a A in the course.

Freshman,5,"Honestly this university is a solid place to attend and offers many opportunities for the future. Y’all already know Houston’s party scene wild and the student life is great. We recently just had the Democratic Debate take place at our school and received great hospitality reviews as far as safety. Most of the classes are generally 15-40 people included with free tutoring and reliable teachers. However if you are coming out of state be prepared for a big price especially without Financial aid. Our school is very diverse and kept clean by staff/students. Although it’s in the third ward( honestly just use common sense/street smarts like you would in any other big city), we are located pretty close to the University of Houston and Downtown so if you ever feel bored just staying on campus(doubtful) you’ll have somewhere to go using the metro, which is free for TSU students, or your own transportation."
Junior,5,This is my third year at Texas Southern University and my experience has been great so far. The professors are every helpful and knowledgeable. All the faculty wants to see you succeed in life!
Freshman,5,Texas southern is a wonderful college they welcomed me in with open arms with no problem .

Alum,5,Very cultured and the university itself is historic. You will learn how to maneuver  around the campus on your own and it will prepare you for the real world due to    you actually continuing on your education once you leave the classroom.  A lot of activities one can join and the people you meet will be lifetime friends.

It truly is the heart and soul of Texas. Each event I have attended at Texas Southern University have always been fun and entertaining and I’m so happy that I decided to attend this school for college. However just like many other schools it does have minor problems college isn’t going to always just be a smooth ride especially when your dealing with finical issues with school."

Niche User,4,"This will be my second time attending TSU, I had to leave the first time due to my mother's illness.  This time around I am highly motivated and mentally prepared to go the distance.

I love TSU and look forward to being a scholar alum.  #GoTIGERS!!!"

Graduate Student,4,A good University with some improvements being made.  The new president is working to improve the overall reputation of the school
Freshman,4,My experience was ok. I would like to see more scholarships for students and help where students who parents do't really make the amount of money that FASA says they do.
Freshman,4,So far I really like the school hopefully as I finish my freshman year and continue with school I grow to love the school even more.
Alum,4,Going to a HBCU was a change for me. I grew up going to a private school where I was a minority but going to TSU I finally was part of a majority and saw people who looked like me. The things I wanted to change my undergrad is now happening under the new President of the university. I am proud of being a graduate and wouldn't change my experience.
Sophomore,4,"Allowing more opportunities for students to get access to resources for scholarships. However, it's a great campus. It wouldn't hurt to make parking better."

Freshman,4,"I like that there are professors there who actually look out for their students as if that's one of their own children.

Freshman,4,Texas Southern is apsuch an awesome school. Everything about the school is so much fun and it’s such a family atmosphere. The campus is very nice. Although it is awesome something that can change is the organization and helping the kids with there business.
Niche User,4,I  would like to change the parking garage.  It look unsafe and anyone can walk unto campus without question.
Freshman,4,"I really like Texas Southern University , I will be attending in the fall. Even though TSU is a great school, I feel somethings they could work on. Such as, being  more  available when students need help. Also, returning calls or emails when students have important questions especially with wanting help with scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"Texas Southern University is a campus with joy, fun and people willing to help you. I am now a sophomore in college and my freshman year was not as bad as I thought. I met new people from different states  and country’s and that was the best thing about it. I learned how people are different in their own way to how they dress to how they talk and that’s how everyone is different. If I didn’t attend college I would not be able to experience certain things, and everyone should experience new things. The diversity of people is out of this world, different cultures and religions and having events for certain things. I am glad to attend Texans southern because being a African American myself I can see how things are different with professors and the students."
Sophomore,4,Texas Southern is an Overall good school. I like how the professors are engaged with the class and care if their students pass or fail.

Senior,4,"I just finished my second year at Texas Southern University and I can truly say, I love my HBCU (Historical Black College University). As a top student in the school of communication, I have a 3.73 GPA, I’ve created the first sports show on campus, became a co-host of the only sports radio show, and a sports reporter for the campuses newspaper. And none of my success would have possible without the loving facility and family here at Texas Southern University. I can truly say, it is a family atmosphere at Texas Southern University, the classes are not out of control, the professors and staff care about your education and future, and the on-campus experience is fun. The things I would change about Texas Southern University are the housing, the attendance at football, baseball/softball, and soccer games, and to update the building around campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love Texas Southern University. If you are black I highly recommend attending this school because it is a safe haven for us. Almost all the different schools within the campus are very solid and the networking opportunities are immense. Take your time when trying to get through your classes and be sure to balance your life out. Time management is important because just like any school distractions are every where. Be sure to have fun and enjoy yourself but don't forget you are here for a purpose. If you need financial aid be prepared a lot of the people running the financial aid office can be unfriendly but remember don't become frustrated as they do have control of your money. Getting across campus isn't very hard as their are many options to getting around without always having to walk. The school is very solid but should change just a couple of things. Have friendlier staff, make sure students are always in the loop with what's going on, and keep students safer."
Sophomore,4,Overall so far my experience has been good academic and extracurricular wise. The only thing I would say I had a problem with in the beginning is getting everything squared away with my financial aid.
Freshman,4,I can't wait to attend in the falll!My family have attended T.S.U it's my family alumni college.Im so very excited to be attending the university.Going but to school now I feel it's never to late.I visited the campus I felt right at help.Everybody was so friendly and warm.The campus is so clean I was impressed.
Junior,4,"A few things I like about Texans southern is the student life and the professors. The student life is impeccable: from the way everyone is welcoming you with open arms and allowing you room to grow. The professors I have come across have helped me by actually caring about what they are teaching. Some of those professors will take time out of there day to even assist my personal needs as far as achieving academia. I believe that Texas southern has helped mold me into the adult I am becoming. It has helped me to take responsibility for my actions, communicate my needs and selflessly help others."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Texas Southern has been great! The students are pretty friendly (when they're not on their phone) and the professors are great, and the administrators are very helpful and treat you like family. When I was first trying to get enrolled, there were bumps in the road. However, they pulled some strings together and got me through the door.

On the other hand, the school pride isn't the same that it once was back around 2012-16. Not everyone attends the games or campus functions, but will attend all the parties that aren't school affiliated."
Senior,4,I LOVE MY HBCU!!! I will say do thing early and don’t wait to submit anything and need it done fast!
Freshman,4,Texas Southern University is an awesome school. The professors are always willing to help students as long as the student have valid reasons for missing assignments or if you attend class everyday but you are just not getting it on your own.
Freshman,4,I personally appreciate the aspect of coming together that Texas southern University always pushes towards as for any HBCU
Freshman,4,I liked the atmosphere and the community as a whole. Engaging with previous students and being introduced to the students helped with getting to know the school better!
Sophomore,4,TSU is a very good institution.  The instructor are always there dor support and guidance.  The alumni support is a big thing on campus
Junior,4,"I like the environment. The campus is very calm and not wild or crowded . Classes are not to where you won’t have a seat . Some professors are understanding and will help youWhat needs to change is the financial aid process and housing. The financial aid process can cause you to either stress over how you will pay for school and take forever to receive a refund . The housing needs to be upgraded a little and the visitation rules need to be a little less strict . Also, there needs to be visitors parking when visiting the dorms without cars being towed."
Sophomore,4,"There is always room for improvement everywhere.  Overall it is a great University.  The professors are really concerned about the students.  They really are there to reach out and  actually help support the students in any way duly possible.  It is always a good thing to stay in close contact with your professors.  If  at all possible, establish a relationship with your professors, not to where it makes them uncomfortable.  I'm a band member, and I was a band member for 6 years prior to attending college; I am so glad to be pursuing my quest in staying with the band, because I already have had great experiences while traveling with the band."
Freshman,4,Feels good to know that you’re not just a number or another statistic you’re taken care of and given the resources needed
Sophomore,4,"Although TSU is originally a historically- black college, it has a good job on diversity. There are Asians, Latinos, and whites; they are in the minority. TSU has excellent pharmacy and law schools, as well as a honors college."
Senior,4,I like the surroundings. The financial aid office it terrible. You can never get anything accomplished over the phone. Culture is pretty diverse. Classes are ok.
Junior,4,What I liked about Texas Southern university is that the administration and professors trench you as family they will speak to you by name and also will make you feel at home and special
Junior,4,Yes I love Texas Southern University but we need to change the communications effectiveness. Also we need to get new Professor for the accounting Department of school
Junior,4,TSU is very good friendly school. Ever since I've been there I have enjoyed it very nice campus and big as well the only thing that I am not a bog fan on is the walking.
Freshman,4,"I am a student who attends Texas Southern University.  I just finished my first year of college and i enjoyed it.  I made a lot of new friends, and made connections with several different people.  I did a lot of networking and went to several different career fairs to get my name out there, also to meet different people who are in my desired profession.  I took six classes in each semester.  The core classes i took were a bit challenging, but the elective classes were pretty easy.  The campus life is decent, there are a lot of friendly people you will meet.  My experience in my first year at Texas Southern was pretty good.  I am looking forward to three more years here."
Niche User,4,"I love how much of a family everyone is. It's not like my high school where I looked around and there was no one that looked like me, and that I had no kind of representation. I love this school."
Sophomore,4,"It is a good school very good alternative to UH. The teachers are excellent. They are focused on preparing you for the real world even some core classes I felt that I learned so much. The food is great, there is a begal shop and chick fila to eat. I love the gym it is the place I enjoy going to the most. The facilities are nice and they have lots of equipment."
Freshman,4,The faculty cares about your education and will help you to complete your education. They value what you learn and what they teach improving the type of education that you receive .
Senior,2,Texas Southern is the 2nd largest Historically Black College in the country and I have had to fight and claw my way to maintain my status as a student and it is extremely disheartening to know that even at institutions that are meant to serve the Black community Black students will still be treated with disrespect.
Senior,2,The first 2 years was amazing but after that it seems the majority of the professors stop caring about you.
Senior,2,I honestly recommend just going somewhere else. Save yourself some time and some money. They don't care about you here only about the green.
Sophomore,2,"Online experience was not so great, contact with teachers was difficult due to them not responding to emails. given large workloads with short deadlines."
Niche User,2,My experience was not the best. People's cars were getting broke into. honestly believe that they should get more security. However over all I had an amazing experience.
Senior,2,"Texas Southern is located in the heart of Houston, which is excellent when it comes to taking a break from campus life. Having entertainment, food, and shopping nearby it a plus. Campus life is pretty good there are a lot of things to do or to get involved in."
Alum,2,"VERY unprofessional faculty and staff. I put up with it while I was a student because I wanted to support my HBCU and help change the stigma around it, but now that i have graduated...I can't believe how rude and unprofessional the staff is. TSU can be a really great school but there needs to be a major attitude adjustment university wide."
Graduate Student,2,I enjoyed the lab where I worked and the people there but there were many unnecessary fights between myself and administration. Many of the chairs and deans of TSU don't care about student success and may actively sabotage troublemakers that ask too many questions.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel like that people that work for the school are just there for the check not to help.
College Sophomore,2,The housing options are not that adequate!
College Freshman,2,"The athletics at my school are good. The students are always asked to get  involved in the sporting events at  school. There is somewhat of school spirit but some people don't have any. The athletic facilities are ok, but to a average student their nothing."
College Freshman,2,most of the Greek organizations on campus are suspended
College Junior,2,Last semester we had 3 on campus shootings.
College Freshman,2,There is a bug infestation in my apartment building. I'm still dealing with them after one semester living there.
College Sophomore,2,Don't communicate that much always give me problems about turned in work
College Sophomore,2,Too many people getting shot and killed
College Sophomore,2,"I wouldn't choose my school again it's just to much violence,shooting,fighting and etc."
College Freshman,2,I love my school I just feel that our safety is very lacked. We've had 3 shooting at my school one need in death
College Junior,2,We don't really have Greek life
College Senior,2,"The school is very unorganized, and some of the staff are very rude and not knowledgeable of what is going is. There is a strong sense of mis-communication throughout the admissions department."
College Senior,2,"TSU's education department is in desperate need of restaffing and redeveloping the entire program, along with new staff."
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion the dorms are just awful. There is little to no space, the cleanliness is not up to par and there is no privacy."
College Senior,2,The school is pretty relaxed on policies
College Sophomore,2,I don't even know who my R.A. is.
College Sophomore,2,They didn't follow through with aid money
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough options.
College Sophomore,2,"On campus housing is not the best. It's constantly filthy, not to mention that there's always an unpleasant aroma. All you see is trash in the elevators, hallways, and outside of the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,The school does have a Women's Center and Clinic on campus but they're not well known for their support they give students.
College Sophomore,2,There are quite a few of fast food restaurants around campus but none that are really worth going to.
College Sophomore,2,"The school tries to get more students interested in the football and basketball games, however, they're not popular."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not sure how life is outside of campus, however the school is located by several ""projects""."
College Sophomore,2,Dealing with financial aid can be a trial at times. There are thousands of students that are trying to get assistance so it makes sense why there's always a problem.
College Sophomore,2,"I strongly dislike the atmosphere of this school. This school pays too much attention to the parties then the students or academic performances. However, there is this great Bible Study on campus called Life Change Bible Study that teaches the True Word of God."
College Freshman,2,"It is very difficult to get financial aid. After applying for both fellowship and financial aid, I could only get an unsubsidized student loan. I could not afford to take another student loan, when I just finished paying off my undergraduate student loan."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't even want to talk about housing but just a general run down- it sucks. the amount you pay to live on campus is the same amount for a one bedroom apartment where you don't have to share a bedroom or a place with a roommate. it's a joke how you have only two dorms on ONE side of the campus and how much you charge for that death trap there(floods, roaches, mice, mold) just gross. It's literally like prison. 

the other ""on campus-off campus"" apartments are a joke too don't bother. 

The campus can be aesthetically pleasing but once you go inside you'll see why they pay so much attention to the outside maintenance because they can't fix what's inside"
College Sophomore,2,Strictness on almost all of these things are a joke!!! they just want your money so they will keep you here no matter what you do and don't do.
College Sophomore,2,"average...fried chicken, fried fish, fried everything...salad bar is gross!! they don't wash the bowls between mixing often in salad bar and Asian food bar, pizzas mediocre, burgers thin and thick buns, patty melts are really good!! sometimes they surprise us and have funnel cakes, crawfish, etc."
College Sophomore,2,campus in a bad community wish it was gated
College Sophomore,2,freshman have to get 14 meal plan and there is no plan without dinning points
College Sophomore,2,alot of staff is rude and alot of our facilities are old
College Junior,2,Its the same kinds of food everyday. The main course is like high School caf food.
College Senior,2,I don't know about scholarships at my school. No one reaches out to inform you about them.
College Freshman,2,The food is often overcooked or under-cooked depending on the time of day. Breakfast is probably the best time.
College Freshman,2,I could say I rarely see the police and there's always reports of theft around campus.
College Freshman,2,"I received my financial aid, but I did not get enough of what I really needed. I am still attempting to get more grants for school, because I do not want to be in debt with the government. The process took too much to get to normal. There were issues about my financial aid not going through for about three to four months. I had to finally go up to the office in person just to get my aid re-started."
College Senior,2,"On campus eating sucks. There is not many real restaurants, there is many fried foods and sandwiches, no vegetable or anything.  "
College Junior,2,We have close fast food options that are not healthy. The only restaurants are soul food and wing stop which lead to high blood pressure and diabetes.  
College Sophomore,2,the further you move away from school is the less focus you will have.
College Senior,2,"Lets say about one third of students go to class high off of something drugs on campus is an ordinary thing, the alcohol dosent show its self until people are ready to party."
College Senior,2,"BRING YOUR OWN LAPTOP. The computer labs on campus aren't reliable, some days the computers work some days they do not same for the printers. Also some computer labs require you to bring your own paper. there is wireless internet access but it doesn't always work and some times it is very slow."
College Senior,2,"Cliquey, geeks given fame. They don't do much for the community all they really are good for is partying. the Divine 9 run the yard but they aren't much of a good example."
College Senior,2,"student life on campus is not the best. A lot of the buildings need to be torn down and rebuilt. The administration knows that the school is in need of lots of renovations, they are working on it but not fast enough. The REC is very small. The student center is ok. The library needs to be torn down and rebuilt, the computers don't work majority of the time and the building is very old, if you want to go study on campus I suggest the law library but it is very small but it is in much better shape. The activities on campus has gone down since the last four years"
College Senior,2,"The Rec center is horrible, the school has horrible training and practicing facilities for the athletes the only thing that is nice is out actual stadium which is off campus and which is shared with the Houston dynamos at the BBVA stadium."
College Senior,2,there is a lot of fast food places but nothing healthy to eat.
College Freshman,2,"If I could redo my application process all over I would deffiantly
 go some where where there is more school spirit."
College Freshman,2,For the most part my school is improving slowly with its campus.
College Junior,2,"The campus sits outside of downtown Houston in a urban neighborhood with not many options for dining.  There is dining on campus for $8 per meal, which to a college student is not price comparable.  There is also other eateries such as deli's, snack shops, and two major chain fast food places."
College Junior,2,Some buildings are better than others but overall they are pretty decent.  Some can use renovation
College Freshman,2,The apartments are great but the crime in the area is something the city should crack down on.
College Sophomore,2,"Although there are a few bus stops around the campus, the buses are unreliable and almost always late. Cab services are pretty reliable though. If you can help it, definitely get a car as most points of interest are about 10-20 minutes away from campus."
Freshman,1,"I went there in the fall of 1998.Worst experience ever. I received death threats because I was a minority and the dorms were terrible. Dorms flooded lots of times and some teachers were sketchy and not available to assist with assignments after classes. The staff was very unorganized and seem to never have paperwork right. I could have dealt with that but the threats were my last straw. Hopefully, it has become more diverse now."
Senior,1,I hate it. Everyday is a struggle especially if you’re a medical major. Online school just doesn’t work.
Senior,1,My experience at TSU has been a challenge. HBCU’s were never my goal but due to my very limited option major I had to attend. Once attending it’s been a rat race of finding information and a big game of telephone. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone who ask me about if they should attend. They don’t have food on campus or even a Starbucks but constantly in the news for “higher ups” stealing money. Im not having a good time for all this money they are asking for each semester.
Senior,1,I was only made to do online work as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and it was a horrible experience I hope class is not online in the fall.
Senior,1,"i never been to TSU but from what ive seen its looks amazing. I love their dance team, their athletics teams in general."
Alum,1,"I attended TSU from 2006-2009 and my experience was not the best. During my junior year, the school lost its accreditation and we were told we could transfer or stick it out. That was very stressful and unprofessional. Since I was already a Junior, I decided to stick it out and the school received their accreditation back my senior year."
Senior,1,It is inexpensive and that's what is great a value. There a few great profesessors who care. Majority are there for the money.
Sophomore,1,"This University is very pricey and they are quick to take your money for everything. I pay for parking in the parking garage every semester and I had my truck broken into and Texas Southern University police did not do nothing about. My mom called up to University the say day it happened and they tried to act like they did not know about it even though I reported it and they had her on hold all day. Also, whenever you are trying to register to get into the college, they will give you the run away and give you a hard time."
Sophomore,1,"Rough experience, the professors were rude and did not care about the students and resources were not easy to access on campus."
Freshman,1,"Do not come here. This is an awful school and a waste of money. The graduation rate is so low because the majority of the kids that go here are ill-prepared and dropout, everybody else here that is college ready wants better and transfers. I only lasted one semester. Even the newest dorms are broken down and raggedy, the dinning is disgusting and something is always broken. The school up keep is bad and there is no professionalism not to mention school spirit. You are better than this! please do not make the same mistake and waste your money and time at this university you will regret it. The professors are average but not worth it due to the admin and housing. Do not come here, this school is not good for anything. NOBODY will take you seriously with a degree from Texas Southern - maybe some employers in Houston. However, the world is much bigger than Houston. Do not ignore the facts you see about this institution, it is a ratchet, raggedy mess."
Senior,1,"Tsu is an okay school but they are late on everything, no organization at all. They tell you things last minute. Some of the teachers are rude & could careless about the students when they are supposed to be there to help us.  The area is unsafe you could get robbed. They are too strick in housing which makes you not want to live on campus and experience campus living they say it's for safety but we are adults and we do pay to live there we should be able to have visitors without the hassle."
Recent Alumnus,1,We have the worst on campus housing. They are all so trashy and horrible. Everything is so out dated and its always loud and trashy.Except the new housing they just recently built. Every school year its always so hard trying to get housing. Next year i wish things would change and everything would be updated and cleaned because housing is so nasty and unsanitary.
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing ever gets fixed, moving in things were all broken, with holes in the wall, broken doors, dirty. has roaches and ants"
College Freshman,1,Considering that I stay in the all girls dorms its the worst as far as the on campus apartments their much more better
College Sophomore,1,"I honestly do not like living on campus. The dorms are absolutely disgusting and it's a complete rip off to be paying so much money a semester and end up living in trash. If I could live off campus I would but I can't. The apartments are somewhat better but the dorms are the complete worse and the RAs aren't any better. They need to rebuild the dorms and make new ones because it's rats and bugs all over the place. The rats crawl in the walls and you can hear them, and there is mold everywhere. I would not recommend living in the dorms."
College Senior,1,"Well, I play football for Texas Southern University. We are not support at all by the students or fan. Visiting schools have more fans attending the game than we do."
College Student,1,I don't think I receive enough financial assistance.
College Sophomore,1,"I hate dealing with financial aid. You receive the ""runaround"" and are purged from courses with no knowledge. They send an email, and hopefully its to the updated email address or else...oops to bad you've  been dropped from courses."
College Freshman,1,I'd prefer not to interact with the men and women on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is usually of the same race, economic background, political beliefs, and or religion."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't believe the school has a ""Greek Life"". However, if it does, I was unaware of it."
College Sophomore,1,"I strongly dislike the ""honor code"" the school uses. They're very lenient with just about anything."
College Sophomore,1,"I never hear anything about sexual assaults on campus and never really thought about it until now but I know it must happen...there's no programs, advertisements for it nothing."
College Sophomore,1,choosing an apartment out here for your money's worth is very difficult!! especially if you want to live in a good neighborhood somewhat close to the campus
College Senior,1,"Its horrible they don't care in the Financial Aid Department, they are very lazy and irresponsible. When it comes to refunds not ask when you are going to get one, you get it when they are good and ready to give one."
College Freshman,1,The campus shuttle runs whenever it wants to its not really a dependable transportation route.
College Freshman,1,Whenever it rains it really sucks on campus because then you are forced to walk outside because our buildings are not connected to one another.
College Freshman,1,I received no financial aid help from the school besides loans that I did not accept. Texas Southern's overall review on financial aid sucks the people that work in the office are not very helpful they act as if they don't know anything and do not want to help you find out anything about financial assistance.
College Freshman,1,Athletics at Texas Southern University aren't really big around the campus. Most of the home games are usually very empty from our students
College Freshman,1,always hot humid and gross outside...I turned 3 shades darker since I started here. Invest in rain essentials. it's always raining.
College Senior,1,worst food ever and horrible service. we need better food options.
College Student,1,There is not many off campus housing available for student close to campus. If you were to get an apartment/house off campus you would really need reliable transportation such as a car. I advise students to stay on campus because you want have many responsibilities like bills etc.you can just keep focus on school.
College Sophomore,1,The police force can be any pretty strict about underage drinking and driving
College Senior,1,"Security is ok if you stay in the dorms, but the campus apartment it can be scary if you were to walk around late in the afternoons or at night.  If there is a problem or something serious to happen the campus police are slow to respond."
College Junior,1,Parking is limited the space used is not large enough to accomodate everyone  and it is very tight
College Junior,1,I've been trying for 2 years to get scholarships and the application process seems complicated to me.. They tell you apps open in january but when you go to the site it is not avail.  Then all of a sudden its closed.  I argue it was never there.   I find it impossible to get any help and I have a 4.0 gpa
College Freshman,1,The cafeteria meal plan is expensive and not good. The big down side with that is that once you sign up for the meal plan (like most freshman would) you can't cancel it.
College Junior,1,THE DORMS IS OK BUT BUT SOME OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE . AND YOU PAY ALL THAT MONEY AND DONT GET TREATED LIKE YOU SHOULD .
College Senior,1,"I have been at TSU for 3 months and already regret my decision so very much. This school is UNORGANIZED AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Most of the staff and admin are rude, arrogant and don't care to solve any problems, which are many. Teachers constantly cancel class, online Blackboard always has issues and teachers rely on Blackboard even if the class is not an online or hybrid class...and despite knowing there are major technological issues with Blackboard. This affects students grades and the deans do nothing to help. I have had transcripts lost, scholarship money vanish, financial aid messed up again and again, classes cancelled REGULARLY where my gas was wasted driving to school that day (and tuition not refunded for those days), and so much more. I came from HCC, with my Asscociates in hand yet the seniors I sit in class with have no idea how to speak or write college level, 85% of students in ALL of my classes CHEAT on tests and the teachers are aware, yet they are all earning degrees while hard-working students like myself struggle because of the choice to earn the degree properly. ""Properly"" doesn't work at this University because of the laziness of the teachers who are use to students that don't care so they conduct class in such a manner. My grades, which were all A's have DROPPED in my 3 months at this ridiculous school and this will affect my standing in National Honor's Society as well as my scholarships. I have tried to take things to the deans and they don't care. If you care anything at all about your education, grades, transcripts and have the desire to actually LEARN, do not pick this school."
College Sophomore,1,The entire Athletics department has been suspended for allowing some athletes to play with low grades. The program has taken a horrible turn for the worse.
College Sophomore,1,TSU parking is really hectic. To find good parking you must get to school really early if you don't want to walk a long way to class. I think that if they get more parking structures then everything will be fine.
College Freshman,1,The standard of poor is really low at Texas Southern University. It is hard to get finacial aid.
College Sophomore,1,All of the same foods are served 4 times a week. there needs to be variety and change.
College Sophomore,1,They are not as good as they should be. compared to other campuses nearby we have fewer and poorer choices.
Recent Alumnus,1,Computer Las – There needs to be computer labs and printing for every building but there is not. Most printing takes place in the library computer lab or the student center lab.
College Student,1,Greek life is not prominent in Texas Southern University.The Greek population is very negligible.There are not special housing conditions for any student except the person is disabled.
College Sophomore,1,Cheap Doesn't Equal Good – Good tuition price as cheapest university in Houston but is hampered with issues including parking and quality of staff other than teachers
College Sophomore,1,Likely Have to Pay to Park – Unless you park in a neighborhood or get a $100+ decal you have to park in the parking garage and pay $3 each time you park
College Sophomore,1,"Not Available – Since the school is around a neighborhood, there isn't much variety to housing. Either the students stay in dorms or stay up to 1 1/2 hours away from the school, depending on traffic which is heavy most of the time."
College Freshman,1,"Not Much – Nightlife is ok, they have parties every weekend at a club called iBAR and sometimes this club DBAR has parties but not often, other than that its mostly house parties until the cops come knocking and everybody scrambles."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid will come kicking at your door for tuition and housing payments. You seriously have to set up a pay-ment plan or they will not allow you on campus or in class. The crazy thing is that they have more space (buildings , employees etc.) for financial aid than they do professors who actually show up to class and teach. Ridiculous"
College Freshman,1,"Bad Decision – Moving to Houston was all I could think about prior to my move-in date at Texas Southern. Not only was I happy to be in a city where shorts and sandals were a year-round thing,  but I figured that Texas Southern had to be the best HBCU in the land  ... Boy wasI wrong. This place is more of a community college than a university and the atmosphere around campus is really dry, crazily dull and nothing to do if your not in any clubs or organizations. I will be leaving TSU in the Fall because students come to class more than the professors, someone was just shot and robbed on our campus, they will bug you about your tuition but when it comes to grades and housing, no one is around, it is seriously a joke to attend this school and I was robbed of a first semester, thousands of dollars and time that I can not get back. It saddens me that an institution that is supposed to cater to African American youth is so sloppy and uncoordinated. Really sad. I plan to attend Clark Atlanta in the Fall with my sister, pray for my success. Thank You"
College Sophomore,1,Network Speed – The network speed is very slow at some points. If I was surfing the web to look up a topic to right a report on it would take approximately 15 minutes to load a page after i refreshed the page ten times.
College Freshman,1,"All the teams are not very good, but we do have a good band. The support for other sports are low they only care about the football team band, and which are football team isn't very good. Are facilities are old and small, its not a very big athletic scene more so it is a band scene because people just go to see the battle of the bands."
College Freshman,1,"The off campus apartments are not very good, they always have trash in the hallways and sometimes the elevator, the parking lot is always litered with trash, the so called gameroom is an old pool table that nobody even uses. The upkeep is low, some apartments are clean inside, but they had complete mold inside of an apartment room and let a student move in (they did not inspect the room and obiviously have not been cleaning the room as studets move-out). It doesn't meet the quality off-campus living should."
College Sophomore,1,"drug use is evident, but law enforcement could be a bit better. Students get away with drug use more than they should, but when caught, law enforcement is on it."
College Sophomore,1,during the beginning of the year the RA's do room checks and theres also a curfew for guests that dont live in the aptarpments. the police usually drive around all the apartments on campus they usually walk the halls also.its pretty easy to have parties but BE CAREFUL!
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is something serious.Be sure you can get therer early enough to get a parking spot..Be sure not to park in he student area with no decap are your car will get towed.
College Senior,1,No Shuttles – No shuttle buses. You have to walk to everything Its Texas around noon time walking around in 100 degree weather would prevent anyone from getting to class on time
College Senior,1,Permits Are Too High – Parking permits are $128 a semester. That is outrageous. And the parking areas for students are not close to anything.

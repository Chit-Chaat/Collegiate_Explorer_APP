I've made countless friends and have been in the admissions department for a few years to encourage high school students to share in my experiences."
Freshman,5,"This is my second semester here at Evangel, and the community here is amazing! The professors care for their students and are invested in not only helping them grow academically, but also in their walks with Christ. Not everyone you encounter here will be Christians as many of the athletes are here on full rides so they come here for the sports and not the culture, but many of them are still very friendly and are openly working on a relationship with God. Overall, Evangel University is a great tight knit community where you can openly express your faith, while creating life long friendships."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Evangel University. I was concerned about moving away from home to attend a school at first. The campus is beautiful, and the staff and students are extremely kind. My first day on campus, I made friends and felt comfortable. I am extremely happy with my decision to come to Evangel.

Sophomore,5,"Evangel University is a beautiful campus with faculty and students who care about you and want you to succeed.

Sophomore,5,"The professors are very passionate about their course material, which makes it easy to want to learn. The staff is very eager to help you succeed in any way possible. The campus is beautiful, and homey. The environment of the school is overall likable in every aspect."

Junior,5,"I am currently a Junior at Evangel and would not change one thing about it.  I love how personable the professors are and how willing they are to go the extra mile to connect with the students on a personal, academic, and spiritual level.  It is so important to me that I have adults in my life that are going to challenge me to be a better, well-rounded person.  I am being challenged academically and am excelling in all that I am doing. I wouldn't change one thing about Evangel University and encourage everyone to come here!"
Freshman,5,"The best part of Evangel University is the community environment and the education offered.  All of the professor care about student success and design courses with students in mind.  As for the community, there are so many event to attend and groups to get involved in.  Even walking around campus someone will smile and wave at you.  With Evangel being a smaller university, it is a great opportunity to connect to both peers and professors."
Junior,5,"Good school And Good people. They have really neat Programs. The school cares about student and their future, so they will do everything to assist student. The professors are very nice and patient. They will help students to fix their problems in academic area.  Some of them even like to hang out with student."

I have become a better person, and have grown in so many ways. The students who attend Evangel are loving, helpful, and very friendly to everyone they come across. One of the greatest characteristics about Evangel are the people who teach here and attend. The staff, students, and faculty are great people who are caring people. My professors so interest in the lives of their students, and care and want their students to succeed, and to me, that is very important in considering a university. I wouldn't want to be at any other university than Evangel."
Sophomore,5,"If anyone is looking for a place that welcomes them like family, Evangel should be their first stop. I have never felt as cared for and loved as I had coming here. The professors sincerely want you to succeed in every area of your life."
College Freshman,5,I love this college and am so thankful I chose it.
College Freshman,5,Professors care about students' lives post college
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus all the time.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly and I love this college.
College Junior,5,It's actually really awesome to see the amount of alumni that have received jobs at the University. There are so many opportunities that open up after graduation.
College Junior,5,"I honestly believe that Evangel University provides one of the very best experiences academically. It is a large university but the classes still manage to be intimate. Professors will work one on one with students to make sure that they are retaining all of the information that is being taught in class. They will adjust their teaching styles if necessary. Most importantly, the professors genuinely care about the spiritual life of all of the students."
College Junior,5,Our school does a phenomenal job of maintaining high levels of security on campus. I most definitely feel safe on campus.
College Junior,5,I've only been on campus for a few weeks but I have been loving every second of it. I meet someone new everywhere I go and there are several opportunities for fun activities to get to know the student body. Help is always offered when needed. Professors are very engaging and helpful in their teaching. Both the academic and community life are excellent.
College Sophomore,5,Campus Housing is one the easiest steps to go through. They connect you with the correct people.
College Sophomore,5,I love our professors. They're excited and passionate to teach us. They believe in us strongly. My favorite style of learning is through discussion based. Class sizes are pretty small/medium.
College Sophomore,5,"I am planning to be an AG minister. With the school being in the AG headquarter, it will not be hard for me to find a job."
College Sophomore,5,"I always feel very safe on campus. Even though we live in not the best part of town, campus safety does a good job. We have great counceling and health facilities."
College Sophomore,5,I love how small the campus is. Everybody kinda knows everybody. I like that about it. The teachers really care about you individually and about your success. The students are mostly nice! I made friends easily because most of them believe the same way I do. Chapels and devotions really challenged my faith. That was life-changing.
College Senior,5,There are several career fairs throughout the year. It is rare for a graduate to not have employment within a few months of graduation.
College Senior,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from my time at Evangel.
College Senior,5,"Evangel University not only effectively prepares you for your career field, but it also allows you to build lifelong relationships along the way with both students and faculty."
College Sophomore,5,SUPER diverse group of people. We have plenty of missionaries and the like
College Sophomore,5,"People might rarely smoke weed around the Krause House, perhaps a couple of beverages off campus, but I haven't heard of anything bad. Students are very responsible and generally don't enjoy those kinds of things"
College Sophomore,5,"I haven't heard of anything occurring, as far as I know there aren't any crazy people in campus who are looking to hoot or holler at any girls. If they did that, one of the football guys would probably stand up for anyone going to far with anything really. Great support on campus from students, and nearly every place you go is filled with people. Very safe"
College Sophomore,5,"I love everything about Lewis hall (co-ed), though Krause hall (guys) or Spence hall (girls) would be my other two recommendations for people coming in. Lewis is the biggest and best hall, not to mention that guys and girls hang out in each other's rooms very awesome, and I say tear down the gender barrier!"
College Sophomore,5,This is an amazing school for those wishing to grow closer to God! Me and a friend are planning on starting a spiritual life group on campus and it's going to be amazing. I love the people here
College Junior,5,I have loved all of my professors and courses. I honestly don't have any complaints.
College Junior,5,"I go to a very small school, so professors are able to give one-on-one help when I need it. All of my professors make me feel valued and I know that they truly do care about my success. I have also made so many amazing friends at my school who have challenged me to grow as a person and reach my greatest potential."
College Junior,5,Most of my teachers are very hands-on with the students. There is much room for involvement on campus and in the local area using the skills I am learning at school. I am very happy that I decided to transfer to Evangel.
College Freshman,5,"I feel 100% safe on campus! Public safety is open 24/7 and are extremely helpful. They survey the parking lots as well as the campus 24/7 as well. The campus crime rate is extremely low, and there are many special security measures put in place just in case something were to happen. All in all, the health and safety of campus is wonderful!!"
College Freshman,5,The career center and services on campus are great! They send out emails a couple times every semester about job fairs in the area and there are even job fairs on campus about once a semester.
Senior,4,"Evangel has been an incredible place to learn! I feel prepared for my career, and I know the teachers and staff care for me, my family, and my future."
Freshman,4,"I love Evangel. The first thing that drew me there, and many others will say the same, is the people. The people there are truly great people and they want to connect and create with you. These are people whose relationships will last a lifetime. The staff is quite remarkable as well, they're not just there to teach. They're not just there to watch the students grow. They are there to learn and grow with the students. The professors at Evangel University want to be there! They're excited for us to learn! They make learning fun!"
Freshman,4,"I was a student who stayed on campus but because of COVID-19, we were forced to continue our learning online. Evangel did an incredible job of shifting everything online. They also moved swiftly and efficiently to make sure online classes were the best that they could be."
Freshman,4,The Evangel University staff are very kind and the professors actually care about how you do and will help you if you ask. They also have a free counseling service which is amazing! Evangel University is a very good school and I would recommend it to most people! They have allergy options to eat too!
Sophomore,4,"Evangel University is a very nice campus. The people all have a good kindred with each other and follow the lord well with their hearts. The professor's also do their best to put God's teachings into class, even if it isn't a theology class. The staff that work with students about  financial aid, public safety, and maintenance work extremely fast and do all that they can to make sure your need and safety is taken care off. It is often times hard to reach other students or professor's about any questions you may have. The surrounding area is also a dangerous one, but the actual campus itself it very safe."
Niche User,4,close to home and has good baseball program. Would love to go there. The price of school is too expensive though.
Sophomore,4,"Evangel University is a great Christian school.  If you are looking for a party scene, or Greek life, this is not your school.  They have very high placement rates and standards."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Evangel University, the price is a bit steep, but worth it for the education and atmosphere."
Junior,4,"Evangel University has a great community of students and staff that genuinely care about your success in life and relationship with God. Faculty at Evangel has been incredible at helping me find resources for financial assistance. While Evangel is a great school, one thing I have noticed that could improve is disabled accessibility. One of my good friends at Evangel is in a wheelchair and we have noticed that several doors do not have a working automatic door or do not have one at all. We also found out that there are no disabled-friendly dorms on campus. My friend has cerebral palsy which makes it difficult for him to take notes and some teachers do not have copies of class notes."
Senior,4,"Evangel is a small, private, Christian liberal arts school that really invest in its students spiritually, as well as preparing them for their vocations. The core classes are engaging, and most of the professors I've had were knowledgeable, relatable, and genuinely interested in helping you succeed. The community life staff is great-- there are rules (curfew, dress code) to follow, but they aren't unreasonable. Springfield is also a great place to be a college student!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the intimacy of smaller classes and the student community. A person typically gets what they want to out of their college education, and Evangel University has a lot to offer."
Niche User,4,Evangel Unveristy is a great post-secondary institution. The community is great and the Christian values are awesome.
Graduate Student,4,"I went to Evangel my Freshman year and looking for a new start. It was very small but has a close tightknit community.  The professors care deeply about the students and help them succeed. As far as a typical college experience, it is very different. The relationships built there are long-lasting and meaningful."
Junior,4,"Evangel University truly embraces it's mission statement, ""Evangel University is a comprehensive Christian university committed to excellence in educating and equipping students to become Spirit-empowered servants of God who impact the Church and society globally."" The professors are dedicated to each students success in the classroom. The university emphasizes the importance of students relationship with God, and incorporating that in their everyday life."
Freshman,4,"I love Evangel University. It has a beautiful campus which you can cross in 10 minutes or less. The staff is wonderful and keep you updated on progress you're making (especially when it comes to the application process) and the enviorment and students safe and fun. The only change I would currently make is how expensive it is. For many families this school is not an option because the total yearly coat can add up to$31,000."
Sophomore,4,"Evangel University is one of the best Christian communities I have ever been involved with. There is a great amount of support that each person can find through fellow students, faculty, and even administrators. It is a great place to not only grow one's faith and beliefs, but to also grow their education."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the small class style and how students can connect more with the professors. I also like how the university incorporates spiritual life into our everyday schedules and encourages us to grow in our faith. I wish there were more options for campus food, but overall it isn't terrible."
Junior,4,"Evangel is a great school; however, there are many unneeded rules. It's much stricter than other colleges."
College Freshman,4,A lot of students attend the games.
College Junior,4,Living on campus makes the overall college experience 10 times better. It opens up the students to the community of students and allows for more social opportunities. The dorms are conveniently placed on campus and allow for quick and easy access to the rest of the campus.
College Junior,4,"The majority of the students in the school love the athletics and enjoy attending athletic events. As for the actual team performance of the athletes, it tends to be a bit mediocre. But there is always a good amount of fan support and school spirit. I think that if the athletic teams did better, there would probably be more of an enthusiasm coming from the student body."
College Sophomore,4,Many of the students that have graduated from here are able to get a job almost before they could graduate.
College Sophomore,4,"I love everything Evangel has to offer. Academically and spiritually,  we are blessed abundantly."
College Sophomore,4,I am confident to say that our students on campus do noy have to fear of an type of sexual assualt. We strongly based on faith which plays a big role in keeping that out of our campus.
College Sophomore,4,I'm not involved in any Greek life
College Sophomore,4,"We do not have many facilities for our sporting events, but the students and faculty are supportive of our athletes."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been great! Students are encouraged to enage in the school's activities, academically and spiritually"
College Sophomore,4,I love the way our dorms are set up. We have 2 people in a room and another two people in the room next to us and we're connected through a bathroom. It is convienent to classes.
College Senior,4,"It is not in a great area of town, but campus is a safe place."
College Senior,4,"While there are things that drive you crazy about every dorm, Evangel is one of the best. No community bathroom . . . need I say more?"
College Senior,4,People love hiring Evangel grads.
College Senior,4,I have loved my experience at Evangel!!!
College Sophomore,4,"I love the professors and they really try to make everything easy and well explained, but some new teachers are struggling to create coherent material"
College Sophomore,4,"For anything ministerial or musically related, you will get your job. Other majors don't really help you out too much"
College Sophomore,4,Evangel is a great school to have received a diploma from.
College Sophomore,4,"All of the professors I have had have been extremely intelligent, helpful, and kind."
College Sophomore,4,Public safety officers seem to be everywhere. Generally they leave us alone but there is one jerk officer none of us like.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are close to everything on campus, including parking lots. Each dorm has its own unique atmosphere about it."
College Sophomore,4,"When a lot of fans/students show up to a varsity sporting event, it is extremely fun. However, students do not travel well and do not care much as the varsity seasons go on. It is clear the campus does not revolve around its varsity sports."
College Sophomore,4,Evangel has a wonderful atmosphere. I have never been around so many genuinely good people in all my life. Evangel is making a difference in my life and I would choose it over and over again.
College Junior,4,Most of the graduates that I know got jobs right after graduation. My school does a good job of preparing students for their future careers.
College Junior,4,The school does a really good job of notifying students when there is a crime on or near campus and the campus is very safe. There have no been any serious crimes on campus that I know of and I do not feel unsafe at all.
College Junior,4,"The dorms are great. The atmosphere and community in all the dorms that I have lived in has been very welcoming and I have really enjoyed the time I spent there. Some of the buildings could use some work and the dorms could be a little more affordable, but overall, on campus life is great."
College Junior,4,professors are accessible and work with students that make an effort
College Junior,4,Enjoy living on campus and my dorm (Lewis)
College Junior,4,I enjoy going to the events. They are well publicized.
College Freshman,4,"Most students attend the sports games, but it is not what the campus focuses on."
College Freshman,4,"We are pretty safe here. I feel comfortable, of course It is always good to lock your door."
College Freshman,4,"We can go on pretty easily, I think, to join some ministry. We will leave here with a lot of experience and ready for more."
College Freshman,4,"I have had a couple issues with a couple of the professors, but we worked through it. I love the majority of my professors."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy being a part of the leadership program that partners with James River Church and Evangel. I am learning a lot and it is a great place to grow.
College Sophomore,4,I like the professors at this school. They are very willing to help in anyway they can to make sure that you are learning what it is that you need to know to be successful.
College Sophomore,4,The campus has such little crime activity I feel bad for the campus patrol that drive around with not much to do.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know much about this yet but I'm looking further into all these aspects with my advisor, she is extremely helpful to me!"
College Sophomore,4,Love the class sizes and the teachers have always been merciful on late assignments and very caring about grades.
College Sophomore,4,"This school has opened me to new opportunities I didn't know I had and the faculty and staff are so caring towards the students, it feels like a home at this school."
College Freshman,4,"The quality on campus that includes students to their majors are great. The campus has open values and groups that encourage students to dig and get a taste of their career. When you pick a major, you take a class that covers what you are getting into and if you like it, you can continue your career. If not then you have an opportunity change your major. Overall Evangel helps you get a degree in the career you want."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus and the security on campus has been the best. It is sometimes scary walking alone but I have to remember that I have to have someone walk with me at night. The while campus is serious on keeping the students and everyone on campus safe.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is the best sometimes you get the feeling that you stay on campus to much but it passes. The dorms are great and always clean. Sometimes the dorm has some negatives such as loud music late at night or people talking loud during quiet hours. Or minor problems with your roommate walking in late at night, but we get passed those. The social atmosphere is great there are great people to talk to everyday and everyone is so nice. Overall living on campus is great."
College Freshman,4,Sports are a big thing in college life. It helps to get my mind off homework for a hour or two. School spirit shows around the school and everyone has something to neither big or small. For example the football games are awesome because I get to show my school spirit at Evangel University. Even when we won or lose we show support to the athletics.
College Junior,2,"If you are even lucky enough to be approved to live off campus, (which is more difficult than convincing a unicorn to surrender it's horn to the Great Kahn himself) the houses are outdated, dirty, dangerous and in bad neighborhoods."
Recent Alumnus,2,There is very little funding for grad students.
College Freshman,2,"It is great for people who don't like to party, but for the average ""partier"" they won't find the kind of parties they are looking for. Evangel has a very strict no alcohol policy. We do still know how to have a good time though."
College Junior,2,Eat off campus or buy your own groceries if you can.
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus is very limited, which makes it difficult for people who cannot afford living on campus."
College Freshman,2,"We live in Missouri. One day it's 75 and sunny, the next day it's 30 a snowing."
College Freshman,2,not really many options for off campus housing
College Freshman,2,students must have their own cars or get rides from friends
College Freshman,2,"Missouri has bipolar weather. It's usually windy, which is an annoyance."
College Sophomore,2,There's nothing really to do.
College Sophomore,2,Not much night life encouraged
College Sophomore,2,The administration is very strict in a variety of areas. It is definitely more strict than your average university.
College Sophomore,2,The weather here is terrible. Missouri weather is so inconsistent!
College Senior,2,Every single year I have some issue with my financial aid. I had it appealed once and ended up getting less money in the end. It was really hard to get money when I first started school because I was only 17 years old.
College Freshman,2,"The public safety don't want to be bothered with your petty problems. My friends car was stuck in the snow in the parking lot and when she called to ask for some help getting it out, she was told that ""we don't do that"". In other words, it's cold outside, I don't want to help. The nurse is sweet and all, but NEVER prescribes anything so I question her ability as a nursing professional. "
College Freshman,2,"There are too many students here that connect to the wifi effectively. Half the time the wifi works fine, usually when you need it, it doesn't work though. There are computer labs, but the atmosphere of the labs is awful. "
College Freshman,2,"The best way to get around is to have your own car, or hitch a ride with someone. It is not safe to walk very far from campus. "
College Freshman,2,You can't live off campus until you are 21 unless you are living at home.
College Sophomore,2,"The city doesn't seem to have very many options for outings at night for students that don't party. And at Evangel, 99% of us don't. We usually have to make our own fun because there aren't that many things to do in town."
College Junior,2,"Missouri's weather is beyond inconsistent and being from Florida where it's either hot or rainy, I was not a happy camper. I do enjoy the Spring and the Fall because of the warm, crisp air. When it snows? You can find me in my bed all day."
College Sophomore,1,It's the worst because we have no Greek Life. I am alright with that.
College Sophomore,1,"Um... We don't have fraternities or sororities. We have groups that go places every day though and somewhere around 50 clubs, though the biggest are the spiritual life clubs like Crosswalk and other ministries"
College Sophomore,1,DO NOT LIVE IN WALTHER. There is major corruption in the leadership that is in this building starting from the top level of leadership to the bottom (RAs).Gossip and incorrect ways of handling problems/issues are a major issue. Excessive threats of being fined and yelled at is extremely unprofessional and rude. This is not a place for a mature college kid to stay. Do not live in this dorm.
College Junior,1,Greek life does not exist at Evangel University.
College Freshman,1,"As far as I am aware, we do not have anything specifically targeted towards Greek life. I could just be unaware though."
College Freshman,1,we dont have that here soooo yeah
College Freshman,1,The weather is insane and you never know what will happen next.
College Freshman,1,"You are not allowed to party in any way in clubs or bars or nightlife in general. Biggest deal, NO DANCING."
College Freshman,1,You are literally not allowed to live off of campus unless you live with your parents. 
College Freshman,1,"This is a Christian college, partying is not encouraged."
College Junior,1,"Evangel strictly forbids any alcholic/drug parties on campus.  Most people just go off campus for birthday dinner, etc."
College Senior,1,This school is pretty expensive and prizes are going up as well. Advice that I would have to give is to be sure to apply for FAFSA early. Regardless if you want financial aid or not the school requires it.
College Sophomore,1,"Rules and Regulations – Evangel has some pretty strict rules, being religiously affiliated. The punishments can be severe or not, depending on your offense."
College Sophomore,1,Get Yourself a Ride. Your best bet is to either plan on having a car or bike or makes some friends with cars quickly. The buses system is not good and takes forever. You can walk to the grocery store and tacobell. But if you want to get out for awhile it's best to plan ahead
College Junior,1,Not Available – Because Evangel University is a private university they require all students to live on campus. There are a few exceptions to this.
College Sophomore,1,"Worst Dining Available – I would give rate the dining an F if it wasn't for the variety of drinks available and the salad bar, but the food on campus gets old very quickly. I didn't think it was that bad when I first arrived on campus, but by my second semester, I found it repulsive. Basically, you are served the same food every week. Thin-crusted pizza, rice, pasta, casserole, and other stuff. Don't come here if you don't mind bad food. It's worse than army rations!"

Graduate Student,5,I've found this Bible College to have great resources and incredible professors. Really nice area and campus.
Alum,5,"NBC was a a great experience for me.  Having a full time ministry, I opted for the online learning which is all they offer now. I found the online system to be very effective. The learning plan was well thought out and the faculty was very timely and helpful. The overall experience was fantastic and I am very thankful that I chose NBC."
Sophomore,5,Love being a part of this school and nothing to change. I am in school for outreach ministries and pastoral leadership. I love the feel of the online classroom here and the staff is extremely graceful.
Sophomore,5,I love this college. Great people. I enjoy the online courses. I have been enrolled for about four years starting with a BA degree but switched to AA degree. I will finish soon and be able to work while going back to school for more education. I will enjoy going back and spend time learning more as I grow more as a person. This has been a great experience for me. The college has people call you and encourage you as you attend. I have not had that experience before. I will
Sophomore,5,I absolutely LOVE Nazarene Bible College! The onboarding process was smooth and everyone has been so helpful and supportive. I do not know of any  other college that calls each student individually on a quarterly basis to see how they are doing and to pray with them if needed. I know that I am truly cared for and appreciated at NBC.
Works Here,5,it suks            ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Senior,5,The professors and staff are some of the nicest and caring people I have ever met. They truly care about you as not just a student but they also care about your personal and spiritual life. They are willing to do anything and everything they can to help you!

College Junior,5,As students at this school we are treated as adults and expected to treat others with that same respect.
College Junior,5,The network that this school has for online and on campus education is second to none.  
College Junior,5,The online campus is amazing for communication with professors and other students.  You do not have to be on campus to be able to access your professor for questions or concerns.  
College Junior,5,"If it was not for the opportunity that NBC allows me in attending my school, I would not be able to complete my degree."
College Junior,5,Campus life is very diverse and allows for many opporutnities to meet other people.
College Senior,5,"I'm in the Pastoral Ministry degree program and I find it rewarding and satsifying to say the least. The program specifics of types of courses, workload, curriculum are to the best advantage of anyone taking this program. The professors are full of knowledge and expertise to help the students in the online classroom. The program concentrations are great in terms of classes on leadership, specific ministry programs and our own personal spiritual formation. I have enjoyed being in this program and this major is great for hands-on experience."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Overall Review â€“ Nazarene Bible College is an amazing Christian education school. The campus is stunning for local students. It has a great view of Pikes Peak and sites like Apostles Court and Strickland Chapel that are definitely worth seeing. It is also a great online college for adults who can't move to Colorado but still seek ministerial preparation, higher education, or continuing education. It's also great for younger college students who want to take courses with a Christian perspective. Very helpful staff. Highly recommended!"
Senior,4,"The online classes have been excellent. The learning environment is great and the interaction between professors and fellow students has been fantastic! I have learned a lot through my classes and enjoyed the warm, friendly, challenging and encouraging environment."
College Senior,4,"A high GPA will get you merit scholarships, You must go through a interview process with references for specific degree and exhibit a life that is honoring to God."
College Senior,4,"we live in a military community and the home of several colleges so housing is plentiful. You can find anything to fit your budget and also the availability of sharing homes, apartments, etc are an option."
College Senior,4,We live in a University city so the options for dining are plentiful from high end to discounted. Google dining in Colorado Springs and you will  find evry type of food in every budget available.
College Senior,4,"As I am pursuing my degree as a Christian Counselor we are receiving Masters level material for a BA degree.  They accepted 60 of my credits that I received  for My RN degree.  I also received a merit scholarship of 100 dollars per semester hour.  The curriculum matches specifically for my field of study and also requires that the student receive counseling.  This portion is required so that we work on our own life issues so that we do not take unsolved issues that have affected us into our professional practice.  The cohort is intense and gives us, ""hands on practicum"", to practice the theories first hand.  The facilities are comfortable and the campus small, making it easy to navigate the campus. Our curriculum offers night classes and the main age group is 35 and above so that those working during the day can attend classes at night. We are required to do a professional development course that includes an internship and also a final paper on our personal philosophy of counseling.  We have several job opportunities available from hospitals, mental health facilities, Rehab centers,non-profits available for work opportunities.  College opportunities to pursue further our education are available and convenient.  I personally will be pursuing my Masters when I finish by BA and I have already received a part time job at a non-profit which is opening a home for young women 18-24 that are transitioning out of foster care, homeless or trafficked."
College Junior,4,"Overall, the health and safety options on campus are convenient and accessible for the various needs of health and safety.  If there is not an answer on campus, there are people to help get answers off campus."

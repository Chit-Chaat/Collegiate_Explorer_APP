Graduate Student,5,"I have so much love for this school. It completely transformed my life and my dancing. By far one of the best schools for your dance training. You will 100% thrive here if you work hard and absorb the teaching. I really cannot express just how wonderful the dance classes/rehearsals, academics, student life, and teachers were. Every single teacher truly cares so much with the student mentally, physically, and emotionally in and out of classes. This school will forever be my home. Best years of my life."
Graduate Student,5,"I get a lot of professional skills and knowledge from the school, the faculty is willing to help students become artists and share their useful experiences with students. It's a very cozy and friendly school, I love this school so much. I believe I will become a great film composer in the future."
Freshman,5,"This school has incredible faculty and student body that inspire you to improve and create.   It will push you to be your best while also giving you leeway to work on your own projects.  The area is beautiful and the buildings are always being improved.  New courses and minors are also always being added, giving you the opportunity to learn things outside of your art."
Graduate Student,5,Admissions process was smooth and exciting! Professors are industry experts. Engagement leading up to orientation has been insightful and exciting.
Freshman,5,I love this school! I feel like I'm truly at the right place where I will grow as a filmmaker. The mentorship and experiences I've been given in the last year are honestly some of the best that any film school has to offer. I can#t wait to keep working next year!
Freshman,5,"I LOVE UNCSA! Getting to work with some of the best teachers in the country and forming great relationships is part of what makes UNCSA so great. They truly care about your development and well being, and will do anything to help you accomplish your goals. Not to mention the equally talented students that are incredible to collaborate with. The academics are lower than the standards of most colleges, but then again it is an art school so you're there for a specific art.
While some people think going here lessens the typical college experience, I would actually disagree. We get free tickets to performances, movies, concerts, which all add culture and exposure. I have learned so much about other arts, which enrich my own performances and will help benefit my future career."
Freshman,5,"This is an amazing, diverse campus filled with like-minded artists focused on their respective crafts.  It is a true community filled with encouragement, acceptance and drive!  The faculty and staff are so supportive of you as both an artist and individual.  It felt like home the first time I stepped foot on campus!"
Graduate Student,5,I love this school now im a graduate so i recommend this college to kids who need good colleges and go to this college for a good education.
Junior,5,"Knowledgeable faculty and plenty of resources. While it’s hard work, you won’t find another place quite like it!"
Freshman,5,I feel that UNCSA is the best institution for me to pursue my major. I feel I am a part of a strong community. UNCSA has become my home.
Freshman,5,UNCSA is such a great school with all of the people you meet and all the great times you have  you wont want to leave. they work so hard and are nonstop workers.
Alum,5,"UNCSA is a haven for the budding performing artist. I have yet to find another school that can compare to UNCSA in its welcoming environment and community, passion for life in the arts, or individualized support for success. Every student, teacher, and even staff member that makes up the quaint UNCSA community becomes a key part of your network for the future, and they are always pushing students to strive to be the best they can be."
Freshman,5,"UNCSA is a very rigorous program. Our first year we learn other Design and Production Majors such as Scenery, electrics, and costumes. We are on crew for sometimes long hours. It's very tough but that's why it is rewarding and educational at the end! My favorite course out of crew rotations was being in Costumes. The gowns were gorgeous and actors were very entertaining."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts has been amazing. My professors at the school give me and my fellow classmates the motivation to better ourselves as thinkers, partners, and filmmakers. Coming to UNCSA has opened my mind to meet amazing people and to work with them."
Senior,5,"This university is one of those places I call home. I have never wanted to leave, and, seeing as I'm about to graduate, I'm heart broken that my time is about to come. This place not only holds the impeccable keys to success in the arts, but it also holds some of the brightest and most creative minds I have ever met. Though this school is a challenge, they welcome each student with open arms and strive to shape them into an artist who makes the world better, an artist that the artist themselves are proud to be."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My school is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.  Being able to do something to what I love and present it on stage often times during the school year is exciting. I like how there are super well know guests of every kind of talent come and visit our college and talk to the classes and inspire the environment and energy. The students are always doing something with their majors and it would always be different with too much creative, which is what makes them epic! I'm going to spend the rest of my years here most definitely."
College Sophomore,5,"All of the artistic faculty is incredible here. They are well experienced in their field and put forth all effort to see their students learn, make mistakes, experiment, and succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"At this school I am being challenged not only as an artist, but also as a human being. I am constantly reminded that I am a human being first. That being said, so much of art can transfer into everyday life. I am extremely blessed to be in an environment that nurtures me as a whole person. Many, if not all, of the lessons being taught in the classroom can be applied to regular life. I am being taught to explore and experiment while learning to communicate my thoughts and critique my work, and my peers' work."
College Sophomore,5,I know i'll get a job right away out of college
College Sophomore,5,"As old as the facilities might seem, the education is amazing"
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt so supported and understood by faculty and staff before. It has truly been an amazing first two weeks!!
College Freshman,5,UNCSA is one of the best experiences in my life. I made hundreds of contacts in the visual arts world as well as made life long friends!
College Freshman,5,"UNCSA is an incredibly dedicated campus, with amazing faculty and staff"
College Sophomore,5,"The local food is pretty delicious lots of awesome coffee spots, thai, mexican, and the BEST Mediterranean place I've ever eaten at."
College Sophomore,5,"They spoke to me on a real person to person level that made me feel extremely comfortable in my audition/interview. They ask a lot though, 3 monologues (2 modern contrasting and 1 classical) + 16 bars."
College Sophomore,5,All the interns I've seen are fully involved in the classes they apprentice for.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Winston-Salem. Tons of parks, public art and local restaurants/businesses."
College Sophomore,5,"Very diverse campus, I was surprised at the large population of international students we have. In terms of personalities it is an arts school, so....a wide variety."
College Sophomore,5,Every department on campus has major connections to the professional industry and the great teachers of those fields. Our dance and design + production schools for example are a huge feeder for Cirque Du Soleil.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is not strict.
College Sophomore,5,"You can't get any better theater experience than at UNCSA. Period. We have connections with Broadway, Cirque de Soleil, and other large companies who love to work with our students, and credit it to the amazing training we come out of this school with."
College Sophomore,5,"In every program, no matter what department or major, you'll have access to training from some of the most amazing professionals in the business. UNCSA plans wonderful experiences for the students where professionals will come to the school and do workshops, seminars, and work with you one-on-one and give you tips and pointers - not to mention making connections that will help you gain a summer internship and (eventually) have a job waiting for you after graduation!"
College Freshman,5,Winston-Salem offers the best food in the country! I have never been so impressed by the variety of restaurants and the quality of the food served.
College Freshman,5,UNCSA has a very low crime rate. This campus is one of the safest.
College Freshman,5,The weather in North Carolina is absolutely beautiful! Although we receive some snow in the winter I absolutely love the breezy and sunny weather we have!
College Freshman,5,"The University of North Carolina School of the Arts is a school that is dedicated to the prosperity of its students. This school has the highest percent of graduates working straight out of college, doing what they love. UNCSA is a school that not only focusses on talent and skill, but also academic integrity, artistry, and well-being. This school is truly the best in the nation."
College Sophomore,5,"Very focused majors and departments, the best facilities and faculty you're likely to find.  But also extremely demanding- they won't hesitate to assign you more than you think you can possibly handle- although that's part of the fun!"
College Sophomore,5,"If you know you want to be in the arts- you can't find a more focused major.  For example, most schools have a degree in technical theatre/design, or just theatre with an emphasis on technical theatre/design.  If you do find a school that has majors in more specific things, it's most likely going to be set design, lighting design and costume design.  We have a whole school of Design and Production, and majors as specific as props, scene painting, or wigs and make-up.  We also have the only MFA program for scenic art in the country."
College Senior,5,"My specific major, filmmaking (cinematography) is some of the best in the country. Our faculty and facility is most likely the two strongest factors at this school. We have industry professionals who have worked for many years and some are still working today. We have 3 large sound stages. One of which, an independent feature used for their film. The school has a numerous amount of cameras, grip, and lighting equipment. More than you will probably have access to when you first leave the school. The workload is tough but good for you. The school productions lets you practice your craft so it does not become a film studies school but one that specializes in film production. The school has a staff member dedicated solely to helping students find internships and jobs. All in all, it's really the best bang for the buck school one could ask for. It's slowly becoming more popular, so come study here asap!"
College Sophomore,5,"For studying music, I can't imagine a place I would be receiving a better education. The professor are an eclectic mix of traditionalist and progressive minds, and classes are both challenging and encouraging. The professors are always willing to spend extra time with a student to help them improve, as well."
Senior,4,"I have been at uncsa high school for four years and have enjoyed it greatly, but it's not perfect. I would only recommend it for someone who is truly invested in their art and is ready to put in the work."
Senior,4,I have taken online classes during the 2020 school year and it has been as good as one can expect. teachers have been very understanding.
Alum,4,"During my time at UNCSA, I found the arts education exemplary. My technical training had me hired on a job literally the day after graduation, and during the time I worked in that field I had great success thanks to the training I got at UNCSA. The student lifestyle while I was there was pretty brutal, with morning academic classes, afternoon/evening arts classes, and weekends spent doing film projects. Academic classes in general, with some notable exceptions (there are a handful of incredible academic teachers there doing amazing work with exhausted arts students), were lackluster when compared to more general education schools, but UNCSA is an arts conservatory and excels at that."
Junior,4,"UNCSA has a great party scene as well as a welcoming community and great professors in the music school. I have found all of the music school staff and students to be very welcoming and have created a great community. They have also been fantastic teachers in all ways by being dedicated to growing students both as musicians as well as citizens. The Liberal Arts professors, however, I have yet to have a good experience with. For every liberal arts class I have taken, the professors either don't seem to care about teaching the class at all, or give extreme amounts of homework and taking away from the time you need to work on your art."
Niche User,4,"I will be new to UNCSA next year, but so far my experience has been great. I look forward to being involved with other students working in the same and similar fields as me."
Alum,4,"Loved the opportunity to specifically concentrate in my artistic passion.  The students at the school are very competitive and out to win ""The Hunger Games"" at an arts conservatory."
Senior,4,A very hands-on intensive learning experience. By the time you leave here you will already be hire-able on a professional film/tv set. Personally I wish there were actually more film theory-style courses available.
Niche User,4,This school is a fantastic place for those who are deeply passionate about the arts and want to pursue an intense career in it.
Junior,4,I really like that UNCSA is an Arts focus school. Everyone is very passionate about their particular major. The motto of the school is Do what you love! It is so true! One thing that I wish were different was the size. It is so small. Everyone knows everyone.
Sophomore,4,The school itself is great and has a lot of great things to offer. The only thing that sucks is how small it is. This makes for a very political community (imagine living in a small town where you know everyone).
Sophomore,4,It is an amazing school. Gives you exactly the arts education you crave. Not for the weak willed. Only if you are extremely passionate about your art. 
Niche User,4,I visited this college to determine if i would like to apply. The location of the school is in a residential area but it sits alone. Everything that you need is located within the school. I also like that the campus is not too far away from shopping areas and they offer a shuttle bus once a week to go to the shopping area. My family and I were comfortable with the environment.
College Sophomore,4,"The liberal arts teachers aren't that great.  However, the arts teachers make up for everything.   They are experts in their fields and highly regarded."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not that familiar with the job placement opportunities in other schools.  However, in the school of dance, the dean and faculty work to place students and give them good recommendations to get jobs as soon as they graduate.  Also, the dance alumni network is crazy good!"
College Sophomore,4,UNCSA is so different from any other school out there! It is a haven for young artists developing their different crafts and interacting with other arts.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I feel like you won't get the full college experience if you don't live on campus. That's my opinion. By my fourth year, I plan on living off-campus though."
College Sophomore,4,"Because the community is so tight, there are not a lot of chances for problems to occur.  People are there to work and don't cause a lot of criminal activity."
College Sophomore,4,This school sets the graduate up for a job in a related field of his or her choosing.  The community outreach is awesome and the professors respect the grad students as future colleagues.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall impression of UNCSA is that it is a wonderland full of art, constant creation, challenge, and growth.  Raw talent will be used and you will graduate having a well-rounded experience."
College Sophomore,4,UNCSA is a very accepting community for people from all walks of life with all different beliefs.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many artists who have graduated from UNCSA that have made successful careers for themselves, and even won academy awards."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel pretty safe on our campus, even at night. I wish I were more aware of sexual assault on campus. Honestly I haven't heard any reports of it although unfortunately I'm sure it has happened. There was a service in April to bring awareness to victims of sexual assault."
College Sophomore,4,"I attend an all arts conservatory, so there are zero organized sports on campus. And I think everyone is okay with that. We are highly involved with art and refining our skills that no one is all that interested in huge sports teams. There are other activities such as movie on the hill, or karaoke that give us something fun and relaxing to look forward too. The dance studios and facilities are well kept and the gym is fairly well equipped for general physical activity needs."
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you love what you do, this is the place to come to learn how to do it"
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors and programs are great
Recent Alumnus,4,This has been a great place to learn your specific craft that you are passionate about. The professors are knowledgeable and the school is small enough so that students get individual attention.
College Sophomore,4,UNCSA is a great school with a lot of course work.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't been here long, but so far so good!"
College Junior,4,"I go to a University, but in reality it is a conservatory.  University of North Carolina School of the Arts is a place where one is able to grow and hone one's artistic skills.  I am a Dancer with a Ballet focus and I get to do what I love all day, and that is dance.  Of course, there are academics involved other wise we students would not be able to leave this wonderful school without a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA).  Both the arts as well as the academic teachers are extremely supportive and help us students survive and thrive.  If I had to choose a school again I would most definitely find myself at University of North Carolina School of the Arts."
College Freshman,4,"from what i hear its pretty great, its cheeper then living off campus by a long shot, so theres that."
College Freshman,4,"you can eat down town, which is cool, or there are little things around in general. You can usually find somewhere to go eat."
College Freshman,4,"This school is pretty expensive when you are from out of state, but they are really good at helping you out if you need the money and get your paper work in on time."
College Sophomore,4,It's challenging but so much fun.
College Sophomore,4,"Minimum wage. Ushering for performances, working in the costume shop."
College Sophomore,4,People have fun thats for sure. I dont go to the club or anything like that though so I wouldnt know
College Sophomore,4,"I feel extremely safe, on campus and in the surrounding area. We have more police with more weapons and security then necessary."
College Sophomore,4,"My arts courses in the drama department are amazing, there are registration issues you have to deal with for academic placement but those courses are great as well. The variety of courses you can choose from academically is pretty wide and creative."
College Sophomore,4,"UNCSA is very diverse in religious beliefs, sexual orientation, and ethnicities. I promise, there are people at UNCSA that will make you feel right at home."
College Sophomore,4,"Some of the dorm halls still need renovating, but UNCSA is working on them, and some of them have already been renovated. The on-campus Bailey Apartments are really nice, but kind of small (4 people to an apartment), and the off-campus Center Stage apartments are gorgeous (2 people per apartment with washer-dryers included)!"
College Sophomore,4,"I was so worried Financial Aid was going to be terrible, I had heard so many horror stories from others saying that it was so troublesome. Luckily, Financial Aid went wonderfully for me. UNCSA entered me into Financial Aid Scholarships I didn't even know about, and found me nearly $15,000 worth of free money for school. I only ended up paying about $2,000 out of pocket. I was so relieved!"
College Sophomore,4,"UNCSA is a place where people are very accepting and friendly. It's a community of artists that band together for the bigger picture - our productions. The people are hilarious, very outgoing, very random (maybe even a little crazy), but they're some of the most amazing people you could meet. I can say that I know almost everyone on campus, and even if some of them aren't the best of friends with me, they're always very courteous and friendly."
College Sophomore,4,"People in Winston Salem are very friendly towards our students. We often walk from the campus to the Washington Perk or downtown towards Camino (both are very tasty coffee shops), and it's always a wonderful experience. Many food establishments and cafes are within walking distance from the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"On campus, everything feels extremely safe and secure, but as soon as you get off campus, the area gets pretty sketchy. I've never had a problem with anything on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have a pretty positive opinion on being in the School of Music at UNCSA. The course load isn't too insane, but it's targeted to increase your understanding of music as a whole which is really valuable (or at least in my opinion). For instance, the core music classes really interact within each other as far as the material covered in the other classes in order to create a three dimensional understanding. 

The facilities are improving since I first got to the school. They got new carpeting in the practice rooms, which was really needed, but the only thing is that the practice rooms are on the other side of campus, so when we have a lesson we have ot hike all the way across campus and back to warm up for a lesson in the music building. 

The main problem is the lack of scholarship within the school fo music (or at least within my studio, and others that I have talked to). There's literally nothing to offer the incoming students, so I really don't even know why they're still getting students."
College Sophomore,4,"It's generally diverse throughout the entire campus, but the degree of diversity depends on the area in question. There're so many different types of people, each with a unique thing to offer the school as a whole. As a community we're extremely accepting of new and different types of people. For instance, we recieved a few international students this year and everybody was super friendly towards them. Some people even went so far as to start learning their native tongue just to make them feel comfortable. 

The only thing that might not be as diverse as it should be is ethnic/racial diversity. Although my immediate friend group is incredibly diverse, we're lacking diversity through ethnic cultures such as Native Americans and Asians."
College Freshman,4,There is wifi offered throughout the campus. There are also many labs to work in and many printers to use.
College Freshman,4,The student body at UNCSA is very diverse. Although we are all different this school functions in a way that everyone feels like family!
College Freshman,4,UNCSA has a small pool of classes to choose from.
College Freshman,4,"UNCSA offers many literature classes. This school really likes to focus on creativity, and artistry."
College Freshman,4,"The campus strictness is very high. UNCSA has its police force riding around campus 24-7. This school has extremely high expectations of its students and expects us to be on time, and ALWAYS in class."
College Freshman,4,"There are many off-campus living options for students downtown and around the city. There are many apartments, townhouses, and regular houses available."
College Freshman,4,"UNCSA offers campus transportation to students who do and do not have their own transpiration. UNCSA schedules weekly trips to target, Walmart, Hanes Mall, and many more places in Winston-Salem."
College Freshman,4,"UNCSA was the first arts school created in the U.S. As a result of this, it is in many ways, old. Although this school has beautiful studios, it could use some work!"
College Freshman,4,This school does not offer the typical college experience. The hours that are expected from us students are in many ways exhausting and tiresome. UNCSA has a high expectation from its students so they believe that it is important to stay focussed and always remain working. This school functions like a conservatory rather than a regular university.
College Sophomore,4,The faculty are literally the best in the business- look up the most famous names of people in theatre design and you're guaranteed to come across numerous members of the faculty.  Facilities are some of the best in the country as are the connections you make here.  You get a much more detailed education than at a liberal arts school- but it's also a great deal more work.  Don't be surprised if you have to pull multiple all nighters a week and work all weekend as well.  But the education you get is well worth it.
College Sophomore,4,"The only downside to off campus dining here is that there are no/few student discounts, and very few places within a 5 minute drive from campus.  If you've got time for a 10-20 minute trek, you can get just about anything, and for very reasonable prices too- assuming you don't choose an extremely swanky restaurant.  There are almost all the classic chains found in most regions, along with some great local restaurants and plenty of fast food options.  If you wanted to, you could eat out for months without repeating a place."
College Senior,4,"It takes some time, but by your 4th year hopefully you know some good spots to eat outside of campus. There are plenty of ethnic places in the city. You can find great Mexican and Thai food. Sushi's okay. Chinese is okay. Italian-decent. Greek-pretty good. Mediterranean-not bad. Indian-not bad. BBQ-pretty good. A lot of fast food around. Everything is really cheap here and all pretty much within 15 minutes of driving. Student Discounts? I've never heard of any, but that'd be cool. Some places to check out- if you enjoy authentic Mexican-El Rancho. Hands down, my favorite restaurant in town. Eat right. Eat with the locals."
College Senior,4,"Crime on campus? Out of the 2 years living on campus, I've never had any major problems. I have never felt in danger while on campus. The police are usually patrolling or on duty 24/7."
College Senior,4,"So far? Well I am a Senior Filmmaking Student at UNCSA and have a few more months to go before I graduate in May. Favorite experiences? Too many to name. But in broad terms, it definitely has to involve fellow students from the school. What makes UNCSA, UNCSA? Our mascot. I would not take back my 4 years if I had the opportunity to. I actually moved out all the way from Bay Area, California to transfer to a community college in order to study here. And after all that- it was still worth all the trouble. Come here, you won't regret it!"
College Senior,4,"For what you pay, it really is some of the best you will get for the rest of your life. Unless you move to a third-world country. I lived in the dorms my first year (the worst living experience in my last 4 years). My second year was at the Bailey St. Apartments (a lot better) with four people to a small apartment (bathroom, living room, kitchen). My third year and fourth year have been a house shared between four other UNCSA film students. Our rent is a little under $300/month + utilities= ~$350-$400/month. We also have a front and back porch, 3 bathrooms, 2 living rooms, and 2 kitchens. It doesn't get much better than this. Our landlord is a nice guy, but our house has been broken into! Parking is great and easy like the rest of the city. The school does not specifically help students search for off-campus housing other than their Center Stage Apartments, which are not worth the $$ IMO."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are very old and need to be updated. The bathrooms are almost never clean, but the resident life is good."
College Sophomore,2,The school itself does not deal much with scholorships. But will easily point you to a loan
College Freshman,2,This school does not have a good amount of parking. The only parking lot that is available to students is extremely far and is most of the time not worth the walk.
College Sophomore,2,"You'd better find a friend with a car, or be prepared to wait a half hour for a very expensive cab."
College Senior,2,"UNCSA not have a sports team. However, the school does have a mascot- ""The Fighting Pickle"" which has been on a list for some of the cheesiest college mascots across America. We have a pretty good school gym that is within walking distance from the dorms and Bailey Apartments. The field that we used to play ultimate frisbee, football, and soccer is now under construction..."
College Sophomore,2,"A portion of the school is under construction and that portion used to be a parking lot that is now blocked off. So that gives most students with a car a limited place to park. The only place to park is a parking lot south of campus that can be a very far walk from dorms, classes, and academic buildings. If you're an RA you can park behind the dorm. But if you park illegally the campus police do give tickets and if you avoid the warnings your can get towed. So really you just have to follow the rules as far as parking goes, until construction is over, and there is more places to park."
College Student,2,the programs here are very demanding and do not promote a lot of free time for this sort of recreation.
College Sophomore,2,"You'll find many characters at School of the Arts. There's 5 programs - Music, Dance, Film, Drama, and Design& Production. A certain level of artistic sophistication is located in every department, but each has it's unique set of stereotypical qualities. Drama tends to be the most stuck-up. They dress up in all black ninja-like outfits everyday. Also they typically display fake personalities, as they are always acting. I have found several to be talking in a strange irish accent for a week at a time. They use life as a stage, and are constantly playing pretend with themselves. Music kids are the hermits. It's hard to describe them because they are too busy hiding indoors. Ironically, they are never seen nor heard. Film kids are the quirky, hipster kids. Pretentiousness is not hard to find. They spend most time disagreeing about the quality of movies and participating in strange activities. I have found a group of film kids dressing up as pirates for no reason. If you like mainstream Hollywood cinema, then keep your mouth shut around them. Dancers have a New-York esque flair to them, and if they are male they are most likely flamboyant and homosexual. Not afraid to express themselves in any way. The most attractive women are found in dance, but their intelligence lacks. A lot. Design and Production students are like hardworking ants. Underground, straightforward, and sketchy. They work hard. They are technical geeks. They could build you a stage in a week. And they will not hesitate to tell you how busy they are. That's Uncsa students in a nutshell."
College Junior,2,"Cars Are Your Friend. while UNCSA has buses, they mainly take the high schoolers who live on campus to walmart once a week.  Cars are your friend for the most part.  The closest walmart is about 10 minutes away by car and off of a main road that is not bike friendly.  Most places are more than a few blocks away from campus so either have a car or make friends with someone who has one."
Junior,1,"This school is a scam. It is basically a for-profit institution where the administration is in it for themselves, and the professors privately acknowedgle the multiple issues with the film school on a creative, educational and personal level."
College Sophomore,1,UNCSA does not have a Greek life community.  If you wish to go to Greek parties and get involved with that you can go to Wake Forest College nearby.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have athletics at UNCSA.  Our mascot is the fighting pickle and there are no football teams or other sports teams available
Recent Alumnus,1,The UNCSA Police Department is a joke. They spend all of their time writing parking tickets instead of patrolling the areas where multiple students get mugged and assaulted.
Recent Alumnus,1,The dorms are absolutely disgusting and should be torn down and rebuilt
College Sophomore,1,"There are actually no sports on campus.  I think there might be inter murals for some things, but it's rare.  We are a very demanding school academically, and sports would make good grades near impossible.  Plus, it's an art school."
College Junior,1,Dont go to graduate school here if you want an education that supports you as an artist or critical thinker. Only sheep will do well here.

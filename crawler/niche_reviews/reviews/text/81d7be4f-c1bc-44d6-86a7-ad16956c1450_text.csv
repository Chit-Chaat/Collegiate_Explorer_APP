Junior,5,"Middle Tennessee State University has been very good to me. The staff is incredibly nice, the campus is beautiful, and the majority of the professors there want to see you succeed. There are of course a few bad apples in the bunch, but most of the professors I have had, have been very helpful and seem to love what they do!"
Junior,5,"I have taken several classes online and I personally love it. I believe each person's experience is different when it come to online courses, but for me it was exactly what I expected. Most of the online courses are self paced, as in you have a due date and you do your assignments within that time frame. You have to keep up with due dates though on your own, which can be hard, but it works out well for some people."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman at MTSU and so far I've been loving it! Both students and professors on campus are so nice and helpful so I've had no problems adjusting to college life here. Overall, I'd say this is a great college to go to and would definitely recommend it to everyone! Professors always have the students best interests in mind and will do all they can to help you pass."
Junior,5,Quick and Easy and i can get a lot done. Everything is simple and i love my teachers. They make things simple
Junior,5,"MTSU is a great choice to not only work towards a degree, but to be within a community that cares about your growth. There are plenty of opportunities to grow towards your career goals, but also to grow as a person. With so many extracurricular activities to do on campus, you will never get bored."
Junior,5,"Online courses at MTSU are some of the easiest online courses I've ever taken. The links always work, the professor can communicate with students easily, and it hardly ever crashes. When updates or down times are going to happen, the university notifies students and faculty at least 2-3 weeks ahead of time."
Freshman,5,I did not want to go at all until I toured it. I did not realize how good of a school it is. The academic oppurtunities that the school provides hooked me.
Freshman,5,I am a rising freshman so I do not know anything about the professors except the class size.  The class sizes seem to make it easier to ask your professor questions.
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, I have never felt more safe in any other environment besides my own home. Everyone is welcoming and is always nice when greeted with a question or any form of confusion. It is a beautiful campus which is taken care of year round. I wanted to leave home since I went to high school in Murfreesboro, but I love it here and im very happy I decided to do my undergrad here at MTSU."
Sophomore,5,"The only time I have had online learning with MTSU is when Covid-19 hit and we were forced to go off campus for our classes and while I am highly an in person learner, my focus did not leave any of my classes. The professors still made each lesson engaging and like we were still together in a classroom learning. Each professor I have had is very good with responding to emails as long as it was from my student email."
Niche User,5,They have been so helpful in the process of transferring from one college to the next! I am so grateful I have an opportunity at MTSU and becoming a blue raider!
Niche User,5,I have only just begun with MTSU and done my online orientation and have gotten set up with all the online programs. Overall it has been very helpful in the process and cant wait to learn more!
Sophomore,5,The size was perfect and felt like a little city of its own! All the gas station rest stops really helped me when I was needing a quick snack
Sophomore,5,It was really easy to use and the teachers were so nice about the situation. Overall the atmosphere is perfect for a college student
Junior,5,I've taken a lot of online classes with MTSU and even had classes shift from meeting on campus to online during the Coronavirus Pandemic. Even those professors who did not have experience teaching online classes learned and adapted very quickly to make for the best online learning experience possible.
Junior,5,MTSU is a great school with amazing aerospace and video/film production programs. The facilities on campus are perfect for the students and faculty is incredibly helpful and invested in student learning and quality of life.
Sophomore,5,I love online classes at MTSU they are extremely easy compared to the on campus classes. The professor are more helpful and more understanding if you are having trouble or need to catch up.
Sophomore,5,"MTSU has honestly been one of the best colleges i've been to.  It has many, many friendly people on campus, as well as great food choices and professors"
Junior,5,I love how hands on everything is in the theatre department and how they make sure you experience what its like to work in theatre and how to work as a team.
Senior,5,"The professors, campus, and experience is everything I wanted to endure. It was very easy to make friends and get involved here."
Senior,5,MTSU is what you make it. Your experience is based on the choices you make. I enjoyed MTSU. It was far enough from home but not too far. I made some great memories and met some good friends. MTSU  actually cares about their students.
Senior,5,"My online experience was great. I never had major issues with D2L (elearn) or pipeline. If there was an issue, it got fixed quickly."
Sophomore,5,"The academics and research opportunities are excellent. Professors legitimately care for the students and, in my experience, challenged themselves to provide the best digital format possible."
Senior,5,Amazing dedication to their students! The professors are determined to help student succeed. Would recommend!
Sophomore,5,"I love the academic part of MTSU. My professors have truly been such an advocate and an encourager for me. The worst part about MTSU would be the separation of it and college life. Everything on campus shuts off during the weekend and it has a very fitting reputation of being the ""suitcase college."" Meaning everyone goes home on the weekend and most people even commute."
Freshman,5,MTSU is a very fun and innovative community. I really found something in myself that i did not know i was capable of.
Senior,5,"Middle Tennessee State University offers 300 or more undergraduate and graduate degrees of study in diverse disciplines that prepare students for high demand jobs or careers.  MTSU has one of the best aerospace programs in the country.  MTSU offers six areas of concentration in the program.  There is Aviation Management, Aerospace Technology, Flight Dispatch, Maintenance Management, Professional pilot and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations. The MTSU  Aerospace faculty represents a wide range of experience and education. MTSU is like a close-knit community.  The buildings are all within the same vicinity. MTSU is located near downtown Murfreesboro enclosed in its own area.  It is also close to Nashville.  Also because all the buildings and dormitories are located close to each other, you see people you know everyday while walking to and from class.  I have met so many people from all over and have made life long friends. I love attending MTSU and would highly recommend it."
Senior,5,"I would be nowhere close to the person I am today without Middle Tennessee State University. From the students who all have insane passion to the professors who connect you to the groundskeeper who always offer a smile, the culture MTSU provides on unmatched in the area. The Princeton Review was right when they said that Middle Tennessee State University is a hidden gem."
Niche User,5,There are a lot of opportunities there and the staff are great people who really know what they are doing so you’re able to learn so much without a whole lot of stress.
Alum,5,"MTSU was a great university to attend. I was able to not only make friends, but also build networking relationships. The professors were thorough with assignments. MTSU helped prepared me for real world adversities."
Niche User,5,I have taken a few MTSU true blue tours and they are wonderful to attend. You learn a lot about the college. It has a ton of features that help students who go there. My family has all gone there and loved their student life as a blue raider. I will be attending there after I graduate this May and I am very happy to have chosen this university to study at.
Freshman,5,I like the diversity that the school has. The school has a lot of great programs. The professors are wonderful. I would refer this 4 year college to a lot of young people struggling to pick a college. The campus food is good and the environment is very safe. There are a lot of great things around the local area.
Sophomore,5,One of the best campuses around for academics especially medical majors such as nursing and athletic training and the music programs are great here too
Graduate Student,5,"Overall, I really enjoy being a student at MTSU. The experience is going to be what you make it, of course, but there are multiple avenues for getting connected to the campus and your peers. Graduate funding packages are also a plus."
Freshman,5,"As a first-year freshman, I truly believe Middle Tennessee is the best option for those wanting to pursue an education degree. At MTSU, there is a teaching program called MTeach. In this program, you learn how to develop lesson plans and have hands-on experiences in county school classrooms. The college as a whole is a great place to get your university."
Freshman,5,"Mtsu is amazing.  It’s like a big family. They always have events going on.  Excellent communication from administration , great teachers. The campus is big , but easy enough to get around. There are many options for food.  Safety is a  huge.  They have there own police department.  And the pilot program is amazing!  You can actually  fly in a plane , 10 minutes  from campus.  You will know from day one this is the place for you."
Niche User,5,"When i went to tour MTSU. I literally fell in love with the campus and the size of it. I loved the food and the feeling of being safe. Honestly, i am a very picky eater and the cafe had many difference  choices. I also liked the different dorms because I really like having a desk to work on. It is easier for me to work at a desk and stay focus then doing it on my bed because I will fall asleep.  In a nutshell, i really loved my experience at MTSU and I do plan on going to MTSU this fall."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is helpful and friendly! Scheduling classes are easy they offer so many classes online and on campus. On campus classes start at 8 all the way to 9 or 10 o’clock at night so it works for everyone. Professors are understanding and all admissions and signing up for classes is online. The campus is diverse and everyone is comfortable.
Sophomore,5,"I love attending MTSU. While it was originally my second choice for school, I am glad I ended up at MTSU. I am very happy here, more so than I would have been if I had gone to my top choice."
Niche User,5,The admissions office is extremely helpful. The environment is welcoming and the campus is adorable.
Junior,5,"Overall, my whole experience at MTSU is great I have a private apartment to myself and living on campus is easier for me to access sources from MTSU, there's a variety of food places to eat on campus, all sorts of entertainment to make things fun; such as, concerts, gaming, events, comedy shows, etc., access to free and updated programs and technology and I feel safe with on-campus police around 24/7.

However there are a few changes I would like for MTSU: 
- If its possible make more parking lots for off- campus students 
- The price of the meal plan is too high because it's not entirely helpful with its equivalence and how its has to be used certain times of the day. In addition, it cannot be used everyplace on campus
- update animation courses, it be great if there were equality with taking traditional and 3d animation classes"
Graduate Student,5,"Mtsu is amazing.  The school really supports students and the area offers many opportunities. The professors are helpful, available and supportive."
Sophomore,5,MTSU exceeded all its expectations. It made me feel like I'm home and I can't br more glad. I was very hesitant between MT and Lipscomb but MT was the one with the better finances. It is a free and big campus. I am in the honors program so I am in small classes with the great professors so if you can do honors do it. Good luck !
Niche User,5,"I love how inclusive the university is. The campus has so many opportunities for students and ensures that they feel safe and capable while pursuing their dreams. As well, it is kept very clean all throughout. Despite the high number of current students, it carries a small school feel. In comparison to others, it is laid-back and feels like home."
Junior,5,My experience at Middle Tennessee State University has over all been great. The staff is very helpful and willing to in time to help improve your grades or answer the questions I have.
Sophomore,5,MTSU is a great place to not only meet new friends but also to learn and excel in your field of study. I am currently in their business program and have really enjoyed everything about it.
Junior,5,The diversity and wide variety of opportunities for clubs and internships are amazing. There are many talented students I have met and professors that care and I have learned a plethora of skills from.
Niche User,5,I am not a student but I plan to be. I’ve heard nothing but good things about the school. MTSU has a very nice campus and some very good programs.
Senior,5,I love going to MTSU. This was the third school I went to and I am glad it is the place I ended up. Great teachers and great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
Freshman,5,"I am in my first semester at MTSU and, so far, it has been a great experience! I am receiving a wonderful education whilst meeting a diverse plethora of people. I am majoring in graphic design and I love MTSU's art department. What I also love about the college is that each area of campus is dedicated to one's liking, in terms of their major. To be specific there is a science area, an art gallery, and even a math section of the campus. Also, dorms are to be selected based on what classes are convenient for me and that is also great."
Junior,5,"I love the diversity and the whole community. it feels so welcoming, it has definitely helped me become the outgoing and educated person that I am today."
Freshman,5,Great and clean school. I enjoy the diverse environment and the amount of foreign students in most of my classes. My major will be easy to obtain because of the various opportunities they have in my field.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE this university. There are so many great aspects about MT! The education is wonderful, and you actually learn. The labs are truly really fun and make you get great hands on experience on what you learn about in lecture."
Niche User,5,"Upon visiting Middle Tennessee State University, I was immediately stunned post walking through the main doors. The campus is astonishing with beautiful scenery and buildings that aren't too far from each other, making it relatively simple to go from class to class. Our tour guide was a former student who attended Middle Tennessee and she expressed school spirit like no other. I am interested in taking Music Business as my major and attending some music production classes. We toured that area of the campus and once again, I was amazed. Their academics are through the roof and I am proud to say that Middle Tennessee State University has become one of my dream schools."
Freshman,5,So far my experience with Middle Tennessee State University has been nothing but excellent. The application process for both MTSU and MTSU School of Music  has been easy to fill-out and understand. The part of going to MTSU that I am most excited about is studying computer science because I am passionate about this field and am willing to put the work in to earn my degree. I am also very excited to join the band program offered at MTSU so I can further my education in music and help provide school spirit to other students. I am also excited in the many clubs and organizations offered my MTSU. I am hoping I can find one that closely related to my major so I can hopefully gain more experience that I would not find in a classroom setting. That is why I am excited to go to MTSU and finally for filling my dream to become a Blue Raider.
Freshman,5,I am in love with this school. All of my professors genuinely care about teaching and making sure you're educated. There are so many ways to feel at home on this campus.
Senior,5,"I earned my first bachelor's from MTSU and felt it has done me well. I am now earning my second bachelor's degree so I can be a child life specialist (A person who relieves stress and anxiety for children in the healthcare setting). Overall, I am thankful for MTSU and their professors who truly invest in their students. The food could always be better though ;)"
Sophomore,5,"Offer a wide variety of choices for a major, so there is something for everyone. Campus is lively, students are friendly, and professors and staff truly care about your success as a student and reaching your goals. Tons of resources at your fingertips geared towards student success.  Beautiful and well-kept facilities and many options for nutritious meals on campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus as well, which is an important factor when you spend most of your time walking in the open."
Niche User,5,"I will be attending for the first time in January 2020. I have a family friends who have already graduated and who are attending and have completely fell in love with the campus and the college environment it brings to each student. I have been to the campus countless number of times, and had my official tour a few months ago, and fell in love with it even more. The staff is super friendly and there are many ways to get involved. I am so excited to start this next journey of mine in January!"
Sophomore,5,"I honestly loved my first year at MTSU. Overall, it's a beautiful campus. The dorms are nice and the RAs are always willing to help. The school is equipped with many great professors who are willing to take time to help whenever it's needed. As far as student life is concerned, it is so much fun. MTSU is a very diverse campus with students from all over the world, so they try to have programs and events to make everyone feel included. There is also a huge musician campus, thanks mainly to the recording industry program. With me being a musician, it helped me make friends a lot easier."
Junior,4,"This is a good school overall. I like the atmosphere and the community. Some professors are better than others, but that is to be expected. In general, I think the food is decent depending on where you buy it from. The dorms are nice, but expensive. I feel like there is amazing diversity, but feel like it should be celebrated more. Academics depends on your major and the professors teaching it. It can definitely feel like they either want you to succeed or fail. Luckily, I have been blessed with more of them wanting to see me succeed. It is definitely challenging, but my hope is that it is rewarding."
Freshman,4,"My experience has been alright. Due to the pandemic it's really not much of anything to experience like I always thought i would but it's not their faults, so the experience is nice."
Freshman,4,"This semester, I took four classes. 3/4 are good; I mean in-class interaction is significant. However, I don't satisfy with my calculus class. I experienced many problems; class lessons couldn't be recorded in the first couple of days; my professor took a wrong micro of other class; class lessons (again) only recorded 10-15 minutes of class time, and my professor's voice is really hard to listen through his micro.  Web assignment couldn't read one answer on my test even though I made it right.  I was lucky because I took a picture of that answer and sent it to my professor because Web Assignment DIDN'T record that answer at all."
Freshman,4,"My experience with Middle Tennessee State University has been good so far. I'm an international student here, so I had many problems since I came here in March 2019, but I must say I  received a lot of help from Middle Tennessee State University. I always have responded in 24 hours from the international student department when I have questions. Besides that, I still remember the beginning of this fall semester when ""President Trump wants to send us back to our home country if we take 100% online-class"". My advisor and international student department gave me helpful instruction/advice to react to the new policy."
Freshman,4,"Half of my classes this semester has been online due to COVID-19. Overall, I'd say it's been pretty good. it can be a bit difficult to get used to the whole online situation and there may be a few problems such as examinity and zoom not working sometimes. But those are pretty rare and everything usually works properly."
Senior,4,All of the classes I’ve taken here at mtsu have been very easy to follow and I have been able to understand the material just as well as I would with in person classes
Senior,4,"Middle Tennessee State University has something for everybody, anyone would have a great experience here"
Junior,4,"I've only been attending MTSU for one semester, so I can't say I know much about everything it has to offer. However, I can say my experiences with the teachers and staff I've had so far have been encouraging and made me feel like MTSU was a good choice for continuing my education."
Junior,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed attending MTSU. I am currently in my third year at this university and it definitely feels like a safe environment to be in. Everyone there is always very willing to help assist anyone when you need it. I can't wait to finish my education here and create amazing memories."
Sophomore,4,"Middle Tennessee has truly risen among the ranks of universities. From start to finish, they try to make it as seamless as possible to attend and, eventually, graduate!"
Sophomore,4,"I became an online student due to COVID-19. That meant quite a bit of scrambling, but the professors pulled it together and tried their very best."
Junior,4,"MTSU is a great four year institution that welcomes any and everyone. They offer one of the biggest ranges of course studies in the state of Tennessee. If you enjoy meeting new people and networking his would also be the university for you. There are multiple resources to use such as peer mentoring, scholars academy, on campus tutoring, on campus therapist, on campus healthcare, and etc."
Freshman,4,There is a very good college experience feel to it. I love the football games with the band. And I love the opportunities anyone can have here.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve taken about 5 classes online. Due to Covid 19 it was a bit of an adjustment, but my professors were really flexible and understanding when we moved to the online platform. Learning online is just as good as learning in the classroom. You can still have simulated labs online and not worry about being late for class or anything like that. Some professors prefer live Zoom classes and others will post the lecture for you to watch and do home work along with it. Overall the online class structure at MTSU is advanced and allows opportunities for students that can’t make it to campus or be in a campus setting, but still get the full education they need."
Sophomore,4,"So far college life at Middle Tennessee State University has been a great experience. Their are plenty of people that are there to help you especially the first couple of weeks of each semester because they know freshman students are coming in. You can ask anyone for help around campus and they will gladly do it. The advisors are really helpful when it comes to picking classes, so if you ever feel lost just schedule an appointment and they can point you in the right direction. From the professors I’ve had they really are dedicated to their jobs and helping you learn, and the sooner you build a relationship with them the easier classes will go. Overall it’s been a great first year at MTSU and I’m looking forward to continuing my education there. College isn’t as scary as everyone makes it seem, so don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it."
Freshman,4,Middle Tennessee State University has been a great school so far! Positivity is everywhere and the school is very diverse! The support of each diverse group of students and faculties makes me feel welcomed and accepted!
Sophomore,4,"Some of the professors had great online courses, however a select few had very poor online courses(only power points)"
Junior,4,The hands on experience is very good. I love the faculty in the theatre department and the MTSU campus. This is a great school and the education you can get here is amazing and will take you far in life.
Sophomore,4,Many of the professors are good and are very helpful. A good place to learn and have many good experiences with many others.
Sophomore,4,"All of my classes transitioned to a digital format amid the pandemic. My professors tried very hard to maintain the standard of learning, but some classes, such as laboratory portions of science classes, did not translate very well."
Senior,4,I took the last two years of my degree online. The tools and structures were well thought out and enabled me to be successful. The materials were easy to understand and the discussion forums were easy to navigate.
Junior,4,"Do to a lot of changes as far as new teachers and administrators coming in, a lot of things are somewhat unorganized. I've had 3 different councils within the last three years. OneStop is so unorganized as far as who deals with what..."
Junior,4,"This school is so affordable! And not only is it affordable, the campus is nice as well. I feel safe there, and enjoy my classes. The only thing I would change is more/better parking, but so is the struggle of college life."
Sophomore,4,"Campus is large and provides plenty of opportunities to get involved and make friends. However, since it is mainly a commuter school, I'd say that there isn't a whole lot of school spirit and that does affect its ability to create a sense of community that you may get at a smaller school, or one that has a majority of its students living on campus. Many students are transfers from regional community colleges and are there to finish out their degrees, not necessarily to have a full university experience. That being said, it has a multitude of programs to choose from and is pretty good for the price."
Alum,4,College was the best four years of my life thus far. MTSU has a beautiful campus with lots of things to do for students. The education is great and most professors will do whatever needs to be done to help their students succeed.
Senior,4,MTSU is a great program for those in the sciences. All of the professors genuinely care about the students and there are many resources to make sure that you succeed.
Junior,4,MTSU is like its own small city. There are buildings for every major imaginable and people to fill them. There are always events happening on campus that either help the student academically or are designed to let us have fun and get to know each other. Only down side is there is a lot of people and parking can be a pain.
Freshman,4,"The college is a wonderful place with a cheap tuition and gorgeous, safe campus.  One of the main problems with the college is the Chem. department. The department is filled with professors who barely care and many students do not pass the first time taking a chemistry class, because the professors do not often care."
Freshman,4,"Middle Tennessee State University offers many majors and miners alike. The school has a lot of student diversity. There are multiple clubs and organizations available to help students help their community. But, the living quarters are ageing and I have noticed that most students live off-campus. There are not a lot of healthy eating choices on campus, but that is changing and the university introduced ""The Farmers Market"" which offer health choices of food for the facility, staff, and students. Overall the school has many great qualities to help future students achieve their goals at a cheaper cost."
Freshman,4,I LOVE Middle Tennessee State University. I transferred from the University of Alabama and I can confidently say its the best decision I have ever made.
Sophomore,4,"This school wasn't my first choice but I honestly love it here! School is affordable to the point where I've been able to pay for it by myself without having to ask my parents for help. There's a lot of diversity, too, so you won't have to worry about feeling alone. There's something for just about every type of person on campus. Academics vary by professor, but I suppose that's true for any academic institution."
Senior,4,"MTSU provides many free resources for students to be successful. The computer science department needs work, but the Jones College of Business is great."
Freshman,4,The only reason I don't give a 5 star rating is because I haven't had the full experience but I can tell this is a school that has put 110% into its students. they have gotten the same back giving it a world class influence via the successful students they nuture
Freshman,4,"Entering my second official semester at MTSU in the Aerospace program, and I genuinely like it. All of my teachers have been good and very helpful, and I love being around campus and the vibe I get from everything. I've lived within 20 minutes of MTSU my whole life, and I haven't gotten bored or tired of anything and don't believe I will."
Senior,4,"Campus quite big, helps that there are internal buses to get around. The REC instalations are awesome and included in the tuition! The library is very useful and convenient for those who do not have a computer or printer at home, or that simply like to work on a library instead."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is simple and easy to get around and the science building is top notch. The school has many opportunities for research and other activities. I must say it is one of the better schools in Tennessee and is underrated. It's a great school for the price with great professors. The transition to the school from high school is quite easy considering it took me only a couple days to figure out where things were. Parking kind of sucks and needs work, but other than that I would give the school a 7.6-10 rating."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed how hands on everything was, and how easily accessible things were. However some of the teachers were underwhelming in my opinion."
Freshman,4,"So far things have been okay, everyone’s been so welcoming and adjusting to the new environment wasn’t as stressful as I thought. There’s never a dull moment on campus, that’s for sure. Great school, good resources!"
Freshman,4,"Before I begin I would like to point out that I was not a fan of school. I made decent grades, despite my reluctance to get into it, and I resisted those who knew better than me, just because my stubborn nature dictated it. Be that as it may, I ended up needing help. Eventually, I was forced to reach out when my parents didn't have the answers necessary to power through the semester. That's when I realized this school's strong suit. Despite the graduation rate, professors are constantly looking out for the better to the students that come through. The sit down, work with you, and do their best to counsel those in need of answers. In one semester, I have created several connections. Even though the work load ahead is daunting, I feel confident in shooting an email and receiving all the information required to succeed in class. In short, I have nothing but hopeful, and excellent things to say about the school I attend."
Junior,4,"I love attending MTSU. The professors and students makes your college experience one to remember. I would recommend that they open/build more parking lots for the green pass permits, because the majority of people attending MTSU seem to have green parking passes and their parking lot is either on the out skirts of campus or 99% packed."
Sophomore,4,"Middle Tennessee is a great school and one that I have no regrets in committing to. Being a student-athlete, I can speak in a different light about my experience. Middle Tennessee cares about its students and you really feel the love when professors, coaches, and a good portion of students seek out to learn your name and actually remember them. I would not be where I am now without Middle Tennessee State University."
Niche User,4,"I have my cousin, and she in personal told me that the students in MTSU are so enthusiastic and keen to take any opportunity. But the college need to make new parking plots in fact of growing population!"
Freshman,4,I love the campus and most of the faculty. everybody is very friendly and open to helping you and others
Freshman,4,"I could not have asked for a better college experience. The teachers genuinely want their students to learn, and they make it easy to stay engaged. This campus is beautiful, and it is very easy to get around, even if you do not have a car. The food is decent, and they serve a variety of meals. I cannot imagine myself going to a different school. I love Middle Tennessee!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at MTSU has been really good, so far. The worst part is the parking, as it can be SUPER hard to find. My professor has been hard but I know he is only trying to ensure that we know the material well. All staff that I have encountered have been very helpful and willing to aid you in any way possible. Would recommend MTSU to anyone looking for a good school!"
Sophomore,4,"Middle Tennessee State University is such a tremendous institution. It is close to home, the tuition is not too expensive for in-state students, and it offers many majors. However, I believe that this school can broaden the majors more. I am looking into transferring next fall only because MTSU does not offer a dental hygienist program."
Niche User,4,I love the marching band. The school is very clean and organized.  It has just about any major or program you could imagine.  They let you rent things out and they have a ton of things available to you.  Be careful where you park because there are alot of places that are off limits to park.
Junior,4,Very nice campus with educated professors that very clearly care about their jobs and students. Campus is very diverse. Lots of opportunities that each program provides.
Freshman,4,So far I am loving college life. The campus is gorgeous and the staff is very friendly. Also my advisor is super helpful when I trying to schedule my classes. With so many options to choose from it is always nice to have help.
Freshman,4,I love this school. I love the fact that the classes are small so its easier to get to know people easier. I am a current freshman and I highly recommend this school if you love cool professors and fun classes.
Junior,4,"I have registered to start classes August 2019 to finish my career major in Mechatronics Engineering. I couldn't get housing on campus because they have a shortage compared to students, so I found a place near by. I registered for most of the classes I needed to continue my education for two more years. I am looking forward to starting classes next week."
Freshman,4,I liked the diversity within MTSU it won't be too hard to make friends and enage with diffrent racea that's what I liked the most
Senior,4,"My experience at Middle Tennessee State University has been a decent one. I went here thinking I knew exactly what I wanted for my future... That changed statically when I got to this campus. I live in a small town and I am very much a home body, do going to this huge campus that is almost an hour away from my friends and family was terrifying. However, I feel like I may have found a safe place here at MTSU."
Sophomore,4,"Altogether, MTSU is a great university, but there are several things about it that should change. They need more professors that actually cares about the students. Also, meal plans shouldn't costs as much as they do. Other than that, the atmosphere is great. The rec center is full of activities to do. There are always events and activities going on around campus."
Sophomore,4,"I really like all the programs MTSU has to offer. The professors are great and really care about the students. They encourage you to study abroad and help you find the best direction to go in the field your career is in. The food could be better though, the dining hall isn't the best. However, both food courts have great options, just wish the one in the KUC had better hours. Overall, I really like my experience so far and has made someone like me, being an out of state student, feel right at home."
Sophomore,4,"Middle Tennessee State University has such a friendly environment. Attending classes isn't as bad as long as you're putting in the effort, focused, and have the right reason why you're there. Professors want to help as much as they can as long as they see you're working hard in their class. Sports at MTSU is thrilling and is a great way to meet new people. Overall, Middle Tennessee is a great college to attend."
Junior,4,"I liked how when I went for CUSTOMS, the people were very friendly and helpful. We took a tour of the campus and we also registered for our classes. Some of us went to go get our IDs too. They also have a diverse group of students. In addition, they have different kinds of food too."
Freshman,4,Their Music Education program is exactly what I was looking for!! I have had great professors within my major classes and general education classes.
Alum,4,MTSU is a diverse community. The diversity is seen in not just its student population but also in the programs they offer.
Sophomore,4,"It's a friendly atmosphere, and while it is a big school, it doesn't feel that way when you're there.  It is easy to get comfortable and focus on your studies.  Many of the professors in the business college are great, and you can tell the ones in charge made good choices.  While the facilities aren't perfect, all the buildings are still good and they get the job done."
Junior,2,I always Have an issue with the school. Every Semester i have to go through too much for thing that are simple and i'm singled out.
Junior,2,"When Coronavirus hit, we were forced to move to an online platform of classes. This was a new experience for all of us, but it took some professors longer to adjust. I also believed it took away from the college experience as a whole. Although, they did their best to make the move to online smooth."
Niche User,2,"Middle Tennessee State University has worked hard with us as Dual- Enrollment Students. However the campus, Greek life, and party scene is not what you would expect for such a large school."
Freshman,2,Overall I never felt like I was wanted or welcomed here. They let me fall through the cracks. And the financial aid office did nothing to help me with my financial situation.
Niche User,2,"Middle Tennessee State University is dirty and not well taken care of. However, it is close to Nashville, which is a beautiful and fun city. "
College Freshman,2,drug use on campus is somewhat noticeable but often times labeled as not enough sleep
College Junior,2,MTSU in a word is mediocre. It feels very fake.
College Senior,2,I believe that MTSU should have more people attending football and basketball games. I have noticed that the school doesn't have alot of school spirit.
Recent Alumnus,2,I have heard stories of sexual harassment and assault by Greeks.
College Student,2,"It is really gross. Everyone is disgusting. But it is a dorm, so what do you expect. I recommend getting a private room if at all possible because the rooms really are small and I couldn't imagine living with another person in here."
College Sophomore,2,"there is always something happening on campus, but worse of all the student body is not told when something happens on campus until way after it was reported."
College Senior,2,"Online course selection is dismal. That wouldn't be a problem, except that there is only ever one section of any class above freshman-level courses, and they are all scheduled in the same time slots, so forget about working then around an office job. The college spends a ton of money renovating and putting in fancy touch screens, but refuses to hire more teaching staff. I don't know anyone who managed to actually graduate with a bachelor's degree in four years. I know many undergrads who have been at MTSU for eight years or more."
College Senior,2,"The campus lacks any kind of outdoor security cameras. Rapes and robberies are reported weekly. The student body's attitude toward sexual assault victims can be summed up as, ""Stop talking about it, liar. It was probably your fault."""
College Freshman,2,"Greek life her at MTSU can do good things for the community, but the overall social atmosphere sticks to the stereotypical plastic, cliquey identity mainstream media and culture claims it to be."
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough opportunity scholarships, most just academic"
College Senior,2,The good food choices are limited.  Also if you use the POD always check the expiration dates.  They do not check their shelves for expired food that needs to be thrown away.
College Freshman,2,I like the JUB and KUC and the STU food but for real McCallie's is the absolute worst. I really wish they had more fresh fruit because the apples suck and there's rarely ever bananas. It's super expensive for what we're paying for which is NOT GOOD FOOD. I just want someone to realize the quality of the food could be so much better with what money we're paying.
College Freshman,2,"It's so hard to meet people which I didn't expect living on campus, but people are super closed off and there aren't many opportunities within my dorm to meet a whole lot of people. There isn't really a sense of community at all."
College Freshman,2,"Although living on campus can help someone interact and make new friends, a disadvantage would be the cleanliness of others on the floor you live on. It may be clean one day, but some days it could be trashy."
College Freshman,2,They took forever to process all of my information! but when i called they immediately did it over the phone.
College Freshman,2,They don't have enough funds to provide scholarships for students who need and deserve them.
College Freshman,2,I can barely find scholarships or ways to earn them around campus. I have to pull loans every semester.
College Junior,2,It's really probably in your best interest to explore off-campus options.
College Junior,2,The structure of this school is less a democracy and more an bureaucratic dictatorship in many ways.
College Junior,2,"As with nearly all major universities, the surrounding areas are sketchy and overpriced."
College Junior,2,"I think the strictness in the dorms are very useless. There are quiet hours, every resident must sign every guest they bring in at the front desk and get a visitor's pass, the visitor can only visit at certain hours and for a certain length of time, the RA's and DA's can be very nosy when you have guests, there can only be a certain number of people in your room at once, no one can stay the night in your room unless they live in your building and it has been okay'd with the Area Coordinator. And gender does not matter, they will say no to girls staying in the room with girls as well as boys staying with boys. I think they are too strict on the students that live in the dorms and they expect the to act like adults, but they're treating them like naive children that can't take care of themselves."
College Freshman,2,It needs more for out-of-state people.
College Junior,2,"Okay this semester crime on campus has skyrocketed and I have no clue why. With that being said it mainly happens at night when you should already be in your dorm for the night. Your best bet is to not be flashy. Don't walk around with $100 as the smallest bill in your wallet (it does happen. I used to work in the KUC and twice I've had a customer hand me a $100 for a $4 sub), don't let people know how much money you have in your wallet, and keep your valuable items either close to you at all times or under lock and key."
College Senior,2,I was not allowed to apply because I am independent and under 24
College Junior,2,"Overall, I've struggled to adapt to a school where few people know what's going on and few people are willing to help a student navigate the rather complex school heirarchy.  The one exception has been the office of graduate students. They've been fantastic about answering my questions and helping me find solutions."
College Junior,2,I am not impressed by the course work I am asked to complete.  The rigor and applicability is low.
College Junior,2,The office of teacher licensing is unorganized and unhelpful.  The staff is unwilling to answer question and respond indignantly to requests for information.  I felt like I needed to start slipping bribes across the counter in order to get anything accomplished.
College Senior,2,They make it way more complicated than it should be. My first year they told me I needed to take a loan out so I did and I found out later that I was fine without it. I was so angry because that was unneeded debt. They don't offer very many scholarships.
College Senior,2,"There are two new parking garages, but parking is still horrible."
College Junior,2,"Apartments near campus tend to be unsafe, they are usually about 400 dollars a person, and the convenience is usually pretty decent."
College Sophomore,2,"The town feels cluttered and unbearable at times. There is so much traffic all of the time, and not much scenery."
College Sophomore,2,There is often some sort of crime occurring on campus at nighttime. I do not feel safe walking to my car in the dark.
College Junior,2,I am not into drugs or alcohol so I notice the scene easy
College Junior,2,Long distance transportation for students who live far away is expensive and time consuming
College Senior,2,Very far. Busses don't always get to places on time
College Sophomore,2,coming from a city its bad!!
College Sophomore,2,Grab your rain boots ASAP!!
College Freshman,2,"The amount of very strict policies on campus is pretty ridiculous. I guess it's all good for the university and the people in charge, but for us students, it's just insane."
College Freshman,2,"While the campus is great for walking on because it is flat and you do not have to hike up any hills or stairs, when it rains, the sidewalks flood."
College Junior,2,SO many people drink. They even bring it on to campus. I don't think MTSU even cares.
College Junior,2,We had a rule about smoking on campus and how it was not going to be tolerated under any circumstances. It has not been enforced and keeps getting worse.
College Freshman,2,MTSU has a strict  policy on drugs and alcohol so it is nearly rare to see such on campus.
College Freshman,2,Scholarship money i believe is very complicated to apply for.
College Freshman,2,really cold walking across campus
College Junior,2,Big campus + single digit days = shoot me.
College Student,2,"Parking is available, but always taken."
College Freshman,2,I don't like Greek life. I feel like it's just paying to make friends. I can make friends on my own. It's nothing but a popularity contest and party throwing atmosphere. 
College Sophomore,2,No one really takes part in campus events and it hurts the charisma of the game.
College Sophomore,2,Parking is bad if you aim too high. Be prepared to walk. Parking permits are included in tuition. 
College Sophomore,2,The campus shuttle is okay unless you're already late. Sometimes you have to wait a while. 
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is okay! If it rains just a little, the whole campus is flooded. Get rainboots!"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at MTSU is AWFUL. They recently added two new parking garages, which helped alleviate some of the pain in finding a spot but it is still difficult to find a spot. I had to get to school at 9:15am for my 10:20am class last semester if I wanted to get a reasonable spot. Otherwise I would have to had walked 15 minutes to class and then up 4 floors..."
College Junior,2,Many students take prescription drugs to enhance their studying. 
College Junior,2,I live off campus and a lot of crime takes places where I live. 
College Senior,2,"Parking is one of the few downfalls at this university.  It is the bane of many students because all of the close spaces fill up quickly, sometimes causing visual displays of anger among drivers. Parking inspectors seem to be in top form, but I am fortunate to have never been ticketed.  "
Senior,1,"You wanna know the real secret? It's not safe. Don't go here if you are a young lady. I personally have been harassed and followed to my car on several occasions Yep it's got great ""Diversity"" but contact public safety and give them a description of someone who yells and grabs at you while walking to your car at night and they say it's culturally insensitive to tell you their skin color. It's a description to help you find the predator. 
I transferred in, made A's and B's most of my college career. Got here, C's. No matter what I did. C's. The professors don't want to be here, there are few that give a d about you. 
If you are a good student go somewhere else. There's plenty of options in Nashville."
Freshman,1,I had teachers who didn't care that their students had other courses that they were taking or maybe had to work while going to school. The teachers didn't work well with their students and the advisers didn't know what they were talking about. Teachers were very verbal about their own self views and would treat students poorly if they disagreed with them.
Freshman,1,"To be blunt, MTSU is not a good school. The classes are crazy easy and the professors basically hand you a good grade for minimal effort. With that being said, you basically are not required to learn very much. The professors are not very good and often time have unimpressive experience in their field. When I was at MTSU I was majoring in Music Business. After I discover that MTSU had fibbed on their job placement statistic (only 1 of my many friends have found a job in the industry), I decided I was going to double major. When I brought this up with my advisor I was told that I shouldn't because I would bring down the university's percentage for students who graduate in 4 years. In addition to all this, Murfreesboro is a small town with very little to do and traffic to Nashville is a nightmare. MTSU is not worth it. It isn't even ranked and this could make it difficult to find a job upon graduating. There are much better schools out there for what you want to do."
College Junior,1,Some of the dorms are disgusting and 100 years old
College Student,1,No one really cares. People don't go to a lot of the games. Literally no one goes to the football games.
College Junior,1,"Probably the worst Greek life I've experienced, most frat and sorority girls and boys only associate with other greek life people and push out everybody else. Seems like most are still stuck in the high school mentality."
College Senior,1,"Study areas outside the library, where they exist, are noisy open spaces. MTSU also has a ""look busy"" culture. Being seen studying is more important than actual studying. The preferred study style is group study, and the cultural narrative at MTSU is that group study works best for everyone, even if it actually results in poorer grades."
College Senior,1,"One word: Don't.

MTSU has several systemic cultural problems. I have yet to meet a staff member who will not cheerfully pretend it doesn't. No one, except members of the student body, will acknowledge that this place need change worse than last week's socks.

Before I started at MTSU, I often heard it referred to as ""the 13th grade."" I would place it more in the area of the 7th-and-a-halfth grade. Cliques abound and gossip is plentiful. Diversity is tolerated only on paper, and the kind you wipe your you-know-what with at that. At MTSU, there is One Correct Way to Be, and One True Way to Learn. Anything else is wrong, invalid, and must be shunned, erased, driven out. As the saying goes, ""The nail that sticks out must be driven down.""

Further, although this is not a religious institution, Christian culture permeates everything. Religious debate arises in every class discussion I've ever been part of. Certain instructors have no problems with the teaching of outright lies. Volunteer opportunities? Hope you like church groups. Bible quotes even adorn the walls of the so-called Science Building. 

Care to report a problem? Rape, robbery, vandalism, discrimination, ADA non-compliance? LOL, just kidding. MTSU has no problems. You must be mistaken.

Even the course evaluation surveys given at the end of every semester are biased, weighted such that all positive responses are on one side of the form.

Run. Run fast, far away, and in literally any other direction.

But, if you insist on going to MTSU, do yourself a favor and only take professors who don't have tenure yet."
College Sophomore,1,Its hard to get any answers concerning financial aid
College Junior,1,"I don't feel safe anywhere on campus once the sun starts going down. There is too many crimes on and near campus, and campus police doesn't patrol as frequently. Even when they do, they don't actually look around. They pretty much just ride around in circles when they patrol. The campus and parking areas are very poorly lit and a perfect place for someone to get hurt, robbed, or sexually assaulted. I think they should spend more time and money worrying about the safety of their students, than the cost of tuition."
College Junior,1,"The dorms are very strict and it's like they treat you like you're incapable of taking care of yourself or having common sense. The AC's, DA's, and RA's monitor your every move and often question your whereabouts. The computer labs inside the dorms are very poor. There aren't enough computers, and they are in a cramped room with little to no space for you to do your work. They can also be very loud at times. Not all of the computers work most of the time and you can only print a certain amount of items and you must bring your own paper. I feel like every computer lab should already be stocked and equipped for students."
College Senior,1,MTSU never closes even if it's tornado warnings/watches or it's hailing. They're always open and it's very dangerous.
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the on-campus parking is reserved for faculty, and there are not many spots otherwise so they fill up quickly.  Off campus parking can be far away."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is overwhelming. Almost every girl is in a sorority and parties, making the girls who aren't feel out of the loop. However I would never join."
College Sophomore,1,"Students do drugs constantly it is very disturbing. More so behind the securities back, but still very prevalent."
College Sophomore,1,make sure you have all paperwork even copies
College Freshman,1,I don't know about the nightlife because I don't go out and party.
College Junior,1,"Since they have taken out so many trees, there is nowhere to hide really. The campus floods and if you don't have rain boots or a rain jacket, you will get soaked."
College Freshman,1,"The only bad thing I can say about MTSU is the parking. That is why I live on campus. I don't really have to worry about parking since I live in dorms. But there has been a few times when I had to go to the doctor or take my brother to school and then came back for classes and by 8:00, there aren't any parking spots. It's outrageous. I had to park on the opposite side of campus and take a bus to my dorm. I wish there were more parking availability on campus. They just built two parking garages which is good, but they fill up fast, too. I think students should just live on campus."
College Sophomore,1,Its pretty annoying to deal with the campus police as much as I have to as a Vice President of my fraternity. 
College Sophomore,1,I pay more in parking tickets than I do in tuition. Living on greek row I have a gold pass that is only allowed to park on the greek row lot. The greek row area is on the polar opposite of campus where there are not any buildings and we are constantly pestered by parking officers.
College Junior,1,Tickets and fines are outrageous and occur often. The availability of parking sports is not near enough than what it should be. 
College Freshman,1,Tennessee weather is unreliable and everywhere. Never predictable.
College Junior,1,when it rains it floods really bad
College Junior,1,MTSU turns into a lake when it rains. There are so many low spots around campus that all seem to come together when it rains. It's awful! 
College Student,1,"If you live on campus, you'll feel like you move away from mom and dad so the university can be your mom and dad... Police are only relaxed about drinking on campus during tailgate and they turn a blind eye to underage drinking in that situation.."
College Student,1,People on campus say greek students account for 3% of the school. The get a bad reputation but there are respectable fraternities and sororities on campus.
College Student,1,There are never enough parking spots. You'll wind up spending alot of time looking for a space if you don't live on campus.
College Student,1,Everyone tailgates - no one goes to the games.
College Senior,1,"There are no cool bars, no cafes.  The town only has frat dives, small venues, and trashy clubs.  The local spots aren't stylish or contemporary at all.  The campus is dry, so concerts on campus are unpopular with 93% of the student body."
Recent Alumnus,1,Hardly no parking. I have often missed class for parking.
College Junior,1,The parking situation at MTSU is terrifying. In order to get a spot you have to be there for at least half an hour waiting to see if another student leaves and you have to be alert so no one else takes the spots that are being disoccupied. They are building parking garages so that will improve the situation although they are bad walking distances to my classes
College Junior,1,"In murfreesboro,TN, it rains all the time!! And when it rains, it floods!"
College Sophomore,1,"Weather is decent. It is frigid in the winter, and blazing in the summer. You also have to watch out for all the tornados!"
College Junior,1,I'm a transfer student but seriously this place is as hard as elementary school. It's terrible if you actually want to learn.
College Sophomore,1,All students at MTSU have figured out by now that the parking is terrible. There seem to be plenty of available areas with parking passes but you have to find them and they are not always convenient. Also there is a minor confusion about time availability parking but everyone gets it wrong. Its supposed to be that the rules dont apply after a certain time of day but not many know the exact time. They are making improvements by adding the new parking garages to the school so all this trouble could be said and done. However standards are deserving of a D right now.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible, but a new parking garage is being built, so this will change shortly."
College Junior,1,The financial aid office workers are rather rude and you probably won't get any attention beyond them informing you how to apply for government aid like Fafsa.
College Junior,1,The parking sucks big time.  My classes are all in one general area so I like to part in that area but I have to arrive over an hour before classes start to even hope to get a decent spot where I don't have to hike a mile or so.
College Sophomore,1,Parking at MTSU is a nightmare. I rod my bike the majority of my freshman year but during my sophomore year I needed to drive because I had moved. There is little to no parking near campus the closet lot is nearly a half mile away from the main campus.  The passes are free but the students get the worse of the parking. Greek housing and staff both have special parking which I see as somewhat unfair. The campus also offers buses from the parking lots in the middle of no where but it takes almost 15 minutes for it to pick you up and usually it is so full that you're either standing or body to body with a stranger.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is a complete hassle and a joke. I am from out of state so the scholarships are scarce.
College Freshman,1,The parking lots are always full and I see many tickets when i walk past cars but it doesn't look like the cars are in trouble.
College Sophomore,1,Parking for students is completely ridiculous. Lots are always closed for construction and events so there is often little to no parking. The lots left open are a 20 to 25 minute walk or bus ride away and bus system is incredibly unreliable.
College Sophomore,1,The only way I can find a parking spot is if you stalk someone with you're car as they're walking to their car. It's very bad.
College Freshman,1,its hard to park on campus and the bus takes for ever.
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly, unless you're in a super safe apartment surrounded with gates and such you will most likely NOT BE SAFE. I lived off-campus for the first time this year in Raider's Crossing and I was promised a safe living environment where crimes are unheard, BUT so far I have already had my bike stolen off the bike rack as well as our apartment broken into over this winter break, My roomates had their tvs and laptops stolen. They broke down the front door and our room doors. The apartment fixed the damage but as for the stolen items they cannot do anything about it and I'm not so sure what the polic will do about it yet either. In all, DO NOT LIVE OFF CAMPUS UNLESS IT IS SUPER SAFE. It's a big risk. I never thought this would happen to me, but it did, and it can happen to you too. If I could have changed anything I would have chosen to live in a dorm where it's probably less likely that someone can break down the door since it isn't made out of some weak wood. But on campus apartments are horrible and un-safe too as well as all the bike racks on campus so don't leave them out at night. People are thiefs and poor and will do anything to get money."
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus can be very difficult. Anyone who wants to park on campus needs to get on campus 30 minutes prior before their class starts. If not they will not find a decent parking space. They would have to park very far away and have to walk very far to get to their classes. As being a freshman I do not have a car but I know the parking is difficult because I have friends who can never find a parking space.
College Junior,1,"There is a large selection, the new Student Union building is amazing. Everything is WAY over priced. It shouldn't cost $10 for a 6"" at Subway. The Chick fil-a people were really rude, but seem to show improvement."
College Junior,1,"Students pay to attend the school, they should be allowed to smoke a cigarette. We cannot park at the library without getting ticketed. If your destination is less than 2 miles form your destination you are lucky because all the parking is reserved for staff!"
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, I have yet to see much of Greek life. All I've seen are Greek t-shirts."
College Sophomore,1,I hated living on campus my freshman year. It feels like jail. The meal plans are disgusting. It is a horrible and boring experience and definitely not worth the money. They are so strict so they completely prevent you from having any fun. I do not recommend it.
College Junior,1,The parking sucks. It would be better to walk or ride a bike.
College Sophomore,1,"No Space – Parking is worse than it ever has been. Taking away two major parking lots to spend Forever building parking garages that will not add to the beauty of the campus is not a good idea.  Tickets are not that bad, but they are known for following people around waiting for you to walk away so they can get your tag number. Good luck finding parking past 9 AM.  Be prepared for cars to follow you to your car trying to get your spot, and give yourself more than enough time to find a spot and walk to class."
College Sophomore,1,I Dont Like This Part – I didn't really like how they handled the process. They didn't help me as much as they could. I had to figure out things on my own or with current students help. It was a stressful situation.
College Junior,1,"Slow and Lose Paperwork Often. I got no financial aid from MTSU. The process was slow and all aid was gone before they even processed my information. Everything about MTSU is slow, especially the admissions."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Strict at All! MTSU is not strict at all. It should BE more strict. I remember one time a few years ago that USED hypodermic needles were planted in the vending machines so that when you went to grab your snack or drink, you got stabbed. Also, there have been many on-campus robberies and the like. The police force should be more strict and more actively involved in preventing these crimes. Additionally, the acceptance rates should be lowered and it should be more difficult to get into the school. If you have felonies on your record, maybe you shouldn't be able to go right to college without a rehabilitation program or something to help ensure good behavior."
College Sophomore,1,The weather is bipolar. It does not know if it wants to be hot or cold.
College Junior,1,"Parking wouldn't be bad if there wasn't so much construction at Middle Tennessee State University. Building two parking garages will be beneficial, but at the same time is ridiculious. Plus, the university has changed some student parkings to faculty parking only, which is worse for the students. Students typically have to park off-campus to get to class on time, so students need to arrive at least 30 minutes before their classes start."
College Freshman,1,There are not many good food places around MTSU. We mostly have pizza restaurants and fast food. There isn't any good all-american food places.
College Sophomore,1,Availabilityand Convenience – Parking on campus is a rising problem at MTSU. There is not enough on campus parking for students. As the student body grows more adn more restrictions are being placed on campus parking. In order to ensure a resonable spot you must arrive to schoool before 8am. If you arrive after this time you will be forced to park off campus and take a bus.

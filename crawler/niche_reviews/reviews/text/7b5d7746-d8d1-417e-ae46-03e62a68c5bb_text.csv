Freshman,5,I like how Chipola College is very small and family oriented. If you are not into going to parties then Chipola is your college. The only thing I would change about Chipola is making parking more accessible because you have to get to class at least 20 minutes early to get a decent spot.
Sophomore,5,Overall Chipola is a great college and i don't really have any negative things to say about it. The professors are all really helpful and actually interested in what the students have to say which you don't see very much anymore.
Freshman,5,Chipola is a great environment for all students. Small classes make one on one learning easier and more accessible. All the classes and professors are exceptional. Definitely recommend Chipola College to students who are considering their options.
Junior,5,"My experience at Chipola College was beneficial and worthwhile. The professors showed me that they had my education in their best interest and would go above and beyond to help if one is willing to put in the effort to excel. Chipola College itself stands for success through their Ace Lab program that helps students succeed by providing free tutoring sessions, class reviews, and a nice spot to engage in group projects. In addition, the library is another great place to study, which provides computers, individual cubicles for privacy, and best of all silence. Overall, my time at Chipola helped me to grow and develop tremendously in my studies."
Sophomore,5,Chipola college is awesome! I love learning at a college where the professors actually know your name and can give you one-on-one help.
Sophomore,5,This is a truly great school. This is less than half the cost of most 4 year universities. It seems like the professors here genuinely want their students to succeed. The ACE Lab has free internet and tutoring services that make a huge difference in my test scores!
Niche User,5,"I am a dual-enrollment student here, and I thoroughly enjoy this college a lot more than my high school. It is so calm and peaceful. So far, my professors have been amazing, helpful, and full of personality which I love. They treat everyone with respect and are aware of how many dual-enrollment students attend this college. It allows a lot of highschoolers and college students to do more with their academics despite their financial background."

Sophomore,5,"Affordable, easy access, and the professors are wonderful. They actually enjoy students who are eager to learn and work to make sure students are successful.  Courses are offered at convenient times. Administrators, counselors, and staff are equally great at promoting the success of their students. I have attended Chipola full time for two years now, including 3 online courses, and I absolutely LOVE it. I live 45 minutes away and my academic advisor worked with me to schedule all my classes for the same two days per week so I wouldn't have to make the drive every day. WONDERFUL school!!"
Sophomore,5,I have gone to Chipola for almost two years now and I have nothing bad to say. The teachers are always kind and the material is well explained.
Alum,5,I was on a softball scholarship at Chipola College. Dorms on campus are only for athletes. I loved my classes and professors and I learned a lot throughout my time there.
Sophomore,5,All of the staff work very hard to help in any way they can and the teachers put in much effort and care into their work for the students to succeed.
Recent Alumnus,5,The class sizes are the one the best parts being so small that it is easy to raise a hand get help with the professor right away instead of struggling with material and not knowing what to do when doing homework. The professors really care for your well being and want to see you succeed.
College Junior,5,Chipola College has many different times and teachers available for most classes. It is very easy and convenient to schedule my classes around work and my daily life.

Many of these colleges also come to the school to recruit students for their school. Chipola College prepares its students to move forward in their educational career."
College Junior,5,"Being a pharmacy major at Chipola College has been a great experience. There are other students at Chipola that are Pharmacy Majors and help offer guidance as they go through the process of transferring to a graduate program. Also, the Ace lab is a great place to go to get advice for any major. Mrs. Smith helps any student that comes to her for advice. The workload for my major is  a lot; however, a student can do it with dedication and hard work."

Sophomore,4,I enjoy being able to take all of my BSN classes online. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the fact that Chipola does not honor the tuition waivers for state workers when it comes to online classes. Unfortunately all BSN classes are online.

College Sophomore,4,Chipola College is a small school which makes your relationship with teachers and peers unique. Professors know you by your first name and give you undivided attention.
College Sophomore,4,Chipola puts a lot of efforts into making college fun filled and provide a good education setting.
College Sophomore,4,The computer system is exceptional.
Recent Alumnus,4,The administration has been wonderful with transferring my information to the next school.  My advisors have been great with helping me enroll in the correct classes.  The instructors are great with students needing to leave class or the not attend for various reasons.
Recent Alumnus,4,My advisors have been very instrumental in helping me with my schedule to ensure that I have the right classes that will transfer with the degree I am pursuing.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Chipola is a mix of high school, college and adults.  It is a good mix that allows the younger generation to learn from the more life experienced people.  Mature people teach and guide the younger people in more ways than just school."
College Freshman,4,"Chipola College has went out of there way to introduce me to Chipola. The navigation has been great and I am always available to view my grades at any time I would like. The teachers are always there to help you and they have FREE tutoring here! I did not give an A plus, because the parking is not a plus."
College Sophomore,4,The student body is great.  Most of the students are recent graduates.  I enjoy my classes and the individuals that share my academic study.

College Junior,4,"I haven't had any problems with the wireless or network. D2L can sometimes be glitchy, but that's not really something they can help. I like to have my own computer but it isn't necessary. Wireless is in all the buildings."
College Junior,4,The College is small enough that you can walk to all your classes. They also have great customer service in the book store.
College Junior,4,"My daughter who is currently attending the Chipola, has a teacher whom is helping her find a job. For myself I haven't had anyone to help at all."
Recent Alumnus,4,The education I am receiving at Chipola College is a good one.  I will always think some fees are overpriced but nothing of value comes free.  The finanical aid office is extremely helpful with any questions that may arrise.
College Freshman,2,Online courses are not calibrated to the student. A general course is given and the teachers/monitors only want to here there opinions on the material.
College Freshman,2,There is little alumni and the career center isn't the best.
Recent Alumnus,2,Like I've mentioned in a earlier statement the resources are very limited at a smaller school such as mine so job/internships and networking is very rare.
College Sophomore,2,Chipola has recently made it to where you can not receive funds from federal student loans. After high school I did not apply for financial aid and still as an adult can not receive the Pell Grant. Going to college paying as I can is very hard. I am working two jobs one full time and one part time. I can barely afford the cost of living and without a college degree I will never be able to move up in society. Without the possibility of a federal student loan I will continue to take one class at a time which is not beneficial.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know much, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen."
College Junior,2,I attended a few other colleges before transferring to Chipola. So far Chipola has been very frustrating getting my correct class that I had attended. They also love to put you on suspension for having too many credits. That should not be a bad thing if you are making good grades.
College Senior,2,Not Much Variety – The college is set in a small town and therefore hardly has any variety. The majority of the student population is made up of people from the area.
College Sophomore,2,"My Experience – I love my school for the most part.
Only two things I would change is, the parking and the way the nursing program is set up with pre-reqs. It has changed twice since i have been going."
Recent Alumnus,1,Being a junior college it is hard for networking and there very few degrees offered at my college so very few alumni. Most big time job recruiters do not recruit out of this college.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid at chipola college is not very helpful. It has been a very stressful and long process for me

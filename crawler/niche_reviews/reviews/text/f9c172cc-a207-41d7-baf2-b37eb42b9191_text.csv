Alum,5,"Loved the sense of community and abundant opportunities if you apply yourself- however, some administrative difficulties"
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience at WSU has been really good. The professors were really helpful with this.
Freshman,5,"Westfield State has changed my life, especially the Urban Education Program. I love it here. I am an on campus tour guide now and am part of the Honors Program and two Honors societies: The National Success and Leadership Society and Alpha Lambda Delta. I am Co-President of our Multicultural Association. It’s an opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion on campus, not only regarding race, but people with different abilities, social classes, mental states, shapes and sizes as well! I am part of SEAM which is the Student Education Association of Massachusetts and I've made it on the Dean's List. I've been able to accomplish so much and can't wait to see what's next to come."
Freshman,5,"The student life is amazing and it really helps you branch out and meet all kinds of new people! I really like how you can pick how you want to take your classes, if you prefer online or in a small class setting or in a lecture setting. They really have opportunities for everyone and is suited to your needs and how you learn best."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy attending Westfield State University. I have learned a lot in my chosen major during my time there. So far, I have had a generally positive experience with my professors. Westfield State University is about 25 minutes away from where I live, so I commute."
Freshman,5,I would like to see them change the school lunch. The dorms are nice at first I wanted to transfer but I’m going to finish the semester. It’s hard to go places if you don’t have a car.
Senior,5,westfield state university has been an overall great experience. I got involved with sports early and it really jump-started the good times. Classes awesome because most teachers really can interact with the class. I constanlty feel engaged in my on-campus classes.
Sophomore,5,Westfield State University has a beautiful campus and a tight-knit community. The classes are nice and they do a good job of keeping the atmosphere fun
Sophomore,5,"It is a medium sized beautiful campus with an amazing picturesque view of the mountains. Class sizes are small, major opportunities are endless, professors are well educated and involved. Theres so much to do on campus and so much inclusivity."
Sophomore,5,"It is a small campus, giving every student an opportunity to become a part of a family. Westfield State University is its own wonderful community. The staff, administration and students do everything they can to be welcoming and loving to each other. It is definitely a home away from home, seeing as though I am from Boston."
Senior,5,I loved Westfield State. I did cheerleading here and it was a great opportunity to meet new people and stay involved. The people are great and the professors are personable and helpful.
Junior,5,"WSU is an amazing university for every student regardless of their nationality. As diversity is highly encouraged. The school offers a nurturing and safe place for the students. The classroom size is perfect for individuals who prefer smaller classrooms. Also, the classroom size gives students the opportunity to get to know their professors and have a closer relationship with them."
Graduate Student,5,Happy and proud to have attended Westfield State University in my hometown. It has been an amazing experience earning my Bachelors. I am beyond excited to be in the first class to attend the new Physicans Assistant Program starting January 2018.
Sophomore,5,"Westfield is great. The environment is just amazing, everyone is so friendly, it is really a great place to be. I love living there and I am so excited to go back in less than a week. It is not too big of a campus but also not small; you wont get lost in a crowd but you also won't know everyone. The community is great too. Lots of students give back to the community which is just a wonderful thing to be a part of or even just to observe."
Sophomore,5,Westfield captures the essence of both a large and small school. It is a great place to continue an education and get the college experience. It is a big commuter school so the opportunities are equal for residential and nonresidential students.
Alum,5,Westfield is what you make of it. I had an amazing time and learned a lot. I committed myself and put myself out there. Only by experiencing foreign situations and you really experience yourself!
Sophomore,5,"When I was in high school, it was a lot of students and not many professors to give you the attention that I needed. As I am now in my second year of college, I love the small class sizes and the education that I am getting now is helping me be a better person for my future. I have a very positive experience here, because of my professors and the friends that I have gained. I love this campus and everything about Westfield has led me to be a better person for shaping my future."
Sophomore,5,"I currently attend Westfield State University and it is by far the best thing that has ever happened to me.  The people are so nice, I have not met one mean person there.  The teachers are phenomenal and the teachers really care about their students education.  The clubs and sports I recommend checking out because they are a blast and you meet a lot of new friends and get connected to the university immediately."
Junior,5,I like Westfield State University because it is a small campus and all the professors are friendly and helpful. Every professor wants to see you succeed and will help you reach that goal.
Niche User,5,I had a great experience with Westfield State. I took a tour at their college and came out of it with lots of knowledge on the school.
College Junior,5,Everyone is very supportive of all at my school
College Freshman,5,The education program is extremely helpful and hands-on. It is why I came to the school.
College Freshman,5,Its a great school if you get involved and make the best of your college experience. It has really great and helpful education and criminal justice program. The area is beautiful
College Sophomore,5,I've had a great time so far. I am really happy with my choice and I would do it again!
College Junior,5,"The majors prepare you for getting an internship/job right out of school. Whether you are required to observe, do clinical, or do an internship for a class, many majors require this so that you have those networking tools right away."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Westfield! The people are welcoming and the professors are terrific!
College Junior,5,It's a really good school that follow rules
College Freshman,5,"Campus housing is great! The maintainers work hard to make the dorms look nice. My section in my dorm is noisy and smells of drugs, but other than that everything is super nice. The housing process was easy, and it seemed easier to have a dorm and roommate already chosen than to go random."
College Freshman,5,"I love it here! Some days I find myself rethinking choices I made, but choosing where I wanted to go to college is not one of them."
College Freshman,5,there is so much variety for places to go and it's all within 15-20 minutes!
College Senior,5,"I feel like Westfield is just an awesome school, when you walk across campus its small enough where you are bound to know someone but it is big enough where you will not know the majority of people you see. You'll meet someone new everyday."
College Senior,5,"I love being a communication major, the staff, the students, the program is just outstanding. They help you like no other. If you get the chance, take a class or two with Professor Gardner."
College Sophomore,5,Education is a really confusing major with so many things the state wants and needs however the staff are great at attending to what you need to do and when. However you need to keep up also. I would definitely recommend here for Education majors as they set you up in schools for observation hours and ultimately help with jobs. They always know what you need to do even when you have no clue and help you get there.
College Junior,5,Love being in my major.
College Sophomore,5,The dining hall is very spacious and has very good menus.
College Sophomore,5,The local weather does not affect the campus
College Sophomore,5,I plan to have an intership this summer.
College Sophomore,5,I am very satisfied with the program.  My career goals are to as soon as I receive my bachelor in Social Work to start working in the DCF.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that the Social Work where the classes are held is a small building, the curriculum is great."
College Sophomore,5,Campus police are very active.
College Sophomore,5,My experience with the financial aid process was the best.
College Freshman,5,Art major is awesome. All professors are friendly.
College Freshman,5,Always prompt and on time.
College Student,5,the computers at school farely new printers are every were
College Student,5,i thought the rooms were bright and clean the outside is very nice
College Freshman,5,"I personally love Massachusetts weather, but I also enjoy colder temperatures. We had an unusually long winter this year though."
College Freshman,5,"Here at WSU, we accept all kinds. Every gender, sexual orientation, and religion."
College Freshman,5,I filled out my FAFSA and the school took care of the rest. Very easy and I got all the aid that I needed.
College Freshman,5,"I have only noticed a few students that look like they may have been hung over or maybe had smoked some marijuana, but I have not noticed any signs of a serious problem. Campus feels very safe and secure."
College Freshman,5,I'm an education major and Westfield is known for that department...it used to only be an education so I think the major is great. A lot of students here also major in Criminal Justice and Athletic Training.
College Freshman,5,"I love my program. If I could do it all over again, I would. My program has great classes and professors that helped me set career goals."
College Sophomore,5,The safety on campus is amazing. I always feel safe everywhere. You can tell its one of the university's priorities. They do a great job.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel extremely safe on the Westfield State campus. RAs and campus police are stationed at the entrance of every dorm from 9:00 pm to 2:00 am. All the dorms require a key care to enter, the card only works on that specific students dorm. The campus is very clean and well maintained."
College Junior,5,"There are many different types of living options, including on-campus apartments and suites. The newer buildings have air conditioning, and nothing is more than a five-minute walk from any given academic building. Housing can be stressful because it is a lottery process, but it is fair."
College Junior,5,"There are many different kinds of clubs, and creating clubs is easy if the school doesn't provide what you want. The professors are very involved in their students' lives and treat them like adults. There are so many internship opportunities for all majors, and the campus is beautiful."
College Junior,5,"Lots of clubs, great outdoors, performance opportunities, all sorts of things."
College Freshman,5,Most of my professors have PHDs and a few either went to or taught at Harvard University.
College Freshman,5,The best I have seen around.
College Freshman,5,"The residence halls are all in a circular setup. So they are all surrounding the campus green where events and such are held, very convenient."
College Freshman,5,"Library is free and the times are useful. Athletics are big there, and so are the gyms (there are two). A lot of student handouts."
Alum,4,I took a few classes online. For the most part they weren't too difficult. I think it really comes down to the type of course and professor to determine how the online portion is but otherwise I didn't have a lot of technology issues.
Alum,4,Online classes were structured enough to give schedule but also lenient enough to be able to work at your own pace
Sophomore,4,"I got a refund for room and board after classes went online. Most of my professors just gave us an assignment and told us to do it by the end of the week. They were very understanding if there were technical issues. In person classes were much better, but it could have been much worse."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my first year at Westfield State University and my experience has been great so far. The staff has been very helpful and all the professors have been good. I have also been able to rent my textbooks online instead of buying them from the professor or bookstore. I actually really like the food too. The campus isn’t gorgeous, but it’s not ugly either."
Junior,4,Online learning for me is very easy. Blackboard is a simple program easily followed self-explanatory the professors are clear and precise on what they expect of you and what they want from you.
Junior,4,I have not dorms on campus and I am an online student. I am considered a junior but this is my first year at Westfield State and so far it has been good.
Freshman,4,"When visiting the campus, I really enjoyed my time at Westfield State and look forward to committing to the college on May 1. While attending Westfield, I am planning on double majoring in Political Science, and Criminal Justice and doing the 5 year Masters program. I did also do an Accepted Student Day where I met professors and coaches and saw the campus in its most authentic form, and I truly loved it!"
Junior,4,"I had just transferred to westfield state, and I am just now realizing the amount of money it costs to go there, but my experience there so far is good."
Niche User,4,"Westfield State is a pretty good place. The professors and staff are always available and focus on making sure students are successful in their studies. Students can get really involved, but of course, this depends on the class/major you have.  The food is pretty average but they do have a selection of different foods. There are also a few places you can buy food around campus or you can buy from the several fast-food restaurants located outside of campus. The dorms are mixed, having both males and females on the same floor. The dorms are pretty normal but I recommend bringing a fan with you. Freshmen tend to get the older buildings that don't have A/C. The place overall is pretty safe. There's a police station right outside the campus and they can be contacted at any time through their phone number."
Sophomore,4,I am a Criminal Justice major and the professors within the department are amazing. The class sizes are small enough where you can get to know your peers. I am an in-state student so the University so more affordable than others and the size is preferred. I know that if I went anywhere else for school I would have transferred to WSU anyways because the education for Criminal Justice is the best.
Freshman,4,My experience at Westfield has helped me become more independent as a person. I enjoy the campus. The professors are very fair. The food is decently good. Westfield reminds me of home in a way.
Freshman,4,I love Westfield State University.  I love the size of the school and the professors are great.  I especially like the Banacos Center where I can access tutoring and other accommodations.  The food is pretty good.  I feel safe on the campus and see some familiar faces routinely but also frequently see new faces.  The only thing I would change is make it a little more diverse.
Sophomore,4,"I very much so enjoy the location of the school, as it is surrounded by a lot of different types of nature. I also enjoy the campus itself and how home like it makes me feel. The professors here are pretty great and seem to always want to help. My academic program is very nice and treats everyone like family,"
Freshman,4,The school has a amazing criminal justice program also the rotc program at the school is outstanding I really enjoy it
Senior,4,Amazing and passionate teachers that went above and beyond for me. When I first transferred too WSU I had little to no help. My original advisor did not advise me at all and I did everything on my own which was pretty stressful. Now that I have a better advisor things have been much easier for me. He advocated for me in so many ways. Make sure you get a good advisor that is willing to help it can make all the difference!
Alum,4,I loved my time at Westfield State University. The professors are genuinely interested in students’ success
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Westfield state university is not bad at all but I am not sure if I am a good example because I’m never really anywhere besides my room and the basketball court. Everybody is pretty friendly and most professors are understanding. The campus is clean and has various places for sports activities which is pretty nice. The campus police is alright too, they don’t really bother anybody unless it really calls for it. I am a black male and there are very few students of color which is kind of a let down sometimes but it could be worse I can manage. The university is pretty good I will say."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Westfield so far has been positive! Campus is pretty small so everything is an easy walk away, but academic buildings aren’t all crammed together. Professors overall are great and most of them are concerned with our success after college. Most of my professors have great experience outside of the classroom that they can bring to the table. People for the most part are friendly, campus is just big enough you can always meet new people, but small enough to always see someone you recognize. As a commuter I don’t really take part in extra curriculars  on campus  but I am aware of the all the clubs and sport teams available  to join. I wish commuters got more attention on campus as we make up a large part of the campus community. However, I am happy with my choice to attend Westfield, for the low cost of going I would say I am getting my money’s worth."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Westfield overall. The food is good, the teachers are amazing, and the custodial staff is wonderful, very nice and keep the buildings and campus very well maintained. You get a lot of freedom with the classes you want to take and your advisor is very helpful. There are plenty of events to take part in if you so choose as well."
Freshman,4,"Coming to Westfield State I had a lot of anxiety, particularly social. I just wanted to do well and make friends. I ended up becoming really close with my two roommates and some of the RAs on campus. I found my way around relatively easy and liked most of the classes I took my first semester."
Sophomore,4,Great place to be involved as a student. The professors are supportive and always willing to answer questions.
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed my experience here. The professors were wonderful, and it makes for a really friendly team environment here."
Senior,4,"Westfield state has changed my life for sure! My last four years would not have been without the help of the Urban Education Department, Banacos Academic Center and the TRiO program!"
Sophomore,4,I like how everything is close knit and they try to get the students together. I just wish it had more fun activities that everyone would like. Westfield itself is very boring. There aren't many places around. So if you want to go to a place where you can focus. I guess Westfield State is an option for you.
Sophomore,4,I like the atmosphere at Westfield. The campus is not overwhelming and everyone had been very welcoming on my first day as a transfer.
Sophomore,4,It's been very fun here meeting all the friends I have made and bring part of the track and field team as a thrower. My coach and team mates are the greatest. Its been the greatest experience I've ever had being a part of a team. The Lifetime owls is one of my favorite reasons for being here! We always hold very fun trips and paint nights for the lifetime owls on campus and whoever else wants to participate!
Alum,4,"Like any college, you'll get out of it what you put into it. Westfield is an excellent school for its value, especially if you study Education, Criminal Justice, Psychology and other big majors there. I was a Music major and I was lucky to have incredibly talented and intelligent professors. I made some good friends, too, but it can take a bit to find your niche. Commuters make up a good portion of the school, so there isn't a huge ""State School"" vibe that you would get at UMass or other huge institutions. But the small size is partially why I went there. The dining hall just recently updated their food so it is amazing now. Overall I had a great experience, learned a lot about myself and the world."
Junior,4,I like how Westfield State tries to make everyone feel as welcome as possible. I have loved all my professors so far. The professors work with you to help you achieve your goals and to help you succeed in college. I wish they would change the food in the dining hall.
Sophomore,4,The school is pretty great and the staff and faculty are awesome when it comes to making sure that you are where you need to be!
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Westfield state was enjoyable I met a lot of nice people and some of the teachers and staff were very helpful, and the course material was challenging at times but satisfying the use of critical thinking was encouraged by every teacher and the teachers always attempted to get the class involved."
Alum,4,Westfield has a good amount of majors to choose from. The psychology department was very good and had plenty of good professors to engage with. There were plenty of classes offered for my major and had no problem registering for the ones I wanted. There was no much of a campus life during the weekend however since a good amount of students commuted.
Freshman,4,"I am really loving my classes, my sport, and the people I have met so far.  The campus and dorms are just the right size for me and I feel very comfortable here."
Senior,4,"I am currently enrolled here at WSU. I am a transfer from Holyoke Community College and the transition has been a little rough, however, WSU has eased some of that discomfort by offering my a campus that has very devoted professors and a department that I really, really love. WSU is my first ""four year college"" experience. I have seen a lot on campus and I have seen many people come together to stand up against acts of violence and hate. It was a really beautiful thing. The community here really care for one another and they take care of each other the best that they can. Academics here are amazing too. I have been challenged in the best possible ways here at WSU and I look forward to obtaining my well deserved degree."
Alum,4,I like that WSU has a homelike feeling to its campus. It constantly has activities going on. For those who are of legal drinking age it has an on campus bar and it also offers free shuttles on Friday and Saturday nights to downtown night life and back. This is a safe option it offers it students. The professors that the school has are very dedicated to the material they teach. The only thing I would like to change it the amount of classes offered. Its tough to get into major classes due to limited availability.
Sophomore,4,"Westfield State is a great university filled with many different areas of study for students of all kinds. They are very open and love to make everyone feel welcome. They have an abundance of clubs and extra curricular activities. I especially love all of the classes that I have taken, and appreciate all the help and support I have gotten from my professors, I have connected well with quite a few. If I could change one thing, it would be the amount of activities open to commuters. All the activities are open for everyone but as a commuter it is harder to find time to join a club or such knowing that I also have to drive home later."
Junior,4,"I chose Westfield State because of the Banacos Center and the Education Department. Just like it would be at any other college, it was a big adjustment. If you're looking for a small college, I would 100% recommend Westfield State!"
Niche User,4,My parents and brothers all attended WSC! And they loved it. The campus has changed quite a bit since the '80's for the better. I did decide to go to Fitchburg though
Sophomore,4,I love Westfield State. I have learned and experienced so much during my time here. The classes and professors have left a positive impact on my life. I have also made lifelong friends that I will cherish forever.
Freshman,4,"Would love to see more extracurricular activities, clubs etc.  Maybe some intramural sports and such.  Also more work opportunities for student."
Sophomore,4,Westfield State University is a beautiful small community away from the cities that surround Westfield. There are a little over 6 dorm buildings if youre interested in staying on campus and they have a ton of amazing majors you can choose from and this university is known for their criminal justice and education programs so if thats what youre looking for Westfield is right for you. The professors are amazing and there are so many programs that can help you along the way through your classes.
Junior,4,"The school is a perfect fit for people who don't like large classrooms. The small class sizes allow students to connect well with the professor and other students. The campus is beautiful when the seasons change and easy to navigate through. They offer a wide range of classes. Professors are very involved in your means to succeed, which is also beneficial."
Recent Alumnus,4,The housing was bad freshman year but got better
College Sophomore,4,"I actually enjoy going to my classes and I have made several friendships that I feel will last a long time. The campus is small enough that it is not overwhelming, while still being large enough that you can meet new people everyday."
College Junior,4,I'm so happy I chose to attend westfield state
College Junior,4,I feel very protected and safe at my school
College Freshman,4,Great gyms. Options for all.
College Freshman,4,Theres not much around to make it an unsafe area. I am a girl and feel safe walking around campus in the middle of the night.
College Freshman,4,The professors are all experts in their fields and really helpful. The courses provide real life experience and background to the curriculum. The class sizes are perfect for a hands on approach.
College Freshman,4,"I live in Dickinson. It's newly renovated, close to a lot on campus, and has a lot of fun social events."
College Freshman,4,i feel very safe on campus!
College Freshman,4,my professors in my department seem very involved in helping you find a job!
College Freshman,4,"so far, Westfield is great. the only thing that i would change is that i wish that freshman were allowed to have cars on campus."
College Freshman,4,"i love this school, i just wish there was more to do around town."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had very good luck with my professors and my classes. All of my professors really cared about how their students were doing in the class, but they were not afraid to give the students a challenge. Even though some of my classes were quite difficult, it was in my best interest. However, I am not a fan of the Gen. Ed classes because I feel like some of them have nothing to do with what I want to do in the future, which is the most important thing about college for me."
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus, but I think I would enjoy it more if I was living in a suite with my friends rather than a dorm room with one other person. I feel like a suite would be more suitable to my life at the University because we are supposed to be learning how to live on our own, and a suite is much like an apartment, so it would be much easier to get a feel for living in a place that you need to provide your own amenities and necessities."
College Sophomore,4,"Westfield State has a lot of school spirit. I don't think I've gone one day without seeing at least three students wearing Westfield State apparel. Most of my classes are in the athletic building so I make use of a lot of the athletic facilities and they are extremely well kept. Intramural sports are also a big deal at WSU. I have attended a few intramural volleyball games and they're very competitive, but fun at the same time. I also attended a football game which was packed with supportive fans."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm very glad that I chose Westfield State University. It's close to home, which I love, but I still live on campus with my friends. It's a very lively community of students, and there's always some sort of activity or event going on. I've created so many relationships at WSU and my professors and academic advisors have helped me to become much more serious about my future, and they are very supportive in my decisions, as well as helpful in giving me their own advice."
College Sophomore,4,"You can feel safe walking around campus. If I am alone, I try to stay close to lamps for extra comfort."
College Sophomore,4,Can't wait for more fun times!
College Sophomore,4,"It all depends on what hall you are in, and then what floor and section. Some of the older dorms are being renovated so that they are nicer than before."
Senior,2,"Enjoyed online Management Program.... however nearly every class I had was political in some way.  From the professors to the curriculum, politics was somehow involved.  I try to stay neutral when it comes to that and I believe it took away from the content of the education I was paying.  I talked with many classmates who had the same view I did.  Some actually transferred because of it."
Sophomore,2,"Very small, very boring, very unorganized. The campus is small, and there isn't much to do in town. I would not recommend it."
Niche User,2,"Westfield State University does a great job of marketing themselves as a great place to live and learn, but once you're on campus living there, it becomes quite  clear that this is not the case. There is very little campus life whatsoever, especially on the weekends and most of the staff (aside from the professors) really don't care about students' success on campus"
Senior,2,"I do not recommend going to WSU.  Besides the professors, most of which are good, the rest of the faculty is horrible.  Every department has faculty that leads students in the wrong direction and don't know what they are doing or even saying.  The wifi barely ever works on cell phones.  There are not nearly enough spots on campus for students to park.  It is a complete war zone through most of the morning and early afternoon.  If you have any class starting from 8:30-1 you need at least 20 minutes to find a spot.  In addition to that, if you ever get a parking ticket, don't ever expect an appeal to work.  No matter what you say, the committee will reject your appeal and make you pay the ticket.  The surrounding area is very bad as Western Ave (street the school is on) will destroy your car.  The town doesn't care about the road at all and even went as far as just putting a sign up saying ""use at your own risk"" instead of fixing it."
Sophomore,2,Ok university extremely affordable college in comparison to other state and private university's in the New England area.
Senior,2,"I had a mix of experiences here. I think there are good people  for the right reasons. But, The atmosphere is not like a public university. It’s a small private community. The natives of Westfield who are old and have lived and worked their  are not a great asset to the school. Some of the admin needs to be uplifted and turned in my opinion. There are two very different faces to this school. There are people fighting for social justice and equality but you have to get by the other side of it too. The financial aid office is not helpful. They want cash. They also are not accepting of alternative part time students. They just put a lot of money into the buildings. I think it’s sad when new construction has very corrupt things in it. It’s not the walls that matter it’s the people InSide them. I was never encourage or helped by anyone when pursuing my degree. I would not recommend this school to anyone."
College Freshman,2,it  not too good people are not friendly
College Sophomore,2,"We have some stuff around, but it can get boring after a while. Also, not many places accept owl bucks."
College Sophomore,2,Sports are not a huge deal here.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus food is horrible. Poorly made, unhealthy and unsanitary. Almost every time i eat in the DC i find a hair in my food. Last year a rat fell from the ceiling onto the table in the DC."
College Senior,2,"This campus is extremely strict. It seems like the officers on campus are always looking to get people in trouble. You can't turn the corner without seeing a cruiser. Just last night I went to move my car from South lot to Commuter lot (a less than 2 minute ride) and I got pulled over for a missing headlight (granted I should get it fixed, but I don't think that's a good reason to be pulled over). Also, I always hear about people getting 10/100's (10 hours of community service, $100 fine) for drinking or finding alcohol/weed in the dorms. Back when I was a freshman, almost all of my friend received 10/100s for something alcohol-related. In terms of parking, this campus is extremely strict. If you live on campus, you are allowed to keep your car in the commuter lot from 5 pm Friday to Sunday at midnight. My friend has been tied up in schoolwork and went to move her car around 12:15 or so on Sunday night, and she already had a ticket that was written out at like 12:07, which is only 7 minutes late. They could be a little less strict on things like that."
College Freshman,2,Only thing to do is go to Amherst or Springfield.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot to do, not much culture or diversity either. The attitude towards students seems to be that we are just loud, obnoxious college students."
College Senior,2,"The DC sucks bad, they don't care to change up their meals. Except my favorite TK he's at the simple servings part of the DC quality food."
College Sophomore,2,Downtown Westfield is not a great place to hangout. Best things to do are if you want to drive to UMASS Amhurst or into Springfield. Otherwise your stuck with some run down bars and crappy strip malls
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little diversity. You can tell the school tries to be more diverse however most students are Caucasian, Christian, Middle Class, and Straight. One of my friends said ""It was like culture shock for me coming from a diverse high school here to Westfield where there are almost no other Dominican students"" I am one of three members of the Jewish student organization."
College Junior,2,When is rains the walkways are mud. Rainboots are a must
College Junior,2,The DC sucks and has a pretty limited menu. However there are other options on campus.
College Junior,2,There usually aren't a lot of open spots in places closest to the academic buildings.
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a car so I didn't have this problem, but the parking pass fee is reasonable. Good luck finding parking somewhat close to campus. Unless you have an 8:15AM class, you probably won't get a spot in Commuter lot. You'll end up in South Lot and thats a far walk away. Shuttles go there but on a schedule. You don't really need a car on campus, but if you want to go off campus, its best to have a car because the PVTA bus is sketchy and doesn't take you everywhere"
College Freshman,2,"In the winter, its absolutely freezing and its horrible walking in the cold. When its nice out, its absolutely beautiful."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many people chose the live off campus, and those who do, tend to wish they lived on campus. The on campus experience is very good. It's where everything happens."
College Freshman,2,"The dining commons does not have good food, but there are also Dunkin Donuts and Subway run by Sudexo."
College Freshman,2,The off-campus dining is too far. without a car it's no fun to go because it takes too long and the bus has a shirt schedule at night. 
College Freshman,2,"When I toured the school, the financial aid person I talked to told me I shouldn't attend the school because it wasn't in my price range. I basically applied for everything on my own and hoped for the best. "
College Freshman,2,"Every time I enter my hall all I smell is marijuana. My floor is extremely loud and always smells like marijuana, my roommate and her friends are always getting drunk and talking about alcohol. The enforcement is not that strict. People get away with a lot at this school. "
College Freshman,2,"It rains almost every other day and it can get very cold. I would suggest investing in a rain coat, rain boots, and an umbrella if you plan on coming here."
College Freshman,2,The city bus will take you downtown to where the parties are but it only runs until 10:10 and cabs are awful and sometimes don't pick you up. You will probably end up walking the 3 miles back to campus once or twice if you go out. There is basically nothing within walking distance of campus so a car is pretty important.
College Sophomore,2,It is very strict for the most part but pretty lenient on guests
College Sophomore,2,The wireless net work is horrible bring your own router if possible
College Sophomore,2,Very strict and very crowded until your a junior..
College Sophomore,2,Get your own car the busses are extremely unreliable 
College Sophomore,2,mostly the same social class no internationals what so ever
College Freshman,2,The building I live in is very small but there are some nice building.
College Freshman,2,The police on the campus is strict but run a tight ship.
College Sophomore,2,I find the town to be pretty boring comparing to where I live. There isn't much to do off campus unless you're willing to travel.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do on campus party wise so the bars are more my scene. However there isn't many options to chose from.
College Sophomore,2,This campus isn't too diverse comparing to other schools. The campus is predominantly white. 
College Freshman,2,The dining hall is pretty good. The menu has variety everyday and the value is pretty good. The best place to go is probably the dining hall because they serve healthier options than any other place on campus. I wish they had healthier option such as whole wheat pasta. I also wish they served breakfast until 11AM. Using meal plan dollars is very good. You can use them in all the other food places and market on campus.
College Freshman,2,There's lots of off-campus dining options. There good in cost. You have to take the bus there if you don't have a car which is inconvenient. There aren't student discounts that I've seen but they take Owl Bucks. Theres a pretty good variety of food I would say. I wish there were healthier options though.
College Sophomore,2,"there is a decent amount of parking, but it is really far away from dorms/classes"
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of the classes aren't very hard, the professors are decent though"
College Sophomore,2,"The computers are decent, sometimes it is just hard to obtain one especially during midterms/finals"
College Junior,2,"Our campus is not very diverse at all. A majority of the students come from predominantly white suburban towns. For the students who are culturally diverse, there are many clubs and organizations on campus to help keep them more comfortable. Overall, I feel as though our school does a great job when it comes to building a respectful community. For political beliefs, there is both a republican and democratic club on campus. This is a way for both sides to voice their opinions respectfully. Our campus fully honors LGBT individuals. There is also a club on campus that helps support those individuals."
College Junior,2,A lot of excess charges come from living in dorms from things that you may not be involved with. A lot of damage charges from people getting drunk and destroying parts of the buildings.
College Sophomore,2,"During spring weekend, campus security is at an all time high, and can be pretty annoying, especially if you are not participating in spring weekend. There are bag checks whenever you enter a dorm, no matter where you are coming back from (including from the library, classes, etc.), and there are fees to have guests stay over for that weekend. If you usually have people come and visit you during the weekends make sure you know when spring weekend is so that you don't have to send them home early."
College Freshman,2,"It's always very rainy on campus and we have a lot of flooding issues but overall, being on campus is so much fun, especially on nice days! everyone is outside!"
College Sophomore,2,Most of the students at Westfield are white. It is not as diverse as people make it out to be. But there are people from all over the world that do come here.
College Sophomore,2,Not Close Enough – The parking is a pretty far walk from the classes and dorms but the school does have a shuttle that runs from 3pm-3am.
College Sophomore,2,"Too Small – The town is very  little and with very little to do. There is no bowling alley, movie theater, or mall. There are bars and decent places to eat. The surrounding towns have everything that Westfield doesn't and they are so close that it somewhat makes up for it."
College Sophomore,2,"A Smattering – three general types: hipster, jocks, and geeks.  Hipsters are the best looking but they often keep their high school girlfriends and they have very high standards.  Geeks are nice but not very desirable.  Jocks have high standards but are typically a-holes."
College Senior,2,The major is not as challenging as it should be. Work load is too little and needs to be increased. Some professors really go out of their way for you if you need it but others don't put effort into your education. A lot of it is rudimentary and fundamental. Basically high school all over again.
College Sophomore,2,It's Ok – The food isn't the worst but it definitely isn't the best. On the days that they have good food there are many options but on the days where the options aren't so good there inst anything to eat.
College Sophomore,2,Old Buildings – The buildings are old and needs some renovation. The rooms are also a little small and doesn't offer a lot of options on decoration and arrangement of furniture. The bathrooms are dirty and lack some of the proper toiletries so many of us are used to at home.
College Sophomore,2,"Rains ALOT – Poor drainage and alot of rain. Had to purchase rubber boots, I am 42 and never owned a pair since I was 5. Need them in Westfield!"
College Sophomore,2,"Registration Process and Class Offerings – The registration process at Westfield is horrible. First off, they don't offer enough of classes for students since they had expanded on the amount of students for each year. If you can't get into classes, you go to the registration where they can put you into classes. What isn't fair is that students who have a good gpa and have declared a major might be put on hold to a student whose gpa is lower than a 2.5 and they can't declare a major. I was locked out of a full class because a girl who has horrible gpa's put into it before me. Now I am behind and they won't over load me into it."
College Freshman,2,"To get into most of the parties, you either have to be a hott girl or know someone at the house. There are specific houses that always have parties and if you know someone there, you're set. The off campus scene is definitely only if you're 21 or older but kids on-campus just drink in their rooms."
College Freshman,2,Not Worth It – Don't come here unless you want a cheap Criminal Justice or Movement Science education.
College Sophomore,2,There are shuttles that take you places on campus and busses that drive downtown.
College Freshman,2,"Would Rather Walk – Public transportation on and off campus are satisfactory at best. The on campus shuttle buses are hardly on time. City buses that take students to downtown are typical, sometimes not frequent enough if you miss one. The city cabs are absolutely horrifying and unsafe. They are people from houses that drive their own cars and most likely they are preying on partying college students."
Senior,1,"Enjoyed online Management Program.... however nearly every class I had was political in some way.  From the professors to the curriculum, politics was somehow involved.  I try to stay neutral when it comes to that and I believe it took away from the content of the education I was paying.  I talked with many classmates who had the same view I did.  Some actually transferred because of it."
Senior,1,"I'm not a fully online student, but during the pandemic is was incredibly hard to switch over. Starting out the semester with online/hybrid/in person classes may be difficult as well."
Senior,1,"Don't come here.  Advisors will screw you over so you have to stay longer. 
 The school is money hungry and bills you for things you shouldn't have to pay for and things you waive.  Roads surrounding are horrible.  Parking is horrible.  Dean of the business department lies and goes back on her word.  I could write an entire paper on all of the issues I've had at Westfield State."
Senior,1,"None of the staff are helpful. The people at the registrar are completely useless. The professors are OK as long as you can get one that speaks fluent english then you should be set. Otherwise, any staff that is not a professor are not helpful in any manner."
Niche User,1,"This school is awful to attend!  If your an undergraduate or graduate student who does not fall into the 18-23 range, go to a different college that knows how to treat adults with respect.  

A lot of the administration and some of the faculty at this school have no idea how to teach and communicate with older adults, it sucks!  A lot of them are afraid of teaching, helping, even talking to older adults because the majority of students that take classes here are in the 18-23 range and that is what they are used to.  It's like they never worked in the private sector with a wide range of adults.  It's pathetic!

A lot of the administration are very ""cold"" and some of the student workers are downright rude.  The school tries to act like it is accepting to ALL students but the very people that try to accomplish this are the same ones that are discriminatory.
Graduate/Continuing Education Division sucks!
My academic advisor sucks!
Unfair grading!
Go to another school!"
College Freshman,1,i don't get scholarships because I'm a DCGE student.
College Sophomore,1,there is no greek life here
College Sophomore,1,The one time i went to see public safety the men were extremely rude and unhelpful.
College Sophomore,1,"I was not given financial aid even though i have three siblings, one who just graduated, one who is still in college and one who is about to graduate high school."
College Sophomore,1,"The food sucks. The staff at the dining hall are very nice and the place is clean, but the food itself is not good. There is no variety. Every other day the same thing is served and its always fish or pork. I personally don't even bother eating dinner at the DC because it makes me sick. There's dunking donuts, subway, the commuter cafe, that are good options other than the DC. Typical meal plans are 19 or 14 meals a week. I usually only eat breakfast at the DC because it is the only meal thats actually decent. You also get $150 sodexo bucks to spend around campus which is really great. Most people spend them on subway or dunkin."
College Freshman,1,"Save yourself and don't come to this school, go to UMass Amherst"
College Sophomore,1,Everything is so far away. Unless you part in a faculty spot in which you'll get a ridiculous ticket expect to walk. Shuttles take forever and are often full. You're gonna need to walk and it sucks
College Sophomore,1,Always raining or snowing and the campus does a terrible job of plowing and salting sidewalks and roads.
College Junior,1,Due to issues with the schools budget not many scholarships were available
College Freshman,1,we don't have any sort of special housing and there are no frats or sororities
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at Westfield State. The closest thing would be for someone to play a sport. The sports at Westfield State are all division III. Sports players usually live off campus and all life in houses around the same vicinity. Club members usually don’t all live together. There are no specific locations that the sports players have to live around.
College Freshman,1,I hate living on campus. I feel so out of place. All the girls around me are extreme party goers and I don't like that type of scene. I don't feel safe in my dorm unless I have a friend with me. My roommate never has her key and always leaves the door unlocked. Everyone is extremely loud at all hours and nobody really does anything to control it. The bathrooms are disgusting. The same piece of hair and glop was left on the shower wall for at least 4 weeks. The people around me are extremely immature. I don't enjoy living on campus at all. 
College Freshman,1,All the parties are in the off campus housing which is 3 miles away. Unless you can get there the only on campus things that happen are if random people decide to hang out in someone's room. There isn't much night life around like clubs or bars.
College Freshman,1,I am a Spanish major with a licensure in Secondary education…which I found out doesn't exist here yet even though it's on the website… so unless you are a criminal justice major or an elementary ed major I would suggest calling the school to make sure what you want actually exists before coming here.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.

Freshman,5,"Exceptionally beautiful Campus. When you stroll around campus, you really feel that it is wonderful place to learn with rolling hills and lush greenery. Food is terrific and the cafeteria is nationally ranked. Food in downtown Saratoga is exceptional as well. The student body attracts a large number of wealthy, smart kids with a passion for the arts. People are generally low key and not pretentious. No riots or protests or crime. Bohemian hipster with a wealthy country twist."
Freshman,5,Good overall. Small classes with in depth class discussions. I found it challenging but also very friendly and animated.
Alum,5,Interested and interesting student body.  Faculty that are leaders in the fields (e.g. Dr. Paul J. Arciero).  Saratoga Springs is one of the best big towns in the northeast.
Niche User,5,"My son is now a sophomore and is loving his Skidmore experience!

His first year seminar was amazing as he bonded with his Professor who was also his Advisor. The campus is beautiful during all seasons. The vibe is friendly and the town of Saratoga Springs is friendly!"
Niche User,5,"I love this School! Every single time I visit this school I immediately feel welcomed and invited in. Every single student I interacted with was welcoming and interested in wanting to know me. Furthermore, all of the teachers want their students to do well, which not only improves the student to teacher relationship, but also creates an environment that is warm and inviting. The cherry on top, is the food is amazing as well! The chefs in D-hall love what they do and you can taste that through the food!"
Alum,5,Beautiful college with an open & welcoming community feel. Rigorous coursework with professors dedicated to making sure you can meet the challenge.
Sophomore,5,"People at Skidmore are generally kind and accepting of others. There's a party scene on the weekends but it's not very big. Football and Greek Life aren't a thing, either. Skid's well suited for someone who wants a well rounded liberal arts education, an intimate student body, and a relaxed campus environment."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 1992 and had an amazing time at Skidmore! I made great friends who I still talk to today. The location is perfect - right in Saratoga Springs, an idyllic town full of cute shops. I don't remember much about the academics because I went there so long ago, but I feel like I got a good education overall."
Niche User,5,Super awesome !the campus is beautiful!My professor was extremely dedicated and focused.I always felt safe on campus .
Sophomore,5,"Skidmore offers the most wonderful education. For a small liberal arts school, it offers amazing internship opportunities through our career development center, and more than 90% complete at least one internship in their 4 years and more than 80% complete 2. The professors are amazing and students are able to really collaborate with them inside and outside the classroom. And finally it is the inclusiveness and diversity of the student body that makes this place feel like home to me. I’ve never felt more myself in a place in my life than at Skidmore."
Sophomore,5,A great place to go. Full of privileged white peoples but they could be worse. The professors are intelligent and the classes engaging. Saratoga springs is divine.
Senior,5,"Skidmore hosts the National College Comedy Festival every year! This is the largest college comedy festival in the nation. Not many people know this and it has been one of the highlights during my time at Skidmore. Another highlight of mine has been the Skidmore Outing Club. This club provides outdoor hiking, climbing, rafting, and backpacking trips every weekend. This allows students to explore the Adirondacks which are literally just outside Saratoga Springs. The school has amazing academics and professors, however, the thing that makes Skidmore special is its students. The school gives a lot of money to its clubs and the students truly create inspiring work. Whether it be tackling social issues, dancing, singing, comedy, or frisbee, the students never fail to share their creativity and dedication. Skidmore truly is an amazing school."
Alum,5,"I made great friends here, even with professors. The education is exactly what you'd expect from a great liberal arts college. Lots of resources for students. Saratoga Springs is a beautiful town. I'd live my four years at Skidmore again in a heartbeat."
Freshman,5,"Current Freshman at Skidmore; It's super easy to make friends here, the dining hall food is better than that of any of my friends or family's colleges, and you can find a way to do pretty much anything that interests you here. If you don't want to be bored, you won't be; there are more events every year at Skidmore than there are students, so there's always something interesting going on.  As for the party scene, it is what you make of it, as long as you aren't seeking out frat party ragers, since there is no greek life. There are 2 or 3 clubs in downtown Saratoga springs which are filled with Skidmore students on the weekends, and a bunch of the student groups host regular parties (Mainly the athletic teams, the theatre kids, and one or two of the bigger acapella groups). Also, although we are officially a smoke free campus, there's a reason we used to be rated the #1 weed school in the country, and I have no reason to think that the smoking culture is really ever going to go away."
Alum,5,"I graduated in May 2017 and I can say with confidence that Skidmore set me up for a successful life and a career after college. The class sizes were intimate and the professors were challenging, but incredibly supportive. The campus is beautiful and the overall atmosphere is welcoming."
Junior,5,Skidmore is a creative and welcoming place that helps you to figure out both who you are and what you want to do.
Freshman,5,"When I visited, I found the experience very different than most colleges. The atmosphere was very welcoming. As a small school, I felt at home as soon as I got accepted."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus and beautiful places in nature and i loved the environment and vibe that skidmore gave off to its students
Freshman,5,"When I was looking at colleges, I wanted to go to a school with a strong dance program, but also a strong academic program. Skidmore is exactly that--no matter what form of art you want to pursue/continue. A lot of the faculty is very friendly and supportive, and it is very easy to create a strong bond with your teachers. Since most class sizes are small with an average about 15 or so students, asking questions, participating in discussions, and making friends in class is not intimidating."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Skidmore, and I couldn't be happier. The academics are rigorous and interesting, and the professors are more often than not heavily involved with their students and helping them towards success. The student life on campus is always interesting, there is never a dull moment. Events on campus are always happening, from student acapella groups to academic speakers. The party scene is definitely there for those who are interested, but people who don't drink or party aren't left in the dust. The dorms are fairly old and poorly lit, but can be cozy and welcoming once settled into. All in all, I adore Skidmore, and wouldn't dream of going anywhere else."
Alum,5,"A wonderful place to grow, learn and succeed. Small class sizes and excellent dining hall. Many students double major. Saratoga can't be beat! Awesome town."
Alum,5,Skidmore College was an incredible place to get an education. Great and tough classes but social scene and extracurriculars were solid. On campus housing is amazing and dining hall is better than a lot of restaurants in Saratoga Springs. Set me up perfectly for medical school and I’m so grateful I went to Skidmore.
Alum,5,My experience here was 100% positive. Skidmore set me up for a successful life and career after college. Going there was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!
Junior,5,"Skidmore has been one of the best decisions I've made in my young adult life. I've had access to a plethora of opportunities, be it a grant to present research at the American Psychology Society's annual convention, or the opportunity to study music composition under a successful opera composer. Professors and classes are engaging, and while there is a lot of material it has never been difficult to manage. If you truly enjoy learning and want an environment that stimulates your intellect, Skidmore is the place for you."
Sophomore,5,"Skidmore's academic scene is very strong. All of the professors I have had are invested in the subjects they teach, and always make themselves available outside of class to meet with students. There are many interesting people and club activities on campus, and while there are definitely cliques, most people are friendly and spend time in multiple social groups. Food and housing choices are fairly limited for freshmen and some sophomores, but the options available are fairly good."
Junior,5,"A beautiful school with truly a place for everyone.  About to finish my third year, I can say with certainty that my parents' money is paying off.  I have taken at least three courses that have permanently shaped the way I view the world and continue to influence me every single day.  Professors are incredible and very easy to access outside of class.  There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!  I definitely made the right choice coming here.  There is no Greek life, which is awesome in my opinion.  Also, Saratoga Springs is quite possibly the most beautiful little city I have ever seen."
Sophomore,5,Very positive experience so far as a first year student at skidmore. Students are super nice no matter what they do/whether they are upperclassmen or not. Campus food is definitely a PLUS. Dorms are nice if you live in certain buildings(north quad and wiecking). professors are the BEST!
Freshman,5,Everyone is really relaxed and nice. Professors are always available and there are plenty of academic resources. Food wise there are a lot of options if you don't like what's being served that day. There are a lot of parties off campus or in the apartments you can usually just ask around and you'll find one.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Skidmore is an excellent school that provides an excellent education. Professors are incredibly accessible and the vast majority genuinely care about cultivating interest in their subject. Classes tend to be on the smaller side with a more participatory atmosphere. Some departments are stronger than others and the administration is sometimes slightly resistant to addressing the needs of certain departments, especially those that are growing in popularity.

Lots of good people who all really care about the school and other students. The campus is lovely, facilities are great, and Saratoga Springs is a great college town."
College Freshman,5,"Friendly people, and professors are always willing to help. Especially since it is a small class size"
College Sophomore,5,"Though Skidmore has a Title IX action against it currently, I feel the campus is working hard to improve support systems and preventing future assault. I am a woman and I feel very safe on campus (though I do not party, so I am not around alcohol or out late at night)."
College Sophomore,5,Class sizes are small so professors get to know you and help you.
College Sophomore,5,"I have not had issues with my room, though I know people who have, but Res Life has always sorted that out."
College Sophomore,5,"For Skidmore students, the fact that we don't have Greek life is a big part of choosing Skidmore."
College Sophomore,5,I can do everything I want to pursue at my school.
College Junior,5,Wonderful place; I am so glad I chose Skidmore.
College Freshman,5,I am really loving the college experience very much.
College Freshman,5,Literally everyone is so friendly. As long as you're not a tool then you can probably hang with upperclassmen and you will have no shortage of social life. And classwork isn't overwhelming because you like and chose the classes you're taking.
College Junior,5,"My experience at Skidmore has surpassed my college expectations, and I look forward to every semester more and more."
College Senior,5,"Skidmore is known for its somewhat alternative student body, which is often defined as artsy hipsters. While there is definitely a presence for artsy hipsters, every other type of student diversity can also be found there. I am so happy with my choice to attend Skidmore. I have made the most amazing friends and have made memories I know will last a lifetime. Skidmore has opened my eyes to so many possibilities and truly opened doors for my future."
College Freshman,5,Many options and variety! All food is great but some places are expensive. There are definitely off-campus places that accomodate students however
College Freshman,5,"Great variety, very quality food, better than most other schools"
College Freshman,5,Dorms are extremely spacious. Easy to manuever around. Opposite sex floors
College Freshman,5,Greek life at Skidmore is the greatest because it does not exist.
College Freshman,5,"The professors care more about students than any other school I've seen. They're truly passionate about what they do, and are very good at teaching it.

Also, if you're a prospective student reading this, take Psych 101 with Sheldon Solomon. Do it."
College Student,5,They are very lenient with much of what goes on.
College Student,5,The skidmore campus food was delicious and it seemed to be freshly made and used good ingredients as well.
College Student,5,"The campus is very nice. The dorms are very close to the classrooms which makes the entire area easily accessible and close-knit. The dorms are also beautiful, especially with the window space and seats."
College Student,5,it's a small school so it's good to play sports on
College Student,5,There are a lot of different places to go to eat that are reasonable
College Freshman,5,"While sometimes there will be those days when the food is just not to your liking, there is always pizza and pasta to fall back on. There is a large variety of food, with all options for even vegetarians and international students. There are some weeks when Global is consistently on point. The live action pasta is my favorite of all the options. Students will sometimes complain about ""dhall"" food, but when my friends in other colleges describe their options, ours never sounds that bad."
College Junior,5,There are so many restaurants. It's always super yummy.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus is really safe. Fall 2014 was apparently the most insane semester in years, due to some wanted criminal with a gun hiding in the woods, and a bomb threat. Things like that almost never happen. Campus safety handled those really well and really efficiently.

There's some theft on campus, but the school makes sure that everyone is aware of any problems that occur. It's not as big of a deal as in a lot of other schools. I once accidentally left my laptop in the dining hall, didn't realize until I got back to my room, went back, and found it and all my other stuff completely untouched."
College Freshman,5,"I really love Skidmore. People are generally very friendly, intelligent, and passionate. I've heard people occasionally say it gets a little cliquey here, but I don't think that's really true. I think, more than anything, it's that people tend to get just as focused on their existing friends as they do with everything else around here. People are almost always super friendly with anyone who talks to them directly. It's something that's actually helped with my social anxiety. Skidmore also has one of the best support networks I've ever seen. Academic services and advising is super helpful and is good at keeping students from falling through the cracks. Tutoring is readily available in many cases. As someone with multiple mental health issues that can often effect classroom performance, I feel that Skidmore is awesome in minimizing the impact of those disorders. Even during the admissions process, they seemed to take those into account, listen to me when I explained how it impacted my GPA, and make sure I knew about all of the things they have in place to help me out. Even now that I'm doing better than I was in high school with my mental health, they have so many things in place to help minimize the impact my mental health has on my success. I don't think any other school I applied to was so vigilant about that kind of thing.

Really, my only complaints about the school are about the leaf/snow removal. The leaf blowers in the fall are loud and tend to wake people early in the morning, and they just let the leaves blow around again instead of removing them. The snow plows are PAINFULLY loud (I have sympathy for people on lower floors of Jonnson Tower and the other buildings) and have been known to happen at weird hours. And the overload of texts and emails about moving your car for snow removal (which is irritating if you don't have a car and it's constantly snowing). But seriously, those are my biggest complaints, and they're really really minor things."
College Freshman,5,"Saratoga has amazing opportunities for eating out, and everyone can find something in their price range. There are some student discounts, and lots of different options for different eating habits/styles."
College Freshman,5,"Saratoga is gorgeous! There's tons of shops and restaurants, lots of opportunities to go out and have fun. You can easily get there on the bus or by car. My only note is that it is quite pricey, but you can find things within everyone's price range if you look"
College Junior,5,it is beautiful every season of the year here but especially in Fall and Spring
College Junior,5,There are so many amazing places to eat in Saratoga at every price point.
College Sophomore,5,"The Skidmore campus & surrounding community is a very safe, comforting place to be."
College Sophomore,5,You'll never be bored with off campus eateries.
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience was fairly brief and due to Covid-19. It wasn't a terrible experience, and I found the professors to be very flexible and understanding given the circumstances."
Alum,4,"All in all, I loved Skidmore! On campus housing is really nice, but expensive, so I chose to live off campus my last two years. Saratoga is a great area to go to school in - there are plenty of bars and places to eat and it's walkable! The school could definitely work on diversity."
Alum,4,"I had some amazing professors, and I found the history and government programs quite rigorous. Other highlights include the on-campus apartments, Zankel performing arts center, the food in the dining hall, Theater Department productions, and Fun Day. I was not a fan of Saratoga Springs, just based on personal preference."
Sophomore,4,Its a pretty good school.  Its in a nice town in upstate New York. You should visit if you have the chance!
Freshman,4,Skidmore is a small liberal arts college. The class sizes do not typically exceed 30 students. Academics could be challenging but there is always resources to help. The food here is decent and there is always something to do. There is a lot of clubs and events to join.
Freshman,4,"So far so good, I'm now in second semester of the first year and I still am liking it, so I must be doing something right."
Freshman,4,"I'm a current student and so far I love it.  If your an incoming freshman, expect to be put in a forced triple.  The forced triples are pretty cramped but doable.  The food alone is worth coming here for.  Home cooked meals will always be better, but as college food goes this place has got the best with wide ranges to choose from and plenty of healthy and diet-friendly choices available.  The academics are amazing and all the professors are very approachable and knowledgeable.  If you're not a party person you really have to stretch yourself to find things to do, as most weekends are party heavy.  They're easy to avoid if it's not your scene but definitely not over the top.  Overall an amazing school and an excellent choice."
Sophomore,4,"Good, intimate classes. The teachers are experienced and are, in most cases, quite good. Beautiful campus. The dorms are surprisingly nice. It is a fairly expensive school, and as a side effect of that, there is very little racial or class diversity. It is a college where people have the option to bring their horses to school with them. Very waspy."
Freshman,4,"Skidmore has the ability to make you feel very comfortable. The campus is beautiful. However, their concept of diversity is all wrong. The idea of being all inclusive is not shown when it comes to certain groups on campus. I can say that students voice the changes that need to be made. Furthermore, Its the campuses job to listen."
Alum,4,"Great diversity for a small liberal arts college. Strong bussiness and arts programs, great campus and town."
Senior,4,"Skidmore College has very strong Art Department. Most of the professors are very supportive. The Business Department is also very competitive. MB107 is a well known course challenges new Business students to work in groups and learn real life skills. Besides, the school offers generous financial aid packages for many students."
Freshman,4,I really like it here at Skidmore. The environment is very welcoming and there are a number of academic opportunities. It's great!
Sophomore,4,"My time at Skidmore thus far has been invaluable. The College provides students to continuing pursuing their interests, no matter how different they are; in fact, they encourage it."
Freshman,4,"Skidmore College is a small liberal arts institution in upstate New York. My experience thus far in my collegiate career has been optimistic and promising. The professors I have had so far have been a few of the best I have ever had the opportunity to engage in conversation with. All in different subject matters and all with different teaching approaches, each of these professors have had a mind that goes beyond the typical academic teacher. They inspired me to challenge myself beyond what I thought was capable and they are a large part of why my experience at Skidmore College has been positive. The friends I have made here have easily become some of the most interesting, kind and genuine people I have had the opportunity to meet. The social life at Skidmore is by no means equivalent to a large university, but it is very much so alive and exciting. I have loved my experience at Skidmore College."
Niche User,4,"I am currently a senior in high school who was given the opportunity to do a pre-college program at Skidmore over the summer. I absolutely loved it because the professors are amazing and truly know how to connect with their students at ease. I took a writing and sociology course in which I did hands on observations with my professors outside of the college for my classes. The academics are astonishing; the liberal arts setting lets you choose majors and minors to your liking. The college tries to also diversify the food served such as dishes from India or Peru. They appreciate culture. The student's are very active in their community when it comes to putting on shows and showing school spirit. I had recently gotten accepted to Skidmore, and I am joyful for the acceptance to its community."
Recent Alumnus,4,"People drink. People do drugs (mostly pot). It happens, pretty much exclusively on the weekends, and it's not a big deal. It's not super noticeable, especially if you're not looking for it. 

It's a campus full of 18-22 year olds - debauchery occurs but it is pretty much never out of hand and the party scene is mostly low key, especially compared to larger schools.Campus safety is much more concerned with safety than busting people."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus housing is definitely above average though it depends on your year. Freshman/Sophomore years students are typically housed in the dorms which vary pretty wildly in quality. South quad dorms (McClellan, Wilmarth, Penfield, Kimball) are not great (though they did fix them up a little bit a year or two ago). North quad dorms, especially Howe-Rounds and Wait, are nicer. 

The on-campus apartments, mostly inhabited by Juniors and Seniors, are a massive step above the dorms. Their only downside is the cost which is borderline unacceptable considering the relatively low cost of renting property off-campus (Saratoga is a summer town so renting during the school year can prove a budget-friendly choice)."
College Sophomore,4,"I've heard that the alumni network is really amazing. After you graduate, the school doesn't congratulate you about graduating, they congratulate you for becoming a part of the alum network."
College Sophomore,4,"As a woman, I always felt super safe, as I come from a small town and never really feared walking alone, but many of my female friends didn't want to walk home alone from the library at night. There has been a fair amount of sexual assaults and crimes, the school usually just puts up yellow flyers saying exactly what happened everywhere. That just makes me, at least, feel weirder about it."
College Sophomore,4,"The Career Center can be helpful, though last time I went it was not as helpful. It is very easy to get internships in your field however."
College Sophomore,4,"I do not really utilize our sports facilities, but they are nice."
College Sophomore,4,"If you have a good RA like I did, you get a really nice community feel on the floor and a chance to bond with everyone freshmen year."
College Freshman,4,There is a health center and campus safety
College Freshman,4,"Although I live in a triple room, but it is big enough for me. And the residential faculty will clean the common area and bathroom every day, so it is clean."
College Sophomore,4,Always felt safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Career Center always ready to help.
College Senior,4,"Skidmore has provided with both a great education, as well as great resources for life after college. My only complaint is that the school is a little self-contained. Given that the student population is so small, this begins to wear on you after awhile, especially if you are an LGBT student such as myself."
College Sophomore,4,"I've learned a lot about issues that make people uncomfortable (especially in the United States) like race relations, radical environmental initiatives and the true significance of privilege."
College Sophomore,4,"I toured Skidmore and fell in love. I am so grateful to be a part of this school and my freshman year was such an incredible experience.  I love the campus and being in Saratoga, my classes were all engaging and although I didn't find myself adoring all of my professors, it is very clear at the least that they have a passion for what they teach.  That being said, the few down sides to Skidmore include the long winters, the lack of variety in party scene, and the fact that at times, it might feel a little smaller than you might like.

All of that being said, I wouldn't consider going anywhere else."
College Freshman,4,The campus is very safe. Students are very responsible and Saratoga is a very safe place
College Freshman,4,"Skidmore is located on N Broadway, which if you've never been there, is full of mansions and large estates. Most of these are rentable but obviously with a high price. Most students therefore must venture further off campus to find homes which are quality but a little far from campus."
College Freshman,4,"There are many great party scenes at Skidmore. Most of the sports houses are home to wild parties...especially baseball and field hockey. If you are not an athlete, it is pretty hard to gain admittance into parties so definitely make friends with athletes!"
College Freshman,4,"Many rules, will be enforced but admin. isn't looking to get you in trouble"
College Freshman,4,"So far, the requirements for my major have been well defined. It doesn't seem like it'll be a struggle to fit everything in"
College Freshman,4,"Campus is beautiful and open. Most of the buildings are in one general area (8 minute walk at the MOST from the dining hall to Zankel, and that's if you're walking leisurely), but it never feels cramped. The library is really nice, and pretty big. Skidmore in the fall is absolutely beautiful. Especially looking out at the trees from JoTo with the mountains off in the distance."
College Student,4,My financial aid was great and I got a lot of money but I could still use a little more.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics building is always open to students, and to clubs. it is easy to use. the games for the varsity sports are occasionally talked about, but there are not huge followings. The indoor riding arena is the best (and only) in the area."
College Freshman,4,"The administration at Skidmore is great. I have not had too many interactions with them, but the rules that are laid down seem to be lenient- only because the students at Skidmore are not the completely unruly type. The school handles all situations with fairness."
College Freshman,4,"The school always gives students who need it the option of work-study. And i received a small grant to go to the school. I have yet to reevaluate my financial status, but there are many opportunities to apply for scholarships and informations sessions about these. In terms of scholarships from the school, there are not very many of these. Students that are completely need based have a much easier access to financial need."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great, because the classrooms and the dining hall are so close. Depending in what dorm (or even floor) you are on can influence the floor community. Sometimes they are very close, sometimes everyone minds their own business. But usually people follow the quiet time rules- especially during finals. I never had a problem with the dorms. the rooming process is very easy, especially for freshmen. They are just assigned a dorm with roommates. if there needs to be a room change because people cannot live together ResLife handles this quickly and efficiently. When i was choosing my own rooms for next year i had a friend who wanted to room with me, and found this after the fact of choosing her own single special housing room. Because this was before the general signup for next year's housing, ResLife let us change the rooms because we explained the situation."
College Junior,4,You save a lot of money off campus. It is fun to have your own place with all your friends and also be closer to the bars.
College Junior,4,Skidmore is technically a dry campus but no one will be checking up on your in your room.
College Junior,4,I love going to house parties at Skidmore because I always know almost everyone there so everyone is really happy and friendly.
College Junior,4,I received a lot of financial aid from Skidmore. They were really willing to listen to my situation and help my family in whatever way they could.
College Junior,4,"The dinning hall is awesome, totally under appreciated."
College Junior,4,The dorms at Skidmore College are great. Having a single is awesome because you have your own space but you can still live with around your friends. The dorms are all close together and pretty close to the dinning hall which is always a plus when you wake up and want breakfast right away.
College Sophomore,4,"Apparently the chefs have won a competition many years in a row. The food is good, but of course gets very repetitive. The Pasta Live Action station is always my savior. Also there is a deli that makes whatever kind of sandwich you want."
College Sophomore,4,"Compared to other schools I have seen, Skidmore's housing is incredible. The dorms are always clean, there are places to study, and the RA's are not insane. There is a north and south quad of dorms and I think it is agreed upon that the north quad places are much nicer. In south quad the hockey guys tend to punch holes in the walls...

Upperclassmen can live in the apartments in two little villages on campus. They are incredible! We say they are the nicest apartments we will have for a very long time. The housing process - though stressful - is simple. The residential life group is understanding and accomidating. It is easy to get room changes. It is mandatory to get an unlimited meal plan if you live in a dorm which I think is absurd considering the price."
College Junior,4,"I like the housing, it's reasonable and close to campus!"
College Freshman,4,"There's a really big variety of classes at this school considering the small size. All of my professors have been really efficient at teaching, and readily available to help or with meetings. All of my professors seem to love what they do. Classes are small to encourage discussion (16-30). Even the few big classes are set up to get maximal individualization for the students. I've had professors apologize for there having to be lab sections with 18 people rather than the normal 16 since they were worried it would effect how 1-on-1 the classes are. The professors genuinely want their students to succeed, and are often as flexible as they can possibly be."
College Freshman,4,"There are a ton of restaurants for a fairly small town. Pretty good range as far as price goes, and a lot more variety in options than in my hometown. I haven't really run into student discounts, but a lot of places will take skidcards (ID cards/room key/card with money for laundry and stuff) as payment, which is really convenient."
College Freshman,4,"Compared to all the other schools I've visited, Skidmore has the best food. Some people complain about it, but I generally think the food is pretty good. We have a pretty good variety, and I've only had one or two things that were BAD. Occasionally a little bland, yeah, but not bad. And they give you money every semester to buy food from places that take skidcards (which the vending machines also do)"
College Freshman,4,"I love my major (neuroscience), but I am also doing pre-medical, which is very difficult and very miserable"
College Freshman,4,"I haven't really noticed the administration, when needed they are very helpful. I've never run into trouble or had to deal with them in that manner."
College Junior,4,Lots of on campus options and most students dont leave
College Junior,4,There are lots of options almost all of which are cheaper than living on campus.
College Junior,4,Lots of parties and things to do. For those who are 21 going downtown to bars is a great option.
College Junior,4,Campus Safety is very quick to respond helpful even in non-emergency situations such as jumpstarting a car.
College Sophomore,4,"Great leading professors, and access to othr. resrcs"
College Freshman,4,"You can only live off campus as a junior or senior, although there are a few on campus apartments for the sophomores who are lucky enough to get them. Actually living in town is very easy for the older students, it is quite a college town."
Sophomore,2,"Academically, Skidmore is a great school. Socially, the school is dreadful. Skidmore is very divided; so if you're incredibly artsy or athletic, you'll fit right in. Otherwise, you'll probably feel like an outcast. The parties are subpar, and ladies, I highly recommend looking up the Skidmore complex because it's ACCURATE. Don't expect any relationship because 97% of the guys just want to hookup and will likely ghost you after doing so. Additionally, they seem to think that they are far more attractive than they actually are. There are far more females on campus than males, so after spending a great deal of time with the limited number of guys, you'll realize that the ones you once found repulsive eventually become somewhat attractive. I am writing this now because I wish that I was aware of these things before I chose this school. In my opinion, a great school should have a healthy balance between academics and social life on campus. Skidmore certainly does not."
Freshman,2,"I don't want to write to trash on Skidmore because I think it is a good college for people who know what they're getting into. I'm a current freshmen at Skidmore, and have done fine friends and academically (3.6). What I want to stay about Skidmore is there is little room to be who you want to be. In high school, I was an athletic kid and had a lot of buddies on the team, but also had kids who weren't sporty. Skidmore draws an ultimatum and forces you to pick which group you want to hang out with for the remainder of your time here. The student body even recognized this with having segregated red and blue sides in the dining hall.. All the parties are pretty small, and only a few times do the sports houses get to 50-100 people. They're chill parties which can be good, but Im not a huge fan of. Really, to sum up what I'm saying-- don't come here if you don't like weed, if you aren't exclusively sports or artist kid, and if you want a large diverse community (everyone is white 78%)"
Freshman,2,The students are very judgmental. Did not feel very welcomed. The dynamic between athletes and non-athletes is very rigid. Both groups are very stuck-up and condescending. Dorms are in poor condition. Best asset is the library.
Niche User,2,"Beautiful campus but I'm not sure how Skidmore has an A in diversity when it is in fact 80% white. There are other schools like Manhattanville, and Albright that are small private liberal arts schools and are far more diverse than what I saw at Skidmore."
Freshman,2,"The student body is very friendly; however, the dorms are terrible (spec. South Quad), and there are only two types of people: the artsy, VERY quirky type, and the arrogant jocks who clearly think they're above everyone else. The professors I've had have been great, but many students are not engaged and don't care to participate, which has been really disappointing. If you want night life and are under 21, you NEED a fake. Otherwise, when everyone goes ""downtown"" to the clubs you're heading back to Spa or your room. The Student Government is impossible to work with if you want to start a new club, and it is nearly impossible if you want to obtain a room change if you're having roommate issues. I can see how Skidmore could work for other kids looking for a less-selective, less-demanding liberal arts school, but I've just found it to be a suffocatingly small school in the middle of nowhere, inhabited by potheads and jocks who think they're the gods of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Nobody cares about sports at Skidmore, but they sure do seem to matter when it comes to where you sit in the dining hall."
College Sophomore,2,The school is very divided between athletes and everyone else. No one really attends games and I heard our teams never win except for men's basketball
College Freshman,2,I play sports at Skidmore and find the environment very strange. There is only one type of person who plays sports at Skidmore and they are all basic and republican.  The sports facilities suck because they are very small and none of the teams coordinate what times they are using the gym so it gets very busy all at once.
College Freshman,2,"The party scene is pretty boring. Unless you're an athlete, especially for women, you really can't get into the athletics parties. The majority of the parties happen in upperclassmen/northwoods apartments, but those are only open to friends of the inhabitants. Mostly, the average ""party"" is a group of people drinking in someone's dorm room, and generally smoking pot. There's not a lot going on."
College Freshman,2,"Although we do have sports, the only people interested are those that play. We are a D3 school, except for the equestrian team, and games do not attract big crowds or anything."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a great selection. Most students are, although very bright & kind, not very attractive."
College Freshman,2,Skidmore is not very diverse in any sense. It's mostly upper/middle class white people. 
College Freshman,2,"Biology is a very demanding major at Skidmore. The workload is really shitty and class will drain you. That being said at the end of the semester you feel like you could recite your bio text book and you'll usually end up with the grade you worked for. The teachers are very smart and always available to help you. Bio major isn't easy, but if its what you want to do then Skidmore isn't a bad place to get it. "
College Sophomore,2,September through November is absolutely beautiful fall weather. December is manageable enough but once winter kicks into full gear it gets pretty bleak. Winter is long and can reach into April but once spring arrives the weather is perfect though you only see a couple weeks of it before classes end.
College Senior,2,"When you arrive in September, it's so nice. Perfect fall weather, staying around 60's and 70's. When mid-October rolls around, its basically winter, and it stays pretty miserable until late March. If you do not like the cold, and I am talking about walking up for an early class and finding out it's 15 degrees outside, do not come to Skidmore. I personally like the cold (versus hot weather), and I do not mind it really, but for some people it's a deal breaker. Conversely, summertime at Skidmore is really great, it's absolutely beautiful on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Some people get a lot of financial aid--I have not received any. Also, there are no merit scholarships, which is frustrating."
College Freshman,2,"There is very little school spirit. Teams are okay for DIII, only a couple sports actually win championships or make it to playoffs."
College Junior,2,"It's cold most of the year, but definitely do-able."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly white, Republican students. The school is diverse in religion and culture; however, when first visiting the campus, I was overwhelmed with the lack of color on campus. School Administration are working on ways to make Skidmore more diverse but it will take a few more years before the numbers start to close in."
College Freshman,2,"I'm Not Very Pleased – I'm a psychology major because criminology is not an available major at Skidmore. It is almost impossible to get into the classes that you want in psych, especially the required ones. It gets easier as you go from freshman to senior but I know some seniors that will have to take an extra semester after they graduate to officially graduate- and they aren't athletes."
Niche User,1,"very racist and has shown its racism within the students and professors, this has created an unsafe and unwelcoming environment for students who are being racially discriminated against"
Senior,1,"Save your money and go somewhere else. I'm going into my senior year and I can honestly say this school has irreversibly damaged my mental health & destroyed my passion for my major (art). Students are cruel, cliquey, and immature- so you need to have an ""in"" if you want to be a part of the community at all and not end up socially isolated for 4 years like me. Party scene is non-existent because all people want to do is sit around in their room and get f'd up on hard drugs. Professors treat you like you're in middle school because the small class size lets them monitor you CONSTANTLY, and they take full advantage of it to feed some gross power fetish. I'm a hard worker but my grades have suffered because there aren't enough hours in the day to finish even the standard 4 class per semester workload. I stuck around thinking things would get better but they didn't and now I'm haunted by the fact that I didn't transfer before it was too late."
Sophomore,1,The school lets in a bunch of jocks to play sports who are also super dumb -- it's weird. The comedy scene is really bad.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life so I cannot say much about it.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life at Skidmore.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life
College Freshman,1,"Skidmore athletics isn't great, but its facilities are surprisingly nice. No one really pays attention to varsity sports but people occasionally go to some games if theres nothing to do on the weekend.  "
College Freshman,1,"Some of the people here are plain weird. They dress oddly, act oddly, and are odd in general. Those who might be more your ""typical"" student often belong to their clique, and their clique only. Good luck getting into that social circle if you so desire. As far as interests go, it's party party party. And maybe a sports game here or there. But there isn't much school spirit."
College Sophomore,1,"People are so nice and it's a great place to be a stoner or someone who hates partying. Also, if you are a hipster boy, the school is full of beautiful girls. Girls: don't come here."
College Sophomore,1,"Like two nice days and then the winter comes. Horrible, bitter cold. Meh..."
College Freshman,1,"LOTS OF POT – The mindset regarding pot on campus is astounding, it's everywhere. Almost consumed as much as alcohol."
College Freshman,1,Still an All Girls School – Yes the school is coed now. But half the male population is gay and thus the percent of straight guys to girls feels like 20:80
College Junior,1,"Not Safe – there used to free cabs home, which was cheap and safe. Now it's only buses and it's a huge pain"
College Junior,1,"Very Cold – It's cold basically year round and snows a LOT.  Sometimes we get snow days, but generally it is painful.  There are about two weeks of nice weather in spring which are always a great time, though."
College Senior,1,"Winter Depression – Depending on how harsh the winters are (they usually are long, cold and isolating) many students feel depressed during the winter. Few go outside, and getting around is nearly impossible."
College Freshman,1,"It's Brutal – The people here are just strange. Everyone smokes. Everything has the high school feel to it, and not in a good way. You need an in for anything you do. It is just not a fun place."

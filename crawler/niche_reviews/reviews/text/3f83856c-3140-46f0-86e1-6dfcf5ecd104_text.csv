Freshman,5,the valley is a amazon place to get to know your fellow students. the coaches make sure you are on track with your studies.
Freshman,5,I loved the fact that the teachers will work with you if you need more ono on one. I am enjoying the football team.
Sophomore,5,"Every faculty, professor or dorm personnel that we have worked with has gone above and beyond in helping us with any need. My daughter is a sophomore and has had the opportunity to join many groups and the participate on a school tennis team. Her professors and counselor have worked one on one with her to customize her degrees and what classes she needs to achieve them. AU has been an all around positive experience."
Freshman,5,I’m a coming into this school year as a freshman. The way Anderson has handled the Covid situation puts me at ease. They really put their students’ and faculty’s safety first! I’m really excited to be continuing my education at AU.
Freshman,5,"Because I am a freshman, I have not taken any online courses with AU. However, knowing the professors, I am sure that that they are well thought out!"
Junior,5,"My online experience with Anderson was good, my professors helped everyone adjust to school and being able to help us understand everything even without being in class and being able to have that hands on experience"
Junior,5,"What I like about Anderson is that the community is great, professors are always willing to help and there are many resources on campus that come in handy and it’s a very peaceful campus."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID-19 sending everyone home during the middle of a semester, it put all of the professors and students to the test on how to properly go about moving completely online. Every step of the way,  professors were encouraging, understanding, gracious, and checking in to see not just how we were doing academically but emotionally as well. They truly care about their students and how they are growing through new challenges. Regarding the academics, learning online was as smooth as it could have been with the short time that we were given to go online. Everything was easily accessible and professors made a point to send reminders out on due dates and upcoming assignments."
Junior,5,"I love AU because they practice what they preach. When you first visit the school, you meet so many people who tell you that the professors and students there really take the time to personally get to know you and are passionate about seeing you succeed. Within a week of being on campus and not knowing anyone, the school became a second home for me. I cannot imagine choosing a different university; they have pushed me beyond what I thought I could ever be capable of and they have provided me with experiences that I will cherish for the rest of my life. It sounds like a fairytale school and I won't lie, there are hard days. Its college, of course there are hard days. But when you are surrounded by people - who were once strangers - that now feel like family, the hard days don't seem so bad. I love AU and will talk them up to any and all who are interested in attending a university. They have helped me find myself and who I want to become. They are simply just the best."
Freshman,5,"Anderson University is a small, private school located in Anderson, Indiana. Since it is so small, you are able to easily go to classes and find your way around. It would be much harder at a school like Indiana University or Purdue University. The people at Anderson are also so loving and they deeply care about you. They want to see you succeed and will do everything they can to ensure this. The professor also have a deep connection with their students. They want that relationship."
Sophomore,5,I highly enjoy the embracing community that Anderson University has to offer. I'd love to see student opinions taken into consideration more but other than that the college is friendly and diverse.
Sophomore,5,"Teachers are amazing! Campus is small and classes are easy to locate. Coffee is just as good as Starbucks, if you don’t know what you want they have a mystery box to choose from! Only downfall is classrooms are a little outdated. Besides that great school to attend!!"
Niche User,5,Anderson University was very welcoming and had a friendly environment. They were very informative about classes and buildings and the athletics.

Freshman,5,The staff at Anderson University have been so supportive and helped me so much throughout my college search. I am so excited for my upcoming years at Anderson!
Sophomore,5,"I love the extracurricular activities my school offers, the classes offered, the professors, and students that I've made a great connection with. I would love to see more of diversity shown for the different cultures we have on campus. I would also love to see different events for the different religions we have on campus as well. Having a larger food variety would also be a great thing to offer for the students. We as students would love great food to make us feel more at home while at college away from home. The last thing I would love to see is water even when it's hot outside, and possibly pool parties at our campus pool."
Freshman,5,"Excellent professors, beautiful campus, and great food. They do a great job presenting the school to prospect students."
Sophomore,5,"Anderson is such a fun, beautiful, diverse campus. Every weekend, there is something fun to be apart of. Whether it is karaoke night or just a night where you can go to your RA's dorm room and hang out for the evening and eat pizza. The campus is beautiful even during the brutally cold winters. Anderson is also small enough that you can see the same people every day, but it is also just big enough where you are able to meet or see someone new every day which is amazing and I highly recommend."
Freshman,5,I love the environment that AU provides. The nursing program is extraordinary and the staff really focus on the students academics
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in high school.  I have visited Anderson University 3 times.  I have told my parents that this campus and school just feels right.  It's where I am most comfortable.  I liked the football coaching staff, the atmosphere, the friendliness of everyone.  It just feels like home."
Alum,5,My time at Anderson University prepared me well for my current career and was influential in my personal development. Would recommend to others.
Junior,5,"I love Anderson University. My experience here has changed my entire life and perspective on everything I do. The relationships I've created are second to none. I know going forward that my education is in good standing with professors I can rely on to make sure I have the adequate resources to accomodate a successful career. Despite being in a relatively low-income city, Anderson is incredibly safe. I can easily say that attending this university is one of the best decisions I have ever made."
Senior,5,AU has been a great university so far. They have small class sizes. The professors want to see you succeed. The majority of the students are nice and willing to help you find what you need or where you need to go.
Freshman,5,The college has an amazing campus. The people working there are absolutely amazing and will help you beyond belief! They have amazing athletic programs for basically all sports!
Freshman,5,"There is a huge emphasis on community. You will feel welcome here the moment you step on campus. Also, Anderson is at a great location and close to Indianapolis. The profs are extremely caring and will know your name."
Alum,5,"Anderson University (Indiana) is a small liberal arts university located about twenty minutes northeast of Indianapolis.  They have an excellent business school, knowledgeable professors who care about their students' success, an up-to-date wellness center, and a fun on-campus community of students."
Junior,5,I love the campus life they offer alot for is to do. But they need to build new dorms. Take a dorm at a time tear it down and build new . They also need better food.
Freshman,5,"I am a current freshman at Anderson University and I can safely say that I have fallen in love with the campus. The people here are so welcoming and will reach out to you in any way possible. The staff go above and beyond in making sure they know who you are, as well as being readily available if you need any help. The students here are all friendly and I can guarantee that you'll always see the students with smiling faces."
Sophomore,5,"There is no place I'd rather be than AU. AU feels like home. At AU you are not just a number but a person that is cared for by amazing professors. There are many spiritual formation events you can be apart of. The community on the campus is also great! If you want to get involved, you will love AU! AU is a great university!!"
Niche User,5,"Everyone is so kind and it is absolutely wonderful to be able to visit the school. My mom is an alum, and I get a personalized view of the school and so many cool stories. I love the community there, it is a wonderful place to be."

Sophomore,5,The environment at Anderson University reflects their Christian beliefs. The faculty and staff are welcoming and ensure to remember you and make you feel comfortable. The dorm rooms may not be the best but they work well for students. The layout on campus is not optimal because certain facilities are far away from students making it difficult to access.
Junior,5,I love Anderson University. It is a great place to go to school and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else!
Freshman,5,"I love Anderson University because not only do you get an amazing well-rounded scholarship, but you get a chance to really grow as a person and in your faith.

My favorite thing about Anderson is the community you build here and the safe, fun, loving, beautiful campus."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at AU! The professors are both extremely intelligent and compassionate. The campus is beautiful in the fall, and I enjoyed my time living in Morrison Hall. It is definitely a place where you find lifelong friends and mentors."
Freshman,5,"I really appreciate the community. There are so many good people, and almost everyone is happy to be met. The faculty, staff, and students are lively and friendly. 
There are also many ways to get good food or entertainment. The town of Anderson is small, but it has everything you need. If you need anything that is not in Anderson, travel just an hour to Indianapolis."
Sophomore,5,"Anderson University is my home. The first time I stepped on to campus I knew that was the college for me. The Christian community is amazing. You grow in every way possible- mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. AU offers it all and has amazing staff and professors that greet you less as a student and more as a friend."
Junior,5,"I love AU and it has become my home.  The professors are great and I am learning so much from them.  I feel when I graduate, I will be prepared for my future career and will be a well-rounded and educated member of society."
Freshman,5,"I love AU! It has a great community of students and faculty. All the professors want to help all their students succeed! I absolutely love being a part of this school. They have many different majors and minors, and if they don't offer what you want, they will help you find a way to get there! All of the faculty members are so motivated to help their students, and you can tell they all love what they do. The athletics programs are pretty great too! The coaches are invested in their athletes and want to help them achieve their best!"
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved Anderson University! The campus is awesome. Everyone there has a smiling face. The nursing program welcomed me with open arms, and made a serious effort to show me why they are the best. "
College Junior,5,Our professors are amazing at AU they want you to succeed and will do anything to help you. They make themselves available at all times and are easy to talk to and get ahold of.
College Sophomore,5,Career Day teaches students a lot about their future careers!
College Sophomore,5,"I would choose my school again because the faculty, staff, and students are very hard working."

College Student,5,"They provide tons of options for study abroad, getting jobs on campus, and internships."
College Student,5,The professors care you their student. They want to the succeed academically. They get to know their students well and about their lives.
College Student,5,The campus is very supportive in sports and clubs. They recommend getting involved on campus as much as possible.
College Freshman,5,"I did not know what I was looking for at college. I wanted a personal experience that allowed for much personal growth. I have found that here at Anderson University. The professors are especially helpful inside and outside the classroom. The people I have grown close to are amazing individuals with potential and that help me realize my own potential. Though we are a small school, I do not think that is something that limits what we offer to students. One of the biggest reasons I decided to come was for the Christian atmosphere. That is one thing that is definitely here among students and faculty."
College Freshman,5,We have an NFL football team that practices at our athletic complex so it is very nice.
College Freshman,5,I love the community impact.
College Freshman,5,In my first semester on the AU campus I have not heard of anyone's personal safety being compromised.
College Freshman,5,The classes are challenging but not impossible. Registration was easy and there's always a quiet place to study.
College Freshman,5,I love my school. My professors are always there to make sure I am succeeding and learning to my best ability.
College Sophomore,5,"Anderson University is HOME!  It is a great university and is my dream school!  It is small enough that I know all of my professors and can get one-on-one help.  I am able to be involved and get to know many of the students.  I love the feeling of community and the culture at AU.  There are many opportunities for service, mission, and culture trips to a variety of interesting places.  Anderson University is where I am meant to be."
College Freshman,5,I love Anderson University!  Classes are small and you get to know those in your classes very well.  I love the different places you can eat at on campus.  Mocha Joe's rocks! The Professors are very personable.
College Sophomore,5,"I've been at Anderson for two years now and I love it. Everyone on campus is friendly and willing to help out with anything you need. The cost to go to AU can seem overwhelming but it's worth the extra money. The Campus Activities Board, or CAB, put on many different events each weekend that allow the students to get involved and get to know each other. Classroom sizes are small enough to where personal attention from the professors is possible and they are all more than willing to help out if you need anything!"
College Sophomore,5,"I think the school does a great job of interacting social lives and academics with their students. Some people may say the rules are strict, but there isn't a curfew, the visitation for boys and girls dorms are reasonable, and the drinking policy is necessary I believe."
Sophomore,4,AU does a good job providing online learning. It’s just that the in-person classes and great professors are superior.
Freshman,4,The professors and support staff were wonderful during the transition to distance learning and throughout the year!  I have loved my experience here so far!
Junior,4,"Something I really love about Anderson University is that because the campus is pretty small, most of the professors are really caring and do as much as they can to help you out.
The students are pretty friendly too and it can be pretty easy to make some good friends by joining groups or clubs."
Junior,4,"Online classes were so different compared to their in person classes during the whole coronavirus. While a lot of the professors were understanding and did as much as they could to help students, it was a lot harder for me personally to actually learn and retain any information."
Sophomore,4,It was a great school to start off my college career with. It is small and close community. I would recommend this college to others looking for an environment like AU.
Freshman,4,this is my first year at Anderson university and I love it . All the teachers so far have wanted me to do well and reach out on their own . I like that it’s not a party school because it keeps my focused on what needs to be focused on .
Sophomore,4,"One huge thing I like about Anderson University it that the community is big in that city! I can even break it down to even the staff at Anderson University wants the students to succeed in life. You have so much support at Anderson with professors, staffs, coaches, and even friends. 

One thing I do want to change is the open house hours. I get that we are a Christian University but we should still get the opportunity to hang with the other gender."
Sophomore,4,"I love how small the classes are overall, and how the professors truly want us to succeed. Being someone who has a learning disability, having small class sizes truly help me feel less overwhelmed. I feel like I can truly talk to my professors about any concern I have about the class."
Graduate Student,4,The staff were super helpful throughout the entire admissions process. They made it so easy to complete and the system for online homework works way better than most I’ve previously worked with!
Junior,4,"Very good school. Good small, private Christian university. School is struggling a little bit, however enrollment is higher than ever and degrees are growing and expanding"
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have an experience from Anderson University that I will never forget. If there is one quality that stands out from the rest, it is the community. As soon as you walk on to campus, people make you feel welcome, and it feels like home. Every professor and staff is passionate about what they do and set fires within their students to achieve. The only problem I've had at AU is the food services, although, the staff are eager to hear students' opinions and fix the problem to benefit everyone. I love my school, and I would never choose anywhere else in the world to pursue my education."
Junior,4,I love the faculty here at AU. They truly make an effort to get to know the students and help them grow in their faith. I am so thankful to be a student here.
Freshman,4,"Honestly, the people are the best thing about Anderson University. The professors, staff, administrators, and fellow students truly want you to be on campus. You are constantly offered encouragement, support, and prayers. There are so many opportunities to grow, whether it be academically, physically, mentally, or spirituallly."
Niche User,4,Anderson University is a home away from home! Classes are amazing and always full of discussion. There is always something to do on campus. The community supports you. The food is delicious. Campus security is always driving around so you always feel safe.
Junior,4,Anderson University has a wonderful community of people. I love how the atmosphere fells at AU. The only thing I would like to see change is the dorm rules to become a little more flexible.
Sophomore,4,I really feel like I have had a lot of growth throughout my time at Anderson thus far. Although it was hard to start out on my own at first the welcoming and kind community and atmosphere quickly changed that.
College Sophomore,4,I feel good about job prospects
College Sophomore,4,I am on the volleyball team. I love my team!
College Sophomore,4,I am very happy at AU
College Sophomore,4,"Some things need improvement, such as the modernness of buildings, but it's a great campus and I will get the best education here."
College Sophomore,4,I was able to get the room that I was wanting thanks to Housing. They did everything they could to put me in the room I was asking for.
College Freshman,4,"The professors I have had in my first year have gone out of their way on many occasions to help students and to make sure they understand the material presented. Since it is a smaller campus, classroom sizes are smaller and students are able to have a better relationship with professors since there aren't 100 students in each lecture. I wish a wider variety of classes were offered in each department."
College Freshman,4,"The community is so great at AU, I think there's something for everyone there. Campus life is a little dry, not much happens on the weekends. The people are all very genuine and care about each other--same goes for the professors. I like the challenge that the liberal arts program offers, but sometimes wish there were more course opportunities available. The staff is short in some areas, but the teachers are passionate and have so much to teach students. If I could go back to when I made my decision of which college to go to, I would not change anything. I am so glad I chose AU, I love it here and I love all the people I have met so far."
College Student,4,Anderson University is a great community school. Everyone knows each other and the professors want the students to success.
College Freshman,4,"There is very little campus crime, the majority of it being simple stealing. Campus is a very safe environment. A police station is located on campus with on duty police officers at all times. There are ""Safe Havens"" that people can lock themselves into if they feel unsafe or if they are being followed. A police officer will immediately go to that spot and check on them. There are also safety poles with buttons to push for an emergency."
College Freshman,4,"With all of the courses I have taken so far, I have loved my professors. They are passionate about what they teach, they make the information enjoyable and interesting, and they go out of their way to make sure students excel."
College Freshman,4,"Living in the dormitory can be noisy, but it is an amazing experience. I have made many great friends and have had lots of fun experiences."
College Freshman,4,Students attend but the bleachers are not packed.
College Freshman,4,This was the only school I applied to because I did not want to go anywhere else. I have not been disappointed with my choice. There are so many fun activities almost every weekend. The campus is beautiful and the community is amazing. It feels like a huge family.
College Freshman,4,"The class size is always very small.  I love how personalized it is, and how the professors will just talk to you."
College Freshman,4,"Right now I live in Rice Hall, and I love it. Everyone who lives in Rice Hall are freshman girls, so the community is very good.  Before freshman year I filled out a survey to match me with my roommate, and it did a very good job of that.  Me and my roommate are like best friends."
College Freshman,4,"I really like AU.  The campus is small which fits my personality, and after just one semester all the faces are familiar. Everyone that I meet there is super nice, and loves going to AU as well.  It is a very uplifting community to be in."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very knowledgeable and there are a variety of classes to take. The class size is one of my favorite things about this school. They're small enough so everyone gets attention if they want it.
College Freshman,4,"Some of the dorms are better than other, but it just depends on the person and what they want. I love Morrison Hall and the friends that I've made there. The rooms are spacious."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus security is always on call. They will walk you to your car. They report all crime or suspicious activity to us. They help us with any car trouble and they are also AED and CPR certified.
College Sophomore,4,Our class sizes are very small. The biggest class size I have been is 100 people and that was Anatomy lecture. Our professors are very easy to talk to and are very understandable. We have a great variety of classes/courses that you can take in or out of your major.
College Sophomore,4,I am an athlete at Anderson University and we have a lot of school spirit. When the softball team travels to Florida we have students also traveling to Florida to support us. All our athletic teams are very close to one another and a community.
College Sophomore,4,Anderson University is a beautiful campus. The community of the school is very close and have great opportunities to not only serve Anderon University but also the city of Anderson as well.
College Sophomore,4,"A variety of majors, minors and classes are offered.  Access to professors is readily available.  Being a small school you get to know your professors.  The library is great for studying."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the dorms have been updated, so they are nice.  Rooms can always be larger, but that is at any campus.  The social atmosphere and the friendships that you can make with those in your dorm are great.  The dorms are close to most of my classes since the campus is small."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a 3 season athlete at AU.  I run cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track.  The Wellness Center at AU is state of the art.  The other athletic facilities are also very nice.  The athletic training staff is knowledgeable and very helpful."
College Freshman,4,Rooms are larger than most dorms.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing in the Falls School of Business, and I work as an assistant in the Recital Hall and as Professor's Assistant in the brand new Musical Theatre major. I am not a fan of chapel, and the Church of God theology does not agree with my personal beliefs, but I have found many people on this campus who I can agree with. Food is getting better, but has a long way to go. Residence halls are decent. I absolutely love my major, and my advisor is great, but I have heard from other students that the advising system overall isn't great."
College Freshman,4,Everyone who attends this University is so accepting and loving. They will strike up a conversation with you even if they had never met you. The professors are so open and will stop at nothing to help their students succeed!
College Sophomore,4,"I love AU! If I had to choose colleges again, I would not hesitate to choose Anderson a second time. It is a Midwestern Christian college and the campus life definitely makes this clear. I love this about Anderson. It feels very open and everybody is super nice. I love most of our campus events and since campus is so small it is so easy to see your friends anytime. For people who like to party all weekend however, AU campus life can be pretty dull."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Anderson. It wasn't a very hard decision for me, and if I had to do it again, I would. The small class sizes allow for good friendships made with peers and professors."
College Sophomore,4,I've received the necessary financial aid I need.
College Sophomore,4,"We have a variety of sports and clubs starting up! Recently, we added a lacrosse team and our rugby team is growing more and more. Our baseball and softball teams are awesome to watch. Many students go out to the sporting events to watch and cheer on our fellow Ravens!"
College Sophomore,4,Anderson has many events that CAB puts on and encourages everyone to attend! It builds community and allows for others to get to know each other on campus in a safe environment!
College Sophomore,4,There are many off campus dining places and all of them give a student discount for Anderson students. They know the campus very well and they are always welcoming to the students!
College Freshman,4,"My favorite is the laser tag in the library, you only have to pay $1 to play, and its a good way to have good clean fun on a friday night."
College Freshman,4,"I think that Anderson has the perfect amount of strictness.  They do not have curfews, yet they do not encourage drinking and drugs, it is a very safe environment."
College Freshman,4,"You get to meet a lot more people than you would expect, and you truly do meet your best friends in your dorm.  Everyone in the dorm becomes like your family and people you can turn to for advice."
College Freshman,4,There are safety services and health services that exists to protect students against sexual assault. Our counseling services here are excellent.
College Freshman,4,I love our facilities and being active. The varsity sports are supported but they could be more supported than they are. Intramural sports are very popular though.
College Freshman,4,"By party standards, AU does a great job of keeping everything AU appropriate."
College Freshman,4,"The polices that do exist are enforced, and enforced regularly and strictly. The enforcers  do a great job of keeping up with everything that happens on campus."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid team did a wonderful job. They were helpful and insightful on some of the decisions I was facing. They were able to walk me through everything I needed.
College Freshman,4,My school is great! The community is abundant with compassion and acceptance towards all kinds of students.
College Freshman,4,"off-campus dining is what gets you through the year. however the cost can add up, especially if you run out of meals/dollars, you're forced to go out and spend $8-$15 a meal per night. once again, student discounts at all the major chains nearby would be a HUGE blessing"
Freshman,2,"Anderson University is a terrible school. Everything from the food to the dorms, to the campus scenery is terrible, and for the tuition to be $40,000+ it is definitely not worth it. I would not recommend this school to anyone. It is a very unprofessional place of education, and not to mention there have been many break ins on campus, a majority of them have been dorm room break ins and security can't see anything on the cameras so they say. It's just an awful place to be."
Niche User,2,"Anderson was a very average school when I went there. Safe campus and good housing, but in my experience, most of the students were very closed off. Many of the student's parents were alumni and all knew each other from birth, so many of them already had friends attending there before they stepped on campus, so they were not open to making new friends. The town is awful, barely anything exciting to do there. Most people go home on the weekends, so it's a ghost town on Saturday/Sunday. Foods almost always awful. Sports are not important on campus, except to the athletes themselves. Academics are very average. Too many classes to choose from with very little professor diversity. Working there is great however. If you're planning on attending Anderson, look into getting a job on campus. Great people work in the offices."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much for students to do. It's pretty boring since I don't drink or so drugs. I usually go home on weekends
College Freshman,2,Students can get caught drunk and still participate in sports and not get into trouble academically.
College Freshman,2,"I still feel like I live at home with my mom. I need to be able to learn responsibility, time management, and maturity on my own."
College Freshman,2,Our athletic facilities are good. Our teams aren't always great
College Sophomore,2,"Typical cafeteria food, low quality, poorly made."
College Freshman,2,No fresh food all prefab
College Freshman,2,"parties don't happen very often here, lots of people go to other campuses if they really want to party"
College Freshman,2,"There are not many parties at Anderson. CAB puts on some events, but they are usually cheesy and once a month. Most students go home on the weekends so there is not too much to do."
College Freshman,2,The all freshman girls dorm is not the best. Its quite old and we have plumbing issues. There was mold in our showers! The rooms are oddly shaped and small.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at Anderson is virtually non-existing. First of all, they don't even call them fraternities or sororities. They refer to them as ""social-groups"". It really has little to no push here at Anderson."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of the sports teams are awful, but intermural are just as popular!"
College Junior,2,"Although the cost of living is quite cheap, there are no public transportation, no shopping nearby, no parks or recreations, nor any museums or cultural attractions."
College Junior,2,"Indiana's weather is never the way it is forecasted. If it is the same as the forecast, it's a rare event. Winter is long and spring and fall are short. I've never stayed in school to experience the summer, but I have heard it is humid during summer. But long winters with frequent snow, rain, hail, and sleet."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to get around the city, you will need a car!"
College Freshman,2,"Aside from the bookstore and a coffee shop/lounge area, the student center doesn't have anything. Chic-fil-a is coming, but construction is behind and one restaurant really isn't going to make the student center a social hub."
College Freshman,2,"Anderson has been struggling since the GM plant went out. It is not filled with a lot of low-income residents which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the crime rates have gone up and the ability to find safe, good-looking housing is a struggle."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have off campus parking. On campus parking is way too strict, especially for how little spots there are. They ticket everything. I'm afraid to invite friends over because they don't have a ticket and literally the campus police patrol the lots looking for cars without stickers or cars parked in the wrong areas. It is super annoying that we have to stress out about it."
College Freshman,2,"It is pretty bad here. And I'm not just saying that, I have had friends over from other colleges and they say the same thing. We are in a transition between caterers so there is only one main place to eat with practically two options. If you don't like one, most likely the line is huge for the other. If you don't like both, its pizza and hamburgers for the fifth time that week."
College Senior,2,"Its Indiana, so the weather is always changing, you just have to be prepared for the quick changes"
College Sophomore,2,"I brought my own printer so I don't have to rely on the school's. Some of the labs aren't open really late & that is when I usually am completing my projects.
"
College Sophomore,2,"Haven't had any internships yet, but it is required in my major. Professors try to point you toward an internship that is good for you. "
College Sophomore,2,"I am happy with my career choice..youth ministry. I am a little worried about the cost of my education and how hard it will be to repay my loans on my potential salary. I sometimes think I should have taken my pre-reqs at a state school, then transferred in to a Christian school for the classes pertinent to my major. I am a little concerned that I won't be able to find a full-time position in my field. I love the social opportunities I have had at AU. Looking forward to a missions trip to Uganda in May 2014."
College Sophomore,2,"Due to being a Christian college, most students come from similar backgrounds."
College Sophomore,2,"Some buildings need updated...especially the main dining hall and Rice Hall (freshman girls dorm). Furniture here is very old and worn. Some buildings have seen better days, while others are very modern and nice."
College Sophomore,2,"Right now they are renovating one dining area & adding Chick Fil-A, so options are more limited. Recently revamped our flex-dollars & can no longer use them in the bookstore or Mocha Joe's coffee house."
College Sophomore,2,It's the Midwest...weather can change on a dime
College Sophomore,2,I will officially apply to the social work program next year. 
College Sophomore,2,I have a small internship currently.  Anderson University offers many different connections to various internships.  
College Sophomore,2,"There are hardly enough parking spots and most are not even near the dorms. The freshman parking is far away. Also, the campus police are sticklers for parking permits and give tickets out. However, you can park wherever you want on the weekends."
College Senior,2,"Anderson is a good school but the thing I do not like the most is that the people are very cliquey and negative stereo types that occur, and the people could act fake for the most part. The freshman can be so annoying and most of them do not like to socialize with other people. I have to admit their are so many people who are shelter at this college."
College Junior,2,"Not a ton of diversity here, but what does exist is very well blended and nobody feels excluded"
College Junior,2,AU has very various group in general. It is hard to get along with americans because of cultural understanding.
College Senior,2,They help but only if you have no other option. I have received aid but only if I had an amount due that I could not possibly pay. The amount was also minimal compared to the tuition here.
College Senior,2,"While it costs a lot to go here, there aren't too many options for student activities on campus. Most of the money goes to the landscaping. There are ""planned activities"" but most of the time you go off campus for those."
College Sophomore,2,the city of Anderson is not what it used to be. The mall has lost a lot of stores but there are plenty of eateries in the local.
College Sophomore,2,"Since it is Indiana, the chance of weather changes are increased daily. The winters can be harsh with cold temps and snow or ice."
College Freshman,2,"There is a 'social club' life, and this involves 'surging' a particular club that generally focuses on public involvement and service projects. However, the surging experience is often based on harsh and time consuming activities."
College Senior,2,"Even after you are 21 you are not allowed to drink alcohol at home, off campus, or with your family. They expect you to not have wine at your wedding and if you get caught you could be put on probation or asked to leave."
Sophomore,1,"For the love of God, do not go here. Tuition prices are absolutely absurd for a supposed ""Christian college."" They purposely hike up the prices up to $44k a year then give you scholarships to make you feel like you're getting a discount when in reality you're getting conned. This university isn't even worth $20k a year. They want a diverse campus yet they force everyone to attend chapel 18 times a semester or else they get a $75 fine. Insane. Your tuition money is going towards paying chapel workers when demanding everyone to go to chapel is outrageous. Food is awful and there are little choices yet the meal plan is outrageous. Constant cross contamination in the food. Campus life sucks. Don't go here."
Freshman,1,"I can say the Professors and faculty at large are caring and very helpful. AU has potential, but needs to take a look at itself. This would be a decent school if tuition was not so expensive. After some time on this old and frankly dirty campus you start to wonder where all the money is going. Aside from that, the attitudes of some of the people on campus really bring down the experience for everyone. The average person stays in their own cliche the majority of the time."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have any Greek life, and but the clubs pretend they are Greek life. I think that some schools have very nice Greek life houses that are surrounded around the profession they are in, and I think that would really help the students and school."
College Sophomore,1,Students are encouraged to live on campus at least through their junior year. 
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have actual ""Greek Sororities or Fraternities"". We have ""social clubs"" which are similar. We have surge weeks instead of Rush week."
College Sophomore,1,"They offered a good scholarship initially, but appear to have no wiggle room if you need help down the road."
College Sophomore,1,Food on campus is not ideal.  
College Sophomore,1,"I gave Anderson University a ""D"" because the only time we have transportation is when there is severe weather and classes are not cancelled. We do not have public transportation that comes from downtown Anderson to the campus; students usually just car pool. Freshman are allowed to have cars on campus, but not everyone has one. Our security officers are always on call and can give students a ride from parking lot to parking lot, but our campus is small enough to walk about every where."
College Sophomore,1,"I gave Anderson a ""D"" because of their lack of support towards our sports teams. We have a lot of students who attend our school because of they will have a spot on our sports teams; however, our teams are not known for their winning streaks by any means. Although our school is made up of many athletes, our bleachers are pretty empty at each event. We have gerat training facilities for our athletes to use, because the Colts train there during the summer. IM sports are more popular than almost anything. Almost every one participates in IM sports at least once in their years at AU."
College Senior,1,There isn't any in Anderson because you cant go to bars and the activities the CAB puts on are rarely fun
College Junior,1,"It's a ""Christian School"" but many ladies will still judge guys based on whether they would date them and if the answer is no they will both refuse to talk to you AND lie to the police about you no matter how nice and respectful you are. Source: 3 years of personal experience."
College Student,1,"There really isn't anything to do in the small town of Anderson, Indiana. If you want to do anything, like go to a movie, be prepared to drive at least 30min. "
College Junior,1,AU does not have good or decent quality of food no matter what. They do not even check out before sending all food out to students. Lots of students got food poison from various places.
College Junior,1,"In order to get in to Greek Life, people have to pay money to get in."
College Junior,1,It is extremely hard to get public transportation.
College Freshman,1,"Anderson has specific parking for all grades.Parking is not convenient for freshman, but upperclassmen have fairly convenient parking. Freshman have the back of the lot, and that is NO fun in the cold. Permits are approximately 50$ a piece, and if you park in the wrong place, they ticket you a certain amount depending on the offense.  Ticketing and fines can be silly, but you can appeal them. Really, there is not much to do in Anderson, so needing a car is just dependent on having a job and how much you want to get away from school food."
College Junior,1,"The sports teams at Anderson University are not strong. I am an athlete on a varsity sport here at Anderson, and we are overlooked by many. Some sports teams, specifically mens, have a pretty good fan support and attendance can be somewhat high in the student section. The facilities are very nice and have been updated. There is room for improvement on the performance part of the athletics as well as the coaching."
College Freshman,1,"There are shuttles that run in the spring to local busines, like walmart and cvs. Other than that there are really no services unless you have a car of your own."
College Freshman,1,It's a Struggling City – Most of the fun/ restaurants are off of scatter field road. Many times it is a treat to go to Rickers (a gas station) to get ices. The town has a lot of crime you can hear a lot of sirens at night. Plus there is also a lot of trains at night. The mall is loosing it's anchor store of Sears. Most of the town is in poverty because many of the factories that had provided jobs for the town so many don't have jobs. Yet since Anderson is 30 minutes from Noblesville and 45 minutes from Indy that gives students things to do on the weekends.
College Sophomore,1,"Not a whole lot of parties here, they are around but are hard to find because you get in alot of trouble and most people dont come to the school to party"

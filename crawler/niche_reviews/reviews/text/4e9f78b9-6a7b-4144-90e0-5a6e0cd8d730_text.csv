Sophomore,5,Welch College has met all my academic expectations. They increasingly push me to do better and achieve my goals. They are Christ-centered and push me to love the Lord Jesus more and more. Come to Welch!
Alum,5,I felt the online classes from Welch were identical to the in-classroom classes. I never felt like I missed out on anything and I was glad to have the flexibility to do online work.
Alum,5,"My four years at Welch were some of the best years of my life. To be honest, I took the exceptional education I received for granted until I began my graduate work somewhere else and realized Welch had not only prepared me for the work, but placed me far and above my peers. Not only did Welch help me with higher-level thinking, but it taught me to see the world through a biblical lens and worldview. I wasn't just taught what to think, but learned how to think. On top of that, the friendships I made with both students and professors are friendships that will last a lifetime."
Alum,5,"Even thought I attended many years ago, I am so glad that Welch College has continued educating leaders to serve Christ and His world. Their Christian values definitely set them apart."
Alum,5,I have not taken online classes but have friends who have and had a great experience. They did not offer online classes when I attended.

Alum,5,"Welch College excels in providing a quality college education with a strong emphasis on spiritual formation and academic excellence. In addition, the campus community is not so large that students and faculty fail to feel like family. Whether a student hails from across the country or across the street, Welch College will go out of their way to make everyone to feel at home while preparing them for the future."
Works Here,5,"Attending Welch College was the best decision I could have made regarding my education, as well as my growth in faith. Welch enables its students to serve Christ by equipping them with a solid, Christ-centered worldview that prepares them to enter the work force, whether directly in ministry or in a more secular field. I believe that Welch College is for everyone seeking to mature spiritually, train for their chosen field of study, and transform culture in light of the Gospel of Christ."
Works Here,5,"While transitioning to a brand new campus in 2017, the school spent the first part of the second semester online. While this wasn’t ideal, the professors continued to deliver excellent lectures. My professors were easy to contact and provided an excellent learning environment online."
Junior,5,"Welch College is a wonderful community of friends and a great learning environment. When I moved to college, it was a scary thing for sure! But, as soon as I arrived on campus, everyone welcomed me with open arms. The professors are also very involved and make sure you are understanding the topics they are teaching. If you are considering attending Welch, I think you definitely should!"
Junior,5,"While I have never been a full time online learning student, I had to take a few classes online over the COVID-19 pandemic. The professors were just as involved online as they are in person."
Junior,5,Welch College is wonderful! I have truly enjoyed my time there. The faculty/staff invest in their student's academic lives providing ample opportunity for each student to succeed.

Junior,5,"I absolutely love Welch College. The community within Welch is amazing, but also the community surrounding Welch has been so loving. I love the community aspect within the campus, and I love that everyone can get to know everyone. There is always something going on that you can get involved with, whether it be volleyball or just hanging out on the quad."
Niche User,5,"I have not taken any classes online, but I know many have been complimentary of the professors and the the 6 week sessions."
Niche User,5,"The professors here truly care about their students, and the environment on campus feels like family."
Sophomore,5,"LOVE this college. It is a wonderful community and you will never find a place where the professors and staff care more about you and your education that at Welch. Not only that, but it accepts pell grants, gives scholarships based on gpa, and takes tennessee promise which is amazing for someone like me who struggles financially. Could not recommend this place enough."
Sophomore,5,Because of COVID we had to switch to online and I loved how caring the professors were. I have also taken online courses in another college and it didn’t compare to the quality of Welch.
Junior,5,"Although I haven’t taken a traditional online class at Welch, we did, like most other schools, transition to an online format when COVID-19 hit. The school did an excellent job implementing remote learning, even under the circumstances."
Junior,5,"Welch College provides a fantastic learning environment and is extremely focused on the growth of its students. The academics are rigorous, and the community is unlike any other. Faculty and staff at Welch are committed to excellency and their students, and they invest all they have to ensure that their students are taken care of, whether it be academically, personally, or spiritually. Overall, Welch College is and incredible institution."
Alum,5,The online program is well-ordered and helpful. It’s nice to take classes with the instructors who developed the material.
Alum,5,Welch made an incredible impact on my life. The professors and community are caring and compassionate.
Senior,5,"Professors were tough at times but focused on really learning the subject and went beyond the classroom to recommended further readings. They also were flexible with scheduling if I had personal things going on (Sick kids, PTSD issues, 60+ hour work week). I also know that many prayed for their students."
Senior,5,"Fantastic experience compared to the other two colleges I’ve been to. The professors are knowledgeable and devoted to the academic and personal growth of the student. The front office has been great and helped get my VA benefits without any work on my part. Specifically, Jena has taken care of making sure I have everything I need and was always helpful and understanding. I couldn’t recommend a better college or a better group of theologically conservative professors for an online student."
Senior,5,"I love the community of Welch College. In my four years as a student here, I have been surrounded by faithful and encouraging followers of Christ that have poured into my life."
Senior,5,"I have taken a few online classes, and in each class, my professors have proven that they love their students and wish to see them succeed. They make the workload manageable and consider all situations when determined assignments and class times."
Graduate Student,5,"I am in the middle of my fourth class in the ministry and theology masters program at Welch (having already completed an undergrad from the same college). The Lord has used the education I have received through Welch college to strengthen my faith and worldview from a Biblical perspective. Best faculty and staff who are there to help, guide, and pray for each and every student. I will forever be grateful for this institution of faith and learning."

Alum,5,I had little experience but what I did have was good! I know the offerings are so much better than when I was a student several years ago!
Alum,5,Welch is a truly awesome place! Top notch education and incredible people! I had zero trouble being admitted to graduate schools.
Junior,5,"Moving away from college was a scary thing. But the professors and students turned Welch into a home for me. Professors constantly reached out to me, & several upperclassmen took me under their wing. I have grown so much in just two years! The opportunities for ministry on and off campus have helped me grow skills I want to take into my future church and career. I am so thankful for my time here!"
Senior,5,10/10! I’m so glad I came to Welch College. I genuinely cherish the time I have been able to spend on the Welch College campus. The faculty and staff care so deeply about what they are doing and about each and every student. I have also made life long friends here. If you want a quality Christian education- Welch College is the place to be!
Senior,5,The Welch College faculty and staff work just a incredibly hard doing on campus classes as they do on online classes. Overall I had a positive experience!
Sophomore,5,"Welch college is an amazing school! When I first went there, everyone welcomed me and took me in. I felt right at home and felt that I was surrounded by people who would help me achieve my very best."
Sophomore,5,The professors were well prepared and did their absolute best to ensure that the students had all the information to complete the course.
Senior,5,"As a student, I've loved Welch as an institution,  a ministry, and what it stands for. The faculty and staff do their best to adhere to biblical principles and ensure that students are taught different subjects with a critical and thorough biblical background. Most of the students are men and women of outstanding character and are bound to be future leaders, whether in churches, businesses or even communities. The values and principles that Welch instills in the students are qualities that will remain with them for years to come and will bless those whom the students come in contact with."
Senior,5,"Taking classes online was well managed. The teachers were understanding or hardships due to online learning, and thus allowed for a relaxed yet dedicated environment for learning. Welch has done very well at accommodating for students who don't have the same means as others for online learning and provided aid for those in need."
Junior,5,Welch’s online learning courses create an aspect of learning away from campus that still promotes a strong education. The professors are able to interact with online students on a daily basis to ensure that they are still receiving the best education they can possibly offer.
Junior,5,"Welch is a fantastic college with a great community of students and professors. The new campus promotes lifetime friendships with a community of Christ minded peers. The staff and professors all take diligent time to invest in us students and make sure we are getting the most out of our classes and experience. The 10 to 1 student ratio makes it possible for us to ask hard questions in classes and to truly learn from the lectures. Welch is a college that cares about their students academics but also pushes them to grow in their faith as well. This is a place of community, faith, and learning."
Junior,5,"Though, it was a quick change from in person classes to online the professors did an excellent job transitioning. They made sure all of their students were keeping up with the change!"
Junior,5,"A great community for a higher education with a Biblical emphasis! The professors take time out of their schedules to get to know their students personally. This makes the learning environment a different experience than other schools. My favorite thing about Welch is the community of like-minded believers, and the kindness that is shown by them and the facility!!"
Freshman,5,I have been to this college so many times for summer programs and college visits. It has a beautiful campus and the environment is extraordinary. The students and teachers care deeply about one another and its such a healthy and loving space.
Alum,5,"Welch offers excellent academics and a faculty that strives to develop the whole person within a thoroughly Christian context. Located in Gallatin, TN, a suburb of Nashville, students enjoy the best of a small town environment with access to one of the most dynamic cities in the south."
Niche User,5,Welch has a really nice campus and friendly staff.  The grounds are smaller than most but have everything you need. They have a large gym and recreational area.
Junior,5,Welch College is the perfect fit for me. The community is amazing and the professors truly care about how you do in class. Welch College is one of a kind. Everyone is wonderful and very involved.

College Freshman,5,The financial aid workers here at welch are amazing they really go out there way to make sure you have everything in order and they are really understanding when u have an issue with something good or bad
College Sophomore,5,"There is a good amount of diversity on campus, and everyone seems to get along just fine.  There are different races, beliefs, and backgrounds, but we are brothers and sisters in Christ and that's what makes our bond so special. Of course, we have arguments, but isn't any segregation."
College Sophomore,5,"There are plenty of options to choose from since we are located in West End Ave, Nashville"
College Sophomore,5,"I Have Loved My Time at FWBBC! The Free Will Baptist Bible College is a place where I feel like I have a home. I am known by name by my professors and they truly care about how I am doing, not just academically, but also emotionally and physically."
College Freshman,5,"Nashville City!!! The Free Will Baptist Bible College is currently smack-dab in the middle of Nashville, TN. The Parthenon is the place to be with its huge park and epic scenery. We are also right down the road from cultural explosions like Vanderbilt and Belmont Universities. Nashville is an absolutely gorgeous place to be and to see the city at night is a real dream come true."
College Freshman,5,"Great Community – The Drug scene at FWBBC is virtually absent. Students are not allowed to drink, smoke, or use any tobacco products. We pride our self on our good Christian Community."
Sophomore,4,"My online classes have been wonderful, just as if we are all together in a classroom. They communicate well with the students pertaining to what is needed and expected. Any questions that we have are answered."
Alum,4,The classes that were offered were a good variety. It was easy to get in touch with professors when needed.
Senior,4,Most professors tried to imitate an in-person experience through the use of video calls and personal interactions.
Senior,4,"Welch is a highly academic school that takes great care for its students. Their classes are challenging, but interesting and preparing."
Junior,4,"Online classes were definitely a struggle for me, but all my professors were really encouraging. They were always communicating with us about what was coming up, and that really helped me out. Online classes included a lot of discussion boards, which was overwhelming."
Junior,4,"I love the fact that I have made life-long, spiritually-encouraging friends! It’s so refreshing to know that Welch cares about more than just the education of their students!"
Alum,4,I loved my time at Welch. The faculty and staff truly care about you and want to se etiquette succeed in life. The community is fantastic and it really feels like a home away from home while still getting a wonderful education.
Junior,4,"Online was not what I wanted, but the professors were very clear and did their best to adapt to online and tell us what was expected. It wasn’t ideal for any of us, but they were flexible!"
Senior,4,"Enjoyed my time at Welch. If you’re untested in a small school experience, this would be great for you. Some things could improve, but still overall a good place."
Senior,4,They were pretty good for having to be done at a moments notice due to the pandemic being worse than originally thought.
Sophomore,4,"Welch is one of the greatest schools in the U.S. The teachers are always there for you if you need help. they are there not just on school things, but if you just need someone to talk to."
Sophomore,4,It was very laid back depending on the teacher. I really enjoyed it. I did all of my online classes at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Freshman,4,"Welch College is a great, accredited college. It helps educate students, not only in what they are majoring in, but also in Bible. All students graduate with a Bible major, along with whatever other major they are studying. The atmosphere of Welch College is incredible. It feels like a family. Also, with it being a small college/campus, there is a lot of one on one interaction with professors and a greater chance of success! Welch college is an amazing place to be!"
Freshman,4,"It is a very small and intimate college. I feel safe here, however some of the advisors and teachers can be a little clueless sometimes. No one seems to be on the same page. The classes are good and the teachers will work with you if you need it."
Junior,4,I like the small school atmosphere. This gives you an easier chance to have one-on-one with the teacher no problem. The teachers make sure that they can help you in any way necessary. The only thing I can truly say needs improvement is the food. They need to find a different way to enforce better/healthier food. Since the food is not desirable at all students are losing out on the food portion of the tuition and spending more because they eat out.
College Sophomore,4,It's called societies at our college and mines great.
College Freshman,4,there is always a variety of choices and most are very good to eat.
College Freshman,4,people from all over the country come here to study
College Freshman,4,I have never really felt like i was going to be in danger. I can honestly say i can jog a mile and an half at 10 o clock at night and know that nothing is going to happen to me. They even send an email out telling us how the crime rate in our area is.
College Sophomore,4,"I chose Welch College because I can get an awesome Christian education while also getting my degree in Biology, which I will use in Physical therapy.  Most of my professors so far have been really great and helpful.  The curriculum is very similar to other big colleges, and they help you get what you need to have an adequate degree in what you are studying."
Niche User,2,Cheap campus for the cost. The college offers a competitive financial aid program but I just don't see why anyone would go to this college. It has potential but it's far from it at this point.
Niche User,2,The college is newly built but is very small and lacks any college life whatsoever. The area it's in is a bit of a drive to nearby cafes or libraries
College Sophomore,2,The gym has no air condition or heat. The excercise equipment is falling apart.
College Freshman,2,"Small Conservative Community – The Free Will Baptist Bible College does have a lot of white people, and sadly to say that the few black students that we have are the majority of our sports, but overall FWBBC is extremely accepting of any ethnic or social background. The college is here to give everyone a true biblical experience and who are we to deny anybody a christian education no matter who they are."
Alum,1,"Their teaching system was good, but their grading system was stricter than average, which effected GPA (Example: To get an A grading, you needed 93.) There are cameras everywhere and the curfew is 11:30 pm. It's a helicopter parent's dream place.

There some slavery apologists and very misogynists ideas taught on campus within the teacher and student circles. I'm 75% sure my Western Civ professor was a nationalist. Oh yeah, and they publically kicked out a student just for being transgender. Yikes."
Alum,1,"This place is an unprofessional mess. They will do anything to make a quick buck off a student even if it makes their institution look bad. I've taken classes from several colleges, and this is the far worse of them all."
College Sophomore,1,It's terrible. There's no room for anything.
Recent Alumnus,1,Pretty Harsh – the campus does not take any stuff when it comes to the safety of theor students.They take any and ever step available to keep the campus crime free.

Junior,5,Peru state has honestly been such a great school for me! It has shown me what it looks like to truly have educators who care about their students and want to see them succeed which is hard to find sometimes at schools. I always know that I can go to my teachers at any point during the week and not only do they remember me personally but they are so willing to sit down for however long it takes to help me with any problem I have.
Junior,5,I have taken a few classes online at Peru state and honestly I can say the teachers did a great job making sure that the online class was gaining all the material they could about the course and made sure we were actually learning!
Junior,5,My Major is in Business Administration Management with a Minor in Computer and Information Systems Management. All of my classes are online. I am able to work full-time and attend classes full-time (12 credit hours per semester). Cost per credit hour is the same amount for everyone nationwide. Course assignments are reasonable and relative to required materials. I am anxious to graduate and feel confident that my experiences and education will help me acquire the certifications and position I desire.
Sophomore,5,Academic advising and getting started in your application process was very easy and everyone was very nice and helpful. Peru is a great college for the price compared to other colleges. They also have very good online class opportunities for people that have difficult work schedules and still want to get a bachelor's degree to further their education.
Freshman,5,This is my first year in college and I must say that it has been a wonderful experience. The staff was extremely wonderful and everyone worked with me with a sense of urgency to make sure that I got all my paper work in a timely manner. The counselors were excellent and extremely helpful in guiding me through my courses and explaining all the classes that I needed in order to complete my study.
Niche User,5,The faculty is very accommodating. Because it is a small school you can get 1 on 1 help with the professors.
Sophomore,5,"Peru State College is an amazing college. Everyone here is so nice and understanding! If you have a problem, the professors are willing to help you right away. It is a campus that you feel welcomed on!"
Senior,5,I love the diversity on campus and how all the teachers make you feel welcome and let you know that there door is open if you need advise. One thing I would like to see in the future is for there to be more degree options such as social work.
Graduate Student,5,Very good staff. Easy to navigate through your program of study. Great value for the education. Like getting a degree from a big name college without the cost.
Graduate Student,5,"The overall experience at Peru State was awesome.  This is not an ivy league school, but for the value and not having a load of school loans it is excellent. Within a few months of my graduate degree in organizational management, I received a promotion on my job to around 110K per year, not bad.  The office goes out of its way to make sure you are successful as well.  I was able to pay as I go and now I have a great paying job without a lot of school loans to pay back. TAKE that Bigger schools."
Junior,5,I have been at Peru State College on and off over the past 5 years. The teachers have been excellent in helping me find what I love and what career I want to pursue. They are very helpful when you have questions and their classes are rotated each year based on your major of choice.
Junior,5,Peru State College has such a friendly atmosphere. It is a small college and the professors really care about you and are always willing to help if needed. I love the small town atmosphere and the smiling faces that you always encounter on your way to class.
Freshman,5,I would like say that Peru state is a great college is has given me a great start to my college experience socially academically and mentally I am prepared for the next for years
Niche User,5,"At Peru State College, I feel at home. The entire campus is beautiful, and the brick buildings add to the beauty of all the trees. The staff is also very wonderful at Peru State. They are very kind and their main goals are to see you succeed. The students are also wonderful at Peru State College. Everyone you meet is so welcoming and kind to you."
Sophomore,5,"I love Peru State College. Even though the environment is definitely small town living, a city girl like me still loves her small college. All my professors so far have been wonderful and very helpful. Each professor I’ve had wants to see every single one of the their student succeed. I know will have a great future with a degree from Peru State College! Peru offers a wide variety of activities on campus for each student to do. All our sports teams are very successful and with it comes a great feel of community when the teams are
successful. Peru also has a wonderful theater and music department. We are a well rounded college! Go Bobcats!!"
Freshman,5,"I love Peru State College. There is a huge sense of community here and there is nothing better than that on a college campus in my opinion. It is super easy to get involved in clubs on campus, and easy to connect with teachers and students in the class room. I would like to see more activities on the weekends besides football or basketball games, but those are still always fun."
Sophomore,5,The people on and around campus seem to really care for the student and the college's well being. They all seem to want to better the school and make sure that they continue to get the funding it deserves even though it is a small school.
Freshman,5,"Peru State College offers many majors and no matter what major you choose you will be satisfied with the education that you are receiving. I am currently majoring in Kinesiology. My professors are very professional and teach very well. One of my professors is an ex Navy SEAL. This means that Peru State hires professors that know what it takes to be successful and that they know what are talking about and will work hard to make sure that the students get the best out of their education. I am also a college football player here at Peru State. The coaches here are fun and energetic and know what it takes to be successful on the field, classroom, and on the field. My experience here at Peru State has been absolutely awesome and fun. I highly recommend taking your education to the next level here at Peru State."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere is great, the professors truly care. It's also very affordable for a state college. I've made many friends while here, and have learned so much."
Junior,5,"So far Peru State has been amazing. from the classes to the campus activities. I like how the college look, it is kind of like a gothic style. I love this college because it is far enough from the city, but at the same time is really close to the city."
Junior,5,This is a campus you have to experience to understand. I know so many students that scheduled a visit as a joke and ended up falling in love with the school before they left. If you want an affordable and quality education I strongly suggest you schedule a visit.
Senior,5,"I love Peru State College; it truly has become a second home to me. The faculty and staff take the time to get to know you and genuinely care about you. The college is very in touch with the surrounding communities, providing students with many ways to build their portfolios and gain experience. If there was one thing I could change about the campus, it would be the food."
Alum,5,I loved that my instructors knew me by name and were always willing to assist you to do your best.  Both faculty and staff seemed to have a genuine interest in my success.
College Senior,5,We are a very diverse campus and try to appreciate everyone for their own beliefs and background.
College Senior,5,"I have had class sizes that are as big as 20 to 30 students to a professor and then classes as small as 7 or 8 students to a professor, but the class size makes giving presentations a lot easier.  Classes always have a lot of substance and therefore they have great quality to each student's academic program.  Students are responsible for choosing and organizing their four-year plan for their academic program and they can choose to take their classes online, hybrid, or face-to-face but they must be aware of the class rotation as well as financial aid."
College Senior,5,"We have a variety of athletic activities, but school spirit and facilities are just as top-notch as our teams!"
College Senior,5,"Campus Security is always willing to give students rides and tips on how to stay safe around campus.  I personally do not walk alone at night, but during the day I do, and I always try to use the buddy system when I can!"
College Senior,5,Peru State is my dream college! It's affordable and my home away from home as a future teacher!
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes were exactly what I was looking for. They are big enough so group discussions are enjoyable but also small enough where the professor has the ability to learn a students name
College Sophomore,5,The professors are very friendly and willing to help. The college also has a very friendly atmosphere
College Freshman,5,"I have never heard of rapes occurring on campus. That does not mean that it has not happened, I just have not heard of any. Campus security can easily be reached, and will come pick you up and take you place to place on campus if you call them and ask them to. I have heard of people stealing people's possessions in the dorms. Both times police has gotten involved, and both times the possessions were returned to the person who was missing them. I feel very safe and protected on campus."
College Freshman,5,The professors always make sure you know the material and feel comfortable in the class. They have study groups before tests. A lot of professors give extra credit to those who go above and beyond. The classes are very challenging. The only thing that is terrible about Peru and the classes is that it is hard to get the classes that you need. The classes always overlap each other so you are stuck with the minimum or less credits that are needed. Then you have to take online classes that are really expensive. I do like the class sizes. They're very small.
College Freshman,5,"There are people on campus willing to help with job applications, interviews, etc. There is a building that will tell you what internships are available for you."
College Freshman,5,I love Peru State because it very small and friendly. The teachers genuinely care about every student. The teachers make sure that the students understand the material being learned. The professors also have a lot of open office hours. The students can go in and get help on any homework whenever it is needed. I like how with my art program the professor has a lot of time to focus on every individual student. He makes sure that everyone's art work is the best it can be. I like how the school is really small and affordable. Everyone at Peru State is really friendly.
College Junior,5,"I love Peru! My only regrets that I have (if any) are transferring from Metro Community College and then coming to Peru as a junior, but I understand that college is always going to be something expensive that costs a sufficient amount of money."
Recent Alumnus,5,"It is a small town with not much to do.  However, it is a beautiful campus and it feels like home to me since I grew up in a small town just like Peru."
Recent Alumnus,5,Athletics are a big part of our school both for the athletes and the fans.  Everyone shows their school spirit by attending sporting events and cheering loud.
Recent Alumnus,5,It is really easy to apply to the education program and getting into it.  It is important to get all of the paperwork in early.
College Senior,5,Are facilities are being updated as we speak.
College Senior,5,There are only about six to eight students in my math courses.  Very small town feel with a lot of one on one availability.
College Sophomore,5,I'm very grateful I chose Peru.  I couldn't imagine going to another school.
College Senior,5,The new Oak Bowl is bringing a lot of excitement to Peru!
College Freshman,5,I can always go to my RA to talk about something if I have a problem.  The campus always has lots of fun events and ways for students to keep busy.  The library is a great place for me to study if my room is too loud or crazy.
College Freshman,5,The facilities are always kept so clean and the staff here is incredible.  
College Junior,5,We are just about finished updating the football field and it looks great! Our weight room is a great size and accessible for both athletes and non athletes. The fans are great and some even travel to away games to support the bobcats!
College Senior,5,My advisor helped me every step of the way.
College Senior,5,Peru State sends out daily emails about internships.
College Junior,5,"Weather is great! I mean in the Mid-West you never know what your going to get, but when the sun shines everyone is out and when it snows we bundle up by the fireplace in the library."
College Junior,5,"Our campus is small so transportation is not needed really, but for event and for clubs transportation is always provided."
College Junior,5,Peru is very well at keeping rules and having student abide by them! Academics and social lives are encouraged!
College Freshman,5,The employees work all the time. they really do a great job
College Senior,5,It's fun because you get to experience a lot more than just one area.
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of spirit from people who don't go to the school
College Junior,5,"Time of My Life! I have only been attending Peru for one year, but it has been amazing. I have so much fun. I have also met a lot of great people. They say that college is the time of your life, and it really shows me that people are right!

I'm having a blast, and could not imagine going anywhere else for my schooling."
College Junior,5,"A Good Time – The students of Peru always have something fun and interesting going on!

Whether is it campus activities or off campus, there is always something to do."
College Junior,5,Not Known – The drug scene on campus is not noticeable at all and no one talks about partying.
College Junior,5,The ladies in the financial aid office are so helpful and knowledgeable.  The aid is processed quickly and accurately and is available at the time they say it will be.
College Junior,5,Personal Safety – When I am on campus I do not feel scared.  I think that this is the safest campus around even at night time.  There are some security around but I don't think that is necessary.  The other students are well behaved.
College Junior,5,Registration Process – The registration process at Peru is simple and quick.  The classes are available and I couldn't be happier to have gotten all of my classes.
College Junior,5,"Awesome Computer Lab – The computer lab is very accessible and user friendly.  There are two of them on campus and never completely full.  You have access to printers, staplers and any other accessories you need to finsh papers or make copies."
Senior,4,I have taken all my classes online and have had a good experience with it.  The content has been easy to access and the instructors a good job of organizing the online content.
Senior,4,Peru State College allows me to earn my degree all online which helps me still take care of my family.
Freshman,4,I’ve been here a little over a month now and don’t have a single con! There’s such a community feeling here and it feels so cozy and homey. Everyone is so friendly and there’s such a positive environment. I only lack one star because I feel like I still have a lot to see since I’m only a freshman!
Sophomore,4,"Fall of 2019 I will be entering my second year of college at Peru State and I cannot wait to go back. I fell in love with the campus, the students and the faculty. Peru has a way of making it feel like at home even though you are obviously not. I have met some life long friends there in just one year so waiting to see how I come out in four excites me. I am on the volleyball team and the whole team is like a family. you see all of us always together and always doing something rowdy and loud, whether it be in the café or the quad or the dorms. The only thing that I would change is the flooding that happened to our school. With the Missouri river sitting right next to us it flooded the town and our water supply. Peru does not have their own source of water for a while and II just wish that I could fix that for them."
Sophomore,4,"Its a very small but very beautiful campus, one of the most affordable too. I'm no master salesmen; but when I went and talked with all the professors and saw the campus with my own eyes, I could see that it had a good environment for work, study, and emotional growth. The college is very well suited for any and all students looking to make a start!"
Senior,4,"I have been working on my degree through the Online option offered by Peru State College. The professors have been very nice, communicate well, and are friendly. They offer a helping hand when needed and are available for questions."
Alum,4,Great experience. Peru State is a quiet place to study. The Campus is amazing. The College offers a mix of online and traditional classes. They are always available to students to help them. Have good teachers. We are all one family.
Freshman,4,"I am a commuter so it was difficult to make friend. I do wish I lived on campus. Other than that, the teachers are so nice and sociable. They help with anything you need, and they know their stuff."
Niche User,4,I love the campus. It's beautiful and the people are nice.I would like to see there be more sport options like girls track.
Freshman,4,"I love attending Peru State College. It is a very small campus, which allows for more of a community feel and that is one of the many reasons I really enjoy the school. The smallness of the school is a good fit for me because not only is it more of a community feel, but all of the professors know who you are personally. For example, my major is Vocal Music Education. My class has three students in it, including myself. It gives the professor a greater knowledge about each of us and that makes me feel very comfortable.
I am a very big fan of my dorm. Eliza Morgan Hall was just renovated in 2012, so the rooms are very new and modern and that makes it feel a lot more like home.
If there was one thing I could change about Peru, it would probably be the safety of the dorms. There is only an RA in the office two hours a day (7pm-9pm) but there are many people who do not live there, men mostly, that are constantly walking in and out without an escort. It concerns me a little."
Sophomore,4,Small school. very friendly staff and professors. small class size means teachers get to know you and truly care about your advancement in college.
College Senior,4,"Drugs are only available at parties as far as I know. I am not a big party person, but I have noticed on the website that there is a fine for any student(s) caught for smuggling drugs or alcohol into the dorms or on campus, so drug safety is pretty high."
College Senior,4,"The cost of housing is the most expensive payment for students living on campus, but meal plans are added in so they cost about as much. The dorms are up to date as much as possible except for the boy's dorm Delzell which is looking at being remodeled this August, so that's exciting."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are really great about bringing prospective employers in and having students visit and learn from them
College Sophomore,4,I live slightly off the main campus and I feel safe walking to and from classes
College Sophomore,4,"I might be a little bias since I am on the Women' Cross Country team, but I feel like the athletes are very good about supporting other athletes and non-athletes."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people only go to Peru for sports. I get really annoyed that the athletic people are only at college for sports.  They do not care about their school work. The school spirit is not great.
College Sophomore,4,It is a nice small community. All the professors and other faculty are helpful and friendly. You are truly able to develop great relationships with a great deal of people.
College Senior,4,There is a huge variety of age and nationality students
College Senior,4,The professors are experts making it easier to communicate with them
College Senior,4,I live in a home I own
College Senior,4,Everything online has worked well
College Senior,4,Well designed and easy to access
College Sophomore,4,I love the small atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"I know for most people, this college is too small, but for me it is perfect. I love how close everything is, and how much one on one attention you can get with the Professors and faculty. The only I wish was different about the college was that it was closer to a town/city. It is not bad if you have a car, but for those of us that dont, it makes it a bit difficult sometimes. But like I said, other than that, I love it here."
College Freshman,4,"The only down fall here is that if you're someone who likes to lift, unless you're football player it's almost impossible. Otherwise I love it here!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a lot of different religions, races, and diversity on campus.  It is nice that everyone is accepted just as they are."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel really safe on campus.  I am able to walk to and from my night classes by myself without feeling threatened.
Recent Alumnus,4,Living on campus is great.  The dorms are within close proximity to all of your classes.  Pretty much everyone is really nice who live in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,"Yes, we have had one really bad incident but since then campus security has really beefed up. If you ever feel unsafe for any reason or just don't want to walk alone, you can always call campus security and they will gladly give you a ride to wherever you need to go. We recently installed new security cameras. I think they are doing a great job."
College Freshman,4,"We have one bar that serves AMAZING food! Zach's is a nice to place to go with friends and have a fantastic burger after a long week. But sadly it's the only in-town dining option unless you order Casey's pizza, which is still really good. There isn't much here, but what is here is great. If you really wanted to you could go to Auburn or Nebraska City for food."
College Freshman,4,"Apply your heart out! It doesn't seem like there are a lot of scholarships or financial aid options, but once you start trying the process it's fairly easy to get money if you need it."
College Sophomore,4,Its great if you push for it to get done
College Freshman,4,"Many people are open to others differences, and encourage them to be different."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are here for a reason. They provide great one-on-one time for their students and ask lots of questions to make sure you fully understand.
College Freshman,4,"There are lots of tutors available if you need them, fairly easy assignments."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of pride in our school's sports!
College Freshman,4,There are lots of old houses available at a reasonable cost if you are willing to live with others.
College Freshman,4,security walking on campus bathrooms cleaned daily
College Senior,4,You really have to get use to the small town way in order to enjoy the campus and all of its beauty.
College Sophomore,4,"Peru is known to be a teaching school, which I am going into.  Also, their science program I heard is good."
College Sophomore,4,"As I said before, curriculum and professors are good."
College Sophomore,4,"We're like a big family; every team supports each other (sometimes not so much for the cheerleaders, as I am one).  Also, the gym and weight room are a popular place to go to."
College Sophomore,4,"Since it is a small town, you have to make your own fun most of the time.  The amenities serve well."
College Sophomore,4,"You'll always get some bad professors, but overall they're great."
College Sophomore,4,"The only problem was parking last year.  People got a lot of tickets because there was overcrowding in parking lots.  To solve this problem would be to build more lots, which I believe they are in the process of."
College Sophomore,4,"No one treats others if they are ""different"" from themselves."
College Sophomore,4,They have an example schedule of the classes you should take each year.  The only problem I have is that there are some advisors not so helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't started my actual program classes yet, just got done with Gen. Eds.  However, I've met some of the professors I will be having and they seem great."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not had any problem or issue with safety and security on campus.  The only thing I would like to have is more lighting on campus when it's dark, which they are currently working on."
College Senior,4,Peru has both the new and old. It is a beautiful campus with all the trees.
College Senior,4,I have recieved scholarships for tuition and also to study abroad.
College Senior,4,We have great diversity on campus.
College Senior,4,This school is small allowing people get interaction with the insturctors in their major area.
College Senior,4,Everyone seems to get along here. There are not too many social groups determined by style or interests.
College Junior,4,I think that the parking isn't bad. There is always plenty of spaces and they are in a reasonable walking distance from both the dorms and campus.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is very friendly and polite. Most people get along with everyone and there isn't much drama. Most people dress the same, the guys in jeans and a t shirt and girls in something cute and comfy. "
College Junior,4,I feel safe at Peru State and I personally don't see a lot going on around the school. 
College Junior,4,"I am extremely happy with the Sports and Excercise Science program that I participate in at Peru State College. If I had the chance to do anything over, I definitely would not. In the future I plan on perusing a graduate program for physical therapy and obtain a DPT. Due to the fact that acceptance into physical therapy programs is extremely competitive, I do have a back up plan in case I do not get accepted into a program. The second plan that I have is pursuing a masters degree in both business and public health."
College Sophomore,4,"When students park in their own designated lot, parking is great. However, during lunch and dinner hours, it's difficult to find parking because your spot may get taken by someone without permission to park there."
College Freshman,2,"I live on campus, but I would REALLY like to no live on campus. There are students who live in houses that are closed to campus than this complex. I'd like not having the hassle of Res. Life. Maybe meet some new people? I guess if you don't know anyone living off campus is only a dream. I'm assuming the houses that are rented out to college kids are mostly referrals year after year."
College Freshman,2,It is bad because we are located in a very small town that has no options. It is rather annoying because the local gas station closes at 11. And everything else is 20 minutes away.
College Freshman,2,You have to keep asking the financial aid office about scholarships and it is a pain in the butt. I still did not get all the scholarships they had offered me. It is just a very ongoing process.
College Freshman,2,The food here is terrible. They serve the same things on weekends and it is very repetitive. The only good thing that they have is the Bob and they offer a variety there. The only problem with the Bob is that it is only open during lunch and late night. It would be better if it was open for dinner as well.
College Sophomore,2,I was once an athlete at Peru State College and decided not to return to being an athlete here due to the poor quality of coaching and facility accessibilty.
College Freshman,2,"The didning halls are always kept clean. The food options are fairly disgusting with little variety, and there are only three places to eat on campus with little variety and odd hours."
College Freshman,2,"My roommates and I have had lots of problems with our dorm, starting with our hot water consistently dripping, to mold, to our bathroom door not shutting, to weird yellow drippage on the walls, to our AC unit dripping, and then our hot water not working. It took several submitted notices for things to be fixed, and we still don't have everything fixed."
College Senior,2,"We have a lot of hills, there aren't to many convenient handicap accessibilities."
College Sophomore,2,"There is one restaurant/bar in town, the rest is 10-20+ minutes away, depending on where you want to go. If you don't want school food and bar food, you have to drive out of town in order to get something else (unless you order Casey's pizza)."
College Sophomore,2,"Almost everyday food is horrible, but sometimes such as on holidays food is good. There is not much to do on campus most of the school activies aren't interresting but anyone can joyin just for the fun of it. I like the buildings how they are clean from outside to inside, and around the campus looks nice. Most importanly to me and other students is that the campus should have a day once a month or twice where the whole campus students get together and do something fun on campus."
College Sophomore,2,There is a very limited choice of off-campus dining and it becomes very frustrating. The nicest sit-down restaurant we have is El Portal which is Mexican. There is no where to eat in Peru except ordered Pizza from the gas station. Other than that you have to drive at least 15 miles to get food.
College Student,2,The food is decent but there are times when I wish I didn't have to eat in the cafeteria.
College Sophomore,2,It wouldnt be that bad if the town wasnt so small. It seems like everyday is the same. Everyone is super friendly though.
College Sophomore,2,Every girl that is attractive seems to be in a relationship. the Guy to Girl ratio at parties is ridiculous. Its like every guy is going after the same girl
Recent Alumnus,2,Need More to Do on Weekends. The town is dead on weekends. The campus needs to plan more events like bbq's or mock olympic games-not just for the freshmen.
Recent Alumnus,2,"More Drinking/Drugs Than Housing Knows – Even when health and safety checks are conducted there is alcohol and drugs hidden in plain sight. For example, a mini fridge full of alcohol temporarily disguised as an end table with a sheet or blanket."
College Junior,2,Water & Heat – The drinking water is HORRIBLE at peru. The heat in my apartment is virtually non-existent. I have to use a space heater & electric blanket to stay warm. The apartment itself is decent & has plenty of space.
Recent Alumnus,2,it snows or you dodge mosquitos – I hope you like snow because it will be on the ground from late november till mid march. It isnt the snow that is the worst part but the cold and the wind. burr. When it does warm up the mosquitos from the missouri river flare up and it is a race from building to building. Not fun.
College Senior,2,"Needs Some Major Improvement – THANKFULLY the caf has started up a comment board where students are able to write down what they would like to see - and then the caf staff posts their replies to the comments. Not too long after someone complained about the spinach, there was more spinach. After I mentioned that I would've liked to see certain cereals, at least one of the cereals came back.

Two things that need MAJOR improvement: labeling, and availability.
I have a close friend who is a vegetarian, and when he comes to visit on campus we usually do NOT go to the caf because we would be paying for him to stare at all sorts of foods that he can NOT eat - he's been a vegetarian for well over a decade, so if he eats any meat it'll make him sick. This also includes rice pilaf, amazingly enough. I was informed that rice pilaf actually contains chicken broth. In addition to having more choices available, because I have since found more vegetarian students on campus who ALSO have issues with the food, I would say that to label of whether or not something is ""vegetarian"" would be nice - and I don't mean like the smarty-pants who labelled the grilled cheese sandwiches as vegetarian.

The food needs to be labelled. I have seen brownies where they either have peanut butter or some kind of nuts in them - and sometimes you don't find out until you take a bite. Actually labeling these better, instead of just saying ""has nuts,"" would be extremely helpful. I have a cousin who's allergic to peanuts. Just because he's allergic to peanuts doesn't mean he's allergic to walnuts or soynuts or, if we're being obnoxious here, coconuts. It means he's allergic to peanuts.

We need more options that are healthier. Just because you provide a salad bar doesn't mean everybody else is going to eat it, and just because I want to eat healthier doesn't mean I'm going to eat at *only* the salad bar for a month."
College Freshman,2,Most of the off campus housing are run down to college students and thier unresponsibility behaviors.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Off-campus dining includes = Casey's and a bar and grill, I think. There's not a lot. You'd have to drive to get anywhere different. It's pretty bad, but if you're broke who cares, right? And if you have a little money? You still have to pay for gas."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing is here, and when I mean nothing.... Literally there is nothing here. It is a town of 800 people. The college is bigger.."
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek life so I feel i do not pertain to these questions.
College Freshman,1,There is only one off-campus restaurant and it is just like any other small town burger joint.
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing much to do here, the next closest town is 17 miles from here and coming from a student with no car, there isn't much I can do independently as far as shopping goes, I need to go with a friend or borrow a car."
College Senior,1,"We have no Greek Life, we're too small town."
College Freshman,1,"I just always hear people talking. It doesnt really reflect the college, but it just shows the student body in a bad light."
College Sophomore,1,"The off-campus dining in Peru is terrible. There is one restaurant that I have never heard one good thing about, and then we have a Casey's gas station and that is it. The pizza at Casey's is the only good thing in Peru to eat and after awhile you get sick of that and it gets to be very expensive."
Recent Alumnus,1,90% White Nebraska kids – My roommate was from central Nebraska and confessed to me early in the year that he had only seen 10-15 black people in person ever! At social events and dinner the black students always kept to themselves in the back of the dining hall and pretty much were forced to stay there for the most part. Not much diversity.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The complex of nothing – The complex is the only way to go. Not because they are great(built in 1976 kinda run down) but because Morgan hall(for girls) and Delzell hall( guys) are terrible. Morgan is getting renovated but it is taking a long time and the building is still a P.O.S. Delzell is by far the worst dorm I have ever had to deal with. Everything is the whole building is run down or broken. There is no A/C. The rooms consist of white concrete walls and windows that are original to the building. I could honestly look threw cracks along the edges of the frame. Avoid Delzell at all costs. 
   The complexes are also literally .25 miles from campus. A .25 mile walk at 730am in -25 degree temps really suck."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A joke – The nightlife consists of drinking in the dorms, smoking weed with the football team or partying in run down houses just off campus. I honestly think most of the houses should be torn down. Peru does have a VFW, a Bar and a sports bar but the Missouri river flooding may change that."
Recent Alumnus,1,Multiple problems – I dont want to mention too much but last year a student was abducted on campus last year and though security is obviously going to be ramped up the facts are the facts.
Recent Alumnus,1,20 miles to anything worth while – Half of Peru is under water right now. The bugs were rough last year and I can imagine the place with all that standing water. The town of Peru hates the students and generally avoid them at all costs. The only college friendly building in town is the Cottys sports bar but that is because they are in bed with the college. The flood waters may be effecting cottys aswell.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They hand it to you – I dont want to say classes at PSC are all easy, but it would be very difficult to not atleasy pull a C- if you show up. The profs. are more flexable than my teachers in high school. this isnt a good thing. the teachers are push overs and due dates do not exist. Atleast 10 times this past semester I worked my butt of on a project/paper and when it was time to turn it in other students would whine and get an extention. My roomate openly copyed a term paper and when I mentioned it to my advisor it was swept under the rug. This is a border line diploma mill."
College Freshman,1,"Peru...Don't Waste Your Time – It's a great school if you like the small class and small campus atmosphere. However, if you want more clubs, activities, etc, then you might want to check out another school. There are not a lot of options for living on and off-campus. The food is terrible and the college is in a rural and remote town, the nearest big city is 15-20 miles."
College Freshman,1,There is not a lot of space to park at Peru State College. With the abundance of trees there are not many parking places.
College Freshman,1,Getting financial aid figured out was a horrible experience. I had to go down to the office at least 3 or 4 times to get my situation fixed. Do not call them expecting to get anything done you have to go down to the Administration Building to make sure that they do it in front of your face. But once they get it done things go a lot more smoothly.

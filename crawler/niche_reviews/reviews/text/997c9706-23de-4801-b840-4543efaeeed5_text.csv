Junior,5,"The university has well educated professors and very involved staff. It's a small campus, but still spacious and has enough resources to study and do well in classes."
Junior,5,"It was interesting, but difficult because some lectures would have been better explained in person instead of receiving a slideshow that has a lack of connecting information."
Sophomore,5,My professors successfully adapted and transitioned to online classes. The workload was manageable and flexible.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school with all my heart. I entered as an out-of-state Freshman without a single friend and immediately found a community. I am beyond ecstatic to start my second year and look forward to the many more opportunities to come! I promise you will not regret attending SLU -- there is a community, more like a family, like no other."
Sophomore,5,I took some classes online this semester and professors are always helpful and willing to take time to make sure you learn. You must take initiative though to get the help you need.
Sophomore,5,"Great community environment! Everyone at SLU is always super welcoming and kind. Academics are big at SLU so if you're looking for a school just for parties this may not be the place for you. Fraternity and Sorority life is not huge here, but if that is your thing you can definitely still get involved. If you're looking for a college that will give you holistic growth, SLU is the right place for you!"
Freshman,5,I love SLU! I transferred here mid semester and felt so welcomed. It has a great atmosphere and professors that genuinely care.
Alum,5,"Fantastic school, great professors, administration side could be slightly better, but not much to complain about. Food on campus is very lacking though and could certainly be improved, but there are some great restaurant options nearby. Be careful of going out after dark, St. Louis is a very dangerous city."
Sophomore,5,"Love the campus. There are amazing people, a short walk to classes on a beautiful campus, amazing teachers/advisors, and good food options."
Junior,5,"I would recommend Saint Louis University to absolutely everyone. This campus has such a friendly and welcoming environment, where everyone supports each other in their ventures toward academic and personal success. In my college of health sciences, the professors make every effort to get to know their students on a personal level. They help every student achieve their goals, without the stress of needing to compete for graduate school spots. Each student is looking for a vocation, rather than a career; they want to find their place in the world and help others along the way. They place community service at the top of their priorities, and each student walks out of Saint Louis University a better person than when they walked in."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love SLU! I have met my best friends here and I am the happiest I have ever been. This is my perfect fit and I love it here. The campus is beautiful and I love walking around and seeing the beautiful buildings. I love sitting outside at the clocktower with my friends when it's warm, and I love making snow angels and having snowball fights in the quad when it's cold. I love this school with all my heart!"
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere of the community, and how helpful the people were was a great experience. Its a good university that gives the comfort of home and that chances of succeeding are high."
Sophomore,5,Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. It is my first year and I believe that I am making memories and friends that I will keep for the rest of my life.
Freshman,5,I am a new student and haven't started classes yet this spring semester but will be next month. I am very excited to start this journey of my life at Saint Louis University. All of the staff that I have encountered have been extremely helpful and readily available to assist me with any questions.
Freshman,5,"I didn't think I would enjoy this school as much as I have! So far, I have loved (almost) all of my classes and have found a really great group of people to spend my time with. The campus is gorgeous especially in the fall and spring!"
Sophomore,5,Wide variety of majors but rigorous classes. Above average athletics-especially women’s soccer and men’s basketball. Lots of clubs and extra-curricular activities. New dorms and other construction making an already beautiful campus even more welcoming
Junior,5,"The Jesuit spirit - acceptance of all beliefs, people of all cultures, and community engagement.  Great academics."
Freshman,5,"Saint Louis University has a relatively small campus and population, making it easier to create connections with fellow students and professors across all parts of campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love that Saint Louis University immediately feels like home the minute you step on campus. Everyone encourages you to follow your dreams and to do what is right for YOU. One thing I do wish was better is the food options on campus. Sure, we have the typical fast food chains. However, for those that are vegetarian or vegan, SLU doesn't have that many choices."
Niche User,5,I like the degrees offered at Saint Louis University and how nice campus is! For example the accelerated business program really helps me out in finishing my undergrad sooner so I can go on and achieve my masters.
Graduate Student,5,"I am an online student at Saint Louis University. So far the staff has been really helpful. Especially being an online student, the direction is key, and I have been able to ask for help and get help in a timely manner."
Freshman,5,"It has always been a good school and have had nothing but positive experiences with them. The staff is always friendly and helpful and ready to assist you with your questions and problems. The facility is beautiful and very spacious, with plenty of room for students to spread out and work on their homework, or just study and enjoy the sun. There is also very good food options here and the lines move quickly."
Junior,5,"As a transfer student, I have had a great experience so far at Saint Louis University. The campus is beautiful in an urban setting that provides a multitude of activities. The professors are fantastic and really care about their students. The food, atmosphere and athletics are just the cherries on top of a great University."
Sophomore,5,"Saint Louis University provides such a warm and welcoming environment for students. While it is a rigorous college, all of the professors and advisors always want you to do your best. They are willing to work around your schedule to make time to work on stuff that you are struggling with. The advisors are always there to answer any question no matter how small and help you find the right resources. The other students are also always there for each other. No one is trying to force each other out of the program for their spot; they are there to make sure their fellow classmates can do the best they can. If I did the college search again, I would still pick Saint Louis University."
Junior,5,"SLU offers a lot for anyone who sets foot on their campus. There is a lot of promise and excitement surrounding all of the expansion for STEM and business students, and there are a lot of great opportunities for humanities students as well - lots of opportunity to leave your mark and make a positive impact. SLU’s academic rigor, dedication to community engagement and service, and focus on developing the whole person makes this a great choice for all kinds of students."

Sophomore,5,I love Saint Louis University and I feel that it is a perfect fit for my academic experience. I have access to plenty of resources both academically and socially. I feel that this institution provides a well-rounded education that addresses the student as a whole person rather than just one or two aspects of a student. The campus is beautiful and I am blessed to go to this wonderful school.
Freshman,5,"SLU is a wonderful school. Beautiful campus, great academics, and the honors program are the qualities I value the highest.
St. Louis is a great city!"
Niche User,5,"Visiting Saint Louis University was an extraordinary experience, within five minutes of entering the campus I was laughing with new friends. The staff always has a postie attitude and makes you feel welcomed."
Freshman,5,SLU is such a great school and the students are motivated to do well in their classes but also like to have fun and enjoy all St. Louis has to offer!
Freshman,5,"Prestige school when it comes to academics. A good education is a top priority at this school. St. Louis is great and there is always something to do. Dining hall food is really good and dorms are nice. Being in the city, there was no need to bring my car because I can ride my bike just about everywhere I need."
Niche User,5,Saint Louis University is an excellent school. Great academics combined with interactive professors and a busy campus life make the student's college experience one of a kind!
Niche User,5,"I had a good experience during my stay in this university. People are pleasant and willing to help others in case when someone needs help. The only problem I had was i was homesick and i missed my family, but then professors and classmates were like family after quite sometime.It made my life easier because i feel am at home away from home inspite of many differences."
Freshman,5,"This school is very great academically, and has a great campus life. I felt right at home when I stepped foot on campus.                         ."
Junior,5,"Saint Louis University is a wonderful school with a great education and great people. There is great on campus housing, lots to be involved in, and the campus is very open to hearing others' opinions."
Junior,5,"Love SLU, they are willing to work with each and every one of their students and want the student to achieve their goals and careers."
Freshman,5,"I love SLU! All of the students and staff that I have encountered are very friendly and helpful. The campus is one of the best that I have ever seen, from the dorms to the historic buildings to the even the athletic fields. There are also plenty of tools to help students succeed and a strong emphasis is put on making sure students taken care of in every aspect. However, the biggest downside to SLU is the cost. Tuition is very expensive along with housing and pretty much everything else. However, I think it is worth it because you can't really put a price on a good education!"
Freshman,5,SLU is full of self-motivated students and passionate professors and faculty. I always feel as though the professors want the absolute best for their students and put forth great effort to prepare them for every future academic and work related endeavor.
Niche User,5,"There are pros and cons to every college in the nation. SLU takes 5 stars easily based on the location, size, academics, athletics, and success."
Freshman,5,Great programs and schools and aviation program is top notch.  Aircraft in aviation program is not the standard aircraft and could be expanded.
Niche User,5,I love that is close to downtown and easy to get and awesome chooses of what is wanted to be studied
Senior,5,"I love SLU! I attended SLU many years ago fresh out of high school. Due to financial and family challenges I ended up dropping out and going into the military. Now many years later, I am back at SLU, a real non-traditional student ...lol... actively pursing a degree in Organizational Leadership and Technology. Everything here at SLU is truly done in a spirit of excellence!"
Freshman,5,Saint Louis University is a great school and has great professors that motivate and push you to learn!
Sophomore,5,"Great resources given to help reduce stress throughout the year, including on campus concerts and on campus hammocks to lounge about.."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Saint Louis University has been tremendous so far! I have met many friends, participated in several clubs and activities and my professors have been outstanding. The smaller class sizes have made it easier to connect with classmates for study groups and I have gotten to know my professors well. While the academics are challenging I feel like faculty and staff really set you up for success at Saint Louis University!"
Sophomore,5,"The students are incredibly preppy, but the school provides so many opportunities. I love all of my classes and professors. The party scene isn't exactly wild, but it's really cool being downtown with the bars and Ballpark Village."
Junior,5,"I love SLU's mission, building men and women for others. The professors craft students into talented men and women while setting us up for success in the workforce. Additionally, the campus life provides a slew of opportunities for involvement and service. However, I would like to see the food change on campus, as we have limited options. I would also like more transparency as to how our tuition dollars are spent each semester."
Senior,5,"I love the people and lifelong friendships I've made here. SLU has a commitment to not only producing educated students, but people who care and live with and for others."
Freshman,5,"SLU is an excellent school that has made the process of getting in easy, and rewards hard work. I personally have done well there, and they continue to make the college experience as wonderful as possible. I can’t imagine going anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"I am a senior in high school and have just recently been admitted to Saint Louis University as a flight Science major with a minor in Spanish. I’m so excited to be a Billiken. It was difficult at first to figure out how to afford to go there but after the scholarships I received and the financial aide packet, it was a no brainer that I would get my education at the school of my dreams."
Freshman,5,"So far I've had a great experience at Saint Louis University. I'm currently pursing a degree in Computer Information Systems online. If you're in the Military and want your CCAF, CLEP, and DSST credits to transfer over then I recommend this college for you."
Junior,5,"The school is absolutely beautiful. The teachers are wonderful and always wanting to help students. I love the views and architecture. Overall, just a wonderful campus."
Graduate Student,5,"Saint Louis University is a good fit for me. First, it has my course of interest and how the curriculum is tailored to meet real world challenges in my chosen field of interest. I love that they bring real company cases to class for students to analyse using computer software. I love that there is a good focus on acquiring technical skills that are relevant in my field. More so, the classes are not too large which helps  me to get one on one time with professor when I need to."
Alum,5,"Saint Louis University is a very diverse and well rounded campus. The institution is definitely built to cultivate excellent minds and allow for creativity. The campus itself is built in two sections. The main campus, which is excellently placed near the fox theater, down the road from Forest Park, which is an excellent park filled an abundant amount of free activities and the main campus also is the oldest university west of the Mississippi. 

The second campus is the Med campus, where all medical professionals are taught. This section of the university is continually growing and has been for years. Many of the buildings are new and provide state of the art tech to work on. The campus is also very close to some of Saint Louis' best eateries in the Tower grove area."
Freshman,5,Saint Louis University has one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen. It is the perfect place for students to have a traditional college experience.
Sophomore,5,"Prior to school starting, I had gotten into a very bad car accident.  Because of it, I was hospitalized, unresponsive, and many thought I would not make it.  I slowly started moving, talking, and sure enough, only eight months later, I was starting college again!  Starting at SLU was great!  I was unsure if I would be able to mentally and physically continue as a student, with homework and tests, but my teachers have been incredible about helping me!!  They know that my mind is a little slower now, so they don't call on me for everything, but when I raise my hand to answer, they make sure to call on me so that I can get a chance to see if I know the answer.  Educators at SLU want you to get a good education, and they will work with you in whatever ways necessary for you to learn and earn your degree.  The teachers are great, the students are friendly, the campus is beautiful, and the administration is very friendly!  To rate Saint Louis University, I would say it's incredible!"
Freshman,5,I love SLU. The campus is beautiful. The classes are challenging and engaging and there are so many different places to go if you need help.
Sophomore,5,"Saint Louis University is a great school no matter what you want to major in. They have great medical programs, engineering programs, and even an aviation program. SLU is the perfect size, small enough where classes are close, but big enough that you can meet someone new every day! Location is great too, it is about 5 minutes away from the heart of downtown. 
I would like to see more involvement in the sports aspect. We have a soccer, baseball and basketball team, but not a lot of students attend their events."
Niche User,5,"Slightly diverse campus, lots of clubs and activities, and there are a lot of free attractions around the city that will keep you busy. Campus is not too big and not too small, has a suburban feel."
Senior,5,"Saint Louis University is a great school, all of the professors want you to succeed and will do their best to help you. Highly recommended!"
Sophomore,4,"Do to COVID-19, I was required to finish my spring semester courses online. even though this was the case the professors did an excellent job transitioning from on-campus courses to remote learning. All professors took great responsibility and ensuring their students still maintain and acquire the proper education. Although I wish I was able to stay on campus because the campus life is so enjoyable, the online learning taught me just as much as far as academics."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Louis University is the complete package. They emphasize being a well-rounded student, meaning putting emphasis not only on grades and curriculum but also on meeting others, connections, student Life, knowledge on inclusion and diversity, and the overall well being those to attend this University. The main campus is absolutely beautiful and the students, professors, and staff are all very welcoming and friendly. This University is a great transition from living at home to living the college experience. As a racial minority I wish the University was more diverse between races though, they are taking strides to increase their inclusion. I have also already acquired many connections between professors and staff as well as friends that will last a lifetime."
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, all classes were moved online. SLU uses the Blackboard platform to help keep us all connected and I think it was a great move. I had a relatively smooth transition onto online classes and was kept in the loop by my teachers, SLU president and SGA about what exactly is happening and what to expect."
Sophomore,4,"Super fun and involved campus with tons of resources available. I never had troubles voicing my concerns or trying to ask for help in subjects that I struggled with. The campus life is very fun because different clubs and associations plan activities open for all to go and enjoy. Also, there are so many on campus resources available such as the gym, counseling, different religious ministries and more. One downside to SLU is that the dorms are very old and the chances of actually getting a newer dorm such as Spring or Grand is low. I think it would be helpful is more money is put aside to help renovate the dorms."
Sophomore,4,It has been a positive experience so far in terms of academics and meeting new people.  I have began to fly with Saint Louis and it has been very beneficial in learning the different aspects of flight.
Sophomore,4,"I began to take online classes after our spring break in March. Although the circumstances were difficult, the staff made it work and gave the right notes and assignments to the students without struggle."
Works Here,4,I've been a TA here for a little while and it's been good. I was a little worried about SLU being a religious college but the affiliation is really just on paper. Incredibly diverse and forward thinking institution. Had the opportunity to work with some amazing professors.
Sophomore,4,"Originally, St Louis University was not my top priority but now I go there. My reasoning behind this decision was based on the diversity of student activity and clubs."
Freshman,4,"While growing up Hispanic in a predominantly white town, I never knew where I fit it. Like other people of color, I got the ""return to where you come from"" so I never knew where I fit in. At SLU, I found where I fit. I found my home away from home. I found new opportunities which I never believed I would be able to even be considered for."
Freshman,4,SLU is a great school for students who are interested in STEM fields and are focused on their school work. Classes are competitive and require a lot of work. This is not a party school and not a school where you can get away with slacking off.
Junior,4,"I love the community at SLU. Great focus on academics and the Jesuit Mission. Although there are some administrative issues that can be frustrating, my overall education has been of the highest quality."
Freshman,4,Saint Louis University's campus is a sight to behold. The mix of greenery and castle-like buildings transport you to another world. The student involvement and school spirit are definitely there! I would recommend being a Billiken!
Freshman,4,The University has a great campus that is kept safe and clean. SLU's campus has a wide range of diversity. This university has a lot of classes to offer as well as great professors. They care deeply about their students and their education.
Sophomore,4,"I love the students and faculty, everyone is very friendly and welcoming. There are a lot of extracurricular activities and cultural organizations to join."
Niche User,4,"I loved attending Saint Louis University. I loved the campus, I loved the city feel and I loved all my professors. The one thing I did not love was the price. This school is crazy expensive and without scholarship I wouldn't even be able to dream of attending this school.  That being said I do feel like there is always a lot being offered on campus just as coffee, bagels, donuts, and therapy dogs making me believe a lot of the money goes back to the students. The school also has a very nice library and gym, honestly the campus is just beautiful. But it is important to remember this campus is in Saint Louis and you should always take caution when walking, especially alone or at night. It was often your phone will ring with a new notification of a crime in the area, but campus does a great job of keeping with the university walls rather safe."
Freshman,4,The first time I toured SLU I immediately fell in love. The people I encountered were so welcoming and friendly. I have heard great things about this University and am excited to attend this fall.
Freshman,4,So excited about SLU! Beautiful campus and amazing people! Everyone is always so helpful and looking out for others! Can't wait for my next four years here and could not be more happy with my decision!
Junior,4,"This school pumps a lot of money into STEM with many new buildings being built. Residence halls are mostly new or renovated. Unfortunately, fine arts are generally thrown by the wayside."
Freshman,4,"Saint Louis University has a wide variety of clubs and programs for students, as well as strong safety nets put in place for both physical security, and student mental health. The academics in their STEM programs are challenging, and campus is generally well-maintained. Teachers, GTA's, and upper-classmen are all welcoming to incoming students."
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with SLU when I moved all the way from California. Never thought a place so far away would feel like home so quickly. I joined the Health Sciences Learning Community which was a great way to meet people. These people who lived on my floor became my closest friends. It was only possible for me to come to SLU because of the generous financial aid package that was guaranteed for 4 years. Coming to SLU ended up being cheaper for me than attending university on the West Coast. One of my absolute favorite things about SLU is their commitment to service and pushing their students to always help the surrounding community. SLU's food is honestly my only complaint. It's not bad, but I think I am just spoiled coming from California where I feel like I have easier access to fresher produce and meat/fish. The social scene at SLU is a bit lacking unless you are apart of a sorority/fraternity or participate in some other club or organization, which I recommend doing anyways."
Niche User,4,Excellent university private university. Well known for medicine and law. Just wish it was cheaper and a little safer at night. The addition of more competitive baseball team and a football team would really help the university grow.
Niche User,4,I love the campus! The dorm diversity is great as well. They do a great job supporting pre-medicine students.
Junior,4,"The humanities department is wonderful! All the professors are so kind and always willing to help out! Make sure to check out the Madrid campus too, it's by far the highlight of my college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Louis University is truly a welcoming community with diverse clubs and academic opportunities. The professors care about the students as individuals and are willing to help when asked. The academics are challenging, but are guaranteed to successful prepare each and every student for a career, graduate school, or any other ambitions."
Sophomore,4,SLU is a truly welcoming place. The education is absolutely worth it. You have to embrace this place but it is amazing
Graduate Student,4,"Amazing campus, dedicated faculty, rigorous academics. Located in the heart St. Louis, SLU is a Jesuit 4 year university with a wide range of programs. SLU also has graduate programs."
Senior,4,"Saint Louis University (SLU) embodies many of the key elements of a great university. The educators and instructors are top notch, the campus is beautifully curated, and students access to resources is competitive. The one area where SLU must make an important effort in improving is their disability services, and making the services more accessible to students with disabilities. While the services are available in name alone, the barriers created in meeting the needs of differently abled students are so great that many students go without their needed accommodations. Additionally, once the student does meet and go through the unnecessary hurdles to obtain these services, their needs are not handled by trained staff. For a university that trains future healthcare professionals it is unfortunate they cannot meet the needs of all of their students equally."
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful right inside an urban island.  During my tour of the campus I was very impressed with those that attended and talked about the university
Freshman,4,I have really loved the start of my year hear and really recommend the school. There are so many opportunities on and off campus and the city is so large that there is always something to do.
Sophomore,4,"As a current Saint Louis University student, I am really enjoying my time here. I not only love the environment, but the other students are so welcoming  and the faculty and staff are so involved and willing to help in almost every regard to help me be as successful as possible. The academics push me to a level I never thought I would be able to achieve. I am excited to see what the next couple years at SLU have in store for me."
Sophomore,4,Saint Louis University has amazing academics and supportive students and staff. The only thing that I think should change is the food. The cafeteria food is not good at all.
Freshman,4,I love the scenery of SLU's campus. The location helps compliment the beauty of walking around the area. The student body and clubs offered keep you busy and interested in the student life at the university.
Graduate Student,4,"SLU provided a welcoming and inclusive environment to transfer to. The students, the staff and the academics are great, and I have learned so much about myself and the world. I am thankful for the experience and the education I have received as a SLU student."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Louis University is great with academics. Most professors are professional and extremely resourceful with some exceptions. It is in St. Louis so although on campus is safe, directly off campus there can be some risks. There isn't much of a party scene on campus, but it is close to WashU which has some good parties."
Junior,4,"Coming here as a transfer student was a rough transition at first. However, by my second semester I have come to love SLU. The academics are rigorous and I feel like I am learning new things everyday. The students and faculty I have met here are amazing. If you are an incoming student get involved, there is something for everyone at SLU. The campus is gorgeous and I love everything that the St. Louis area has to offer. Definitely satisfied with choosing SLU!"
Junior,4,"SLU has brought me closer to my goal of becoming a PT. I have so many friends that are in it for the long run with me, and I can't wait to go back in the fall. The classes challenge me academically, but it balances out with the extensive variety of extracurricular activities. They give me the opportunity to be a leader, and to try things outside of my comfort zone, all while enjoying the serenity of on-campus living."
Freshman,4,"The staff are all passionate about the subjects they teach. Campus is beautiful and is a perfect size. The opportunities that are given to students are also phenomenal, being in a city helps find companies to intern with and network with. I do not enjoy how expensive it is to go here and also it is a majority medical based campus, so I feel they need to work to diversify the student body."
Senior,4,"I wish it would focus effort in bringing more people of color. Overall, a good experience, the professors are mostly very understanding and helpful in preparing you for the future, finding your niche is easy, so sense of community is easy to find."
Junior,4,"Saint Louis University has been a great place to call home for the last three years. I have met such amazing people and have had great professors. Everyone here wants each other to succeed and is willing to help each other out. St. Louis is a really cool city with great sports teams, restaurants, and parks."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and the warm environment from my fellow students and teachers. The classes are very challenging but if you put in the effort you can achieve good grades!
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore and I love SLU, it is a great campus that has so many caring and passionate professors."
Freshman,4,"The application and enrollment process was pretty easy. My only issue with the university is that since it's a well known university, it can be quite pricey compared to some other less ""popular"" universities in the area."
Niche User,4,"I liked the fact that Saint Louis University was clean and has a good college atmosphere. The professors really know their stuff and are not only interested in making you into a better student, but a better human being."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and the Nursing program is awesome! Plus, it gives the opportunity for nursing students to study abroad which a lot of other schools don't offer."
Freshman,4,"Overall, Saint Louis University is a great school, in a great city.  However, SLU is so expensive; it is impossible to pay for without a plethora of loans and/or scholarships.  It is a tough for me to pay but the atmosphere and my love for the school makes me stay"
Junior,4,"It is a great school whose staff members work with students academically and individuallly. I like the diversity of the school even though the black community is not considerable numerically. It will also be better if they provided enough financial scholarships for low income students. Besides that, the Saint Louis University is one of the best schools to get a degree from."
Niche User,4,"The university may be located in a somewhat dangerous/risky area but the campus is beautiful and everything is relatively near each other so you don't have to venture outside too long by yourself. The advisors and the professors tend to differ between topic and subject. Some professors try to engage the students, but some professors have too many students to spare time outside of class to help them or establish a connection with them."
Freshman,4,I honestly love the vibe at SLU. Everyone is constantly working hard and making sure to stay on top of things. Also I get so much help on my homework and everyone learns at the same pace. This school offers so many free things and tries they’re best to make sure every student is involved and learning many skills other than the ones preparing them for their career. It feels as if I were in living in Elysium.
Senior,4,"Getting involved is incredibly easy and even though not super-diverse, there is still a very large multicultural population at SLU."
Alum,4,"Saint Louis University is a good college. The Jesuit curriculum requirements and principles definitely makes students more well-rounded. The school is full of many diverse cultures and languages, however, the level of diversity does need improvement. Though an expensive college, a degree from here carries a lot of merit. The academics are good and there are many research opportunities available to students. Overall, Saint Louis University is a good well rounded university."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Slu and I absolutely love it here! The academic scene at Slu is very competitive and challenging for my major (biology pre-med), but I enjoy it. I have made some amazing friends on campus. There are so many clubs and organizations you can join. Pretty much anything you can think of. The campus is absolutely beautiful!"
Niche User,4,"I have attended this campus before, and I am planning to attend again. That must say something! The campus is quite even at night. The staff are nice and seem truly interested."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the people at SLU and the professors are always there to help us out in every way that they can! I wish there were more things to do around/ on campus and I don't have to drive to get to all the restaurants/night outings! The Physical Therapy program is amazing too, they really do everything they can to help you become the best PT you can and give you plenty of opportunities to get in touch with future employers before you even graduate!"
Freshman,4,"Saint Louis University has a beautiful campus and everything I want in a school. I can take pre-medical courses while majoring in theatre, being part of an equestrian team, and because of the area, there are fun things to do in my free time."
Junior,4,"Saint Louis University is big enough for students to have all the luxuries of college life, and small enough to feel like you have a family here. There is a club for everyone. The professors are friendly and you can tell each and every one of them want you to succeed. The only thing to be aware of is that St. Louis and this student community is very involved in activism, which exposes students to an amazing array of issues. It's truly an experience like no other."
Junior,4,"I really love the beautiful campus and how approachable the faculty and teachers are. Everyone makes it very easy to get involved whether it is with a club, sports, or greek life on campus."
Freshman,4,"The location made me nervous at first, but the level of security on campus is comforting. I have enjoyed my teachers so far, but of course, they vary greatly. My experience in the nursing program has gone well so far."
Freshman,4,"Although I'm only a freshman now (2018) at SLU, I've enjoyed my experience so much and cannot imagine being anywhere else. My professors teach their courses well and offer office hours if students have questions about material. The university offers a number of community events and speakers to encourage community involvement. My residence hall is very well maintained and also offers events for students to get to know each other better."
Senior,4,What I like about Saint Louis University is that it is Catholic. I myself am a Catholic and I am able to learn with the Jesuit Catholic teaching and ethics. What I feel needs to improve is that the professors need to be more understanding.
Sophomore,4,"I love the Jesuit mission of SLU, and the type of community that it fosters. I have had the opportunity to meet some of the most amazing, social-justice oriented, empathetic, inspiring individuals during my time here, and for that I am very thankful."
Sophomore,2,During the coronavirus pandemic the learning was difficult and rushed. When the teachers taught from home they did not seem to care about their students academics anymore. I hope nothing like this ever happens again because my grades really did struggle through this experience.
Senior,2,"Not worth the cost. This school does a good job of presenting themselves as diverse, tolerant and accommodating place to get an education.  The reality is they are terrible at accommodating any kind of disability, even to the point of blatant violations of the ADA requirements for persons with disabilities. They promise a lot but in actuality provide minimal help. The safety of the campus is an issue. SLU ride is touted as a safety measure but in reality they take 30-60 minutes to respond leaving students vulnerably standing waiting for a ride. The buildings are not all accessible, the kitchen does a poor job of accommodating layered food allergies, the elevators break regularly trapping disabled students and there is mold issues that are brushed aside or patched over.  Overall, I would recommend looking at other schools before coming to SLU."
Freshman,2,"This school has an obsessive tendency to hound out and punish students who stray from their idea of what a ""perfect student"" should be. The housing director made me and my friends complete 25 hours of community service along with a $100 fine for entering our residence hall without signing in at the front desk. The administration often shows a lack of basic decency and a respect of student privacy, rummaging through desks and closets filled with personal belongings during room inspections."
College Freshman,2,Personally I am not a big fan of Greek life
College Junior,2,"The dorms here are pretty terrible for the price we are paying. Luckily, there are new buildings being built."
College Freshman,2,A degree from SLU seems to be useful if youll be working in st louis. Not much elswhere.
College Freshman,2,Incredibly overpriced. Cramped as all hell. Relatively close to classes.
College Freshman,2,Greeks are either douches or nobodies. Their parties are relatively lame and very rare.
College Freshman,2,"For the most part, all they do is throw parties and drink"
College Freshman,2,"A large number of students smoke pot regularly, which I personally don't have much of a problem with, though I do not partake. The fact that it IS still illegal in Missouri means that the school is reasonable in not allowing it on all accounts, and the same goes for underage drinking. However, SO many students partake in one or both of the previously mentioned substances that a parent would have to be completely oblivious to not expect their child to try or regularly use one or both. Furthermore, 'study drugs' such as Adderall and Ritalin are highly sought after by students who are pre-med (a major cause for concern if you ask me), making it much more difficult for students who need them to not be suspect whenever an incident involving those substances occurs. It's a real shame."
College Freshman,2,"If you are a private school kid, your parents make a ton of money, or you are pretentious and selfish then this is the school for you. Saint louis university claims to be accepting and have diversity, however the only diversity comes from rich indian kids and black basketball players. SLU Is extremely expensive. The whole school is cliquey and cost WAY too much for the programs it gives. Judgement is inescapable. And if you don't wear a Patagonia vest, hunter boots, or Sperrys you will not only be ostracized but looked at as poor, dirty, and unappealing. Dorms suck, people suck, cost sucks, get caught drinking? It costs $100. Advertise average of 25 people in a classroom- not true. Chemistry lecture hall was 200+, Biology was 150+. Saint Louis University is a for profit institute- that not only makes it's money off it's students for fining them for harmless acts but, hires 60% adjuncts professors that make less than a third of tenured professors. Within the first semester over 25% of Pre-Med students dropped out best of terribly taught chemistry classes. 

Library is super nice though."
College Freshman,2,"Sports are not our strong suit this year, so fan support is scarce, regardless of sport.

School spirit is subpar, proven by the various collegiate apparel students wear (mostly

big state schools)."
College Senior,2,Greek life is unnecessary at a school this size and does not have housing. I think the community on campus would be more united without it.
College Freshman,2,"The only thing I really enjoy about living in campus housing this year is that it is close to my classes. In Walsh, there is way too much furniture to fit in the room and at least one person has to have their bed lofted. The building in general is pretty outdated, but we are in the process of building two new dorms that will hopefully be much nicer."
College Freshman,2,"If they said Greek life isn't big here, they lied."
College Freshman,2,I do not feel like I fit in
College Sophomore,2,"Similar to most colleges, a lot of the food available to students is unhealthy. The few healthy options that are available get old really quickly. Also, everything is really overpriced so flex dollars run out before the end of the semester. The bean has decent coffee though and they are open late."
College Senior,2,FAFSA is a pain and the school couldn't get me the aid i need.
College Senior,2,"its not healthy, its not farm to table. and its expensive."
College Senior,2,The housing process is really difficult especially if you are a underclassmen.  If you are a upperclassmen there is no guarentee that you will get the housing you want.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I know little about it. My impression is the public line is, ""we do great things for people.""  Privately it's a lot of disturbing and ridiculous rituals and over the top drinking."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not much diversity on this campus.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not that large. There is definitely a presence but it is not overwhelming
College Freshman,2,There's a strong sense in the community currently that the administration has lost touch with what students and alumni want for the university. This stems from the Ferguson protests that occurred on campus in October.
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of options and the cost is not cheap. There is never student discounts
College Junior,2,"I feel safe majority of the time, but we always get e-mails that someone was robbed at gun point or something bad happened near our campus"
College Sophomore,2,"I live in a dorm as a sophomore and the rooms are old, dirty, the air conditioner makes loud noises, the bathrooms have mold, and the ceiling is chipping off in the showers."
College Sophomore,2,This could definitely use some improvement. There seems to be a lot of white and asian students and not enough of other races.
College Freshman,2,you can get away with whatever you want
College Junior,2,"SLU really isn't a party school compared to state schools, but if you are looking for fun you will find it.  There are several bars near campus which get old quickly if you are trying to meet new people. SLU provides transportation around campus at night."
College Senior,2,"It's not just the campus the city needs a good transportation system, like a metro."
College Freshman,2,Sucks if you dont have a car. Get friends with cars. Metro is okay for some uses but can be really sketch. Cabs are super  expensive.
College Senior,2,They need to give students more money. I don't believe the funds are fairly allocated.
College Senior,2,"In the past, we have gotten email alerts about students getting robbed and apprehended/solicited in areas around campus."
College Junior,2,Rules and policies can make you feel like you never left your parents freshman year in the dorms.
College Freshman,2,they are boring and not friendly
College Sophomore,2,They charge a ridiculous amount for only specific lots and if there aren't any spots near by my dorm you have to park a block or so away and it sucks especially when its cold. And there are only 2 parking structures that are covered the rest are open lots and they still cost a lot.
College Freshman,2,"Not the most enjoyable nightlife, could be much better."
College Sophomore,2,"Our workload is crazy for science classes. SLU prides themselves on the quality education we receive, which is code for we will work our butt's off for four years. Classes can be fun because of the small atmosphere, but students can also be crazy competitive for no reason. The competitive nature of SLU is one of the worst things."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is only cool here if you are greek. Most people don’t care about the greek life, and find the socials annoying. Since the school is in the middle of saint Louis, there are no dorms or houses for the greek students. Many sorority and fraternity members enjoy their organization, but are not as in to it as larger schools tend to be."
College Senior,2,"Campus housing is bad due to the cost being so high. It is unsafe to live off-campus, but living on-campus could cost a student over 1,000 a month to share a bedroom and have no kitchen. It is crazy! The lottery system for the housing process can leave students paying ridiculous amounts for housing that is inconvenient and disgusting--old and unclean."
College Senior,2,SLU is inner-city and has much of the crime from St. Louis City surrounding the campus. DPS is not very intimidating to outsiders and crime is prevalent.
College Student,2,It's incredibly difficult to find any available internships due to the shear number of applicants.
College Student,2,SLI is not in the best part of the St. Louis area.  We are consistently warned not to travel alone at dark.
College Junior,2,What sets my school apart from other schools is the academic programs; the chemistry program at this school is highly accredited as well as the other pre-med programs. 
College Junior,2,"As a vegetarian, there are little to none options on this campus for people that eat like me. Though there is one place for vegetarians to eat called, Terre Ve, the place is closed very early, whereas other dining areas stay open very late, and is VERY EXPENSIVE. The best place for dining would be Salsarita's; however, the food is not the healthiest with the large amounts of salt that is put onto the tortilla chips. I do not use a meal plan/flex dollars. The best way to maximize my eating lifestyle is by living off campus and buying my own groceries to make meals for myself. "
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process is one that is fair, but it is not very helpful unless I take out numerous school loans. My financial aid does not cover my most of my school fees and none of my book fees. My financial aid also does not completely cover my health insurance. The only way that i am able to continue going to school is by taking out numerous school loans. The way obtain financial aid at my school is by applying for financial aid in January, taking out school loans, and applying for scholarships. "
College Junior,2,"Don't even think about drinking in your dorm if you are underage. Over extended holiday breaks, rooms are checked for containers and other items that could be construed as drinking items.
"
College Freshman,2,"I'm surprised by the amount of people that smoke pot and drink on a regular basis, especially underage drinking"
College Sophomore,2,"Looking back on the college decision process, I would have paid more attention to the extracurricular list. There are a lot of debate and charity organizations in the club list, however other than sports clubs, there are not many groups to join for fun or creative meetings for social purposes. Despite the small percentage of students who join, Greek life still seems to be a big deal on campus. It is easy to feel isolated from that group. Advertising for on campus events could also be better. "
College Sophomore,2,"Campus police does a great job given their resources; that said, it's impossible to ignore the fact that SLU backs up to more run-down parts of the inner city."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is very expensive, but it's reasonably located given how densely populated St. Louis is."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some great restaurants nearby; I wish there were a few more, though.  Humphrey's is a great option."
Recent Alumnus,2,expensive. bad management. they are all below standards. scams
Recent Alumnus,2,terrible weather. cold wind chills just hit you when you go to class. doesnt snow so much. overall terrible weather
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a former varsity athlete, I can honestly say the program is good but could be a lot better. The biggest issue we run into is with funding in general but also the unequal distribution of funds. That is why hardly anyone knows we have a tennis team but everyone scrambles to get men's basketball tickets."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a first year student, you are warned of the various punishments for offenses but by the time you are ready to graduate, the tone is much more lenient."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is very involving for those who choose to be involved in it.  SLU's statistic on how many students are involved in greek life is misleading: there are way more greeks than they lead you to believe.  But if you're not in a frat or sorority, it's no big deal."
College Junior,2,St Louis weather is crazy. Just check the weather in the morning to know if you will need an unbrella or jacket
Recent Alumnus,2,"Weather is honestly all over the place, and classes never get cancelled. But when it's nice out, it's a really beautiful campus and city."
Sophomore,1,"I have had the worst experience as a student in my time at SLU. I do not recommend attending this school to anyone. The administration is so far out of touch with their student body that students struggle to find any sense of home on campus. They preach mental health but disregard the actual needs of their students and rather strategically make the school appealing to outsiders. Their own students well being is compromised for the image of the University. This is not a jesuit school but rather a liberal arts college posing behind the identity of Ignatius. There is no presence of Jesuit priests on campus. DPS officers spend their time interrogating students rather than protecting the campus. The city is dangerous and armed robberies are a weekly occurrence. 

There is no resources to fix problems and the bureaucratic nature of the school creates a system in which no change is made. The idea of ""One SLU"" is a technique the president played on alumni to donate to his retirement fund."
Sophomore,1,The school scheduled me for a majority of in person classes prior to returning to campus. I would not have returned to school if I had known that all of these classes would be changed into a virtual based platform a week before classes started. I have a teacher who was hired four days before the term began. These professors were planning on teaching in person all summer and therefor did not receive the necessary training to be effective virtual teachers in the Fall. There are not sufficient resources on campus to take these classes. The school has been manipulative of their students. The education system has been exposed within the past months for their fraud and lack of empathy for students.
Senior,1,"SLU has a lot of claims, but fails to deliver on them. Student's are very cliquey, and act welcoming, but only build close relationships with students who are similar to them. Classes are pretty easy, and I do not feel like I learned at a caliber I expected to. I could get As in my science classes without studying, which is concerning. There are clubs, but there is no passion or social scene behind the clubs. If you aren't the ""perfect"" slu student, you won't have a good time here. 

The housing staff sucks, and does not take student complaints or mental health seriously. In addition, the dorms are moldy and gross, and not properly cleaned from year to year. To top it off, housing would charge you for non-existent damages. 

I have had some incredible professors at SLU, whose classes have changed me, and I am so grateful for these professors."
Alum,1,My degree was expensive and was unable to find a job after graduation. Struggled. They do not give you adequate information about the likelihood of landing a job after graduation. Degree program was pretty useless. Money wasted.
Alum,1,"The main issue with the school is that many of the employees of the university do not practice the Jesuit principles that they espouse. I have heard horror story upon horror story about abusive university officials who continue to rise higher and higher in the university rankings. There are other problematic individuals who I have dealt with directly. If you are going to spend several dozen grand on an education, I would not recommend this institution."
College Sophomore,1,My degree is great but I don't know if I'll find one in my field of psychology.
College Freshman,1,"Professors don't care too much about your performance. Too large of a school, too many students in each class."
College Freshman,1,Dorms are super small. Cost a ridiculous amount of money for the quality of housing. People say don't live at reinsert but I honestly wish I would have. Greis is fun for the first month but not having a bathroom sucks and it's not worth the 10k a year.
Recent Alumnus,1,We do not have our own facilities
College Junior,1,There's no drug scene on campus
College Senior,1,Bathrooms that are not cleaned daily are disgusting when shared by 60 other girls.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are barely any close places to eat off-campus. Everything close by is mostly fast-food and jimmy johns.
College Freshman,1,What separates SLU from the other schools is that it lacks the real college environment that most kids want to be in. 
College Senior,1,"Parking is more expensive than most colleges I have visited. With that, parking is terrible. I once had to park 30 minutes from where I lived just to find a spot-after wasting 1/2 tank of gas."
College Student,1,"A laptop is a must.  However, the network can be so slow that any computer is worthless on campus."
College Junior,1,Nighlife is pretty much nonexistent here. There is not much of a party scene
Recent Alumnus,1,freshman dorms are the worst. do not ever live in reinert. unorganized. you are stuck in dorms for life
Recent Alumnus,1,Chinese and whites. no proper international community because people from abroad are not stupid
Recent Alumnus,1,its in the city. parking is expensive and it sucks
College Junior,1,"In order to be likely to have a spot you have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to park your car on campus. The Medical campus is the only campus with spots where you do not have to have a permit or a meter to pay, however if you have a class later than 8 am on the main campus, you will most likely not be able to take advantage of the free parking which definitely fills up early morning."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not gonna lie, most of the school is upper class white people. As a result, the campus can feel unaccepting at times"
College Junior,1,Campus security is very strict. If you get in trouble for drinking they may force you to do consueling at school or at home out of your own pocket. I find this to be a little ridiculous. Living in on campus housing they are also very strict too. You will get fined if you have candles or alot of alcohol especially in the predominantly freshmen and sophomore dorms.
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any options - especially on the weekends and the food has little variety and is of low quality.
College Sophomore,1,"SLU has a lot of diversity. I see international students everywhere. At the same time, while a wide variety of people are enrolled here, the atmosphere is very ""clique-ish"". People tend to stick with people who look like them, dress like them, smell like them. It's hard to break into different groups. As a student who has grown up in a public school setting, I'm really surprised at how ""private school"" SLU feels."
College Sophomore,1,"Do not live in Marchetti Towers. The only thing that they have going for them is that their location. Location is excellent. As a transfer, I had been hoping that the social atmosphere would be somewhat more active, especially in the transfer learning community. But it was very bleak and isolated."
College Sophomore,1,"While I am sure SLU is a very good university to experience as a normal undergraduate freshman, coming in as a transfer student was extremely difficult. Despite having a transfer FIG and LC, I can say with certainty that my transfer experience at SLU has been very miserable. Just by asking around with other transfers, that seems to be the prevailing opinion. For starters, as a private university, SLU is very picky about what transfers in as credit. While meeting with your adviser in the summer, they say your credits transfer, but it's not until I signed up for classes that I found out that my credits transferred as electives. Most transfers must start over as either freshmen or sophomores just because the credits are so specific. The Residence Halls put the transfers in a LC, which is in Marchetti Towers. Instead of a friendly LC environment, everyone is very isolated from one another. I knew that it would be difficult making friends on campus, so I went out of my way to get involved in about 4-5 organizations. In short, none of them stuck because there was no welcoming atmosphere whatsoever, except for one small bible study. While academically, SLU is a very capable school, as a transfer, I have not had a good experience at all. The environment for a transfer is very bleak, lonely, and isolated that leaves majority of transfers very unhappy. I am planning on transferring out this coming spring. I know at least 5 other transfer students who are planning to do the same. In short, SLU is an excellent school for any incoming freshmen, but ultimately, if you're thinking about transferring here, I highly recommend you look elsewhere because spending this much money on tuition (even with a scholarship) is NOT worth it."
College Senior,1,"SLU seems to work hard to have students from different races and religions; however, the majority of the population is made up of white students of catholic background. Diversity at Saint Louis University is definitely something that needs improvement."
College Freshman,1,"It Is Expensive – I think that parking at SLU is extremely expensive. In order to keep one's car at SLU, each individual has to pay $500 for parking a semester.  It seems like a lot of money to pay to keep one's car at school.  The parking Spaces are not even that great either."
College Freshman,1,"Not So Much – Though it is advertised as a diverse campus it is far from that. We have a nice amount of international students but very few african americans or hispanics making the environment very hard to get used to if one is of that background. There are several religious associations, all are welcome. There is little endorsement on behalf of the LGBT community by the school."
College Freshman,1,parking sucks! its because its in the middle of the city though
College Student,1,"The financial aid process here is useless. Unless you have very good grades, you are considered ""diverse"", or you are virtually poor, you will get hardly any aid. For those lucky few that do, it won't even put a dent in the ridiculous tuition. My tip would be to get very good grades and hope your parents have a low enough income to qualify for aid but high enough to pay for the massive tuition bill."
College Senior,1,There Is NO Room for Upperclassman! The dorms are great and very roomy. The on-campus apartments are great and very roomy and fully furnished! BUT there is NO room for upperclassman on-campus...ANYWHERE. SLU has very little housing options and incoming Sophomores get priority over juniors AND SENIORS!!
College Freshman,1,Not a big deal. Less than 20% of students participate. They have parties and invite the non-Greeks too. You can usually tell who is greek due to the letters. no houses allowed on campus
College Sophomore,1,The dorm is a bit rundown and could use some renovating
College Junior,1,"College Is Not Mainly About Partying – Everybody knows that in order to succeed one must put effort and obtain good grades, in order to do that one must study and attend every class as well as take good notes. We must remember that if your grade point average is below the minimum you will be on probation. We must do what is in our hands to achieve the best while being careful."
College Freshman,1,Not So Good – For as much money as it costs to go here I am not that fond of SLU. The neighborhood isn't that great and there's not much to do besides party and drink. My car has already been broken into and I scared to leave my dorm at night.
College Sophomore,1,"I think its sad when facility maintenance says they would not let their kids live in on campus housing. Mostly all the dorms have some time of mold problem... Marchetti West/ East and the Villages especially. Every summer people are hired to come and clean the dorms, but they end up cutting corners  and the students have to deal with the repercussions throughout the year. Prior to my air vents being cleaned last semester, they hadn't been cleaned since the building was constructed (which was a long time ago). The building are cheaply built and you can get more for your money commuting or renting an apartment. "
College Sophomore,1,"Department of Public Safety unfit to promote ""Public Safety"" – Although SLU tries to make students feel safe, DPS does a horrible job. 15 vehicles just got broken into in ONE night and all DPS did was leave handwritten notes saying ""Contact us regarding your vehicle"". I find it ridiculous that if I park somewhere illegally DPS will be right there to tow my car or give me a ticket and charge it to my account, but if a car gets broken into (on their clock) they leave a handwritten note. "
College Senior,1,"Students Are Overly Restricted – Many of SLU's policies can be very restrictive.  There are curfews for opposite-sex visiters in dorms and on campus apartments, and censorship is prevalent on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Printing on Campus – We pay so much money for so many facilities, which is a good thing for the most part, but a thing that seriously should be considered is printing."

Sophomore,5,"I'm a current Sophomore and I love it here! The campus is beautiful, class size is great, and I've made great friends here so far."
Sophomore,5,I'm taking all of my classes online. The professors are very accommodating when it comes to different time zones and if you email them with any concerns/ questions they usually respond in a very helpful and speedy manner.
Junior,5,Case has done a very good job transitioning all of their classes online. The transition between in person and online classes were seamless.
Junior,5,"Case Western is one of the best STEM schools in the country. Known for their academics, this school lives up to their reputation with state of the art facilities. Their diverse student body is a very welcoming one."
Junior,5,"overall, my experience at case so far has been good. i am a nursing major, and i am very much enjoying the program despite the difficulty of some classes and some questionable hires for professors and clinical instructors. on the other hand, i think case could improve on how they handle sexual assault/abuse on campus (especially in greek life), racism/police harassment and accountability, and the mental health of students."
Junior,5,"i had to take online classes due to covid-19 and the process went very smoothly. some of my professors were even kind enough to replace final exams with other assignments, such as case studies and short essays."
Sophomore,5,"I love CWRU, I'm very happy that I decided to go here. The student body is very driven and motivated, but more collaborative than competitive towards other students. There's a very diverse range of interests so you can find a club for pretty much any activity you want to do. It is a very ideal school to go to if you are interested in double majoring."
Freshman,5,"The online learning was definitely a transition. Especially as a nursing student, clinicals, lab, and nursing assessments were done differently. Utilizing zoom for clinical meetings and recording ourselves performing health assessment on ""patients"" were some of the biggest changes in my learning experience as a Case nursing student."
Freshman,5,"Case Western exceeded my expectations of a college experience in terms of a balanced academic and social life (you'll find the parties if you look for it). Here, you'll meet some of the most intelligent yet humble, creative, and dedicated students and quite frankly, friends for life. The professors truly care about what they teach and make learning, exciting. Almost every professor is open and happy to have a conversation about anything!"
Sophomore,5,"It is overall a great school; however, there are some problems in which the university addresses problems. When there have been students who complain about the sanitation of the dining halls and the quality of the food, the school seems to just sweep it under the rug. The academics are amazing, the inclusion, diversity, and dorm life is about the best thing about campus. Being able to express yourself with all different kinds of people is a feeling that is so liberating and exhilarating. I lover being a CWRU student and there is so much that the school offers that there will never be a dull week."
Freshman,5,Case Western Reserve University is a world class university. It has great professors and really is a great experience for anyone.
Graduate Student,5,CWRU is a great school the new building is beautiful. The community near and around campus is really nice and a fun place to live.
Graduate Student,5,"I did not take any online courses yet, But I heard they are great and easy interface for everyone to utilize."
Senior,5,CWRU has done a great job of hiring smart professors but they work students to a higher standard that prepare them far beyond than what is required which does not make sense since they put us at a disadvantage GPA wise to other college students in the job market.
Graduate Student,5,"Case Western Reserve University has dedicated faculties and a hospitable environment that fosters students' teaching-learning. Along with this, Case provides an inclusive student-centered climate, innovation-focused teaching-learning platform that prepares leaders and thinkers in their respective fields."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent and student-friendly technologies that are handled by a dedicated team to help the student. They have numerous high demanding online courses.
Sophomore,5,Case gives a top notch education. It is known for its STEM education however there are great classes and majors outside of that as well.
Alum,5,"CWRU is an amazing university. It was academically challenging, but I really enjoyed my time there.."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any classes online, but I have a few friends that did, and they really enjoyed the experience."
Freshman,5,"The online classes for math and science classes were easier since the professors post recorded videos online and students could study in their own pace; English and music classes were a bit harder in zoom because the class required group discussion, but the system worked as both the professor and students adapt to it."
Freshman,5,"The online classes for math and science classes were easier since the professors post recorded videos online and students could study in their own pace; English and music classes were a bit harder in zoom because the class required group discussion, but the system worked as both the professor and students adapt to it."
Sophomore,5,A fantastic school with a great social life and diverse group of students that are motivated about their passions. I will never regret choosing Case Western
Junior,5,Case was a challenging school with many driven students. The education was great and friends I made will last a lifetime.
Freshman,5,"CWRU has certainly given me more of an insight into what careers I could possibly pursue, and the academic advising is always available. However, there is a lack of course diversity and its mostly STEM focused."
Sophomore,5,"I  think for me, attending  Case  Western  Reserve  University  is  overall  a  positive  experience."
Freshman,5,"Truly love this school. It is a small size and tight-knit community. The academics are rigorous, but can still be handled. I came from a really small STEM school, so transferring into this type of community was refreshing.  I've always been used to engineering programs, and all STEM majors/topics, are the most valued, so I was not surprised that this is the same. I really like this school and cant wait for it grow."
Senior,5,"One of my favorite aspects of the school was the size. It was big enough that I was always meeting new people but small enough that I saw at least one friend each day. Honestly, going to CWRU was the best choice I could have made. It provided the education I desired along with the social environment that fit my needs."

Freshman,5,"While the party scene might not be overwhelming at Case Western Reserve University, the classes have proved challenging and informative. The people on campus have been extremely nice (for the most part) and the professors are helpful as long as you visit in office hours. In bigger lectures, I recommend going to office hours. Overall, I am very happy to be here and can't wait to see how the next three and a half years turn out."
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful. The professors and admissions counselors are very nice and helpful. They gave the very good advice even when I just had some concerns as a high school student who  struggles with taking tests.
Freshman,5,The environment of Case Western seemed very inclusive. It also seems like a place to find your passion and thrive while pursuing your passion.
Freshman,5,"Case offers a great education and a great community for students dedicated to service and learning. The food is it’s biggest downfall, and the dorms are just OK, but these are things that most CWRU students easily joke about and look past when considering our experience at Case. I would say that I’m very happy overall with my experience and would recommend students interested in engineering/medicine/the environment/anything really give this place a good look, the opportunities are boundless."
Niche User,5,"Case Western allows students to build a major purely based off of their passions and does not follow strict guidelines to achieving goals. Students are able to choose classes from Dance to Physics and have double or triple majors across various fields. Their student assistants, called Navigators, are available 24/7 to help guide students to their intended major and can help them switch majors if need be. The campus is 16 minutes from Cleveland, but their University Circle feels like a small city. It is a great place for someone who wants to be close to urban life but not fully immersed."
Freshman,5,"I really love it here! There are so many ways to get involved on campus and gain meaningful experience. The work is hard, but it is worth the effort, as grads get great jobs after graduating. In my experience as an undergrad business major, professors are easy to access for help and are passionate about what they do."
Niche User,5,"What I like most about Case Western Reserve University is the passion of the faculty, students, and staff. I visited Case Western Reserve during the Fall Open House and immediately felt right at home on campus."
Graduate Student,5,I have experienced a personal and tailored orientation process. The faculty and staff have been incredibly accommodating.
Sophomore,5,"My second year here at Case has been great! Classes have remained hard but everyone is in it together creating a ""community feeling"". The social scene is also surprisingly good, the split in the student body is about 60-50, 60 being socially able students. There are parties almost every weekend as students now like to refer to here as ""Case State"". If you want to work hard, get a good degree,  and have a college experience with a moderate state school feel, you should definitely come."
Freshman,5,"It's been a month since I moved in and I feel right at home. The food is surprisingly good with a LOT of variety (including special meal swipes that work at Dunkin' Donuts and Denny's). Even the healthier options are great. I've found the community to be a very welcoming environment, composed of people from all over America (and a good few international students as well). It's very easy to get involved and meet new people. As for parties, they exist but they're not integral to campus life. You can walk around frat houses until you find one on a Saturday night. They're not too wild though. Great variety of academics, competent professors, strong research scene, nice gyms, scenic campus. There's long walks to class but they're pleasant. Dope architecture. Free museum access and public transport. Big fan of all that. REALLY PRETTY AREA AROUND CAMPUS."
Sophomore,5,"CWRU offers an experience unlike many of the other colleges I toured and visited. It has an incredible focus on student success and offers so many resources--like your own personal librarian and a 50,000-square-foot maker space with 3D printers and laser cutters--you just can't find time in the day to use them all! We're all huge nerds here, so it makes for a tiny party scene with a bunch of socially awkward kids, but that's not why we go to school.

If you've ever wondered where all the Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, and UChicago rejects go to school, this is the place. SO if you're an engineering student who's a little socially awkward and hella smart, this is definitely the place for you!

Come check it out"
Graduate Student,5,"Great challenging education, professors are truly experts in their field and able to connect students with endless opportunities. The school has so many extras for students, it is worth the investment."
Junior,5,"It's incredibly expensive, but that affords a lot of great opportunity and connection. The food is terrible and there's a horrible monopoly on catered food from a horrendous company called ""Bon Appetit."" There's great art and a vibrant scene for artistic creation, especially for a majorly STEM school."
Graduate Student,5,"CWRU might not be perfect, but what I love about it is that the administration actually listens to the students and we see the changes which makes it a good learning environment.
They make us feel they're working with us for our best interest"
Alum,5,"Studied chemical engineering and environmental studies at CWRU. Did an engineering co-op through the university, so I lived in Cleveland for about 5 years. Lots of great professors, resources, and hardworking students. It's a big university, so your experience can depend a lot on which department you are in (which major you select)."
Graduate Student,5,Case Western has the best professors and they actually get to know you. The diversity and intelligence on the campus is incredible.
Junior,5,"I chose Case Western for my undergraduate education to pursue nursing, as the Frances Payne Bolton Nursing School is in the Top 10 in the country. When I visited the campus for the first time in snowy January 2015 from Phoenix, Arizona, my mind had a culture shock. Despite the weather (which I am now used to), I fell in love with Case and the nursing school because of the commitment to intelligence and hands-on learning. When I was in my second week of college ever, I was in the hospital interacting with patients. I even helped save someone's life before my first semester ended. Case shows so much dedication to its students and professors take the time to work with every individual. I have never regretted my decision coming here, and found so many opportunities-- such as working at the Cleveland Clinic and as a camp counselor-- along the way."
Alum,5,"Wide range of course and extracurricular opportunities. It was great to be able to try new activities and new educational experiences, while finding the career path for me."
Sophomore,5,"Case Western Reserve University provides students with endless opportunities. Their motto, ""Think Beyond the Possible"" stands true in every aspect. The university brings actors and famous individuals who have made a difference in the community along with producing shows, novels, etc. There are events and clubs for every type of student to participate in while achieving academic success."
Niche User,5,I loved the think box and the beautiful campus. I also like that it is in the city of Cleveland because it gives me access to many important resources and opportunities.
Graduate Student,5,"Houston AA Campus is very welcoming and homey. Such a close knit group, who wouldn't want to be apart of it."
Freshman,5,"Very smart people hear. My previous high school teacher went to this school and told me that there is a lot of opportunities, academically, for research and otherwise."
Freshman,5,"Coming into Case has been a great experience. Overall the school is a great place to learn, and though difficult there is always a person or resource to turn to. Life is full of activities, and people are not all stuck in their books, at least on weekends. The school feels very much like a community of its own at times, but I can also feel like a part of Cleveland and enjoy downtown with ease."
Niche User,5,"I liked the atmosphere as a whole. I love the nursing program, and how it starts clinicals within 3 weeks."
Graduate Student,5,"This is an excellent university and produces successful and driven alum. Their graduate programs are far better than their undergraduate programs, especially financially. It is not a good bang for your buck unless you are getting a doctoral level degree."
Junior,5,My experience at Case Western has been a great one. The campus culture is one of the most inviting that I have ever seen. The professors and faculty as well as the students help everyone feel at home there!
Freshman,5,Great School with small classes and nice people. I am so excited to be enrolled in CWRU. It has great professors and fantastic undergraduate program.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to Case Western Reserve University after my freshman year.  While I found it difficult to fit in at first, I soon began to call this place my home and found my college family.  Go Material Science!"
Freshman,5,"Case Western is such a great school. Case is very focused on academics, and the professors are very devoted to helping students learn. The atmosphere of the campus is great as well. Everyone is very friendly, and it blows me away. The campus is also extremely diverse, which I love. Case is very proud of its diverse campus and continually works hard to ensure that it remains a safe campus for students from any background.  It is a great school, and I always feel safe. I would recommend it to anyone."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus feel of the University yet it is surrounded by the city.  So many opportunities with Case Western.  The people I came in contact with were probably the friendliest of all my 20+ college tours.
Freshman,5,Amazing academics and very friendly students. This is a small and rigorous school and is much like you would expect it to be. If you want a quiet environment just for school work you can have that and if you want to be involved in a bunch of clubs and party you can do that too.
Niche User,5,What i liked about case westeren reserve university is the campus was amazingly big. The dorms were awsome and cozy.
Freshman,4,"I am living on campus, so I have a hybrid experience. All teachers are super accommodating. I was quarantined for the first two weeks I got here, so that was rough. Yet, my profs were still super nice and checked in with me all the time. I come from a small school and was worried that profs were going to be distant but they are not at all. If you are picking your sages and like civics go with Dr. Busch or Dr. Goldman both great profs!"
Freshman,4,"Just like everyone says, a lot of people here are passionate and studious. I am a freshman and in the Class of 2024. I will say, with only freshman on campus, its weird. A lot of the athletes party and whatever ppl that like to rush also party. Its hard to find ppl who aren't the partying type, which is weird because the upperclassmen are super chill and the complete opposite. Academics are great and challenging. I am not relearning anything or wasting my time. It is a good school, there is a social scene and people care. If you aren't a big party person, that's okay too. I am not but I'm still finding friends, its weird with COVID tho yk?"
Senior,4,"Case is a great school for academics and research. My professors are absolutely incredible. The party scene is not very good at all. There is also very little school spirit in regards to sports, which is what you expect with a D3 school. I played varsity volleyball here for 2 years which was a great experience. Underclassman housing is joke---there is no AC, buildings are so old, kinda gross tbh. But upperclassmen housing is very nice especially the village and STJ. While Case is expensive (especially housing), it has given me the best four years of my life. I am very grateful for the education I received while at this school and for the people I have met."
Sophomore,4,"I personally don't like online learning but it wasn't terrible. There were still ""office hours"" and I actually went to a couple. My French teacher was very still accommodating and supporting through the whole process; other teachers were lenient on assignments. They knew how difficult it was for everyone and they really were thoughtful on how to go about things."
Sophomore,4,"I love pretty much all things Case. It was my number one school that I honestly didn't think I was going to get in and that even if I got in, I wouldn't be able to attend because of cost but to my surprise, I was able to attend. My first-year went great; I met a lot of great people, went to a few events, joined a few clubs, and just overall enjoyed my stay. It's a great school academically and the location is also good - it's right by the Cleveland Clinic and two other hospitals and being a pre-med, that's really fulfilling."
Sophomore,4,"While transitioning to online learning was somewhat difficult, I think most of my professors did a very good of making the transition smooth. I appreciate that they still maintained digital office hours and several of them asked for our input on the changes they wanted to make to how they were running class."
Senior,4,CWRU has done a great job to tradition to online courses. Learning in a home environment comes with its own challenges and I do notth
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed my experience at Case Western, learned a lot that prepared me for my success as a mechanical engineer."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes after COVID affected the year were mixed- some professors were able to Change to the situation better than others. But overall it was a positive experience. Summer classes have also been moved to online, and so far May term has been positive."
Graduate Student,4,I never took an online class at Case Western Reserve University but I assume they worked out for the students in them.
Alum,4,I loved the curriculum and the teaching and learning style. I like the diverse staff and students and also how classes are scheduled to fit individual life style. However Case Western Reserve University is super expensive and especially the paying close to $60000.00 for a 2 year graduate degree in Social work is not worth it.
Graduate Student,4,"Great infrastructure conducive to learning with diverse opportunities for improving your academic experience. However, the school is very expensive when compared to its counterparts unless you have a good scholarship."
Sophomore,4,"Fantastic professors and academic programs, at least in personal experience, dorm living is typical, not that much of a party school, decently safe for a city environment, meal plan is annoying but food itself is okay"
Sophomore,4,"Overall this is a great school with many opportunities and capable students! However, a huge focus on academics and generally gloomy weather can create challenges at times"
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the campus life and making friends while I was at school there. There is always a ton of student organizations that host events on the weekends and weeknights, so I never was bored. I wish that the student body cared more about the sports teams and went to more games. Overall I feel like I received a great education, and that I learned a lot. I didn't always have the most attentive or enthusiastic professors, but there are some that really stood out to me."
Freshman,4,"I love the opportunities that CWRU offers its students. All of the people here are passionate, intelligent, and dedicated to their studies. There's no shortage of advising and support (both academically and otherwise) for the students. As a freshman I've really loved my time here so far!"
Freshman,4,It is a good school for focusing on academics and not parties. Living in a good freshmen dorm depends on what residential community you decide to live in.
Junior,4,"Rigorous academics, not a huge party school, but there is stuff if you’re looking for it. Students aren’t competitive, help each other. Plenty of extracurriculars to choose from, something for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Case Western Reserve University has a nice campus and fantastic academics. The diversity could be better, but there definitely seem to be efforts to improve it."
Freshman,4,"Its a great institution with so many opportunities and such helpful professors. Cleveland weather sucks but other than that, truly all good things to say about this institution!"
Niche User,4,"Personally,  I consider that professors in CWRU are very motivated and engaged in assisting the students in their future career. Furthermore, CWRU also provides many research opportunities for students. Although full-year tuition is high, CWRU does provide the necessary amount of university scholarship or grants that are needed to meet your financial circumstances."
Sophomore,4,I love the challenge that the school provides. Many of the students that go there were the top in their class so you know that  you are surrounded by people who are going to be doing great things in life. That being said this allows you to make connections with people that can later help you to advance in life. One thing that I would love to see is more diversity on campus.
Niche User,4,"Case ranks as on of the top national research universities and is for good reason. Its proximity to Cleveland Clinic Headquarters, University Hospitals, and a host of research complexes is perfect for students who are interested in conducting research and volunteering to build a strong resume for medical school."
Alum,4,CWRU is an incredible school when it comes to the abundant amount of resources available to students and the clear passion all students have for learning. It is definitely a tough school though and time management is key to succeeding here.
Senior,4,This university is the perfect size. It is located in a great area of Cleveland and the professors are some of the top notch instructors you can find.
Senior,4,"If you're looking for a place to receive a quality STEM education and a degree that packs a punch, CWRU is a great school. Despite its sub-par food, lacking social atmosphere, dorms that are only decent once you're an upperclassman, and dis-appreciation for the social science and humanities, CWRU is actually a stimulating place to learn. Classes are challenging, innovative, and very focused on team work."
Senior,4,"I love the location and the professors at this school, and the atmosphere of students really wasn't too competitive. However, sometimes it could be an unhealthy environment that relentlessly values work over health and safety. In addition, the administration did not really listen to student wants, and could be very superficial in their gestures to student demands."
Alum,4,Overall I am very happy with my experience at Case Western Reserve University. It is a school for a very particular kind of student. The classes will challenge you and push you farther in academics than you ever thought you could go. That being said it is up to each student to meet the challenge of the rigorous coursework . There is a certain amount of competition between students particularly in the pre-health fields but close friendships are formed through collaborative work.
Sophomore,4,I like how open the campus is. I wish the eateries nearby honored the campus currency. Also I wish there was better transportation
Junior,4,"Most of the classes I've taken here are high quality and the professors are generally good at what they do (this is from a student who's taking mostly language and literature-type courses). However, I feel like that the cost for room and board are way overpriced for what they offer."
Freshman,4,"Overall, Case is an excellent research-based university. Professors are passionate in both teachings and in their research."
Junior,4,"What I love most about Case is the general attitude around failure. There hasn't been a single class I've been in during my first three years at the university where messing up hasn't been celebrated as unanimously as succeeding has. What I've noticed, is that professors here especially are really concerned with the way you learn from your mistakes. Getting something right the first time is always what we'll hope for ourselves, but the professors here at CWRU understand that we're in a highly competitive environment. Not everyone is going to come in first place. So they take the time to foster an environment where failure is seen as the first step to success. And it's made me a better, more competitive, more curious, and well rounded student. I'll always be grateful to CWRU for helping me learn as an adult that it doesn't matter how many times you fail as long as you figure out why it happened and allow yourself to move forward."
Sophomore,4,"Case is filled with resources available to astute students who utilize them. Professors in small classes feel human, filled with personality and interest in the students. I would like to see professors who teach in lecture halls to either be more passionate about the subject they teach or at least act less robotic."
Sophomore,4,"Fine schools. On-campus employment to international students is very unfriendly. Faculty is not very responsible because most professors are focusing on research, it is important to learn these by myself. EECS department is really underfunded."
Alum,4,Overall great university - professors are really helpful and staff is friendly.  location is in a bad neighborhood but okay if you are careful in your daily life. Students are not so friendly to international peers. As an international students I loved my time spent in CASE.
Freshman,4,"Case Western is a near-perfect mix of a small and big school. There are always new people to meet, but I can't walk across campus without seeing at least a few people I know. School spirit isn't Case Western's strong suit, but the school's prestige makes up for it. I haven't met many people who would say Case Western is their top choice, but it's definitely a great place to be!"
Sophomore,4,"We are a very academically driven university. The academics are great and there are many opportunities for students. Campus life, is eh because of the type of students attracted here, but everyone is very focused and driven."
Senior,4,Nice research facilities. A lot of undergraduate research opportunities. The social scenes are very weak. 
Freshman,4,Case Western Reserve University is a great place for anyone interested in engineering or have a pre med track in mind. There are so many opportunities around the area for students to get involved in. Cleveland is also a very nice area to be around as well. 
Senior,4,I'm learning much concerning Mechanical Engineering as the courses are detailed and interesting. The schools campus is nice and diversified.
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year going to CWRU, and honestly I'm having a blast. The atmosphere is exactly what I was looking for, and the opportunities that are available to me honestly seem limitless sometimes. "
College Sophomore,4,"This school is fantastic, academics wise and social wise. It offers a wide variety of opportunities to please all kinds of students and what they're looking for."
College Sophomore,4,"The career prospect is very promising. This school has a great name and great reputation, and great education of course."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are great, but I go to a division 3 school so sports are not the main priority."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a fun and friendly learning environment, and the people make the experience even better"
College Sophomore,4,I don't like the SAGES program. Classes are large in lower level classes and size decrease as difficulty increases.
College Senior,4,"Greek Life is an extremely positive force on campus, but sometimes is considered pretentious and elitist."
College Senior,4,"Great mix of people from around the world. Difficult academics, but wonderful preparation for the real world."
College Sophomore,4,"Case is an academically rigorous school that may stress you out at times, but it is all worth it. The professors are nice and helpful if you ask, and the courses are all genuinely interesting. Tutoring services are also very helpful. There are many different courses to choose from and class sizes are generally pretty small. Large lectures like gen chem can have up to 400 students, but once you get to your second year they usually don't exceed 50."
College Sophomore,4,"CWRU is a very academically inclined school; the students care about their studies and put them first, but find ways to have fun and enjoy their college experience. As a biomedical engineering student, I have very rigorous classes, but joining clubs, a sorority, and getting an undergraduate research position have made my overall experience unforgettable."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe when I'm with friends. By myself, idk, not so much."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a club called ""Blue CWRU"" that was founded to bring more attention to the varsity sports, and it is cool that they do that."
College Sophomore,4,I love working for the athletic department and varsity sports are always improving!
College Freshman,4,"If I had a second chance I think that although I would apply to more schools to give myself more opportunities that ultimately regardless of the number of applications I would still end up choosing Case Western. It is a fantastic school with so many spectacular students, each with a detailed history and bright future. Some of my favorite experiences include the first week of orientation when you get to meet everyone and just enjoy the college life without the stress of classes or exams. Case Western is unique because the campus encompasses the local University Hospital and the prevalence of graduate students inspires students to be the best undergraduate student they can in order to get the best in the future."
College Student,4,I personally do not know much about it because I am a new incoming student. If 21 or over there are accessible bars in Cleveland. Many different places and transportation that I've learned about through family who live in the area. Cool bowling and karaoke nights for any student. Discount on games and shows in the Cleveland area that are very fun to go too.
College Student,4,"I do not know much, but I know parties do happen but not on the level that they do at other schools. Case is not a party school. It's more events and get togethers or parties on a smaller scale that just help people get to know each other."
College Student,4,"Good transportation and places nearby, but I do not know much about it. I am a new incoming student and am not sure, but it isn't a huge party school. Great because students can attend shows and games in Cleveland and get discounts. Also get free bus pass and have great transportation. If you are 21 or over there are bars and places in Cleveland but I am only 18 and only know about them because my family is familiar with the area."
College Student,4,"No crazy ragers or anything, but students have parties to get to know others and their parties have a more positive impact. However, I do not know much about them, but I know that students have fun gatherings and karaoke nights and events."
College Student,4,"It is incredibly diverse. It's very interesting, many students are from other states and countries and it's incredible. Many opportunities for everyone and very nice people."
College Student,4,As far as I know it is great. I haven't seen any drugs or students complaining about it. Case is not a party school but I'm sure some students may go to places that serve alcohol downtown/around town when of age.
Sophomore,2,"Case Western Reserve University had a very hard time transitioning to online learning. Most professors were not trained or ready for online learning. Additionally, some professors have chosen to cope with online earning by making content 'harder.' In other words making it physically and mentally challenging for students by increasing coursework and testing unknown materials to decrease cheating. Additionally, many have been unresponsive in office hours and working with students on problems. It seems like, with online teaching, the flaws in the education system have come to light where teachers might not always care about what students actually learn."
Graduate Student,2,Recently finished a PhD at CWRU. I would say that the graduate courses were more of formality--some professors barely showed up to the classes they were to teach. It is incredibly expensive and there were not a lot of funding opportunities. My department would not allow students to be part-time which meant you could not work a full-time job as a grad student or receive a livable stipend particularly if you happened to have children. People are impressed when you say you received your degree from CWRU. Received minimal dissertation guidance and support from my research advisor and committee. Very low diversity across campus. There are very few persons of color accepted as students into programs but a lot of international students.  The food scene is excellent.
Freshman,2,Case Western Reserve University was a small school with not much going on.  I attended on scholarship but ultimately it wasn't for me so I left to attend another institution.  The area it is located is not in a great part of Cleveland.
Sophomore,2,"it's a good school. the academics are there, although a lot of the professors are kinda mediocre and some need to be educated about racial sensitivity. people talk up the school a lot more than it deserves. social scene and spirit are dead. a lot of the students are generally unhappy. the weather sucks. the food is awful. but it is a good school and the opportunities are wonderful. greek life is also a great part of campus life. going greek made my semester bearable."
Alum,2,"Biggest pros: This is an elite university across all majors.  If difficulty is your KPI, it outclasses any other school in the state. Biggest cons: Career center is completely worthless; good luck.  "
College Sophomore,2,"I mean it depends. For freshmans, the newer buldings like Taft and Smith are pretty nice. The older buildings, like Storrs and Pierce, are pretty ugly and have smaller rooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is expensive and takes up too much of your time. You can make great friends, but you can do that without paying too."
College Senior,2,Co-op office can't handle the students they have
College Senior,2,I never bothered with the drunken buffoonery available.
College Senior,2,"Heh heh. I played in a mediocre marching band and watched our division three football team get their rears handed to them from the bleachers. 

Don't expect much."
College Freshman,2,"There's no real good way ti put this so I'm gonna be blunt. Football games, soccer games, pretty much most sports games don't turn up much of a crowd at all. Basketball games are much better but it's still not what you'd see at other schools. Of big sporting events are your thing then this school isn't for you. What case does have is a great intermural sports program. Lots of people enter and it's a really fun way to make new friends."
College Junior,2,"There might be something going on about every other weekend. And because parties are so hard to come by, they usually are busted pretty quickly."
College Freshman,2,"worked like ivy league, degree regarded as less, expensive, terrible weather, no parties... but at least its ranked #38 on US news and reports, thats about it."
College Sophomore,2,"Horrible cultural foods and all overpriced. A sandwhich, three snacks, and a soda for $13? Forget it!"
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls, while accessible, are universally known to be pretty terrible. However on and around campus there are plenty of great options for meals, some of which take meal swipes or case cash. So I'd say, get the lowest meal swipe meal plan and then get off it as soon as possible and enjoy all the food Cleveland has to offer (which is plenty)."
College Freshman,2,"BLEH! Oh my god Bon Appetite is terrible. Okay, not that bad, it's just that first semester you're like 'Eh.. this is okay. Not as bad as it could be.' And then you come back after winter break and it's just downhill from there. I have to force myself to use my meal swipes. Jolly is pretty good compared to other things on campus but you only get 2 meal swipes for things (Jolly Scholar and Denny's) that aren't the campus dining halls which is so restricting. There's barely any variety at Leutner and it's just.. bad. Bearable, but bad."
College Junior,2,"For how much you pay, campus food is terrible. On the other hand, once you're off the meal plan, you have some better, less expensive choices."
College Junior,2,"You are required to live on campus your first two years, and after that, you can lose up to $11,000 in grants if you live off campus. This hurts need-based students, and on campus housing is quite expensive."
College Freshman,2,No one really attends games which is sad but there are varsity and club teams you can join!
College Freshman,2,Parties are bad. All the things that happen after people get drunk.... What has been seen cannot be unseen.
College Freshman,2,"The kids get drunk every other weekend. Some people are even smoking ""therapeutic herbs"" in the residence halls."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Freshman year it seems amazing-- you get SO much money. Then you realize that it is all a sham when you come to school the next year and get $10,000 less. You have to FIGHT for aid. You have to go in there and make sure you are talking to the right person. They have the money. I have gotten my grants raised every single year but you have to make sure that you ask."
College Junior,2,There's a lot of schoolwork going on. There needs to be more of that other stuff.
College Junior,2,"People are pretty diverse, though there does seem to be a trend of either really geeky people or people who want to party, and not as much between."
College Junior,2,They care a lot about their research. Wish they cared that much about their students.
College Junior,2,Most buildings look old and a bit ugly. Spread of campus makes it a bit hard to have a community amongst students.
College Junior,2,Lots of dirty work and an inflexible curriculum. Internships mainly revolve around manufacturing. BME is overloaded.
College Junior,2,Lots of dirty work and an inflexible curriculum. Internships mainly revolve around manufacturing. BME is overloaded. Registration is a huge hassle because of limited class size.
College Junior,2,"Intramurals are run well. Varsities have performed well, but nobody really cares."
College Junior,2,Surrounding area is very bad and has been known to trickle onto campus on occasion.
College Junior,2,"There are some connections with surrounding companies, but many aren't extremely solid. Lots of competition and Cleveland isn't exactly a booming city."
College Sophomore,2,Not a party type of location.
College Sophomore,2,"Most girls don't attempt to impress the guys. They don't dress well and let their stress get to them and overeat. There are still plenty of attractive girls, though."
College Senior,2,"Students and faculty members are frequently mugged but 95% of the time, incidents occur without any injury. We get security alerts frequently from Case Security which is good to keep us up to date and police frequently roams the area, but does not usually catch any of the suspects mentioned in security alerts, or does not inform the student body if they do."
College Senior,2,"Apparently this has changed recently, but the hours of the dining halls used to be terrible. 

Also, fruit basically does not exists in the dining halls and if it does it is very poor quality. They claim to have a huge variety, but in reality it's the same thing week to week. Everyone gains weight eating at those dining halls because you end up hating what you get and you go get something else. This happens probably twice a meal and you end up eating a ton."
College Sophomore,2,"For freshmen, the financial aid process goes by fairly smoothly. After freshman year it gets harder to get the financial aid you need. Tips, record every expense so that if your debts are more than your income they can make an exception and give you more money!"
College Sophomore,2,it's rarely not grey outside
College Sophomore,2,"It's Cleveland. The food is average, but nothing like what you would get in a place like New York."
College Sophomore,2,The campus is strict on pretty much everything
College Freshman,2,no one cares about them
College Sophomore,2,I will not stay in Cleveland because I hate the weather so much
College Sophomore,2,There are no clubs or bars to go to.  House or dorm parties are the only option and the cops or RAs usually bust them
College Freshman,2,"Could be better, never really had a problem with going from place to place, but getting home for me has been a bit of a hassle."
College Freshman,2,The weather sucks most of the time it changes when it pleases and gets really depressing really fast
College Sophomore,2,"People are here to study, not to be athletes"
College Sophomore,2,"Not much to do after hours, not a good scene"
College Sophomore,2,"foreign students hate you, and everyone is wealthy"
College Freshman,2,"Case was very disappointing, and I wish I could transfer (but can't due to personal reasons). Lots of things (i.e. meal plan, coursework, weather) seem fine once you start at Case, but get old and frustrating very quickly. On-campus dining is bad, off-campus dining is bad, safety is a BIG concern, courses are overly hard, the weather's terrible, and every student going here seems to just shrug off everything and put on their Case goggles, refusing to acknowledge the bad quality of the school and just going with it. It's a bad experience, and this is nowhere near the top-tier school I thought I was attending, the stellar college that was my top choice back when I applied to college."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics are mediocre, and no one but athletes and their friends pay attention to them, pretty much."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't tons of parties, and there's not a lot to eat late at night, esp. after 12-1 AM (literally only one restaurant is open at that time, and it's terribly-unhealthy fast food). To be honest, you really shouldn't go out at night, just so you don't get robbed or attacked."
College Freshman,2,"With regard to tolerance for diversity, whether it is ethnic, sexual, or religious, there aren't any intolerant people here, really. People are receptive to others of different races, sexes, and beliefs. However, the racial diversity is pretty bad. Most students are white, and relatively few are of a different ethnicity. This year, Case tried to help remedy this by accepting 250 or so students from China (about 1/5th of our freshman class!) but these people speak little English, thus solidifying the ethnic barrier in the school."
College Freshman,2,"Sports don't have a large following on campus. The teams are decent, but school spirit is lacking. Varsity, club, and intramural sports all share the same athletic facilities, so the time and space can be rather inconvenient; however, a new athletic facility is supposed to be built soon. "
College Freshman,2,"The tuition is so high, and there aren't that many scholarships available for students to actually apply for.  At least, not that I know of. I guess you're pretty much stuck with what the school gives you in your acceptance package.  "
College Sophomore,2,"Not many people participate in drinking and drugs. I've noticed that more people use drugs (ADHD medication, marijuana, etc) than drink. However, it is really easy to get alcohol on campus and as long as you don't get caught drinking in your dorm, you are fine. Getting caught by an RA just means you will be sent to a meeting with your housing adviser (usually you just get a warning)."
College Sophomore,2,"My school is not known for having big parties. If you are underage, you can find one or two parties a weekend. There are places to go on other nights of the week (off campus) but getting there/home is difficult (unless a friend has a car on campus) and you are usually too busy with classwork to go out during the week. However, once you turn 21, the downtown area has a lot of great bars and clubs as well as music venues to go to."
College Freshman,2,"To be honest, the weather here is quite bad.  Closer to summer, it's sunny and warm, but when it hits November it's bad.  There is a lot of snow and rain as well as wind.  That's okay though, because there are plenty of ways to get around campus without walking or biking!"
College Sophomore,2,"Case Western is a haven for people who want to exist in college as introvertedly as possible. The majority of people who go to case are engineering majors, which wouldn't really be a problem, but case has a very vigorous and intense engineering program that simply consumes most of the time, energy, and moral of the students under it. Under this amount of pressure, most of the students are focused mainly on not failing their classes and have little to no time to create or participate in fun things to do on campus. Their is really nothing to do in cleveland, and even less to do on campus, unless you get really fired up about going to diversity brunches and indian acapella or dance teams. I thought that anywhere i went for college i would be guaranteed a fun and interesting experience but i was surely wrong. this is no place for a person who wants to make friends and have fun, especially when you are not involved in a fraternity or a sports team. Don't come to this school"
College Sophomore,2,There are not many major parities but there are parties here. There's a specific group of people that typically go out. There are many bars downtown and it's not very hard for and underage drinker to get alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,Personally I would never want to live in Cleveland. There are many things to do in Cleveland but I just would not like to live in Cleveland or anywhere in Ohio after I graduate.
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many spots besides parking ramps but the ramps typically require permits or cost a lot of money. The permits also are expensive. Cars are not needed on campus but it is nice to have one. 
College Senior,1,Campus police wage a forever war against students
College Senior,1,Probably several times a day there are robberies
College Senior,1,"literally crap for being $6,000 a month"
College Senior,1,Administration extorts the students here
College Senior,1,"Huge focus on sexual assault, little to nothing done with the epidemic of on-campus and off-campus muggings, lol thanks case. I miss my cell phone."
College Senior,1,"As a freshman you get to walk a mile and a half to classes through the snow, pay 9 grand a year for a single if you want that, and get to fight the aging buildings. As an upperclassman you get to pay similarly and live in the older, cruddier buildings closer to the quad. Wait, nah... they are all cruddy. You could also pay for an apartment 'managed' by the university and have more black mold than you would if you just rented from one of the nearby slumlords."
College Senior,1,"This college is completely screwed up, in my opinion. Quality of professors is incredibly variable. Some professors cannot be bothered to help their students learn. Classes between departments are never coordinated properly, classes inside departments are coordinated very poorly if at all. Prerequisite/Corequeiste means nothing. Taking a different section of the same class with a different professor might mean you get a completely different coverage of materials. Course sequencing is illogical. Campus does little to promote safety and there are violent crimes and shooting, and yet the only awareness programs to 'promote safety' concern sexual violence and not self defense or the like. Computer Engineering here is a complete joke, which is sad for a university that invented the discipline, and you are run through a gauntlet of completely disjointed elective classes that are supposed to build off of each other, but one class ends and another begins with a huge gap of information left between them, and the general response to this is ""oh, just learn that on your own"". This is not basic stuff I am talking about, I have had classes where the professors simply expect you to come in with an understanding of a programming language not covered at all by any other classes in the university. Just go do it. Here is a book, and we will be getting to your first assignment shortly. 

And the weather sucks. Go anywhere else."
College Freshman,1,International kids don't even get a single penny
College Junior,1,"High cost, small rooms, little atmosphere"
College Senior,1,"The safety and security are absolutely terrifying.  We just had three armed gunmen enter one of the study rooms and rob students at gun point (7/19).  This is the latest of many crimes happening on campus and affecting students, as in the students are victims.  The school made no comment to the students in regards to what the university will do to prevent such issues."
College Sophomore,1,"It's really cold most of the time. There is rarely any sun, it's usually gloomy and cloudy. The winters are long and cold and dreary."
College Sophomore,1,There is no variety in nightlife. The only option are frat parties and after the first few even they get old. There are no nearby bars or clubs.
College Sophomore,1,It's non existent except as a social girl or a guy from select frats.
College Sophomore,1,D3 school.  Enough said
College Sophomore,1,"There is no sun.  If it's not raining, it's snowing"
College Sophomore,1,Total ripoff - $1350/month rent is ridiculous
College Sophomore,1,"The food is so bad, that you should not go here"
College Freshman,1,"HORRIBLE WEATHER. Winter is bad here, make sure you bring plenty to wear. I suggest a heavy coat, scarf or neck gaiter, gloves, earmuffs, a hat, boots, and other additional layers. Don't bring any bobsleds, snowboards, etc. because the campus is too flat for any fun in the snow."
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process is long and insane, and some of my documents were lost."
College Freshman,1,"The weather in Cleveland sucks. Period. It's pretty cold here during the winter and it can be super bipolar. The walk to class is long so you just have to make sure you dress appropriately and you'll be fine. The school offers ""greenies"" which are shuttle busses that can take you to and from the dorms/main quad, but they're fairly unreliable so expect to deal with the elements if you chose to come to school here."
College Junior,1,No friendly parking areas.  Parking  lots are a distance away.  Meters have been put up everywhere and times to pay have been extended.
College Sophomore,1,The weather is terrible from December to May. It snows constantly and we never see the sun.
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a nightmare on campus. It is inconvenient and expensive.
College Sophomore,1,Terrible there aren't many spaces along the street and a parking pass is expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is very expensive here at Case. However, you don't need a car. You can have one if you want (all four years), but you can also have a bike and you get a free public transportation pass for all of Cleveland when you come to campus, so although a car can be nice, it is not necessary... and in my opinion... a waste of money."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Cleveland is cold, rainy, and gray all the time.  It's only sunny about 85 days a year, and that's in the summer when school is out.  It's also extremely humid all the time which makes is either colder or hotter depending on the season."
College Freshman,1,The weather is awful. It rains all the time in Cleveland and is usually cloudy. It's a pain walking 20 minutes to class in crappy weather.
College Freshman,1,"Case Western is located in Cleveland, the center of rain storms and snow storms. In a week, you are much more likely to be walking 20 minutes to your class while wearing rain boots or snow boots than sandals and flip flops. The sun almost never shines in Cleveland, but when it does, everyone goes outside. Our university never closes even during really bad storms, either. We were the only school in Ohio that wasn't off for hurricane Sandy."
College Freshman,1,"They gave me a great financial aid package for the year, and it appeared that it would cover all of my expenses. When it was all said and done, I owed $2000 at the end of my first semester. My family is very tight with money and cannot contribute anything, so I had to talk to them about what I could do to pay the remaining $2000 and they werent helpful at all. The counselor just sat there and looked at me like I was an idiot and offered no reasonable solution to help me out."
College Freshman,1,"They force everyone to buy an expensive meal plan for your first four semesters. However, it is nearly impossible to use everything you pay for due to the rules they have on swipes. No double swiping friends in, no swiping at a location more than once per day, no more than four swipes per day, only one swipe per week here, etc. Therefore, most people only are able to use about half of what they are forced to pay for. This means that, by not using everything on top of the already expensive costs, every time you eat it is about a $20 meal. And let me tell you, the food is no better than a $5 buffet at any restaurant, if even."
College Freshman,1,"I don't understand how people can possibly say the internet is fast here. It's the slowest, most unreliable connection that I've seen at any school. When I do speed tests on the wired ""gigabit"" connection, I get around 2.5 megabits per second, every time. Compared to 50 or higher that all of my friends at other schools get, I would say that this is quite bad. Also, it's very unwise to rely on wifi, because you frequently drop connection. Everyone I know has resorted to using 3G and 4G on their smartphones, as it's both faster and more reliable. For all the hype, the connectivity is a huge letdown."
College Senior,1,"Not a Lot of Minority Students – I really don't see a lot of African American students on campus, and the ones that I do see and know have experienced some type of discrimination regarding their grades. There are a majority of Asian students enrolled and some Indian students, but I have not heard of any complaints from these groups."
College Junior,1,"Case Western is not a school for athletics. It's a research university, and most people are too busy studying to even make it to a sporting event. In fact, I hear more complaining about the noise generated by events than I hear cheering for our athletes. Not to mention, most athletic teams are Div. 3, so that in itself isn't too exciting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Snow, Cold, and Gloomy – If sunshine is a really important thing to you when choosing a college, do not choose Case.  However, if you are from the Midwest and are used to crazy weather and harsh winters than honestly Cleveland will be business as usual.  You really only see the sun from May to September (mainly summer months) and then the other 7 months is some form of winter."
College Senior,1,"People Are Introverts, There Are Some Nicer People – It doesn't matter though, you'll never have time to do anything because every professor acts as if his or her class is the only class in the world and assigns absurd amounts of material and work.   the social scene is entirely absent.  if you hate fun, then come to Case!"
College Senior,1,"State of the Art, Circa 2003 – The computers in Nord lab and KSL are at least 6 years old, since the all run windows XP.  some computers have since been upgraded to Windows 7, but because they weren't designed to handle the OS, they take forever to log on.  Sometimes I feel like it'd be faster to train a carrier pigeon to take a message to a professor than it would be so send an email with one of those ""computers."""
College Senior,1,"Unsafe.  Don't Go Here. In my four years here I have been assaulted twice, one time was when the sun was still up.  It took the university police FORTY MINUTES to respond.  the students are constantly harassed, mugged, assaulted by people in the neighborhood and the assailants are NEVER caught.  not a week goes by without a ""security alert"" detailing the latest assault and how the perpetrator wasn't caught.  if you have any sense of safety, or just want to go through college with your psyche intact, don't got to cwru."
College Senior,1,Off-Campus Life – parking isn't enough and is very difficult to find and the parking permits are way too expensive
College Freshman,1,Parking is horrible on campus.  The options are very limited and parking passes are way too expensive.  The upside is that public transportation is excellent and students get free passes.
College Freshman,1,Not Happy at All – I'm an international relations major and the major has been given a different name at Case Western. The humanities department is incredible lacking for the majority of the school is centered around the medical and technological industries.

Junior,5,all the professors are great and flexible. they are always willing to communicate via zoom or video chat. and emails replies are generally quick. they also tend to assign more affordable/free textbooks.
Senior,5,"My online professors were awesome gave very clear instructions and were very helpful. I feel like learning online is hard, but my professor made it a good experience"
Senior,5,Amazing professors. I feel so comfortable and welcomed at my school. The environment is positive and the people are amazing.
Junior,5,I love going to school here. The location is second to none for Boston schools and employment opportunities in the area are limitless.
Junior,5,"Excellent school, everyone is friendly and driven. Professors care about students and generally make efforts for us to be successful."
Alum,5,Ideal location right in the heart of Boston. School offers plenty of co-op and internship opportunities at various leading hospitals in the area.
Junior,5,"There are so many opportunities at Suffolk, I’ve been blessed with many who have shaped me into who I am today. From a trip to Burma to weekly trips to the Boston Food Bank. I don’t regret ever choosing Suffolk University. One thing I would change is privileges in the cafeterias for Student Athletes, they workout everyday and eat more than any ordinary student."
Junior,5,"The professor are very understanding and do what it takes to get you the information. Although I dislike online, Suffolk has made it an easy transition."
Senior,5,I love Suffolk. The professors are very knowledgeable and the environment helps you learn responsibility for your self.
Freshman,5,I love Suffolk it is wonderful to have a campus that is a city. The faculty and administrators are so helpful. I am so happy that I choose Suffolk and I cannot wait and see what the next three years hold for me.
Sophomore,5,"I love my school! I love how diverse my school is, maybe 3 out of 5 students in my class are from different countries. We learn so many things from each other, everyone is nice, professors are professional and well educated. I'm planning to attend graduate school at Suffolk when I finish my undergraduate program."
Freshman,5,I LOVE SUFFOLK. This is a good place for people who does not have an experience of what it look like out of their house.
Sophomore,5,"I study Global Business and Big Data, and I couldn't ask for a better school. All of the professors care about the students. Students are given real life experiences and opportunities due to the location."
Sophomore,5,"With my time at Suffolk University, I have experienced quite a lot. Being in the city has opened so many opportunities for me. It is so interesting that some of my professors also have other jobs in addition to teaching at Suffolk. It opens up so many opportunities for internships and jobs. My professors have taken time out of their days to help me further my career and to help me succeed academically."
Senior,5,The professors are very committed to their students' success. Additionally they help their students attain professional experience to ensure employment post graduation. I've had an amazing epxerince and would reccomend to anyone interested in developing life long connections
Niche User,5,"I’m not a student at Suffolk yet, but I’m planning on going there. It’s my first pick and I got accepted there."
Freshman,5,"I liked the small college allowed for more a more personal college experience, and allowed me to connect with my peers much easier and my teachers. The clubs, programs, and classes were all useful and helped me grow and learn more about my possibilities in the future"
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved every second of my experience at Suffolk University!  From the friends I have made to the professors I have had to the program I am in, I have truly enjoyed my time at Suffolk.  Its unique location allows Suffolk to have great connections with businesses all around which provides students many job and internship opportunities as well as events to attend throughout the city.  Suffolk has not only given me the chance to become an Orientation Leader, but also a tour guide, and has even given me the chance to study abroad at our own Madrid Campus.  I have loved my time here at Suffolk and I wouldn't change a second of it for the world!"
Freshman,5,"Great area to be in boston, over all a good school academically. Classes are too big and the professors really prepare you"
Freshman,5,I play Basketball for Suffolk university so i really like the improvements in the athletic programs and the overall experience and connections you make academically.
Graduate Student,5,Suffolk University has stood out from day one. From the application process to the admission team they are very accommodating. I am currently a incoming graduate student. While I have not yet attended my first class I would say that the admission ceremony was a very warm and inviting event. The diversity grade truly reflects that. There is a wide range of students all over the world that attend Suffolk University. I am very exciting to start this new chapter of my life at Suffolk!
Alum,5,"Great campus, unbelievable internship opportunities due to the school’s connections and partnerships in high profile organizations both public and private."
Alum,5,Great university! A lot of real world experiences. Awesome Boston campus.theorifessors were also a delight to be around. Good school to talk about with others who are prospecting to attend!
Freshman,5,I love being a part of Suffolk University as it is such a diverse and optimistic place. The faculty and staff care very much about the students and there never seems to be a boring day around campus. there is always something to do.
Senior,5,My overall experience with Suffolk University has been great so far. I was unable to attend this semester because I am unable to afford the tuition and the financial staff put my in touch with multiple scholarship websites to be able to afford next semester. I was not aware of how many scholarship opportunities there were until the team at Suffolk University was able to inform me of them. I am also very happy with all of my professors at Suffolk. They are all very helpful and really care for their students.
Senior,5,"I loved suffolk, the History Department really cares about their students and there is always something to do on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love Suffolk because I love that the college experience is different there. I like that we can walk outside and be at school or be anywhere we want in the city. So far, my experience at Suffolk academically has been amazing. I love all my professors and they've helped me tremendously."
Freshman,5,"My experience thus far has been amazing, I just completed my fall semester and did great. So far everything is going smoothly and I would not change a thing. It’s a great location and diversity is wonderful."
Junior,5,I love the way the professor encourages us to learn. I would love to have A place for students to park a parking...
Sophomore,5,I would like to see more opportunities for student involvement that further future careers. I would also like to be more informed about goings on about administration and student body elections.
Alum,5,"I love how Suffolk is situated right in the heart of Boston. The city really was like our campus. I also loved the fact that class sizes were relatively small, which allowed students to get to know their fellow classmates and professors, which contributed to the development of  life long friendships and mentors."
Junior,5,Suffolk has such a diverse environment that has made me more aware of different cultures and backgrounds. I think that one thing that does need to change is Professors' awareness and understanding of diversity.
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Suffolk. I am starting my second year at the university and have already taken advantage of the plethora of opportunities that the school offers. I've gone to model united nations conferences at Harvard, flown to Spain to Suffolk's Madrid campus, and been accepted as an RA for the 2018-2019 school year. Boston is the ideal place for college students and the opportunities in the city are endless. Suffolk set me up with the perfect work study and the dorms are clean and come with great views. I can't wait to go back in the fall. Go Rams!"
Senior,5,Awesome school right in the heart of Boston! there is always something to do either on campus or around the city.
Junior,5,Good teacher to student ratio and excellent location. Take advantage of the recourses on campus to make the most of your experiance
Freshman,5,"Suffolk University is what you call one diverse school. It's amazing to see different ethnicities coming together. And it's a plus being in the city, if you want more of the ""campus life"" then Suffolk isn't your school. But overall the school is wonderful academically!"
Freshman,5,"The academic lifestyle at Suffolk is very unique in a sense that everyone feels involved in their learning. The classrooms are small which enhances that fact that the professors are able to interact more closely with the students and have a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses that students have, rather than just having a big class and giving a lecture. Everyone feels accepted and the level of diversity creates a sense of community between all, which is what makes Suffolk a melting pot of diverse cultures, bringing in everyone together as a community and possibly a family."
Junior,5,"Still attending, but overall great campus. Awesome area, in the center of Boston. Go to Business school."
Junior,5,"Suffolk is a relatively small community so it is easy to meet other students, to talk with professors and make use of the available resources for students - which vary from academic to personal help, there are many resources! However, I am aware that residence life can improve in more ways than one."
Sophomore,5,I love how Suffolk is very diversity and students from different states and countries come there. Since I love meeting new people it makes me become very social. I don't think much needs to be about Suffolk besides how expensive it is to go there.
Sophomore,5,professors are always readily available . everyone is friendly and helpful every where you go. I hope that we will have a new president soon we have seen too many over past few years but even with that the university has still run well
College Junior,5,There are about 2/3 cops at the door in every building. Nobody goes into the building without a proper form of identification. Guests must be signed in by a student and signed out. There is a number students can call to contact the police in order to be escorted to and from classes. It is a very safe campus.
College Sophomore,5,Love the academics at Suffolk!
College Sophomore,5,The degree matters so much with the heart of Boston being right next to us.
College Sophomore,5,"The courses and professors at Suffolk are by far the best I've ever had. I'd expect college classes to be stressful, difficult, and the professors wouldn't help, but it's been the complete opposite. Professors go outside their way to make sure students understand everything the professor reach"
College Sophomore,5,The housing is amazing at this school! 10 West/Modern Theatre resident halls are the best because they are so clean and the environment is always so peaceful and clean.
College Sophomore,5,Amazing school; especially with the field of study I want to take. I want to go to Suffolk Law School and become a Double Ram after I earn my bachelors in Government. The school is in the heart of Boston and I couldn't ask for better professors and faculty.
College Freshman,5,Suffolk University Police Department ensures saftey accross the campus they even created a APP for teachers and students when they feel unsafe to walk across campus.
College Freshman,5,The dorms have plenty of space and both the A/C and heat work perfect. There also very modern so you shouldn't have a problem!
College Freshman,5,"During orientation, I had the best time of my life! I made new friends from all over the New England sector. I was also able to register for classes, thanks to the helpful orientation leaders."
College Senior,5,I really enjoy the community at my school. The classes are small and the professors care about students.
College Freshman,5,"We all accept each other and have many variety of clubs fit for everyone. If they don't find a club that suits their preferences, they can start their own club and gather members who maybe interested."
College Student,5,"From what I heard from a friend who is in a fraternity, it is a blast and he is having the time of his life. At some point I would love to join one."
College Freshman,5,Suffolks a really good school with a great community. really friendly staff and teachers and easy going people.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is awesome. especially in miller hall where you're located just minutes away from all of your classes. people have been really friendly and it pretty easy to make friends with other residents in your building. the ra's are all cool and pretty chill. the security guards are the best underlay friendly. it feels like home.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe with the SUPD
College Freshman,5,Lots of opportunities for job/interships
College Freshman,5,The professors really help and want you to succeed
College Freshman,5,It is costly but I think it is worth the money.
College Freshman,5,Suffolk has already helped me learn so much.
Alum,4,They did their best to include commuter students who lived away from campus and my major was small enough that everyone knew each other and felt close.
Junior,4,"great professors, especially on the Madrid campus, they care about their students and are actually available. They take after a more European culture between students and teachers. the campus is not great but the staff and location makes up for it."
Sophomore,4,"I think my overall Suffolk experience was vastly great. I believe having more access to professors is crucial because I know how difficult it can be to get in touch. The staff is excellent, and it is easy to get in touch with when I need help with anything. The price for books and such can be steep, especially when living in such an expensive city. The interactive activities were great and had a great time meeting other Suffolk students."
Sophomore,4,"During the pandemic, I did have to take online courses, much like the rest of the students. The experience was entirely different, and you're absent from that campus life. The student and professor experience was lacking, and it didn't feel worth tuition dollars."
Sophomore,4,"Suffolk University is the ideal city school. It blends academics with city life. You get to experience the city while being exposed to different cultures, and so many different life experiences."
Freshman,4,I like that the campus in the heart of Boston Theatre District and best for campus for learning theatre arts from the best professors and professionals in the business.  The only thing I would say is lowing tuition costs.
Sophomore,4,"I toom 6 courses online, As an online learner, I would give myself a 4 out of 5 because I made all the class meetings except for a few times that had to do with my internet access and when I’m in class on the zoom meeting, I follow discussion questions and interact with my peers and the professor. I didn’t give myself a 5 because I would occasionally zone out and get distracted by my surrounding which I later found an issue for. Overall, they were good and even though I wouldn't mind having online classes next year, I miss being on campus and want to get back."
Sophomore,4,"My first semester at Suffolk went by so fast, I didn't expect to be so attached to campus until we had to leave due to the current pandemic. I am on the honors program and because of this, I am allowed small class sizes and more attention with my teachers which I like a lot because I usually like to visit professors and discuss some issues I may have and this would be difficult if there were large class sizes. I have no issue with Suffolk but what I would like to see on campus would be better provision of various types of food because some days I found myself not eating on campus because I didn't like anything they had to offer."
Senior,4,I’ve learned soo much from Suffolk. They look at things from many perspectives and are always open for new ideas. They use real life situations to help us understand a concept better.
Niche User,4,I felt that the transition was not too much of a difference. Professors made themselves very accessible and helped to make class time enjoyable.
Freshman,4,"Nationally, Good School, Bad Price very expensive but
The quality of education you will receive at Suffolk University places it in the top 40% of all colleges and universities nationwide."
Sophomore,4,"After completing my first year, I can say that Suffolk University is a great school! Undeniably, the best aspect of it is the unbeatable location. It's located in the heart of Boston, and one does not have to walk for more than a minute from campus without coming across something interesting to do or see. I was very fortunate to live in a tenth-floor dorm that overlooked the Boston Common. The academics at Suffolk are also excellent. I am a media/film production major and had lots of hands-on experience with camera and microphone equipment in class. I was also able to borrow that equipment and use it for my own projects. The professors seem to be a mixed bag; there were some that I enjoyed having and some that I would never take a class from again. Additionally, the school is very costly and specializes in the studies of politics and law. If those aspects do not bother you, then I would certainly recommend attending Suffolk University!"
Freshman,4,I like that the school is right in the heart of Boston. Being in the city connects you to many opportunities and there is always something to do.
Freshman,4,"As a current student at Suffolk University, I didn't fall involve with the school because it's in Boston, I fell involve with the commute and the community that comes with the school. Professors actually try to help you in any situation you may be in and everyone wants to see you succeed, including the other students attending too."
Senior,4,"Suffolk University is great a great university, especially the Business School! You learn a lot of IMPORTANT business fundamentals from freshmen year, which makes you prepared for the actual business work environment by the time you graduate."
Freshman,4,From my first semester at Suffolk I can say that it has been a great time. The communities here took me in with open arms and the transition from high school was not made more difficult thanks to the support from all the people I've met here. As a commuter student I of course don't have the same experiences as someone who dorms but that doesn't bother me at all. The commute is reasonable from where I live and most days I get to class on time. I would however like to see a lower tuition as that is the one thing keeping many students from finishing up in four straight years
Sophomore,4,"Suffolk University is a great school, especially for business. It is different from other colleges because it does not have a true campus.  Because it has no campus, Suffolk University does not have that many parties.  One major benefit is that the college is right in downtown Boston,  which allows students to explore with no limits.  I recommend this school if you are looking to explore a city, but if you are drawn to the standard college campus with campus life, Suffolk University may not be a good fit for you."
Sophomore,4,"This school is what you make of it. The urban layout of the campus can be challenging when meeting new people, but if you participate in any of the clubs, you will make friends quickly."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman here studying Biology and I love it. You can’t beat being in downtown Boston! Everything is right at your fingertips!
Sophomore,4,"I love going to Suffolk. Technically we don't have a campus because all our buildings are spread out throughout Downtown Crossing, but students mainly relax in the Boston Commons on a nice day. People there are very friendly and kind like the RAs of residence halls. Every RA that I met, they helped make my first year on campus a lot easier. One of my issues is the professors sometimes. Every professor in each department have completely different curriculum outlines so it is really hard to switch back and forth between professors. I don't really know much about our sports because they aren't heavily promoted. I wish the school would advertise more about different games that might be happening on campus."
Senior,4,"I had a great experience at Suffolk. I took charge and had many opportunities that helped me progress in my personal and professional life. As I come upon graduation though, I feel more nervous than ever. I have feelings of self doubt and confidence to enter into a full-time position. I wish Suffolk required internships. I only held one internship, and I feel like I'd be more prepared if I had been pushed to do more."
Freshman,4,The experience is really great. They let me really study a field i want to study. Ii get to have fun but also learn at the same time.
Freshman,4,Very cool to be in downtown boston but it’s kind of hard to meet people with a not so typical campus. People are nice and accepting but the party scene is eh. Many bars around though.
Alum,4,Suffolk University provides a unique college experience because it is located in the heart of Downtown Boston. Suffolk offers a wide variety of majors and activities to get involved in.
Sophomore,4,"I like going to Suffolk University as it was my first choice as was many others’ that attend the school. The campus is amazing as you can go through downtown Boston and explore the theatre district. There are many opportunities to have connections and to network and intern at several places such as the statehouse and PR firms. That’s the biggest draw to the school besides the business and law programs. 

Party scene is not really there so if you’re looking for a party school, this is not it. 

Student life is okay, don’t really know if it means how everybody feels about it or if it means school spirit. 

And it could use more activities for all years to enjoy throughout the year. It kind of lacks after thanksgiving from what I’ve seen."
Freshman,4,My experience with Suffolk so far has been great. Other than the financial aid. I had a tough time getting in touch with people who could really help me figure out what I needed to do to cover the rest of my expenses and didn't find most of their suggestions helpful.
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshmen, the experience I have had at Suffolk University has been both good and bad. Personally, I loved the people I have met from the school. The professors work closely with each student, allowing each student to be more than just their ID number. I enjoy the smaller classrooms offered at Suffolk University, giving me more one on one assistance. However, I have had some issues with the financial aid office. Overall a good school, but very unaffordable."
Sophomore,4,"The campus, though non-existent as it mostly consists of buildings spread around Beacon Hill in Boston, is very easy to navigate. Professors are very good and care what students have to say, and generally speaking, the staff is helpful. Given the area, many students have very little trouble finding work following graduation in their desired field. However, there is limited housing and lack of student pride and unity."
Sophomore,4,I finished my freshman year at Suffolk this May and I greatly enjoyed my experience there. The University is very welcoming. Students from all over the world attend the school and the social environment is great. The dorms are quite good compared to other universities in the area. Most professors are good and have a great attitude. Getting good grades isn't too hard as long as you keep up with the assignments and attend classes. The location is probably one of the university's greatest features. It's right in the heart of Boston where everything a college student might need is within walking distance! The worst thing about the school is probably the food on campus but keep in mind that this matter is very subjective and many people actually enjoy it. Overall it's a great school and I highly recommend it for anyone who is considering applying/enrolling!
Freshman,4,"as a commuter school it was difficult to connect to students, i found myself stuck at my dorm more times then not"
Junior,4,It's a very good school. The professors here really care about their students. Lots of diversity here! You literally meet new people every day. The location of where the school is placed is best if you're a city person!
Junior,4,"Suffolk University is not exactly the ""college experience"" the average senior in High School seeks. It is more like gaining an education while being a full-time adult in a big city. You can't simply buy a handle of vodka and walk down the street to the nearest frat house. You have to find friends with houses who throw parties and hope the cops don't come. Or you need a fake ID and tons of money to afford an Uber, drinks, and club cover fees. Overall though, Suffolk has it's perks. It is literally in the heart of Boston! And the academics are great, especially if you are a Business or Law student. I am in the Arts and Sciences program which is still good, but the Law and Business programs definitely get the most attention."
Freshman,4,Suffolk has been a unique experience thus far. It was by no means my too choice but I’ve had a really lovely time here in my first two semesters. The professors are all very caring and the diversity is so refreshing to see. I feel lucky to experience it.
Junior,4,"My experience so far has been a very good experience. I thought when I applied to colleges I would choose one with it's own private pretty campus. I chose Suffolk instead, in the heart of Boston. I feel my everyday learning in or out of the classroom is preparing me so much more for real life after college."
Junior,4,"nice campus, in the middle of boston,  easy to commute to, professors really care about, easy to find a job and there's always something to do"
Freshman,4,"I really love the location of Suffolk . There is no better place to be than the center of Boston. The professors here show a real interest in their students, and I couldn't have asked for a better learning experience."
Junior,4,"It is a great school, if you are looking for a college experience while being in the city, suffolk is the place to be staff is helpful and with great knowledge. Campus is modern and all the resources are always available to students and it ahs a complete database of books and journals for students to use."
Freshman,4,I am currently a commuter freshman and Suffolk University. I choose to attend Suffolk because of the atmosphere and opportunities it possesses. One thing I love about Suffolk is the interaction among students and professors. The small class sizes help students engage with the professor and material better than other universities do.
Sophomore,4,This is a great school. If you really apply yourself you will do great. Being in the heart of Boston is a great plus.
Freshman,4,I love Suffolk's location. It provides amazing opportunities for someone in any field of study. Law and business students have especially huge opportunities at this university and in the beautiful city of Boston.
Freshman,4,Well this is my first year at the school but i would have to say that the experience has jus been alright
Sophomore,4,"Suffolk University has a fantastic location right in the center of Boston, which, personally, I believe that it is its strongest strength. However, the school does not have a party scene at all."
Freshman,4,"Suffolk University is a great University for Business. It puts you right into what you want. In less than 3 months of attending Suffolk, I have learned so much about the Business world. It has the advantage of being located around so many great businesses. The professors are great and very easy going
There is so many international students which allows you to learn about other cultures and languages."
Sophomore,4,"I originally chose to study at Suffolk University because of its location and Interior Design program. Studying at Suffolk is exciting, because everyday, I get to walk around in a beautiful and historic city that the school utilizes. There interior design program is challenging, and the school helps with networking by having guest speakers and class trips to nearby companies. The school is involved in my future, and has academic advisors meet with students frequently to discuss school plans, internships, and other related business. While Suffolk isn't well-known for its sports, it is helpful in building a future for its students and creating and full-college experience in the heart of Boston."
Junior,4,"So far the Suffolk University is definitely a good college. The Professors are nice, and there are plenty of opportunities and services available. However, this is not a party college, you must be prepareed for a rigorous workload and strict requirements. "
Sophomore,4,"Suffolk Univesity has an amazing location, the heart of downtown Boston! There is always something to do. Concerts, volunteer opportunities, festivals, 5k runs, bars, shopping, job opportunities, dance clubs, and restaurants. However, Suffolk only supplies students with two years of on-campus housing, Parking is scarce and cost of living is high. "
Junior,4,"I really enjoy my time at Suffolk University. Suffolk makes it easy to get involved and most importantly, they are very personable and have a great teacher to student ratio."
College Junior,4,There are endless opportunities to get involved on campus and establishing good connections. We students are constantly receiving emails regarding internship opportunities and ways to get involved on campus. There are also many experienced people who are able to give us tips and advice on how to land a good career.
College Junior,4,Professors are nice and caring. Classes can vary from big to small. Its important to pay attention to classes and keep track of due dates.
College Junior,4,"The dormitories are in excellent condition, rules are extremely reinforced and atmosphere is always peaceful for study and sleep. The rooms are spacious and modern, with great views. There is AC and heat in all rooms that can be controlled at students’ wishes, which for me is an absolute plus. I would not say that the housing is a social place, however that depends on the students themselves. On Campus Housing is extremely convenient regarding its location. However when it comes to signing people into your dorms, Suffolk can be a bit strict. You must at ALL TIMES carry your ID with you in order to enter the building, and any visitors must also carry with them an ID with a picture."
College Junior,4,"The location of my school is among one of the best I’ve ever seen. There is always something happening, so it’s important to constantly check emails and join clubs that are offered. I believe my school opens opportunities for building connections and for landing a great career."
College Sophomore,4,School is very very diverse. People spread their opinions within the campus
College Sophomore,4,The teachers really care about students and the small size classes are of great aid
College Sophomore,4,There are lot of international students from all over the world
College Freshman,4,"The schools has a APP callled HAND SHAKE, which really helps students match their criteria on what there looking for."
College Freshman,4,"Classes are small, classes are taught in different styles"
College Freshman,4,"School spirit is not that great, at least for Soccer and Baseball. However, both fields for Soccer and Baseball are both in the best shape possible due to recent renovations."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are very nice. A little dirty and surprised they have so many problems for such a new building, but the overall layout and room quality is great."
College Sophomore,4,The Suffolk Police to walk you anywhere within a reasonable distance of the campus if you want it.
College Sophomore,4,There are many fairs and meetings with previous students and allows for current students to become knowledgeable about the current prospects and internships. There is always something happening.
Alum,2,"I came here because I was looking for a career as a forensic scientist and saw they had a Biochemistry program that catered to that.  The program is not an ASCLD accredited program, which I wish I had known sooner.  This means their curriculum is not necessarily in line with the standards required to pursue a career in this particular field.  There is no sense of community here. The campus is very scattered and unorganized; you have to do a lot of literal footwork to seek resources, as everything is located in different buildings and on several different floors. It was hard to streamline resources here. Housing is limited to Freshman and so you're stuck either commuting or paying a ridiculous amount of money to live in the city after that.  Plan ahead. The library is beautiful, though."
Sophomore,2,Great location but social life on campus is limited. If you want to have a good time going to a club or a larger school is a better bet. Many students transfer from Suffolk to have a better college experience
Freshman,2,"The financial aid at this institution is awful. If you do not have millions of dollars they most likely will not help you find alternatives on their pricey tuition. And when I say pricey I mean VERY EXPENSIVE. The food quality is trash and so are the cook's attitudes. I paid millions for Sodexo food and services and got treated like a prisoner. The dorming was horrendous as well. Yes, the dorms are huge but have mice, and many pipe problems. would not recommend. A two-star rating is me being generous."
Freshman,2,"I have been very dissatisfied with my experience here. The school expects you to do everything on your own. I was told by my guidance counselor that she could not help me with my schedule whatsoever and then was told that she had another appointment after mine so i would have to leave. The food SUCKS. It is on a declining scale so you pay for every single thing you get. If you are coming here to have fun and party you are in the wrong place. The only fun will have here is drinking at bars, smoking pot in the common or sitting in your room doing nothing."
Freshman,2,Suffolk is definitely meant for a specific type of student that cares more about career opportunities and future planning than enjoying their current time as a student. There is no campus and dorm buildings are not social so it is difficult to make friends. Prepare to deal with a lot of snobby international students. The party scene is nearly nonexistent as is any activities on campus and there is little to no school spirit. If i had the chance I would not have started at Suffolk again.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life has no effect on campus and social life.
College Sophomore,2,No one pays attention to athletics. They are no good and the fields are not close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,My parents made me choose this school for money reasons.
College Sophomore,2,There's nothing interesting to join. None of the sports I have any interest in
College Junior,2,"I do not participate in the Greek Life ""life"""
College Junior,2,I am a Graduate student and use off campus facilities.
College Freshman,2,There are not many sports teams.
College Freshman,2,"Some students will smoke outside of the buildings and we have to breathe the drugs and marijuana when entering the building. It's bad for our health and for anyone who has health issues. Security just stands there and does nothing, they need to step up enforcement and ban drugs and marijuana."
College Freshman,2,"There is no community, sometimes I'm not sure if I'm living in boston alone or ing college"
College Sophomore,2,"While many students may know someone on a sports team, not many people care to support and attend events run by the athletic department."
College Junior,2,I don't live on campus but should have programs for commuter students
College Sophomore,2,No clubs and people arent very accepting. hard to fit in but when you do its fun.
College Sophomore,2,I attend Rivier University and am looking to transfer because it wasn't challenging enough for me and didn't offer the experiences I was looking for.
College Sophomore,2,"As a vegetarian my options consisted of cereal, a bagel, grilled cheese, or pizza most of the time at the 150 Tremont dining hall. Occasionally they have tofu but it's gross. Pretty much all of the food is gross. I got the lowest meal plan and still had a lot of money left over, which is bad because you don't get your money back. Sodexo is basically trash. The 73 Tremont cafe is good. The sandwiches and salads are always edible, but it is more expensive and they close early. The cafe in sawyer is average and good for breakfast coffee or snacks."
College Junior,2,Apartments in Boston are very expensive and the landlords are often not that good.
College Freshman,2,i commute im not the guy to ask
College Freshman,2,i don't really eat food on campus but when i do it does not taste good at all.
College Sophomore,2,They can try and try but it will never be acceptable because their prices are not competitive to nearby stores.
College Junior,2,It isn't known for a party school. You need to find some place else for one.
College Freshman,2,"There's one sorority and one fraternity, but I think they are adding one more.  No one pays attention to them really.  They aren't that big and aren't that important to the normal student.  Probably a good way to make friends, but I'm not really into Greek Life."
College Sophomore,2,No one cares about sports
College Freshman,2,"My experience living in Suffolk's 150 Tremont residence hall was not the best. There is a big lack of community on the floors and the building is in need of work, especially restrooms."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Have to go to other schools, but they aren't that far"
Recent Alumnus,2,You can only check two people in at a time. Which is very frustrating
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a commuter, but eat Suffolk food all the time. Unfortunately. I'm a super picky eater and I dislike most of the food that Sodexo prepares. They make great food for tours and events, but for everyday it's subpar."
College Sophomore,2,Suffolk is a DIII school with very little support for athletics. I've gone to a few men's basketball games and the fan section is always super small and mostly full of parents. Suffolk is severely lacking in school spirit and the sports games clearly reflect that.
College Freshman,2,"The sports teams exist, yet no one pays attention to them."
College Freshman,2,"Our Basketball/Volleyball home games are held in the basement of one of the buildings. There is NO football team here, so bringing people together outside to enjoy an awesome football game is almost impossible, unless you have friends in BC or BU. The best athletic team is probably the hockey team, but the players themselves are usally stuck up since they think they are the ""coolest"" kids on campus for playing hockey"
College Junior,2,"I think there's only one fraternity, maybe two sororities. I hear they have parties occasionally but they can't be that big or fun I'd imagine. Some friends of mine and I were thinking about starting a fraternity to see if it could be done better, so if a new one seems to appear come say hi."
College Junior,2,"I live 10 states away so going home costs a lot of money seeing as I need to take a plane to go back home.  Locally, I can either walk or take the subway every where, this is convenient, and sometimes costly."
College Junior,2,"The Boston Common is sometimes quoted as ""Suffolk's quad"" and while this is true, it should also be pointed out that this is where a large population of people choose to smoke weed.  That being said, the drug usage at Suffolk is very high.  Alcohol is also a very usable substance at Suffolk.  Suffolk is a ""dry"" campus, but that doesn't mean students don't bring in alcohol into the dorms every single weekend.  Alcohol has a huge presence not only at Suffolk but every college scene, I personally never feel peer pressured into it, but I'm sure others have.  Being caught with any kind of illegal substance at Suffolk has definite consequences."
College Freshman,2,its bad. some professors are horrible. every math professor seems to be Russian with the thickest accent.  the qualifications to become accepted to suffolk aren't high therefore the academics aren't held to a high standard like surrounding schools.
College Freshman,2,"Long, cold, and insanely windy winters. September, October, and April are the only months during your school year where you aren't envying your friends that went south for school."
College Freshman,2,So many kids transfer. Something about the school doesn't appeal to a lot of people and i was in several classes last year where a third or even a half wanted to or were in the process of transferring.
College Junior,2,I'm currently in debt and I feel they only limited my options
College Sophomore,2,"From having experience living on campus and consistently being around students as well as Suffolk sports team members, I've never heard anyone hyped up about attending any of their games. I have been to one of the men's hockey team games during the Spring semester and it was a good time, but barely any people attended."
College Freshman,2,"There's not really a policy, but drugs and alcohol are not allowed at school."
College Freshman,2,Cold winter mild spring cool fall
College Freshman,2,"Campus life is poor, not a great academic reputation, and is expensive"
College Freshman,2,"Awfully quiet on campus, better if your over 21 or know somebody with an apartment. You'll never hear of a Suffolk party best bet is finding someone from BU or MIT. Boston is very strict on fake ID's"
College Junior,2,"If you are looking for a school with a crazy and active nightlife then Suffolk University is not the college for you. Everything closes relatively early and there aren't any 18+ clubs you can attend, only 21+ around here."
College Junior,2,"There is not much Greek life on this campus. The Greek life that is on campus is only here for academic purposes, not the typically Greek life people expect in college. They do not host ""cool"" and ""crazy"" parties, but they do a lot of charity work."
College Freshman,2,"The food here SUCKS. Like dont get me wrong there is a lot of variety but the food just tastes bad and most of it is all unhealthy and after eating it you just feel gross, I highly recommend eating out whenever possible "
College Freshman,2,Campus security is ok but the only thing to worry about is what goes on in the city. Theres a TON of homeless people around and they can often get rowdy with each other and a few are known to bother students 
College Sophomore,2,You can't have a car on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Not a great deal of variety. Closes too early and very pricey
College Freshman,2,"There are very few options when it comes to partying at Suffolk University. Dorm drinking in one of the suites is usually the norm, but other than that there are a couple of groups of kids that hit either the clubs or the bars every weekend. If you're interested in going to a college where partying is a big part of the experience, Suffolk should be near the bottom of your list. "
College Freshman,2,"The front desk in the lobbies of the dorms require students to both swipe themselves in and sign in any visitors they have with them. Getting alcohol into the dorms isn't a real issue, as you can carry it in and out in a backpack, but suspicious behavior will merit a search of whatever you have on you at the time. As far as getting caught in the dorms goes, my only advice to you is ""don't"". Campus police are relatively strict about Suffolk being a ""dry campus"", and the punishments that go along with possession of alcohol/drugs are fairly harsh."
College Freshman,2,"Suffolk University has one available ""dining hall"" available to the majority of it's students. The food is bad, the prices are higher than they should be, and it's located in the lobby of the freshman dorm. You're much better off eating at one of the many restaurants surrounding the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"Suffolk University is not exactly what I signed up for. I was the kind of kid that had a great time in high school. I loved hanging out with my friends in school, going to the games, and partying on weekends - by the time we graduated, I was ready to do it all over again. Suffolk has not been anything like I expected college to be; there is absolutely no campus, no sense of community, and school spirit is almost nonexistent. "
College Freshman,2,"Suffolk is in the middle of the city - as a result, getting anywhere that's not within walking distance is always a little bit of a process. That being said, the dorms are right next to the Park St. train station which allows access to anywhere on the Green or Red lines."
College Freshman,2,You'll spend half your life rebooting the wifi.
College Sophomore,2,has a little bit of everything
College Freshman,2,Suffolk's an average school in an above average location. The fact that it isn't you're typical campus (i.e. no real school spirit or football team) turns off a lot of people but what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in it's location. Being in Boston and being close to places like Fenway and Faneuil Hall is awesome.
College Freshman,2,The computers are allright but the wifi goes in and out a lot.
Freshman,1,DO NOT GO HERE!  I had great expectations when applying and was so excited to go here. I lived in smith hall the worst dorm building of them all. food sucks .. it smells... they barely give you a choice over roommates. IF YOU REQUEST SOMEONE ELSE THEY WILL PUT U IN A QAUD OR TRIPLE. There are not many parties unless you are rich ect.. international students have the most fun. it was not my scene I had alot of friends in hs and literally have none here just because its hard cause there is not really a campus. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY
Junior,1,"Don't let the location lure you in. Not only is the food bad, and the dorms are gross, but the people running the place are horrible. The professors are not knowledgeable on their topics, and the deans are old-fashioned and out of touch. Those that run Suffolk act for themselves and do not care for students. I've seen it time and time again. Don't be another person they screw over. Apply elsewhere."
College Junior,1,No one pays attention to them nor does anyone even know they exist!
College Sophomore,1,There are very few open parties and they are not very safe.
College Sophomore,1,"Everything is unbelievably strict, it highly affects a student's social life, and can make academic life difficult."
College Freshman,1,"It does not exist except for one fraternity and on sorority, which no one joins."
College Freshman,1,"Suffolk is an expensive school, and due to my background, I was not eligible for a majority of the financial aid."
College Freshman,1,There's only one fraternity and one sorority on campus.
College Freshman,1,"There is only one frat and two sororities at Suffolk, and even then they're not that special. Nobody really knows of them"
College Sophomore,1,INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ONCE THEY ARE ADMITTED CANT RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID OF ANY SORT FROM THE SCHOOL WHICH IS REALLY REALLY BAD.
College Freshman,1,sick of it half way through the first semester freshman year.  thats probably all schools but this seemed extra awful compared to what friends at other schools were saying
College Freshman,1,if there was an option less than 1 circle i would choose that. no sports and no community in the school. nothing for the students to bond over together.
College Freshman,1,No parties and no fun. People in the frats are almost laughed at because of their lack of school presence.
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life is pretty lowkey. Suffolk does not fund the sororities or fraternities. I don't know about the fraternities, but sorority  girls have to pay $75 a month or $300 a semester."
College Freshman,1,Boston is pretty boring if you're under 21 or don't have a fake ID
College Freshman,1,"For the first semester of college I didn't even know we had sports teams. Suffolk has no spirit. I'm pretty sure the only sports we have include basketball, hockey, and golf. I went to one men's basketball game and it was awful, the gym smelled really bad, because of the poor ventilation, there is only one set of bleacher's and our team lost :( The hockey players are d-bags and I have yet to see where they practice. However, the women's basketball players aren't the worst, they practice hard, and good personalities, and pretty hot"
College Freshman,1,"Suffolk is super strict. It's like the school doesn't understand that this is college and people want to experiment and have fun. There are NO PARTIES, NO DRINKING, and NO SMOKING."
College Freshman,1,expensive and the food is eh
College Freshman,1,No school spirit. No fan support. No anything. If you're looking to go to a school where you'll be able to go to games and root on the school's sports team and chant in the stands than dont bother to apply. Suffolk doesn't have any of that. No one pays attention to the athletics here at A L L. 
College Freshman,1,"Don't. Just don't bring a car. It makes no sense, literally everything you possibly need is within walking distance. Also parking is EXTREMELY expensive so dont even bother. Seriously. Dont even think about it. "
College Freshman,1,"Literally 0% greek life here. There are sororities and frats but no one cares about them honestly. They don't do anything special, they dont get their own housing or are seen as a high part of the campus' social atmosphere. "
College Junior,1,Parking in downtown Boston is a nightmare!
College Freshman,1,"Nobody cares about sports at Suffolk - they're just not a part of the college. We don't have many of the typical sports teams, and the ones we do have are all D3 by a long shot. The people I know who are involved in the teams say that playing on them is a good time, but besides the players, nobody else shows up for the games."
College Freshman,1,"Suffolk does not offer any sort of on or off campus parking whatsoever. You're still welcome to find a spot somewhere in Beacon Hill, but there are plenty of times that people have spent long enough looking for a spot for class that they've just driven back home."
College Freshman,1,"Greek Life at Suffolk is completely irrelevant. The only fraternity ""on campus"" is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and they do absolutely nothing that would affect the life of a normal student. They have no housing, don't throw parties, and are not at all recognized as a fraternity in the conventional sense."
College Sophomore,1,no legit sports team no one comes to games
College Sophomore,1,depends on where u live on dorms
College Freshman,1,They're allright but arent used by everyone.
College Sophomore,1,"With a gym about the size of a kitchen, a computer lab with about 75 computers I think its safe to say they have some work to do. I will say, however, they are building a new facility next 10 somerset that should be quite impressive."
College Sophomore,1,"The rules in the dorms are just absurd. Its one thing to keep order and make sure everyone feels comfortable/respected, but they just go too far. I was written up at 10 on a friday night for loud music. Several friends of mine felt the same way when it came to petty stuff like that."
College Sophomore,1,They're just not good. No football team and the rest of the teams are mediocre at best.
College Senior,1,"Since Suffolk is at the heart of Downtorn, Boston. It is not a good idea at all to be driving to school. The parking is expensive in the nearby area and the college do not have any parking."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is clear that Suffolk makes all of its money from the law school.  As a recent alum who is looking to become more active in the Suffolk community, I receive no response to my emails, there are no events to engage alumni, no emails, no mailings, NOTHING.  Degree mill for undergrads.  Plain and simple.  I fully regret going here."
College Junior,1,"Suffolk University has their own Suffolk police system. They are always around the residence halls making students feel safe. Due to Suffolk's campus being so spread out as well as located in a city it is important to have police that are able to help a student in need at any time. The residents halls are very strict with underage drinking as well as drug use, with the possibility of loosing housing."
College Freshman,1,The frat and sorority are not very well known on campus. They throw parties once in a while but they are usually never heard of. They don't have their own house either so it is kind of hard to know who is in the frat or sorority at times.
College Freshman,1,Unless you can afford parking you won't drive. On-Campusers are in walking distance to/fro their classes so no need to drive. Commuters take the train. An advantage of living in the city is there is a s*** ton of public transportation.
College Freshman,1,"I played sports during the year, which was a great experience but after that, it was so hard to find anything to do. You basically sit around in the dorms on friday nights and do nothing. unless you are 21 or have a fake, night life is horrible. I wanted to transfer after the first month of being there."
College Sophomore,1,"Due to Suffolk's location in downtown Boston parking is extremely limited and very expensive. However the public transportation is amazing, so there is really no need for a car."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't drive, but the parking lots surrounding suffolk are busy to begin with since it's such a hugely population area of boston. There's no suffolk university parking either, you just receive discounts for going to the school. Overall, not to easy to have a car unless you're ready to pay huge amounts for parking costs"
College Senior,1,"Extremely expensive, hard to find. You're lucky if you find on street parking but it has limited times as well."

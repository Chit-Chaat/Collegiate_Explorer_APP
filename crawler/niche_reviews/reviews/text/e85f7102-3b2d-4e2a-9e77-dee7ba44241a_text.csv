At first, It was kind of difficult getting used to, due to the fact that we were in a different setting, however, the professors did a great job on transitioning and helping us transition to online classes. My professors made sure to explain to me how things work and what other online resources I had available."

Each professor is honestly interested in student engagement and success as they both challenge and work with students to achieve goals."
Niche User,5,Trinity is a local University and they provide onsite jobs for students with financial challenges.  Professors reach out to students that are falling behind as well as students who are expectation.  They don't just take your money they make you money work for you.  Employers hunt you down to work for their company before graduation.  Your income potential is unlimited because of their brand.

All the staff & professors persuade all the young ladies to do better for them selves. It's like motivation & that's what made choose TWU!"
Freshman,5,"In these past 3 weeks and half at trinity, I have learned a lot such as self confidence and to not give up on yourself and the dreams you have  just because the work are overwhelmed, I have learned that it get harder before it get easier and that we shouldn’t be threatened by that but to have a positive mind set to the goals that we are yearning to achieve. I have also learned that not everyone was created the same that each individual has their own ways of understanding some certain things that comes in their way that you shouldn’t try to be anyone else but yourself and left each other up and working together as one because we all have the same goal. Just like my Professor always says that in order to achieve anything, you need to give in order to receive therefore the three main words that I need to always remember while I achieve my nursing career is to cooperate , collaborate in order to graduate ."
Freshman,5,"I love Trinity Washington University, I have grown so much since my first day. I enjoy the size of the school itself, not too big or too small. The school works with you to supply every need and they work with you to help you in the best way financially to make sure your 4 years go by as smoothly as possible. To add, the professors are extremely patient with every student and very helpful."
Junior,5,"Trinity is an awesome school, the faculties goes out of their way to make sure that you stay focus. Since I've been there, every professors that I've had gave me plenty of advise. It's going great!"
College Senior,5,really great school and many free services offered to enrolled students.
College Junior,5,"I love my school so much that I am  a student ambassador, the face of Trinity Washington University. Part of my job is to go to different high school,  and recruit other young women to come to my university. My school is the best because it has awesome professors that are dedicated to helping students, one of the math teachers started a math lab on Fridays to help math students perform better, if they are having difficulties. In other words, professors and other staff wants us to succeed because failure is not an option.  In addition, Trinity empowers women to be leaders, math majors and step out of their comfort zone. Also, President McGuire is often present at basketball,  soccer games and other events at Trinity  usually rocking her Trinity attire and taking photographs. At Trinity, we are Sisters, we help and are there for one another. In the dorms, we live like a community. I don't regret making a decision to attend Trinity Washington University, I am even considering of getting my Masters there as well."
College Senior,5,"Being a Trinity student has been the best experience I have had so far. This school has taught me to be confident in who I am and not be afraid to be smart. To try hard and be the best you can because it is possible. To not downgrade myself because I'm a Hispanic woman. Also, to be united with other classmates and help each other out. Trinity has a great community where women of all ages and race get together and help each other out to become successful. All these attributes makes Trinity a unique school for which I would consider to apply again if I had another chance."
College Junior,5,the viewing of the id's and other rules are very strict and put into place
College Freshman,5,They're great with scholarships... maybe because nobody wants to go here but I mean they have enough money to give anyways.
College Freshman,5,Scholarships are offered to a lot of applicants.
College Senior,5,"Trinity is in quite catholic community within the Nation's Capitol, which is rich in history, with museums, theaters, White House, Capitol,  Kennedy Center, Watergate. restaurants, Georgetown-- jobs, parks etc.  Washington, DC offer wide variety activities and quality of life."

College Senior,5,It does a great job to secure safeness.
College Senior,5,The night life and social environment is good . There's always something to do
College Sophomore,5,I love how they increased the special studies for mathematics since it is one of the hardest subjects for women.
College Sophomore,5,I like the fact that we have more one-on-ones with our Professors. They always find time out of their schedules to e-mail us and work with us if we have missing assignments or life issues that created absences from class.
College Freshman,5,DC nightlife is the best
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe! campus police are always near and there is little to no crime.

College Freshman,5,A lot of stuff to help you out
College Sophomore,5,I have not encounter this problem at this school which is a very big plus in my eyes. You are dealing with serious minded people who are eager to learn and partying is not part of there agenda.  We are working to get through this process and gain a degree in the fields in which we are working extremely hard.   
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process went very well and the counselors are very supportive. 
College Freshman,5,On-campus safety is very great to have. They make us young women are escorted safely on and off campus.
College Freshman,5,Trinity Washington University is a wonderful university for young women to attend. The professors help you one-on-one with anything pertaining the subject matter. Everyone is very respectful and easily kind to talk to. 
College Sophomore,5,"I really haven't seen any drug scene at Trinity, so I believe that there is none."
College Senior,5,"I am somewhat happy in my current program. I had to change my major to remain a SPS student once a graduated from Trinity at THEARC. I am a Psychology major, and SPS does not offer a Psychology, so to continue I had 2 options. One to transfer to another school, which I had planned to do, or option 2, change my major. Now I fought this tooth and nail, however, my advisor was great. She suggested that I change to Human Relations, which is half Psychology, and half Sociology. After much thought, and a lot of research, I decided to take option 2."
College Senior,5,Computer labs at Trinity are great. The school provides more than enough computers and support for all students and some labs are available for use 24-hours a day.
College Sophomore,5,i feel pretty safe on campus.. i can walk around any hour at night and not worry about a thing.
College Junior,5,"As a Criminal Justice major, I'm happy with the many opportunities to explore that field. At trinity they let it be known that there isn't one set position for that major. In criminal justice you have the chance to even create your own position. Although my dream position is to be a probation officer for juveniles I am open to other positions after graduation."
College Junior,5,I am beyond satisfied with my decision at being at trinity. Trinity doesn't just prepare you to complete your degree but for the real world after graduation. Countless opportunities to be ready for future positions.
College Senior,5,"I feel very safe when I'm on campus at Trinity. Security on our campus runs a very tight watch on our campus. I attend school in a neighborhood where there have been several incidents of crimes close to the school. As students we constantly are alerted through text messaging and emails about our personal safety, security measures and even server weather changes. Our president Pat McGuire does an awesome job notifying the students as well as the staff and she makes her instructions very clear to us to follow!"
College Freshman,5,The campus is very strict the school is Catholic and they don't tolerate drinking period on campus. I rate our school very high.
College Sophomore,5,There is a free shuttle bus to the nearest metro sation you can take as transportation. The shuttle bus also runs pretty late even later on the weekends. Taxi's also pass by Trinity often.
College Sophomore,5,"there really aren't any drug use on campus.if there was any involvement campus security would have put an end to it.However,for those who do partake in this type of social life all depends on who you hang out with.More people tend to drink than smoke.Stay above the influence"
Junior,4,"The online learning experience has been pretty hard. But I think that is not necessarily Trinity’s fault, but rather this whole situation."
Freshman,4,I am going to take some classes online and it has been going pretty well. I have been attending the zoom classes and it is a little similar to face-to-face classes so it does not affect my learning.
Sophomore,4,"The only online classes that I took at Trinity were to complete my semester due to COVID-19. Personally it was very different compared to being in an actual class on campus but it was exactly the same teaching. It was more electronic work and staying on top of emails, due dates and staying organized."
Sophomore,4,"As a trinity full time student I like that everyone knows each other and there is always support and help around the campus. Also trinity staff is very welcoming and extremely helpful when it comes to school work or even outside help. It is an all girls school and it feels like no one is left out. Trinity is full of support and help, caring for the community and every student whom attends there. A change I would like to see at Trinity would be more activities on campus for all students such as outdoors. More fun activities that involve everyone being together and have a stress free day."
Alum,4,"As a graduate from Trinity College, I thoroughly enjoyed my 4 years here.  Now I have 2 girls and would love to send them to Trinity but it's not the same as it was in the 80s.  It's different now and thats what they have to do to keep It running."
Sophomore,4,So far Trinity has been an amazing experience. Having small ratio of students to professor allows one to get the most of the lectures. The student life needs improvement.
Senior,4,It is a great learning environment because the class size are small and I get to have a one on one hand with professor
Sophomore,4,"Trinity Washington University is an all girl school and very small, which I love. I feel that because campus is small, there is a better interaction between professor and student. I receive the help needed in order to understand or better in my assignments. Only thing that would be great is being able to have more student life on campus, such as, more sports and clubs or locations for students to just hangout with friends. Overall, Trinity shows their dedication in helping students succeed."
Senior,4,"I love how it is a small University. It provides me with high levels of concentration and professors are quick to respond with any questions or concerns you may have. The staff are polite and very welcoming. The students are extremely supportive in class discussions and assignments. 
I would love for there to better parking for students."
Freshman,4,"The campus culture is what makes this place truly special--the student body is friendly, intelligent, quirky, and accepting. There is always something going on on campus. Academically speaking, the coursework was very challenging and it always seemed like all of my heavy assignments in classes were due one after the other.You MUST keep up with assignments and study when you can if you want to do well. Many students follow the ""work hard, play hard"" motto here. If you are looking for a place with a strong sense of community that is going to challenge you and help you to grow in countless ways, Trinity is for you."
Senior,4,"Trinity has provided me the opportunity to complete my degree by attending shall at night although the school has made many cages in attracting students.  Initially the school was designed for a day program for the underserved, but now embraces all genders.  I enjoy many of the classes as we have Avery diverse faculty which adds to the uniqueness of Trinity."
Junior,4,"Trinity faculty are very supportive and available to the students. The tuition is ridiculously high, campus is clean and easy to navigate"
Junior,4,"I like the professors here at Trinity, most of them are kind and care about you passing their classes. However, the campus life could be more lively."
Sophomore,4,Trinity Washington University offers a wide range of opportunities and support to every students; in terms of scholarships and communications with professors.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Trinity is wonderful the teachers and staff are friendly and welcoming. When I arrived at Trinity I felt scared about starting school and making friends but they have many sports club in which I made a bunch of friends. And once class started I was eager to learn more and the teachers are nice and wonderful at explaining class well.
Graduate Student,4,"Trinity Washington University is truly dedicated in gearing their students for success. The faculty are readily available. The curriculum is challenging. This quiet school is committed to ensuring that all the students succeed, and the professors are there to motivate you along your journey."
Freshman,4,Throughout my first semester everything went well except for the math course that I was taking. The school is pretty small and I believe that's a good thing because I learn better in a smaller environment. I can say that I haven't came across a BAD teacher as yet in fact all the teachers I had were very dedicated to what they were doing.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Trinity and so far it has been great. I was fortunate to have professors who actually care about me and want me to succeed.
Junior,4,"Trinity has been my college for the past two and a half years. I love it! i enjoy the professors and staff that work there; although the work load is a lot and a lot of studying to do, like any other college. Stands out for its history and drive to inspire women mainly to stay motivated to do something with lives career wise. Trinity has been great to me and I have been doing very well there. Everyone is there to work hard and succeed and everyone wants you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"I loved the new building on campus, it is simply beautiful and highly equipped with technology and resources for class. The professors are also warm and mostly helpful. However, I would like to see more on campus activities, there are games for the teams, but there aren't enough activities for those who live on campus and this forces them to look for activities else where. There also needs to be more support for the disabled when it snows because it is unfair for them to not be unable to go to class because they cannot get around. Maybe in the future, the university can plan to construct a tunnel so that this can no longer be a problem, but overall the university is very good."
College Freshman,4,Everyone and Everything is/are given equal respect and help
College Freshman,4,Great services and flexibility for the students.
College Sophomore,4,"The safety seems fine nothing has happened on campus to my knowledge, i do take evening classes and there is only one person at the front of the campus so it does make me nervous walking to my bus at night alone."
College Sophomore,4,"So far the school has been amazing, from the first steps in the admissions office to being enrolled and in classes this semester. What has stood out to me the most is how engaged each staff member is at the college. Everyone i have encountered has been very friendly and always available to answer questions and offer assistance. I was very nervous when committing to a school; i am more than happy with my choice and can't wait to continue my education at Trinity."
College Senior,4,Staff stay on top of all matters concerning health and safety.
College Sophomore,4,Some professors aren't proficient at teaching .
College Freshman,4,the motivate you to do well in school and stay in shape.
College Junior,4,"Not involved in sports but when I can attend games, they are awesome"
College Junior,4,It's all women and our professors are both male and female who teach well and keep us all engaged in what we're working on
College Freshman,4,"Although Trinity is a Catholic they to the demand students to be a certain religion, it is very diverse in that aspect.  As for economic background, for what I hear most students have received a lot of financial aid and scholarships."
College Freshman,4,The workload is average and professors are considerate with how much time they give to finish an assignment.
College Freshman,4,I personally feel safe on campus since there is a security at every entrance of the school.  When a person walks into any of the buildings there is security who asks to show their student or staff ID.  Security sends emails regarding campus safety.  Securities are available to walk students across campus and stay with students while they wait for the shuttle at the bus stop that takes students to Brookland metro station.
College Freshman,4,"When I registered for classes the first semester it was relatively easy.  I had the assistance of my academic advisor encouraging me to challenge myself and also advised what classes would be best to take as college freshmen.  Once classes started I did not regret my decision to attend Trinity. Professor explain themselves well and demonstrate they care about their students' academic success.  Professor are available to help and they even open some tutoring sessions when they notice a class struggling.  Since classes are small, student participation, and attendance is part of our final grades."
College Freshman,4,"I have not looked into internships yet, but the career center sends various emails informing students about internships and job opportunities.  I am currently a student worker in the admissions office and I notice that staff cares about each student who expresses an interest for Trinity."
College Freshman,4,Student involvement is not a big part of the school but those who are involved have the desire to get more students involved.
College Freshman,4,"Trinity as their logo says, ""Discover your strength"" is very true.  It is a place where I feel comfortable to express who I am, without receiving judgment.  Trinity has helped me discover my inner voice; I participate in classes more than before, and I am eager to get involved in extracurricular  activities.  I would choose Trinity again because I have discovered an academic strength I did not know I had.  I love how classes are small and easy to participate in, the professors are always available for extra assistance, and students and staff are kind and always approachable."
College Freshman,4,Teachers are all willing to help you with anything.
College Freshman,4,Even though my college is a women college I'm very happy with the choice I made since everyone here is very helpful and care about the students.
College Junior,4,I like the school......just expensive
College Freshman,4,you are welcomed with opened arms
College Freshman,4,It is a great program.
College Freshman,4,It's fun to live on campus but it is very different from home.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Everything that's cool about this school is everything off campus, and that's only cause Catholic University doesn't suck like Trinity."
College Senior,4,"I am a Business/Law major which allows me to use my training in either field. I am learning policy, law, ethnics and strategic planning and the interworking of business and the justice system."
College Senior,4,There is so much to see and explore in the city of DC.
College Senior,4,I did an externship for my major and it was great. There was an externship class and a actual site. I got to be exposed to a work related environment and learned a lot from supervisors. I went almost every day for most of the semester.
College Senior,4,Trinity policies are pretty strict and appropriately enforced.
College Senior,4,"Off campus dining options are good, there are a good number of options, including healthy/organic options. There are stores right across the street however the majority of the restaurants and food places could be a little bit closer."
College Senior,4,I have known a lot of girls that have graduated from Trinity and their careers started right away.
College Senior,4,It's very good. They are always on the move and and able to assist students
College Senior,4,There may need to be more sports but overall it's good
College Sophomore,4,It's quite on campus and hardly anything goes on there.
College Sophomore,4,"You just have to keep up with deadlines, so create a schedule. Remember that there are people around you that can help, so ask for it!"
College Sophomore,4,Professors and staff are very kind and for the most part available. We get much attention and they give us one of the . finest academic learning in the city
College Sophomore,4,"I  get to do things that I wouldn't be able to do at home. Sisters are very kind. And I love my roommates. We chill, laugh, and talk all night.. It's awesome!"
College Freshman,4,The only way you can get drugs in if is if you sneak it. And even then the r.c and campus police finds out and you are expelled
College Freshman,4,Professors work with you to make sure you're meeting all the requirements
College Sophomore,4,The professor in the nursing program are really preparing us to be ready to get into the hospital and farther our knowledge with the hands on aspect.  They can be very challenging but this comes with the territory and they are equipping us to be come RN's.  It makes you want to pull your hair out but it will be well worth it in the long run.
College Sophomore,4,I am in the nursing program and the program is working fairly well.  I am new to this school and the lab so far has been great.  I can't wait to really apply the knowledge that I learned so far on the manikins.  The skills room has so many real life features that I can't wait to try out before going out into the field.  The curriculum seems as it will prepare us for the job and very earger to get started.
College Freshman,4,"The off-dining experience in Washington, D.C. is everything you imagine it to be."
Freshman,2,There was a huge bed bug problem my friend had to deal with and they didn't let students know how bad it was or how fast it was traveling form dorm to dorm and gave my friend a hard time to switch to a room away from the area. the food was good and as far as the schooling and teachers a lot of my professors didn't care to further explain something when I needed help but I loved my professor for math he gave me hope that there was still good teachers until he left. Also the admissions team is great for helping you out.
College Freshman,2,no social life at school I have to go to other colleges to have fun.
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares about the sports ... fair to say they're non existent .
College Freshman,2,Girls are dirty and disrespectful LOUD and the building is trifling. Makes me want to transfer already
Recent Alumnus,2,I came down with an eating disorder.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is not very safe here. One of the security guards got beaten up and the school established a 10pm curfew to cover it up. But, it is DC...."
Recent Alumnus,2,Nobody pays attention to sports here. The teams play against community college.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus dining is not convenient unless you go to the Deli/corner store across the street or the wings place across the street, anywhere else is at least a mile away."
College Senior,2,"There are not a lot of parties on campus.  Trinity is not a party school.  Therefore, parties I have found to be off campus at a students home that lives in the city and from the area.  It is not necessarily a bad then, because Trinity is place of serious minded women."
College Senior,2,It was okay at first but they assume a lot and do not always provide accurate information.
College Senior,2,Not much of a party campus.
College Senior,2,"Eating at a place across the street, I was food poisoned."
College Senior,2,"Needs improvement, but things are never done despite the complaints over the years"
College Senior,2,"The food quality changed drastically this year.it could be so much better if they actually listen to us.they need more food options, variety and space"
College Senior,2,You need to be on top of everything and try to find alot of scholarships.You do receive some money but its hardly enough. They don't take the time out to know the students financial needs or problems outside of school
College Sophomore,2,I have friends who live on campus who complain and I also visited several times and I was glad I lived off of campus!
College Sophomore,2,I don't see many different races at my university.
College Sophomore,2,No Greek life on campus unless a student goes to another university on campus
College Sophomore,2,It can use some improvement. There are not many places anyone can go that is around the area to eat.
College Freshman,2,"No track and field, no cheerleading, no step teams, no dance teams"
College Sophomore,2,"dontreally hear much about greek life. there are some tho just  not on campus, their greek clubs are linked with other colleges nearby (Howard U specifically)"
College Senior,2,"There is an okay mix of culture, but could stand to expand a bit."
College Senior,2,"The athletics at Trinity Washington University are not very popular, it's not really known for many sports although there is a girls basketball team and soccer team. The college is predominately a women's college and is co-ed,  the students are very friendly and tend to support one another when evolved in sports. The gym is a very nice place to get a workout and has many activities including, exercise classes, swimming, weight training, cardio training machines and a track to run laps. I'm not sure how many male students are evolved in athletics there."
College Junior,2,The permit cost is a little costly and it is difficult to find a spot to park at. The need for a car on campus isn't necessary thanks to the shuttle and the station being near by.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a cafeteria, deli, & the book store which does offer snakes. However, there are not many options in places for you to eat. Trinity Washington University is lacking variety in places for students to eat."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not too big on our campus. If you want to pledge you have to do it through one of the very close by schools. Other schools welcome our students so if you want the Greek life experience it's only a short trip away.
College Sophomore,2,Most students to not participate/support in our athletic department. I mean they do not have enough spirit and energy to participate and support in the Trinity sports.  I would love for the students to be more involved in our athletic department.
College Junior,2,The paticipation rate is low therefore they dont have as many events and activities as I would like. The funding is low and it seems all to easy to just group everyone all together. Even if their interest are widly different. I dont believe they even have greek housing. I have never seen any and ive been attending the school since 2006 as a part time student.
College Junior,2,"The area in which Trinity is surrounded is way to exspensive. Bettr off living on campus which will save a ton. It is exspensive to live in DC period unless you locate to the southeast side, which then may be affordable."
College Sophomore,2,The surrounding area of Trinity is very busy and little place to park.
College Sophomore,2,it's not a D1 school it's a D3 school there aren't a lot of sports on campus.  It's just Basketball and soccer.
College Junior,2,"Curfew = 10PM – There is a curfew at 10PM, and you can not get back on campus after 10PM. This curfew was developed to ensure safety, but for students working or wanting to have safe fun after 10, it's awful. They do have visitation. "
College Junior,2,Will not transfer – I transferred into community college and NOTHING transferred from this school. I know girls who transferred into Bowie and U Maryland and the same thing happened to them. I'm trying to get into other schools and they do not have Trinity listed as an accredited college. So choose wisely before you decide to finish here or not.
College Junior,2,"There is a slight amount of diversity student wise. It is mainly African american individuals however there is a good percentage of other ethnicity for commuter students. Overall the staff here at the school are dispersed , coming from many backgrounds."
College Senior,2,The college can offer more scholarships for the students.
College Senior,2,Only Girls – This is an all girls college. There are few males but they only attend class and not allow to stay on campus.
College Sophomore,2,DC Food – The food off campus isnt all that good. my favorite place is wings over washington. The places arent very convenient or open late. we have a quiz-noes across the street but it doesntr get much business.
College Sophomore,2,"The classes here are good, so are the professors and youll get a persceptive here you wont get anywhere else cause alot of kids here are from rougher parts of the city. But life on campus is real miserable. Theres nothing to do on campus, the food is bad, and there are MEAN GIRLS here who are OUT OF CONTROL. When I lived here, I didnt want to use the showers cause someone constantly pooped in them. We had a few meetings to discuss it and the mean girls threw a fit cause they didnt want to clean up. The administration slams students over pettiness too, and some mebers are notorious for playing favorites. I know some girls who moved back home cause of safety issues, but alot of that is part of living in DC.  If you go here, commute. Thats what most Trinity students do, and they get alot more out of this education. "
College Freshman,2,Trinity is not really known for sports. We have woman's basketball and volleyball but not many students are interested. People do not really attend the games.
College Freshman,2,"Trinity is an all women university. There are many different ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, economic background and political beliefs. Trinity is a Catholic University and any and every ethnicity is accepted."
Freshman,1,"I honestly wish I could leave zero stars. Where do I start the dorms are infested with mice , mold in the bathrooms, the dining hall has mice all of the food here makes you sick to your stomach one girl had bacteria in her stomach due to the food here. All they give you is mouse traps for the mice you find in your ROOM. All staff is rude and the tuition is way over price."
College Freshman,1,I never went to parties around my school
College Freshman,1,I don't like their food they need to do better
College Freshman,1,Boring; not the college experience I'm looking for.
College Freshman,1,No parties lol Boring ....
College Freshman,1,"sucks tasteless , not like other universities ... as much money that we're paying it should be better."
Recent Alumnus,1,All the girls here are lesbian and are from SouthEast DC or Prince George County.
Recent Alumnus,1,This school is veryyyyy strict. You can actually get in trouble for dating guys here. The classes are lecture classes and are no differant from the classes they offer at community college. They do not follow up on financial aid either.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I moved rooms three times, and all my roommates were rotten."
Recent Alumnus,1,All the students here act like spoiled babies. Stay away from here.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no Greek Life here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am going t be brutally honest about this school: this school was embarrassing. The students were really weird: they used to suck their thumbs, poop in the shower (frequently), throw temper tantrums in class, and used to make a huge mess in the cafeteria. All the students here are either lesbian or have serious psychological issues. Even the administration is disrespectful towards students who are not African-American, and whenever any mess happened on campus, the administration made it out to look like the school was a nice little Catholic school. And they will do anything to students to make their school look good, ANYTHING.  Howard and UDC are more accreditted. Stay far away from here, unless your a lesbian or psycho."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is not worth the cost. I have to pay loans for almost $20,000 for one year. Its not worth it cause the community college I transferred into was more accreditted. And students used to throw temper tantrums in class, and another time everybody in class flipped cause we were all scared of the Dean. It was embarassing."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are no parties here. Whenever we had balls or sports events, they were always supervised by the Dean and no boys allowed."
College Senior,1,Trinity doesn't really concentrate on Greek life.
College Senior,1,"The food is nasty. The first week of my first semester the food was good, after that I don't know what happened but I changed drastically."
College Senior,1,"They don't help students get internships and when they help you, they aren't based on your major."
College Senior,1,"At Trinity, the housing cost way to much for the amount that they want the students to pay.."
College Senior,1,The security at Trinity is very poor and that is the main reason why I transfer to a commuter.
College Senior,1,Trinity is an all girl school and majority of them are gay
College Senior,1,"At Trinity, there is no off-campus housing"
College Senior,1,"We need to have a greek life, not just chapters at other schools"
College Sophomore,1,They should have more choices and more home cooked meals that are really eatable and delicious!
College Sophomore,1,There's not many around the area. There's almost none.
College Sophomore,1,"We are a Catholic School, not much of a nightlife"
College Freshman,1,Food is nasty serve us the same thing 
College Sophomore,1,"we need NEW computers..... point blank, period."
College Sophomore,1,its not really diverse pertaining to race... it definitely needs to be better.
College Senior,1,"If you are not there EARLY, there is virtually NO PARKING AVAILABLE!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much diversity within race, however this a lot of diversity between religion and choice of partner preference."
College Junior,1,Unfortunately we dont have any off campus dining options.
College Freshman,1,"Trinity is a small, all women's college so we have sports but there is no real support or school spirit. Majority of students attend local university functions and events. The sports we do have don't do so well in games."
College Junior,1,"Our off-campus dining options suck!. There are not not many options. The stores are convience because they are directly across the street from campus, however the food is greasy and exspensive. The convient market charges astronomical prices for things that should cost no more than a dollar. The sandwhiches and fries will ring up to about eight dollars, which is a lot for a struggling college student. The wings are greasy and exspensive, not to mention these places do not stay open late at all!! We recieve no student discounts!"
College Junior,1,"The Campus Strictness here is terrible.  They seem to like being super hard to the point of slamming some students over pettiness (like someone told the Dean of Students you did...and now she doesn't like you so she is going to give you all these extra rules that you follow or your gone). And the rules they give to some students are: no drinking,no partying,  no X.Y.Z., no leaving campus after 10PM, get As or else. When I was here there was a squirt gun fight and a protest that the administration ""shut down."" It depends on who makes the school look ""good"" and who the administration likes and does not like. "
College Junior,1,"More work can be done – Living on campus is a great opportunity to enjoy the experience of a college setting. However, the housing could use more improvement. For example, it would be very convenient if all elevators on campus worked. Secondly, the prices for living on campus are not worth the extra loans. The buildings are extremely old, and not maintained very well. It would be beneficial if the school constructed a better designed dorm building instead of building an academic center which half of the attending students now will never see"
College Senior,1,"Going to Clubs Are Better – Because this is a Catholic school, they dont have a lot of parties. They may have a few but it only be females there with a handful of males."
College Freshman,1,"We have no greek life of our own, you have to go through another school."
College Junior,1,"Parking on Campus is extremely limited.  There are only 2-3 parking lots availsble for students and if you arrive to class more that 15 minutes late, forget about getting a parking space on campus. Also campus security often allows those who do not have a parking permit to park on campus which leaves little spaces for those who pay money every semester."
College Junior,1,Parking sucks. Not enough parking lots. THose that we do have are far away from main building.
College Freshman,1,"Too Expensive – I live at home for the moment, but I am looking into off campus housing.  Anything in this area is out of the question.  A one bedroom in this area will cost you around $2000 a month which is entirely to much for the average college student."

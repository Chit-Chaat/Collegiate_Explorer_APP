I was pretty good at managing my time so it worked for me well. I have taken Spanish, Art appreciation, and career planning online. The professors were always so helpful and responded to any questions quickly so students wouldn’t get behind. They have office hours in which all students can email them for help, or join them on a zoom meeting."
Niche User,5,"Due to current situations, all of my classes have been online and it's safe to say that I'm learning as much as I would if I were in class with the professor.

Sophomore,5,"Returning to college as a 50 year old adult whose been married, widowed, raised 4 children, and has 2 grandchildren was really scary for me., but, both the faculty, and the students made things much less daunting.  Everyone was super helpful, and just outright friendly.   Going back to school is now fun, energizing, instead of scary."
Freshman,5,Overall my experience at Bakersfield College has been fantastic since all my professors are awesome and the college has a safe environment.

Sophomore,5,"Bakersfield College is a really nice school and I have so far enjoyed my time there so far. The professors as well as the facility are really helpful and engaging. I am currently a full-time student and the classes I am taking a really interesting and have great professors leading them. BC really strives for  excellence from there students and there are plenty of resources if one needs help. The one thing the campus could improve on is their student counseling, due to the influx of students it is hard for counselors to keep up with the case load and often times students schedules get mixed up or students hear conflicting advice from the counselors. However, other than that one issue, BC is a great school and I've really enjoyed my time there so far."
Sophomore,5,"This campus is really good, there are many programs and groups that’s make college easier in many aspects."

The professors are nice and care for their students, as they try their best to help each student to get the grade they deserve."
Freshman,5,It was a great experience that is fulfilling with my school career. I'm having a great time. Allowing me to have flexible hours allowing me to go to class and have time to do my homework whilst still having time to study.  I really enjoy my classes. I really want to elaborate that my professors are the best without the knowledge and direction they should give us. I love how verse I can be with my classes and the mostly free will besides having to actually turn in my work and pass the classes. It's a good experience that i'm having.
Niche User,5,I like the staff of Bakersfield College. They are humble and the students at Bakersfield College are helpful.

Sophomore,5,The professors want you to succeed and work with you. They don’t treat their jobs as just a paycheck. Believe this community college is underrated.
Sophomore,5,I attended religiously for 2 years then I took a break for a year due to family issues. Now after hurting my back at work I decided to return to change my major and obtain a AS in Agriculture business management. BC has been very helpful and always willing to work with you to assist you in anyway possible to help you succeed in graduating. I recommend BC for anyone who want to take their general education courses or any other courses.

Sophomore,5,"The professors are available with extra time to help in problem areas,  the tutoring center is free, open all day to help in all subjects, and it also has class groups to help in your specific class alone with your piers. This college is a great way to earn your degree if you are getting from here or if you are transfering to another campus. Financial aid is available to every one and the staff is very helfull to make sure that you qualified for any help available from the state, federal, or a pell grant."
Freshman,5,"For anyone who is wanting to go to college, is not sure where to go to and lives near a Bakersfield College campus, should go to Bakersfield College.

Niche User,5,"Bakersfield College is one of the best community colleges there is due to their low costs, help in financial situations, and has a wonderful nursing program. I do wish that Bakersfield College would make gaining access to the nursing program much easier."
Freshman,5,I really admire and appreviate how dedicated all of the professors and staff at Bakersfield College are. Everyone makes you feel welcomed and as if you belong there. It is a positive environment and would recommend this college to anyone. I would like to see the Nakersfield College Delano Camopus expand and receive more resources from the Main Campus.
Sophomore,4,"I really like that Bakersfield College provides many services for students with DSPS and that the EOPS staff are always there to assist. Even though the classes are now virtual, there are plenty of services available such as the Writing Center, Tutoring Center, and the DSPS Virtual Lobby."
Sophomore,4,"Even though the classes are now virtual, there are plenty of services available such as the Writing Center, Tutoring Center, and the DSPS Virtual Lobby. The classes are a bit more complicated but the Professors tend to be helpful and lenient with technological complications."
Freshman,4,"I liked how it's neat and the buildings are very nice, but I personally don't like how you get confused on where to go to your destination."
Freshman,4,I've only taken a summer course so far but I can definitely see that all staff and students want you to succeed and try to help you find the resources that you need.
Sophomore,4,"I really have enjoyed attending Bakersfield college so far. I am starting my second year, and it is unfortunate that everything is online now because I miss the amazing people that I have met there. All of the professors I’ve had so far have been so helpful as well as the counselors who I’ve spoke with. My counselor Manuel made the whole process of starting college go smoothly. It is also close to home, so I love that I can even go walking. Although it was a huge change from high school because of the bigger load of work, I do like that challenge."
Niche User,4,I am actually a high school student enrolled in an early college program. I have been taking college classes provided by Bakersfield College and have visited the campus very often. It is an amazing college with a really great environment and awesome clubs. It has a really good set of values and allows high school students to get a head start in their education. Bakersfield college also has many ways to help out their students who are struggling financially. It's a college not far from home and makes you feel at home.
Sophomore,4,"I like how there are a lot of student facilities and resources to use, and I also like how the college provides lots of networking events for different majors."
Freshman,4,"I like the teachers there, the campus is fairly nice, and I like the view from the hill it’s on. The diversity is good there, and there’s lots of opportunities for agricultural programs, both with livestock and plants."
Sophomore,4,The online classes were very organized and the instructors were always available to answer questions.
Niche User,4,"I've taken a Public Speaking Class there, and am currently taking two Arts and Humanities classes online. My public speaking teacher was really nice, funny, and helpful. I learned a lot from that class. I rated four stars because while the campus is ok, and the teachers are overall pretty good, there is nothing in particular that makes BC stand out for me."
Junior,4,i have not taken any classes online but they from what i heard is that they are better because they are very flexible however you might get less help from some professors
Junior,4,i really enjoy the environment and the professors. i think that they should offer more classes in nearby cities and more on campus
Senior,4,"This summer will be the first time a take an online class through Bakersfield College. I'm not sure what to expect. However, I am looking forward to completing it."
Senior,4,"I would say that Bakersfield College is a great community college, there are a lot of resources offered, they have classes that can work with your schedule which includes online classes. the only thing is that it is a very impacted school and limited choices of parking."
Junior,4,"Courses online have been great. It goes without saying, because online courses are generally more flexible, more is expected of you. Communication with professors can vary from excellent to infrequent. It is important to consider the professor's experience with technology, as it may be less fine-tuned than some of the students on occasion. Nevertheless, to be able to take a course without being physically present and spend gas, means more time to invest in yourself in other areas of your life, which I found to be very useful."
Graduate Student,4,"Spring 2020 was my graduation semester, and the first one where my classes were not online. That changed halfway through when COVID 19 resulted in everything becoming distance learning. The advisors and counselors did fantastic with the change!  They made it very easy to set up zoom meetings and keep up to date on everything. Most of my professors were flexible and understanding of the new circumstances, however there were a couple that expected everything to stay the same. I am a very independent learner, so I was able to graduate on the Deans list. However, I know some students who rely on professor help to learn, and they had to withdraw because they had professors who were not as easy to communicate with, even before COVID."
Niche User,4,"so far it has been pretty easy to access the website and get in touch with the administrators, and set up my accounts for the summer classes"
Freshman,4,I've attended BC for a year and it has been such a great experience. Iv'e never had any complications with professors or students. Easy to navigate and very welcoming to everyone.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and quality of classes were very good, especially with how low the prices were. The only complaint I have is how poorly cleaned all the buildings were"
Freshman,4,I am just a freshman and I have only been there one semester due to personal reasons. So far I enjoy this campus so much because my counselor are always there to help me with my schedules and any questions I might have. This school has amazing professors that are always there to help. This year was great and I can not wait for this upcoming fall.
Sophomore,4,This is a very good school and they have so many programs to choose from. They have education pathways that can lead to your dream job.
Freshman,4,"In my experience, overall, I would say that professors are very committed to their job. They ensure to make anything as possible on their hands to deliver a good class, especially in quarantine days."
Freshman,4,"Its a very good college highly recommend it. It has a great campus. The teachers are so respectful and they are engage with the students. They have a very good soccer team, its strong team. They won there conference 2019.  Its the first title they've won in 4 years. Other sports are also every good. Bakersfield college is very amazing school its a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"This school really gives you a good education for your money. The only downside really is that there are no dorms (that I know of), but I live at home anyway."
Junior,4,"Being one of the oldest and well renowned community Bakersfield College is very reasonable and a big size campus many community colleges across the nation. The teachers are alright in most classes, with exceptions here and there in teaching quality. Campus parking is completely awful in this school, which you need to buy a $20 parking pass and have to find a parking spot early or all them will be taken. You can park far away from the campus, but there is on going parking issue with the surrounding residents who don't like students parking at their homes.  The security mainly give out tickets and don't really prevent car from being broken into."
Freshman,4,"It is my first college I have ever attended. I like it, good amount of majors to choose from. Some professors are hard to deal with as well as some staff. They expect you to come into college already knowing everything about it which is difficult for freshman college students. But overall, the campus is great."
Freshman,4,"It's everything that you would expect from a CC. Just everyone kinda doing their own thing, nobody is going to go up to you and start a conversation. but people are nice enough."
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of opportunities to grow as a college student at Bakersfield College, you just have to find them yourself. Make sure to get involved, participate whenever you can both inside and outside the classroom. Visit at least two counselors before making your education plan as the counselors here can choose classes that you might not even need. Don't be afraid to use the student resources on campus anything from the writing center to the health and wellness center.  A lot of great professors teach here so just ask other students for recommendations."
Sophomore,4,"Bakersfield College is a good public community college. I've had some great teachers as well some not so great ones. I love that the school does their best to have events and programs that help students with jobs, food, and internships. Bakersfield College also is great at getting distinguished speakers and I love that. The staff is overall very helpful and friendly. Proud to be a current student."
Sophomore,4,"BC is a mixed bag of amazing and terrible. It'd the best community college in the Kern are for your money, and with satellite campuses all over it's convenient. But the professors are a toss up, events are lack luster, most programs are filed with people just trying to get out so don't go in expecting lasting connections. That said, there are some phenomenal professors, incredible people that you get to meet and share your time with. Parking is one of the main campuses biggest problems, get ready to walk."
Niche User,4,"I as a student have had an amazing experience at Bakersfield college. the college itself is extremely pleasing to the eye. the academic as well have great diversity, they have majors from fine art to literary advances. i for one am majoring in a fine art. they have a wonderful diversity with the art major itself. within it are art ranging form paints such as oils, water, and acrylic. to sculpture, designs and photography."
Freshman,4,"I don't know what tot say exactly, but It has been a wonderful time. A lot of the programs & everything that is there is for the students heavily."
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year here at Bakersfield college and, like most people, I decided to go here then to go to a four year college out of state or to another city is because it was affordable. Money is what weighed out any of the other options any of the other colleges were willing to give. Bakersfield College is very resourceful and provides many workshops and programs to help your needs. This includes financial aid, health and wellness services, tutoring, and they also provide a pantry service. The pantry service allows students, who many not know where their next meal may come from, get food for free. One area I would like to see change is the involvement in clubs, so students can connect and establish healthy relationships with each other.  Overall, Bakersfield College is a great community college that can fit your needs."
Freshman,4,"My experience in Bakersfield College is starting off pretty great. I’m currently a freshmen in college and am still experiencing the college life, which I’m not really fond of for now."
Freshman,4,"In a word, Bakersfield College is: unusual. There are a many opportunities for those who need financial aid; however, one can get overwhelmed with that they need to do. The experience is something to be felt on the campus, but as long as you ask for help, you can survive BC."
Freshman,4,"This college offers the courses I need to pursue my degree. The professors have been very friendly and very understanding. The course load is as expected, completely attainable and not too heavy. The only thing I don't appreciate, and I'm sure this is a nationwide problem, is that book costs are way too high."
Freshman,4,"It was a good experience for getting your GE done. I started with online for the summer. It was fast, but good to do."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with former professors have has been great. They are very accessible,caring, and humble."
Junior,4,"The campus itself is clean. Many renovations are being done to improve the amenities as well as campus. You find good diversity of students of all ethnicities and ages. I have been able to register for all of my pre requirements with minimal hassle. The satellite campus' allow for more class availability as well. The professors at this college have also been great. Some classes are heavily impacted, so maybe adding classrooms as well as professors may help with this situation. The cafeteria food is great and has healthy options available."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Bakersfield College was a very good one. From the classes, to the sports, to the student I met along the way. Each class and professor teaches you something different that will help you for the rest of your life. Bakersfield College is the perfect place to get your Associates Degree and a good transitional period from high school to college, and then on to a University if you choose to do so. The friends I made and the life lessons I learned was all with the help of Bakersfield College."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy going to class and learning. I dont complain much about homework or classwork. But I feel that, for a community college, the professors give tons of homework."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Bakersfield college was pretty good. The campus is really nice and I really like the atmosphere that the faculty gives students and visitors. Although the parties aren't the best and the professors aren't always the most agreeable the college is a great place to receive a great education at an affordable price. There are plenty of amazing clubs and sports to choose from if you're trying to keep yourself busy on and off campus. If you're looking for a decent and economically smart college to go to that provides a good education while having fun, this is your place!"
Niche User,4,Haven't been there but I'd like to go. I'm not completely sure what I would want to do but this place seems good enough to be a start.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Bakersfield college has been great. It would be better if they expanded their Delano campus because there are so many students. The general Ed classes are always full and gone so fast. They’re librarians are awesome and very helpful. They’re tutoring center is always full as well, so if you’re not quick in making an appointment, good luck honestly. Most of the professors are really nice, some are scary, and some are brutally honest. The security could be better though because I rarely ever see a security guard around campus. I’ve personally only seen the security guard twice in the last two years."
Freshman,4,The school has cool teachers and cool programs. I wish they had a few more language classes.  Would love if they also had more ways to help you pay for your classes.
Freshman,4,Bakersfield college has allowed me to fully explore my options for my life as well as get started on working towards my career.
Sophomore,4,"I liked how they valued there professors, because it means a lot to them. Since the school payed and treated there professors nicely it really showed when the professors came to work each day wanting to actually teach and help students better themselves within the class. I feel like Bakersfield College could work on making the school bigger or adding more classes since it is hard for some students to get classes into. Especially if they are about to graduate and only need acouple more classes."
Freshman,4,Bakersfield College counselors and advisers are very helpful. The professors take education seriously and they want you to  learn and succeed. My counselors helped me get the most out of financial aid and there are so many resources offered to help students along in their education.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this is an excellent school and offers many online classes which is great for those working full time or taking on 2 or more jobs."
Niche User,4,"I've only taken one class, but so far so good. Staff is very friendly and helpful especially with helping you get to where you need to go and such. The teachers are pretty nice and respond back fairly quickly, at least a lot faster than I initially thought."
Sophomore,4,I liked the fact they give every opportunity for a student to succeed in their academic goal.  They have professional tutors with Bachelors degree or Masters degree to help with English composition and Math.  They also provide peer tutoring  (student tutors) so each student can get help if they need it.  On top of that Bakersfield College provide Student instructors to re-enforce what students get from the professor during lecture. It allows the students to have a more approachable environment where students can freely ask questions regarding the topic of their classes.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the staff at Bakersfield college, i always get the help i need. Ive literally visited, every resource possible this year and everyone has a great attitude. I like the shuttle bus this year, it was a very good idea. Specially, the hours they run for, i love it."
Junior,4,"Bakersfield College has excellent and knowledgeable professors. Although, BC is over populated and may be difficult to get into certain courses."
Sophomore,4,BC is extremely affordable with excellent instructors. I'm an older student and feel 100% accepted with my younger peers.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Bakersfield College. It’s campus offers a lot of educational help. My favorite place to go study is the library it’s quiet and there is a lot of study space. I have had really helpful professors as well. Although the classes are harder to get into as I get closer to finishing my general education, it is still a good environment and less expensive."
Sophomore,4,Bakersfield College offers many degrees. Transferring from Bakersfield College does not happen often but is not hard to achieve.
Alum,4,"Bakersfield College was the first school that made me feel welcome. During my time there, I was able to grow into a more confident person with more self-worth. When I graduated, I felt like I truly deserved it. I hope to see an increase in activity from the LGBTQ community there as well as more academic opportunities given to women."
Senior,4,"Administration can be lazy and make bad decisions, but the professors are amazing and very helpful. Parking can be a total nightmare though."
Freshman,4,"I've been attending Bakersfield College for a semester now. The counselors here are extremely helpful, although some are not as knowelegdable as others. My experience with the professors here so far have been very positive, there has been a couple here and there with their own quirks. The overall culture of the college is very positive and supportive. Courses are so far built pretty well, but of course this varies. Education paths are sometimes changed/tweaked year by year, and this can be very frustrating. I definitely recommend it to those who like a smaller school feel."
Alum,4,"A good start to one's college education for the price!  I was able to obtain my AA-T in two years.  The professors are overall pretty good!  While attending the school I played for the tennis team, therefore allowing me to get priority registration for classes which was a huge help because getting classes can be difficult."
Freshman,2,"I am currently taking classes online due to Covid-19. Not how i imagined starting my first year of college, its very stressful since everything is online."
Junior,2,the psychology dept professors treat students not right. most professors I should say.they are very rude to the elderly students that's a fact. the student financial aid helps sure can mess your aid up. the counselors never have the same ideas for a student's educational path. five classes turn into 20 plus. one-semester turned into years.

Sophomore,2,"It is ok, but what I have seen is a lot of reverse discrimination coming from fellow African American students, and they get away with it. It is so sad because there are a lot of good professors who have their hands tied because of how the current admiration sides with one minority group over all others. It should be an institution of learning, not pushing your political views."
Niche User,2,Decent for locals in Bakersfield. Not anything outstanding. Classes are hard to get registered in. Good way to save a lot of money.
Sophomore,2,"It's not the worst, but it could be ten times better. There is hardly any student involvement, and if there is it's rare. You hardly hear about any of the events happening, and the quality of teachers ranges on both sides of the spectrum."
Senior,2,"Bakersfield College is overpopulated and the majority of terrible professors, outweigh the good ones. Staff should be evaluated more efficiently, to ensure students are getting what they pay for, and there should be enough tutors available to assist the mass of students that are desperate for help. Personally, out of the FOUR YEARS (yep, four years at a two year community college), every single one of the counselors i've talked to never fully know what they're talking about, each one sends you in 100 different directions. It's almost impossible to get into classes as well, since the amount of students attending basically overpowers the amount of classes available. I would not recommend Bakersfield College to anybody, unless they want to spend their senior year at a community college while their friends of the same year are graduating with bachelor degrees at a CSU."
Junior,2,I would like to see the school get more organized systematically and in personal within the buildings.
Sophomore,2,"Bakersfield College is an easy School to get started with. However, the overall care for students is not there and it is not career driven. If you are just looking for units it’s fine but if your looking for a school that cares another option would be better."
Freshman,2,"Overall teachers care and provide tons of work, but the administration doesn't and the ""safety"" team is a joke. The campus parking is miserable, some would call it a joke, but jokes are suppose to be funny. They offer ""flexible"" schedules like night classes and weekend classes, but no support for them, good luck getting tutoring if you have a job and you're out of luck if you need to buy a book..."

Sophomore,2,"Some of the professors are excellent but they are rare and many of the others are horrible because you learn nothing from their class. The academic staff repeatly have made mistakes that have resulted in me not receiving early registration for multiple semesters in a row, which has put me behind, and have even made mistakes that prevent me from being able to graduate or transfer to the next college."
College Sophomore,2,i have never heard about jobs on campus or any interships
College Junior,2,"The tuition is very affordable however the financial aid is absolutely USELESS if you have an issue that they cannot go by the books. I am halfway through this semester and have yet to receive ANY financial aid due to a small error in my FAFSA which will take months to be able to see any aid. Even then, it is unlikely I will be able to receive it due to the semester ending."
College Junior,2,It's very difficult to find help here. Financial aid are lacking in knowledge and unhelpful. You are much better off asking the students here.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot of activities on campus. There should be more campus activities.
College Sophomore,2,No aid was awarded for me
College Junior,2,We are just a jr college
College Freshman,2,It's kind of a pain because they are unclear what they need from the tax return from the last financial aid application.
College Freshman,2,Most of the counselers can't answer a lot of questions that I have asked.
College Senior,2,"Unless you're super poor, a single parent, or some other such person with extreme need you are probably not going to receive financial aid. The tuition also goes up each year."
College Junior,2, I sometimes have trouble finding a computer because many students are not even doing homework they are on Facebook or YouTube and yes some people have caught their attention but they still do it.
College Sophomore,2,"If you cannot afford to go away to a four-year university right away, then BC is an okay option for two years until you can transfer. I do not think it prepares you very well for the future, but there aren't very many alternative options in Bakersfield. "
College Sophomore,2,"I don't mean to sound snarky, but BC does not consist of the top students. Usually about half the class ends up dropping throughout the semester. It is not very diverse; most students are of a lower socioeconomic class and Hispanic (this is representative of Bakersfield as a whole). While there are some students who are attending BC with the intent of later transferring and saving money, most students are just biding their time before they drop out."
College Sophomore,2,"As far as workload and difficulty, the online classes I have taken are extremely easy. As long as you keep up with your assignments, check-in every few days, and complete the work, you will most definitely get an A. If you are not self-motivated to succeed, you might find them challenging. The teachers are pretty hit-and-miss. Some are very on top of grading, others are not. One of my online professors this semester hasn't graded anything in 2+ months. Most classes have weekly discussions for everyone to participate in, but mostly students just post their discussions and do not respond to anybody else. If you are genuinely interested in learning, I would not take online classes. After this semester, I will never take them again."
College Senior,2,Usually network availability is good but sometimes the speed is slow.
College Junior,2,the money i am going to be paying the school is not exactly worth it for the degree i will be getting.
College Student,2,I didn't know what to expect at first overall it was a nice experience easier than i thought it would be but me personally i still perfer face to classroom
College Junior,2,I'm an Economics major and Bakersfield College doesn't have much courses for the major. They only have intro to macro and micro but nothing else that is transfer worthy.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel a lot needs to change with the Financial Aid Department. You can not reach them by phone and my hours at work do not allow me to go at the time that I need to. When you do get the chance to go there is so many people there a head of you that you will wait for an hour or more just for basic questions.
College Junior,2,I've only gotten a couple of BOG waivers. The last few semesters I've had to pay for the classes myself which is difficult because I live paycheck to paycheck.
College Freshman,2,"I don't believe that Bakersfield College offers enough classes to be able to get my AA in English. I wish I could have but they just offered it at times that were literally impossible for me. One class was late at night while another was at a time that messed up with another class time that was mandatory for me.
They offered more classes in the fall, which I wish they would have said on their online homepage for me to access, but I found out the hard way in the spring. 
The transfer English class is full of students and there are many good teachers to teach for that, but it's harder as you transition to the major in English like literature and English history because there are few teachers that teach it and I have already had a bad experience with some."
College Freshman,2,"Bakersfield College is just average. It is a great little school to get all of your gen-ed classes done and prepare you for transfer, but it lacks in several fundamental areas. For starters, it is way impacted. There are almost 17,000 students, and not enough faculty members. It is very hard to get classes if you do not have priority registration, which many people don't. If you get priority registration you should have no problem."
College Sophomore,2,I am doing my general education right now and have not taken any classes related to my major.
College Senior,2,"they hardly offer anu classes that i nned, only two at a time. the classes themselves take along time to coplete (very time consuming) i have to work around the classes schedule and not mine. the only thing it has is that is in a convenience area for me to attend."
College Senior,2,many of the classrooms are old and are in need of computers
College Senior,2,"saplig learning, a progam were we had to do pur hw. it shut down temporarily, and was always slow even on campus"
College Sophomore,2,"most students have families, work full time and theyjust dont study enough. Bakersfield college has all the requirment that all students need from tutoring, to professors offering their to help out. but students dont take advantage of that."
Recent Alumnus,2,I received this grade and was unhappy with it but that's what I earned.
College Senior,2,The facilities are alright to say the lease. The programs get confusing because the class numbers change over the two years I had been there so trying to find the classes I needed were hard to find. And honestly the campus life wasn't anything to say about. I went there for class and left right after.
College Junior,2,"I am going to give it a C because of the fact that it is my first semester, so I don't know about it too well, yet. 
I don't want to give it too much of a good grade or too much of a bad grade so I am going to stay in the middle. 

I am aware of the things. My College had a 'Constitution Day' and there were a lot of booths set up in honor of the constitution being ratified 225 years ago. I stopped at one of the booths and was asked what was our nation's first Constitution and I said the Articles of Confederation. it was the correct answer, so I got a mini-u.s. flag as a prize."
College Senior,2,"I am a communication major and my classes are never as interesting as they should, yes I am learning but not as quite as I should for the most part."
College Junior,2,"They dont help that much, you have to work with them really hard to get anything done."
College Senior,2,"I have been attending school here for a few years and I have not seen much activity on campus. Since it is a small school I find it easy to contact professors. Although some administrators lack the care we, as students need, there are a handful of professors that really care."
College Sophomore,2,Kinda Is 5 Time I Be in the Office – and take me as .... terrible my son applied with other college and later of 445 minutes all the papers was done
College Junior,2,Needs More Animal Science Classes – B.C. consistently cuts funding for my major and has let may of the professors go. Shameful.
College Senior,2,Cut Backs – I am a agriculture/animal science major and it's sad to see my department being cut back. The amount of classes offered per semester in the agriculture department is shrinking making it difficult to to meet the requirements for graduation or transfer in a timely manner. Bakersfield is known for two things Oil and Agriculture I thing our local college should do a better job reflecting that.
College Freshman,2,Scheduling Classes – I chose this school because it has great teachers and the atmosphere is very welcoming but scheduling your classes is a pain in the butt. When you try to see a counselor there is never any room. The front desk always tells you the list is full and to check back at a later time. Then you go online and the classes you need are always full and they don't have any more classes until the following semester. There is never enough classes for all the students.
College Junior,2,"BC Renegades – There's not much community support concerning our athletics programs, were a small community and we should advertise more."
College Junior,2,Money Bags – The tuition for BC is very affordable and financial aid is very complicated when school starts.
College Senior,2,"Its Better Than Nothing – The reason for going to this school is because its the only jr college in my city and also because its cheaper than going to a four year university. Extremely few classes that are transferrable to a four year university, you can basically only do your gen ed."
College Senior,2,"Classes Extremely Limited – I don't spend too much time on campus because its not appealing. The professors are average, once in a while you will find a really good teacher who loves to teach and who cares about the students. There is not much to do on campus, so I just go to class and leave. The biggest complaint that I have is the actual classes. Their is limited space in classes it is extremely hard to get into classes that you need, especially when you get down to your last classes."
College Freshman,2,"Where Are They? I know we have a student body, but I haven't seen any special events or activities put on by them yet. The first semester is almost over, and I don't know if I've just been uninformed or if there really isn't anything going on."
College Junior,2,"Just One – I've only attempted one online course, and I couldn't figure it out. However, I am currently in a math class that uses an online proponent, and it is fantastic. Great learning tool!"
College Junior,2,"Mas O Menos – BC has it's moments. There are both good and bad. Depending on what you involve yourself in, your experience may be better. Some teachers are OUTSTANDING, but others will knock your socks off with their incompetence. The worst part are the students! Most are horrible, and are their for the free child care or other students (socially). Basically, watch who you associate with, and check out your teachers before hand. GOOD LUCK!"
College Freshman,2,The student body consists of recent high school grads and older adults trying to improve their education.
College Senior,2,they need to work harder to make things run more efficiant
College Sophomore,2,"Grades Not Shown – i wish my teachers would have gives weekly grades in order to know were i stood, i entered blind and did not know my grade until the semester ended where it was too late to improve."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is hard finding a job once finished at school. Some coursed allow for work with a certificate most require most schooling. The career services is very basic. Like going to a job fair its all about you the student doing everything then going and asking for more assistance.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's Not a Good Campus – I don't do much on the campus other than attend classes and the library.  It's not that clean or modern, and most of the campus needs a serious upgrade.  It's not important though, and there are still many activites that take place on campus that I've seen while walking to the library.  I'm not a fan of the campus, but it's an old school so what can I say?"
Sophomore,1,The teachers there don’t care about the kids succeeding except for a select few teachers. All they care about is getting their paycheck.
Freshman,1,"My experience so far has been terrible.  The students are abrasive and rude. The professors don't seem to care about the students; it's as if they hate their job and are only doing it for the money. Whenever I need help, professors are reluctant to do so because they claim that they don't have time. Overall a terrible experience so far but I'm hopeful that soon it'll I enjoy my time here more and more."
Graduate Student,1,ew hate this college. It's the worst and yeah hate hate hate hate hate this idk what else to put but yeah hate hate hate hate hate hate hate
College Senior,1,My major is criminal justice as a probation officer and I will love to keep studying and keep having that opportunity with your help to keep helping my country and keep studying and finish my career
College Senior,1,I love studying put I will like some more help so I can keep on going with my education and graduated from Bakersfield college a very good educational college.and if you help me with this scholarship I will be very thankful for your help and support and for helping me on keep me education going thanks you and thansk GOD GOD bless you all and your family as well I'll be praying so I can get the help that I need to keep my studies going.
College Sophomore,1,The quality  of post-grad services at my current school are the worst. It is that way because it's only a 2 year community college. We have no post-grad services that I know of.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few things to do at BC. There are a few clubs, but they generally have very little participation. If you want to make friends and have a good time, you will have to put in a lot of effort. Most students come to class and leave straight away; they are not there to make friends."
College Student,1,So far it has been bad but i am not to sure whats going on with my financial aid its real confusing and i haven't received anything and i turned it in like three   or four months ago
College Junior,1,I am horrible with online classes.  I prefer a traditional classroom setting.
College Junior,1,"I have to work full-time during the day and the only way I can take classes is in the evening.  It was hard to get the classes that I needed because they would fill very quickly.  Because I was only capable of taking one class at a time, I didn't get priority registration, even though I only had 2 or 3 classes left to take for my degree.  It took a very long time to finish my classes.  I had to take a leave of absence from work so I could take a required class (Microbiology) because it was only offered during the day."
College Sophomore,1,Completely not helpful. Cannot get any good advice and it takes forever to get to them.
College Senior,1,"I do not qualify for financial aid even though my parents do not pay for any of my school. Instead, people who do drugs and have 10 kids get it instead. Not fair!"
College Junior,1,"I got financial aid twice and then I was no longer elgible for it so the pass two years I'm not elgible for finacial aid so I buy my own books, pay for parking, buy supplies out of my own pocket and its HORRIBLE!"
College Junior,1,Hassles of Registration – They do not offer enough classes or big enough class sizes.  Classes fill up way to fast and they give people priority registration that do not even deserve it.  They need to figure out a new system.
College Freshman,1,"Registration at BC – When trying to register for classes at BC it is next to impossible. Almost as if there is a time window and if you miss it, then you get all the leftovers. You have to be on the computer, waitning for registration to open and hope that your computer doesn't freeze or any such luck."
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus Scene – There isn't much school spirit. On campus it is like high school all over again due to immaturity of students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"A Pain!! It is a pain to get financial aid at this campus. If you call the Financial Aid Center it is very hard to get in contact because the automated message says ""Don't bother calling because we are not going to return phone calls""!"
College Freshman,1,Not Very Good – i think the online classes are helpful with your personal schedule but you have to teach yourself and it ends up taking more of your time.
College Junior,1,"I Dont Know – To be honest, I dont even know where to go for that kind of help."

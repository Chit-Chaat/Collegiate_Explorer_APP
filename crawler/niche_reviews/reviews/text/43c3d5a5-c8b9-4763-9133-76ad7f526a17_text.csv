Senior,5,"OCC is clearly dedicated to training young men and women for Christian ministry, and they do an excellent job at it. You learn more about God than you ever expected, you build lasting bonds with people who will bless your life (both students and professors/faculty), and you are constantly introduced to ways to develop your gifts, grow in wisdom and knowledge, and serve the world."
Sophomore,5,"I can not imagine going to any other college, this place feels like my home away from home. The community is great, it feels like a family. The professors invest in you and your future."

Alum,5,Professors are nationally recognized as experts in their fields and they genuinely care about their students. Living on campus is a phenomenal experience; I made lifelong friends here. My years spent there were some of the best of my life!
Niche User,5,I have gone on a tour there and all my pastors graduated from ther and it is the best place to recieve a Biblical education. Professors and students click well and it really feels like a good community to be a part of.
Freshman,5,Ozark is an amazing school with a lot of ministry opportunity to get a feel into ministry and challenge your faith.

Junior,5,"I love my school! At Ozark you learn how to learn and be prepared for life in ministry.  The staff and professors actually care about you as a person and it is a great environment to learn.  The workload is challenging, but you learn so much."
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman in college in another state seemed terrifying to me, but Ozark is strong on the aspect of community. It did not take me long to find a group of friends to connect with. Very quickly the school gave me connections to the outside community like churches and  different volunteer opportunities available. Ozark loves connecting and serving people. Being at Ozark has given me a sense of belonging and purpose, even if I do not know what I want to pursue in the future. The love I have experience here at this college is unlike anything I have ever experienced, and for that I am truly grateful."

We generally have smaller classes, which is great for classroom discussions. The workload is a lot and kind of overwhelming, but we learn a lot and the professors are gracious in their grading."
College Sophomore,5,"There are almost always people on campus recruiting Ozark students for jobs. Sometimes, they are recruiting for a summer position or internship and sometimes they are looking for full time positions. Some people specifically want Ozark students because they know we are hard workers."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek Life is not a thing at Ozark. To be honest, I don't even know what Greek Life is. But people do learn Biblical languages here, which includes Greek. I think it is way cooler to learn Greek than to identify yourself with three Greek letters."
College Sophomore,5,"I love OCC so much! The community is fantastic. We are surrounded by older, wiser adults. Every professor genuinely cares about their students. Each dorm has residence directors, affectionately referred to as ""dorm parents."" The dorm parents are good at making everyone feel loved. We are also put in mentorship groups so that people who have experience in ministry can help guide us through this time. The student community is also great. I love knowing that I can be friends with anyone on our campus because we are all united as brothers and sisters in Christ."
College Freshman,5,"Ozark, being a Bible College, does not have an issue with Sexual Assaults. We have a campus security guard who’s main concern is keeping long boards off campus."

College Freshman,5,"The professors, courses, and classroom settings cultivate a learning experience I have never experienced. I do not feeling like I’m chasing a degree. My first semester here I gained more knowledge and learned more about myself than I did my entire high school career."
College Freshman,5,This is not an easy school. The professors (all alumni) pressure each and every student to perform to the best of our ability because they know the difficulties of ministry after school.
College Junior,5,Everyone that I know that has graduated has been able to immediately get an internship after graduation or near it. The committee in charge of internships and ministries after graduation has been doing a great job!

College Senior,5,"When you enroll at OCC, you sign a covenant pledge that as long as you are enrolled as a student, you will not drink alcohol, take illegal drugs, smoke, violate biblical teachings about sex, etc. The administration of the college doesn't believe that alcohol, drugs, or smoking are inherently sinful on their own, but they do want you to learn to live a disciplined, self-controlled life. And these rules also help to keep the campus a safe and healthy environment for everyone, so that you can be free from the distractions and dangers involved with those activities and focus on being trained for Christian service."

College Senior,5,"The dining hall has a cafeteria-style meals downstairs with a variety of healthy options, while upstairs you can get things like burgers, pizza, etc. On-campus students get to choose between a full meal plan or reduced meal plan, depending on their needs and preferences. You get a set number of meals per week, and you pay for meals by scanning your student ID card."
College Senior,5,"What they don't have in amenities, they more than make up for with the excellent Christian community."
College Senior,5,"The Bachelor of Theology is the highest degree you can achieve at Ozark. It is the longest, most rigorous, and most demanding of all the degrees. Only these students have the opportunity to address their fellow students and professors during their senior year at chapel. It is a great building block for those seeking a lifetime of biblical study either as a pastor, professor, or researcher."
College Senior,5,"If you need help, you can get it. They want you here."
College Junior,5,Living on campus was one of the best choices I've made. I made some of my best friends because I stayed in the dorms

College Freshman,5,"I have really been so blessed to come to Ozark. The atmosphere, people, professors, and academic work is all so worth it. I have grown so much in my walk with Christ and I will always be so thankful for the opportunity to attend Ozark Christian College. To me, it's the best place to attend college. I adore it so much."
College Freshman,5,"It's a Bible College, they offer tons of Bible majors."

College Freshman,5,"I love football and that's the one sport we don't have, but the basketball, soccer, and volleyball events are really fun to attend."
College Freshman,5,"It's great. Joplin, MO has a ton of off-campus dining options and big cities like Kansas City, Springfield, and Tulsa are only a couple of hours away."
College Freshman,5,I have received enough financial aid because of my grades that I didn't have to pay a single penny my first semester. I've been very blessed to receive their help - and the help of the government.
College Freshman,5,"This is a ministry-based school. We love, learn about Jesus, serve our community, and pray a ton. Everything is based around our Savior - even the non-Biblical degrees such as nursing and teaching. The core of all degrees, classes, staff, students is Christianity."
College Freshman,5,"We are challenged a lot, but with Biblical majors I feel it's very necessary that we are because we want to know that what we're learning and Who (Christ) we are learning about it correct in order to better our future ministry. The work is hard, but it's incredibly useful and life-changing."
College Freshman,5,"The community on our campus if phenomenal. Everyone is so courteous and gentle to one another and I believe everyone who steps foot on our campus feels loved and at home. I absolutely adore my professors and fellow students. Most importantly, we're a community of believers and it's awesome to share our faith with one another and very easy to walk with one another and grow together in our faith. I love it!"

College Junior,5,Our physical plant staff are fantastic and clear the parking lots and campus in great time. 
College Junior,5,"Bar none our professors are the best! They care genuinely about the students, love them, and want to know them as well as guide them in Truth. "
College Junior,5,"Our college campus is strict, but in its strictness you learn that there is freedom. "
College Freshman,5,"I am not naive enough to believe that no one who attends my school does drugs or alcohol, but I do not know of anyone who does. Each student signs an agreement when they enroll, part of this agreement is to abstain from drugs and alcohol and most hold to this agreement very seriously. "
Alum,4,"I spent my four years for undergraduate education at this establishment. They care deeply about Biblical literacy, which is also near to my heart and family heritage. Very thankful for their commitment to that education."
Niche User,4,"Staff, professors, and students care about each other.  Really CARE! Community involvement is highly encourage, for staff and students.  Facilities have been recently upgraded.  On the edge of town."
Freshman,4,Overall it’s a fun college. My professor are very personable and are always encouraging. My dorm life is the highlight of my year. The friends I’ve  made here are incredibly kind people.
Freshman,4,Ozark is very focused on prepareing it’s student to serve God. The entire evironment is welcoming. The only thing that got a terrible rate on the questions below is the party scene. That’s is because our focus is on academics and living out a life for Jesus. I would like to see more diversity on campus. There is a little but it would be neat to see more.
Alum,4,Ozark is a wonderful Bible-based college. I have complete respect for their values and rules. It is a great environment to be in as a college Freshman!
College Freshman,4,The student body loves to show support of the sports teams.
College Sophomore,4,"We learn so much here. Most of what we learn is related to the Bible or ministry, so it is easy to be passionate about studies. The workload is a lot, but we learn so much."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms at Ozark are not known for being fancy. The rooms are functional. The physical property of the dorms are not the highlight of dorm life. The highlight of dorm life is the people. Dorm living keeps you surrounded by Christian community. On this small campus, the dorms are also close to everything."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, I don't care about sports. Other people do and that's great, I just never have. That being said, what I know about the athletic department is that teams are a great opportunity for community. I have never been to a game, so I don't know what game attendance is like."
College Freshman,4,"Ozark provides a fantastic dorm atmosphere. The encourage positive community and allow students time to interact. My only issue would be the age of the dorms. They, probably, should have been updated 10 years ago."
College Junior,4,"The workload is difficult, but our professors know that we are capable of doing great work. They will not give us anything that we can not handle. They want our success to show."
College Junior,4,"There are men's and women's basketball and cross country, but there should also be men and women's soccer. Currently, there are only mens."
College Junior,4,Ozark is a great school and is the perfect place to be!
College Senior,4,"We have men's basketball and soccer, women's basketball and volleyball, and they just started up co-ed cross country. There are always people playing pick-up basketball and ultimate frisbee, as well as intramural volleyball, ultimate, and basketball. As for facilities, we have an indoor basketball/volleyball court, outdoor basketball court, soccer field, disc golf course, tennis court, and a small weight room with a couple of cardio machines. Athletics are a fun and healthy opportunity for students and staff to participate in, but our commitment to training for Christian service always takes priority."
College Senior,4,"Here, an A is a 95 or above. You have to work very hard if you want to do well. They ask a lot. You will read lots of books, take many tests, and be challenged in every area of worldview, biblical studies, and theology."
College Senior,4,"It's a Bible college, if you don't like to obey the instructions that are placed before you, then you probably aren't looking to come here anyway."
College Senior,4,Anything you could ask for.
College Senior,4,"Students are just like students everywhere else, just with a different focus/drive than most."
College Junior,4,"The workers in the financial aid department made sure that I was taken care of. If you need help, they are more than willing to do something if you just ask"
College Junior,4,The strictness is required at a Christian school.  It helps us to stand firm in what we claim to believe

College Student,4,I like having the stricter setting
College Student,4,"Campus life is great, the dorm parents are strict."

College Junior,4,Living on campus is the most wonderful opportunity to meet wonderful brothers and sisters and to create a sense of community that enhances your learning experience! 
College Freshman,4,"Parking spots can be hard to find because of the small size of our campus with a growing student body. most of the time, however, even inconvenient parking spaces are not too far from the dorm or classes. There is no cost for parking and only a sticker on the back of your car is needed to save one from getting a ticket."
College Freshman,4,"My school feels secure. Because we are a christian college, people tend to respect each other and abstain from activities that may harm or hurt others. As a precaution, all the dorms are locked and a school id card is necessary to enter. There is also on campus security that we are able to call at any time if we have concerns. "
College Freshman,4,My favorite experience at my school is learning about life from my professors. My school is unique in that they actually care about each and every student. No one is left with out help that needs it.
College Freshman,4,"The psychology and counseling major at my school is excellent. We have great teachers heading up the degree program who are willing to work with you to give you the best understanding of psychology and counseling. The workload is heavier than average, but it is worth it. job opportunities are the only downside of this degree. It is absolutely necessary to have more schooling after getting this degree to have any sort of career as a counselor out side of the church."
College Freshman,4,"The dining hall has a cafeteria downstairs and fast food type options upstairs. Salad and fruit and vegetables are always available. every student on campus student is required to pay at the beginning of the year for 7 to 13 meals a week in the dining hall. The dining hall has several options, and the food is always fresh and unique. "
College Freshman,4,"Joplin Missouri at surface level is not extremely appealing. It is a pretty average town in Midwest Missouri. However upon some exploration there are several great trails and parks with beautiful scenery. Arkansas is only a couple hours away with even more options for hiking. Joplin has plenty of options for food and recreation and shopping, however if one finds the available stores unsatisfactory, Kansas city is only 2 hours away and Springfield is only 1 hour. Joplin is safe, and is the perfect balance between a boring small town and an overwhelming city."
College Senior,4,Off Campus Housing is really cheap and very easy to get into
College Senior,4,Basketball and volleyball are the only sports offered at school thus far. Both are exceptional
College Freshman,4,This is a Bible College. You are required to wear pants to all of your classes but can then change into shorts after class. Girls cannot wear short- shorts. This is a dry campus (duh) so do not drink.
College Freshman,4,There is a good variety for all types of international foods as well as the American classics.
College Freshman,4,Everyone here is here for a specific purpose and all are here for Christ so everyone here has a heart for people. There are a variety of personalities though between the specific people. The guys are mostly athletic and the girls enjoy sports also. Intramural teams are always fun.
College Freshman,4,"We have an excellent leader in this department. Also, there have not been any crimes since I have been here. I never have to worry about my safety."
College Student,4,"The employees in the business office are fantastic at working with you in order to figure out the best financial plan for you. when it comes to scholarships, there are not much variety but they definitely use what they do have very effectively."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on our campus.  However, I rarely see the campus police.  There is not a real need for them, though."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in Ozark Christian College and I love the program that I am in.
The workload can get overwhelming at first but it does not take long to be able to overcome in. You must teach yourself to do your homework befor hand and not last minute though or you will most likely not get it done. 
In my program there are several oppurtunities to learn hands on and there are several mission trips offered throughout the school year. Also, going to the Internation Conference on Missions is offered as a credit hours. 
The teachers are easy to get ahold of and make it obvious that they care. Several time I have been asked if I had any prayer requests and even more often have been told that my teachers were praying for me."
College Freshman,4,home cooked meal downstairs and fast food upstairs
College Senior,4,I think they have an exceptional cafe for so many students!
College Senior,4,"Being that Ozark is a Christian College, it doesn't have much in the way of a ""traditional"" college nightlife."
College Senior,4,"The real draw of Ozark's student life is not in the party scene or in the student organizations. The real draw to living on campus at Ozark is being part of a community that truly cares about you. The dorms are gender specific, with students of the opposite gender not allowed past the lobby. This helps to create a more tight knit group of men on your dorm floor. Also, being a Christian college, it is great to know that the entire school is ultimately working toward the same goal: spreading the message of Christ."
College Junior,4,"Ozark Christian College is very strict, especially when compared to other colleges.  No drinking is not allowed even if it is off campus and drugs are an absolute no-no.  However, for me this is what I like  and how I prefer it.  Ozark Christian College is also pretty strict when it comes to the dress code.  Perhaps they are aiming for the professional look."
College Junior,4,"There is always somone or some group that is doing something that you can join in with.  Ozark Christian College is  remodeling the dorm lobbies right now, but they are cozy none the less.  There is not much to do late at night, but plenty during the day!"
College Junior,4,"Ozark Christian College is a school with an absolutely amazing, positive environment. The people are friendly and willing to help anyone in need."
College Freshman,4,Labs Are Used Often – We have one main computer lab that is extremely helpful at Ozark Christian College. It has more than enough computers for use. The labs are never quite crowded but you can always find someone there. The lab is important for each and every student because of certain software the computers have that help with our bible classes.
College Student,4,"Everything That's Needed – The facilities on campus are clean and updated. The Dining Hall was just recently renovated providing more space for preparing food and for eating. The Multiple Purpose Building has a new gym floor, a weight room that is expanding every year and a hallway devoted entirely to the history of OCC. The student center just updated their two TVs to new big screen HD TVs with more channel options than ever before. The library is the best in town, with plenty of resources for any projects assigned by the professors. The book store is heavily stocked with all the required books and filled with helpful and friendly staff. Dorm life is set up in such a way that community flourishes and strong relationships are forged easily. OCC has varsity baseball, volleyball, and basketball, and plenty of intramural sports to keep everyone involved athletically."
College Sophomore,4,The facilities at Ozark are convenient.  The only problem is that they aren't open very late.
College Freshman,4,"Pretty Solid – The food is pretty good, but it is still a college cafeteria. The alternative on campus is pretty tasty, though not the healthiest."
College Freshman,4,"Girls Are Respectable – The guys are down to earth southern boys. The girls are ladies, with respect and maturity in abundance."
College Freshman,4,Pretty Well Safe – I never feel unsafe when I'm on Ozark's campus. We always have our security gaurds out. Our doors are locked from the outside so that anyone without a card cannot come in.
College Freshman,4,"Unique Areas of Study--Sign Language – I chose to go to Ozark Christian College because they are one of the few colleges that have a major not in sign language studies or interpretation, but in Deaf ministry, and also a strong emphasis on Bible too. The teacher(s) involved with this department are really great and taught me a lot not just in the classroom, but outside the classroom too and on trips to Deaf schools and Deaf activities and events."
College Senior,2,"Not great at sports, but they are there for the enjoyment of those who like to play soccer, volleyball, or basketball."
College Freshman,2,Our wifi is so bad because of all the students on it. I hope that they can improve it soon.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Your Own Car – If you don't have your own car, you are not going off campus unless you are willing to go for a rather extended walk."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Non Existant – outside of movie theatres, and a few late night restaroaunts, night life does not exist in Joplin, MO for most students. You have to make your own nightlife."
Recent Alumnus,2,"tHe school has a few athletic programs that are very good, womens Vollyball, soccer, and basketball. Mens Soccer, Basketball, Baseball. They need to expand thier sports program terribly, I tried to start a cross country team (virtually no cost to the school) but found nothing bust resistance."
Junior,1,The care and concern of professors and faculty is continuing to decline. There is specific price large given to those representing the school in athletics that allows them to not follow the rules that others are punished for.
Alum,1,Judgemental hypocrites that don't know how to mind their business.  The love of money is more important than the student.
College Senior,1,"The school just created a scholarship to promote ethnic diversity, so this should help."
College Freshman,1,"we do not have any on campus transportation. there are no buses or any type of public transportation that are not expensive. Students are good about helping each other out with transportation, however. It is not uncommon for one student to let another borrow their car, or for those from the same area to travel home together."
College Freshman,1,Where Is My Aid? It's very easy to walk and seek help on WHAT to do.. but i've not been ablt to recieve much financial aid like i hear from everything and everyone.

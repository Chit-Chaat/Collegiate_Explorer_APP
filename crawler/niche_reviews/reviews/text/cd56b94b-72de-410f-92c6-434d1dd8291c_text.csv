Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman so I have only taken the EVERFI courses and not had to take an actual class online in school yet.
Freshman,5,When I visited Piedmont at the begining of the year it was so beautiful and everyone there was supper nice and friendly.
Sophomore,5,Piedmont College offers a unique environment for students to pursue a higher education. The professors and staff strive to include every student and actually talk and get to know students. The classes at Piedmont are taught by professors that endeavor to present information in a thought provoking way to motivate students to approach their learning and assignments from different perspectives. Piedmont College engages students both in the classroom and through campus life. Students are encouraged to attend the numerous campus events organized by the various clubs and organizations on campus. The college even offers day trips to get off campus and explore the local area with faculty and other students. Students can also attend the athletic events on campus that cultivate school spirit and camaraderie that transfers to the classrooms and everyday life on campus. Piedmont College is perfect for individuals that prefer a small college that still offers a unique college experience.
Junior,5,In March we had to switch to an online platform. The professors made the switch flawlessly. I never felt like a lost any part of my education. Piedmont's online classes are easy to follow and very interactive with your professor.
Senior,5,We had online classes during Covid-19. They were structured very well and the expectations were clear. The school did a great job guiding the students and giving them the support needed during a hard time.
Senior,5,My overall experience at piedmont college has been nothing short of outstanding! The professors are kind and care about their students which is Generally hard to find.
Sophomore,5,"I like how everybody is so connected on and of campus. Everybody, there is so kind to one another and will help anyone in any way they can. An advantage of attending Piedmont is that over half of the students on campus are student-athletes. Knowing this, if you're into sports than Piedmont College loves Student-Athletes and they will help them by attending classes and playing the sport they love."
Freshman,5,"Everything about Piedmomt is warm and welcoming! My first year of college was exceptionally better than I anticipated. The process of enrolling to financial aid was all made easy by the staff at Piedmont. Every staff member always greets you with a smile and a helpful hand when you need it. The teachers go above and beyond to help out their students. The classroom setting is always filled with a great learning environment. The pace of the classes is just right. As an art student, I would like to brag on how well the art department puts everything together and constantly meets the needs of students. As a freshman, experiencing my first year on campus and at home due to the corona virus, went smoothly. Everyone worked diligently to satisfy the needs and learning environment needed to make it through the semester!"
Freshman,5,"When classes switched to online due to the corona virus, all the professor's worked diligently to satisfy the needs of students. The transition went smoothly. Even when teachers were not equipped to switch to online as they were campus classes, they did a wonderful job and allowed a great end to a testing semesters."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed the close knit community of the campus and education experience. I felt like I had support every step of my journey, and to leave campus was really like leaving my family. It encouraged me to be better, and I will never forget the kindness and inspiration I received."
Senior,5,"I transferred to Piedmont College as a Junior student after being accepted to their nursing program and I LOVE IT. I wish that I had begun my college experience at Piedmont. The campus is small enough to know just about everyone but big enough to include a variety of different interests, groups, and activities. The on campus housing at Piedmont is so nice and the food is delicious! My favorite part about Piedmont are the small classroom sizes and how much the professors really care about their students. Outside of class, I love attending sporting events. Piedmont  is perfectly located around mountains, lakes, and other outdoor adventures. I wouldn't change a thing about this school, except maybe the parking."
Junior,5,Piedmont is a very nice college. Staff and teachers really seem to care about your success at the school.
Junior,5,I love attending school at Piedmont College because the classroom settings are small and I can go to school around my work schedule. The professors are very helpful! I have really enjoyed my school journey so far.
Junior,5,Great experience!! Eve thing so far is GREAT! I’ve had great advisors. The professors I have had were wonderful and always willing to help or go the extra mile. The students and other staff are friendly!
Graduate Student,5,"I am in my first semester of Graduate School at Piedmont College, and so far, my experience has been wonderful.  The professors are knowledgable, the classes are informative, and my classmates are eager to learn.  I am taking classes both at the Athens campus as well as online, and the facilities are excellent, especially considering the Athens campus is not the main location.  I have been impressed by the faculty and staff since the beginning of the application process. Every time I had a question, I was greeted over the phone by a cheerful, helpful employee who was ready to help.  Great overall place to obtain either undergraduate or graduate degrees!"
Niche User,5,The staff and students are very friendly and welcoming. The campus is small but not too small and is very pretty. It's in a little town that looks historic and gives you a good vibe.
Senior,5,"Small school with a lot of opportunities. Sports, arts, and activities are all available. Lot of potential for students here!"
Senior,5,"Piedmont College offers various 4 year degrees. They are known for their fantastic programs in Music, Biology, and Nursing, among other things."
Graduate Student,5,Piedmont is very accommodating for working professionals.  The professors are either still working in the field or recently retired.  They provide great insight and knowledge of the content due to their doctorate level of education and experiences.
Junior,5,"I love the english and art programs, and some of the classes in the theatre department are pretty cool even if that’s not your major."
Junior,5,"I have just started my journey with Piedmont College as a nursing student. All of the faculty and staff has been nothing less than amazing. They have been supportive all the way through, and made sure I was set up for success. All of my professors during orientation and the first day of class have been thorough and clear with what they expect. I would recommend this college to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"Piedmont College is a small college with so many opportunities to grow. Professors and advisors are always available to help.  There is no appointment necessary. 
The school always puts you first. You are not a number."
Sophomore,5,"I like that is small, we are community here and the professors truly care. The campus is small but we are mighty. WE have one of the best nursing programs in the state and we send people to med school law school and even to study a broad. We get free torturing sessions, and not just by other students by professors too. IT is a gorgeous campus with really good dorms with RA's that care."
Freshman,5,excellent small private college with friendly helpful staff excellent food and nice dorms plus new friends made this fall
Freshman,5,I liked everything about Piedmont everyone is so kind and caring and they make sure you're doing ok and start a conversation they connect quickly with families.
Alum,5,Its a small campus with a true family feel where the professors and staff know you by name and know all about your plans and goals- and want to help. Great atmosphere and resources.
Sophomore,5,I am currently a new student and I really enjoy the Athens Campus atmosphere. The staff and professors really make it fun and easy to learn.
Freshman,5,"So far as a Freshman I've enjoyed dealing with the staff especially on a one to one basis,  living on Campus make me feel like a responsible adult, the Track & Field here is so different than high school, more advanced but that's what I like, Challenge."
College Sophomore,5,I would do it all over again and choose this school.  I would have went to this school before I went to a technical school.
College Sophomore,5,I don't know much about the quality of the degree or how easy it is to get a job with a degree from my school.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and think I'll stay until I graduate. I would even consider the Masters programs my school offers.
College Sophomore,5,I haven't seen or heard of any issues.
College Sophomore,5,I have not experienced any crime at this school and the campus police makes me feel very secure.
College Sophomore,5,Coaches as well as trainers take wonderful care of the student-athletes.
College Sophomore,5,"The professor are very concerned about the students success, as well as the coaches. We have a very family-like atmosphere, where everybody knows everybody. It is an absolutely amazing experience."
College Freshman,5,There is no crime on the Athens Piedmont campus and security is always patrolling. The security is nice and provides a safe environment for the students.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are definitely accommodating and care about their students passing their classes. There is somewhat of a variety of courses and classes are very small. This is for the Athens campus though, I am not sure about the Demorest campus."
College Junior,5,Many classes by different professors are offered.
College Junior,5,I have loved every professor I've had. Class sizes are small. The professors know their stuff.
College Sophomore,5,"Piedmont College has been a fantastic experience for me so far. I love the small class size and the atmosphere. The professors are very good at what they do. I am a student-athlete on the tennis team and I love being able to do that. I am also the president of FCA on campus and being involved in that is extremely rewarding. I am a member of the SAAC organization for student-athletes. If I had to do it all over again, I would without a doubt pick Piedmont College again."
College Junior,5,"I'm going to college for a lower cost than my private high-school education. If you're a decent student, PC will work with you to afford the cost of college."
College Senior,5,My overall experience was great.  I have no complaints.  Piedmont College faculty and staff care about the individual student and when conferring with you  they make you feel as if you are the only one they have on their radar at that moment.
College Senior,5,My school has a small family type atmosphere.  The academic programs are rigorous with a lot of writing involved.  I cannot comment on the social scene because I am not there for that.
College Senior,5,The campus is clean and beautiful.  I attend evening classes and I am a graduate student that does not partake in all of the amenities available on campus.
College Senior,5,I am a graduate student and I did not have any scholarships.
College Senior,5,"I am having a wonderful experience.  Piedmont professors are very professional, friendly, and caring.  They want all students to learn the content and have a successful college experience and they work hard to help the students achieve their goals."
College Senior,5,My major is Middle Grades Science and Mathematics.  The program is rigorous but the professors are very helpful and have convenient office hours and are always available by phone to aid their students.
College Senior,5,As far as I can tell everyone is treated fairly with respect to all of the diversity issues.
College Freshman,5,Love going to restaurants in Athens! There is literally an endless amount of options!
College Freshman,5,"Parking is easy! I was really excited when I found out that it's free. It can get congested at the times when most classes are in session, but I've never had to park outside of the parking lot, just further away from the building."
College Freshman,5,"Since I am at the Athens Campus, there is always something to do no matter who you are! There are many ways to find what interests you the most. Lots of fun!"
College Freshman,5,"I go to school at the Athens Campus, and I have never seen any drug/alcohol usage."
College Sophomore,5,The school doesn't help with looking for off campus housing. There are very few options. The apartments I am staying in is about 20 min from campus and they are beautiful! 
College Junior,5,there is a strict drug policy and the school enforces it.
College Junior,5,"We have a lot of computer labs on campus, though they are not always available due to classes.  Once classes are over for the day though, or during the times that classes don't use the labs, they're great places to get some work done.  The library has lots of computers, as well as places to use your laptops, and I'm pretty sure every academic building has at least one computer lab.  The computers usually work very well, too.  One might have an issue every now and then, but they're computers, it happens."
College Freshman,5,Parking is located right in front of the building. Classes have already started and I can always find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,5,"It's great, but it really depends on the students if they are willing to put there time into studying. It doesn't matter what kind of professor you get they all have their own way of teaching. As long as you study you should do fine in class."
College Sophomore,5,I never really found or see any bad students or teachers. I feel really safe at Piedmont College.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is in Habersham County. There is very little crime here, so most students feel extremely safe. Students will leave their doors unlocked or their phones and wallets sitting alone in the dining hall, and I have never heard of anyone complaining about something being stolen."
College Sophomore,5,"Athens is a medium sized college town, home of the University of Georgia.  There are a lot of restaurants and shopping areas in close proximity to the Piedmont Campus."
Alum,4,I did not take online classes at Piedmont College. I was a student when there were in person classes on campus.
Alum,4,"Piedmont College is a great small, liberal arts college in the mountains of North Georgia. I and many of my fellow alumni had immediate success in the job market after graduating from Piedmont. Piedmont is a small school and I was able to have one-on-one support and meetings with my professors. The smallest class I was in was 3, and the largest was 30. The mass communications department is excellent. 

Campus life when I was there could have been better. There were not a lot of activities for students to do on the weekend on campus, except for athletics. The dorms for freshmen were old, but the newer dorms for upperclassmen were excellent and we had our own rooms after freshman year. Now they have built an impressive student center and have a lot more dorms, including apartment-style."
Sophomore,4,"Piedmont College is wonderful especially if you are looking for a family atmosphere. The small class sizes are helpful in developing your knowledge. The faculty/staff are so helpful in ensuring that not only are gaining information but also becoming a better person. Everyone is super friendly and kind. The school cares and willing to take feedback from students to make the experience better. The campus is the perfect walking size, and there is no need for a car. Whether you are interested in the arts or athletics or something in between there is a program or club for you. Safety is important, and Piedmont College understands this. The campus police are kind but super helpful. You can see them riding around campus throughout the day. Most importantly Piedmont College is inclusive and their goal is that everyone is included and welcome regardless of their background. The school does not stand for any kind of discriminatory behavior."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed all of my professors. Since classes are small they get to know you personally. You can tell they truly care. All my professors have been able for extra help and they want to see you exceed.
Sophomore,4,"I took classes online during the outbreak of Covid-19. The professors at Piedmont prior to transferring to online learning went through a week long training course to ensure students were able to still receive their education as if they were back in the classroom. Professors took the change in stride and presented relevant information to fulfill the requirements of each class. Teachers were also able to provide helpful links and websites they previously had not offered when the class was taught in a traditional classroom setting. The professors were able to use the the online learning forum that the entire college uses to post the various assignments students needed to complete. This allowed for students to have easy access to their assignments, which made completing assignments easier. Overall, Piedmont's transition to online learning went better than expected allowing for students to still receive their education during the Covid-19 shutdown."
Junior,4,Piedmont is an incredible school for anyone looking to work hard and work towards their degree. This is not a party school with a huge campus life. There are very diverse classrooms with students of all ages and stages in life. The class sizes are small and the professors are always available. Piedmont is a college that wants their students to succeed.
Sophomore,4,The school is great. It feels like a family and they work hard to make you feel included in everything. They want to make sure you do well and succeed.
Sophomore,4,Piedmont College did amazing by helping us students with our classes and putting all of us online. they made it possible for us to learn all of the material that was need to learn and finish the semester on time. Piedmont College is good at coming back when the situation is bad.
Freshman,4,I love the smallness of the school and the teachers are very polite. I love the scenery as well it is a beautiful campus. I also love the mall class sizes.
Junior,4,"I am currently a Junior at Piedmont College, and I can say with conviction that Piedmont has been an excellent stepping stone on my path to a successful career.  Piedmont possesses a top-notch group of instructors, who will go the extra mile to ensure that students are critically thinking and effectively learning the course material.  What I would like to see Piedmont do is potentially invest in creating cleaner dorm rooms, healthier cafeteria options, and more intramural sporting events."
Freshman,4,You become close to the professors and community. The school is very student-driven and encourages involvement on and off-campus. I would like to see bigger dorms and bigger facilities in the future.
Freshman,4,Piedmont College is a great school. The professors are good. Class sizes are small which makes it easier to interact and get individual help.
Sophomore,4,Piedmont College is a great school. The teachers and every one around you are willing to help you succeed in school. It is basically my second home.
Freshman,4,"Piedmont College is small, but well connected. The professors are friendly and genuinely care about the individual students.

Their use of online programs for better connection between students, and their use of the Canvas system in order to help keep the students and teachers in a clear understanding of grades and assignments is easy to understand and very helpful. I especially appreciate the online student planning they use. Its clear and easy to navigate. The only critique I would have in this department is that there are four different programs the school operates through for different functions. This would not be as much of a problem if they were all clearly linked on a main website. 

As for student worker positions, you are very likely to get a job at the school if you apply on time. Even mid-term applications are possible on some parts of the campus."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman and have had trouble with academics because of professors but other than that I love it. Very expensive though.
Senior,4,Piedmont College is a wonderful institution. For students wanting a small class setting it is the perfect school.
Sophomore,4,"I like Piedmont College because the people who work there truly care about you, not only do they want to meet your academic needs, but your mental, physical, and personal needs as well. I also love that the classes are smaller (like high school) and there is more opportunity for one on one time with the professor."
Freshman,4,The staff and professors are extremely nice and want students to succeed. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. The faucilities are nice as well.
Freshman,4,"Overall, i think Piedmont College is a great school. The small classes make it very easy to make friends and be comfortable talking with your professors."
Junior,4,"I like how small it is. The professors know you by name and they are always available to discuss things during office hours. I hate how expensive it is, but they do offer many financial aid options."
Niche User,4,"As a Move On When Ready student, I see Piedmont College from a much different lens than a normal college student. I can't speak much to the financial soundness nor campus life of Piedmont, but my professors have been quirky and honest, and my advisor was both patient and proactive when addressing my concerns."
Sophomore,4,"Piedmont College is an outstanding school. Their push for students to really learn is the most important thing at Piedmont. Teachers are amazing and always I mean always willing to work with the students despite the circumstances. This school is not a big school, but it is large enough for one to get their fitbit steps in!"
College Sophomore,4,I do feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,the admissions office did a wonderful job.
College Sophomore,4,the size of the gym is nice.
College Sophomore,4,"The freshman buildings are out-of-date and the parking around campus overall is awful, but other than that it's okay."
College Sophomore,4,I don't play sports here but I have a feeling that it's one of the many reasons we have out-of-state students.
College Sophomore,4,The only problem that I have run into at my school is the terrible organization of the Financial Aid department.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy most of my courses and the course offer is pretty good. The only bad thing is that because of the small size of the school, not every course can or will be offered every semester, which requires students to plan very well."
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard that Piedmont provides great job opportunities for future graduates. Also, the school is very willing to provide information and help on receiving jobs and internships around the College."
College Sophomore,4,"The buildings might not be the newest or most modern, but the atmosphere on campus makes up for it."
College Freshman,4,"There are several student jobs, however not many internships."
College Freshman,4,"The Piedmont campus in Athens does not have any sports, however they do have a gym for students to participate in as well as activities, such as yoga and basketball, to engage healthy living. The campus in Demorest however has tons of sports and the amount of student involvement is quite large."
College Junior,4,Campus PO is always patrolling.
College Junior,4,The professors sometimes forget it's hard being an athlete and student but other than that it's an awesome school and some teachers keep in mind we have jobs and sports.
College Junior,4,Since we do not have a football team every other team is important and all other teams are super supportive of one another.
College Junior,4,I have no complaints reguarding the academics. They are great.
College Junior,4,We don't have any health services but I've always felt safe and secure walking around at 2:00 AM
College Junior,4,I was quickly accepted back into school after being away for some time and it was so smooth and awesome
College Senior,4,"I love that classes are small.  Teachers really do care about each student.  I've never felt like I was just a number, that's how I think it feels and huge universities and community colleges"
College Sophomore,4,Lots of chain restaurants offer discounts. There are also tons of local and family owned places that are great
College Sophomore,4,Piedmont is generally very good at adhering to the rules in the handbook
College Sophomore,4,I was offered academic based financial aid and accepting it was a very simple process.
College Junior,4,"Everything is convenience for my purpose, there no means of housing, but there are apartments located close to the school"
College Junior,4,"Very comfortable atmosphere for students, study aid and study places are easily available."
College Junior,4,The professors are very nice and willing to work with you to make your career a success
College Junior,4,The degree prepares you for the transfer to a four year university.
College Junior,4,"The social scene at Piedmont is highly activity-related: i.e., athletes hang out with their teams; musicians, with their friends; actors, with theirs, etc, etc. However, our academics are highly student-oriented, with small class sizes that I myself have benefited from. Moreover, there is always something to do on campus: an athletic event, intramural event, hiking trip, etc."
College Junior,4,"While our cafeteria and fitness center are currently sub-par, our athletics facilities, library, academic buildings, and outdoor spaces are beautiful. Our new student center that will be opened in Fall 2014-Spring 2015 will be state-of-the-art."
College Senior,4,Athletics is a great part of the Piedmont College but Academics is still the most important focus.
College Senior,4,I have never had any problems.  The security team is always alert and attentive.
College Senior,4,"The main campus is in Demorest, Georgia which is located in the Blue Ridge Mountain region of Georgia.  The climate is mild and the scenery is beautiful.  Demorest is a small town with friendly people and Piedmont College is in the center.  Demorest is located between Cornelia and Clarksville.  Restaurants in these areas range from family style to fine dining.  Shopping centers are numerous in the area."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of awesome people with awesome personalities. I've met some of the best people I know at Piedmont, however because we all commute, we only hang out when we are at school/waiting for a class."
College Junior,4,"The weather is nice, we are surrounded by mountains"
College Junior,4,Our school is private and most people do not partake in drug activity.
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is willing to work with you no matter what.
College Junior,4,It is a small town. There are many moutains around us.
College Junior,4,"The campus safety at our school is good. We have cameras in every dorm, and the are watched 24/7."
College Sophomore,4,As far as I know there haven't been any issues with safety or crime
College Sophomore,4,I am a biology major - the profs are very supportive - since it is a small school they are very involved in helping you achieve your goal - workload isn't too bad - the class sizes are small and personal - good curriculum
Sophomore,2,College does not seem to care for the student. Money is their only concern. Most professors are not caring.
College Junior,2,"I pay how much every year to live in a run down century old dorm building that has bad plumbing, heaters that rarely work, and poor insulation?"
College Freshman,2,"I have been in many classes where the teacher had trouble lecturing because of the information in their lecture that was based on the internet. The internet is SLOW, and it has been brought to the school's attention many times. There is no set wifi for students to connect to. While there are school networks, they are protected by a password that is not given to students. There is a network that does not require a password, but it is not reliable at all."
College Sophomore,2,I think they are too strict about the visitation in dorms - causes people to sneak around and break rules - we're not little kids anymore and should be able to make those decisions
College Sophomore,2,I have only ate there once. It is small and not many choices. The food was okay. 
College Junior,2,"It not bad, there are lesser number of blacks especially in the nursing program. As for the school as a whole, the school has less blacks, Asians, Chinese, and Native Americans."
College Junior,2,there is no nightlife at a private college in the middle of no where.
College Junior,2,There is never enough parking and we need an additional parking deck for the amount of students.
College Junior,2,There are very little computer labs available especially during finals week. They only allow you to print 500 copies a semester and thats not much when you are a nursing student.
College Junior,2,There is very little off campus housing. You have to find it on your own.
College Freshman,2,There are not any public transportation buses or taxies in this area because of it being such a small town 
College Senior,2,"Piedmont is in a small town with not much to do for the college students. However, the city has slowly acclimated to the growing student population and is starting to build attractions to suite the teen and young-adult populace."
College Junior,2,Very random weather. Most of the school year it will go from 80 and sunny to 50 and cloudy or rainy in a day. Usually one major snowfall a year.
College Senior,2,"Off-Campus Living: Not Worth the Hassle – Demorest and its neighboring towns are small. There are not many apartments or homes for rent that are student-friendly. The best part of living off-campus is the availability of a kitchen and the parking at the college. Other than this, it's better to stay on campus and keep your on-campus scholarships."
College Senior,2,"Hitchiking Is a Must – Unless you own a car or know someone that does, good luck getting anywhere off campus. At least the school provides minimum seating transport for school sponsored events."
College Senior,2,"The ""Caf"" is actually quite nice. I wish it had more tables and stations because it gets really crowded around lunch. Sometimes the food has good variety but other times you can never tell what you're eating till you taste it. It seems that they're focusing too much on variety but they need to step back and go back to basic foods that people like and maybe throw in variety here and there."
College Senior,2,The only people that really have internships are the nursing students and education students. I wish there were more provided for other majors.
College Sophomore,2,Few options... some discounts... but travel 45 mins. away to the city are great restaurant options!
Freshman,1,This college is small and terrible. The classes are not challenging and they are extremely boring. I feel like I'm throwing away money by going here. Please do not go here! You will regret it. I've only been here for one semester and I already want to transfer!
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have Greek Life, which is one of the many reasons I chose this school."
College Junior,1,"no special housing available, but would welcome the change"
College Freshman,1,There is no night-life at the Athens campus
College Freshman,1,We don't have one at the Athens campus.
College Junior,1,Haven't Seen It – I have seen a lack of greek life since I have been here.
College Junior,1,"Take a Drive – No places to party within an hour's drive, minus an occasional cabin party. Most people go to Athens to party, which is an hour away. Police forces are strict around campus and surrounding counties, and they have been known to bust parties. Many students get arrested or cited for alcohol."
College Senior,1,"Everywhere you look there are southern Caucasians. There are a handful of people that don't fit that description, but at least there seems to be very little racism in such a rural part of Georgia."
College Senior,1,"The dorms here are not that great at all. The freshman dorms are GB and Purcell and they are disgusting and old. The only nice dorms that we have are Mayflower, New Bedford, and Plymouth. That's because they aren't as old as the others. Wallace is probably one of the worst dorms on campus. It is infested with mold and students are constantly sick here and there. GB and Purcell are also infested with mold along with Swanson and Johnson. The rooms are quite spacious and we are all given a large fridge and microwave. The stuff that is provided for us is nice but the condition of the room isn't. We pay a lot of money to live here and we feel that we aren't getting out money's worth. The social atmosphere is nice but most people stick to their groups like theater majors, education, nursing, athletes, etc."
College Freshman,1,Piedmont does not have any sororities or fraternities.
College Freshman,1,The freshmen dorms are horrible but for the females its a five minute or less walk to classes. Only the upperclassmen get the good dorms. Majority of the dorms need to be rebuilt.

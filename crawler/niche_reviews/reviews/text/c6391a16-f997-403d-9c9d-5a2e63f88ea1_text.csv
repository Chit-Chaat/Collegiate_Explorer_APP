Freshman,5,Digipen is the type of school where you don't go for the college experience. You go to learn. Everyone who attends is super passionate about their degree and overall its a great environment to study in. Also your time at Digipen will simulate what it will be like to get a job in your degree field.
Freshman,5,"DigiPen has such a diverse set of people that are all incredibly helpful because everyone is here for the common purpose of becoming the best that one can be. Because of the smaller numbers of students, there are many faculty members and teachers that have time to address students one on one, as well as having more attention from each teacher in different classes. With additional help from school supplied and paid for tutors, everyone has the opportunity to make sure they are caught up with all of their work. The only downside being, because it is a very goal oriented school that is focused on teaching their students the material needed to be the best, there are no sports teams or anything of that sort, however, there are many clubs ran by students that are free to join at any time, so those make up for the lack of sports teams."
Niche User,5,"I've not started yet, but I have peers who attend that love this university. It's difficult but rewarding."
Freshman,5,DigiPen is a bit expensive but well worth the cost. There is great diversity throughout the school and the community. You will find that the teachers truly care about their students rather than you just being another one of the numbers. The school is very focused on the degree program that you are working on.
Junior,5,The teachers are fantastic! Most are industry veterans and not only pass on their knowledge of the subject but offer real world experience on topics as well.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone from the students to the faculty are really helpful and friendly. I feel like I'm learning a lot of things that will help me in my career. I'm so happy to be a part of this community.
Niche User,5,"This institute focuses on what I want to do for a career since I was five. To become a game artist and create my artwork on a professional level. To develop my foundation skills that would be needed for the different types of medium and technology. To be able to let my imagination be free in this kind of career when I participated in their four-week summer program project fun. I got to experience what the students learn and do in DigiPen. 
I don’t see anything to change about this institution because to me I really look forward to attending DigiPen."
Junior,5,"The teachers are amazing, and the curriculum is spectacular. I am a BFA student and they will force you to learn, get good, and then become exceptional in your skillset. 

The bad is they will work you really hard. You need to commit all or nearly all of your time to doing homework and school can be extremely stressful and panic inducing."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE DigiPen. I am a freshman BFA there, and it has really become home. It is truly made for people of all ages who have a dream and are willing to go the extra mile to make it happen. You meet so many great people, and learn to spend almost all your time there. The teachers are amazing  and genuinely care about your progress, the classes are truly geared toward your degree, and no body throws parties because everyone is just too busy, though we do have select special events where we can all gather and just hang out, which is amazing. The work load is definitely prominent though, and I've seen a number of people under estimate it. But, if you can get past DigiPen, you can get past ANYTHING handed to you, in your field, in the real world. Best choice of my life, so far, to come here."
Freshman,5,"The campus is not the typical large college but rather in an office building of sorts with three levels which makes navigating and getting to class very easy. The teachers are laid back, willing to get to know you, answer questions and touch base if you have any concerns.

The work load is tense, much more than the typical college experience and will be a constant thing to remember when it comes to work but at the same time, this is preparing you for the workforce, meeting deadlines and staying motivated. You get to know everyone eventually.

The staff are dedicated and friendly - when living in the dorms you get to meet your RA's who set up weekly to monthly events and the university itself is very driven by holding events and getting everyone together.

The price of attending here is expensive, but considering the result that you get out of it, it is worth the effort."
Sophomore,5,Very up to date on their information for students going in their respective feilds. Teachers are willing to help and has a great atmosphere for students.
Senior,5,"Digipen overall is a fantastic school. The professors and administration are all great. Of course, like any school it has its pros and cons, but everyone at this school is dedicated to achieving its goal. The cafe is wonderful, the connection opportunities the school provides you with are insanely fantastic, it's lived up to all the expectations I've had for it and I'm glad I am going."
Freshman,5,"Being at DigiPen Institute of Technology is like stepping into another world. It's different from most colleges because you are learning your degree right from the beginning, and you're treated as an equal among your peers and professors. If you get stuck, there is always someone around who can help you or point you in the right direction for help. The campus is very diverse, with people from all walks of life, and the faculty and students take great steps to make sure that everyone feels welcome."
College Freshman,5,"As a student who is specializing in audio, it is very interesting how my course sequence has been laid out. Just this year, I took a class about writing a synthesizer using code. It was an amazing experience. We get access to some of the best audio technology in a special room filled with music equipment, it's great."
College Freshman,5,"DigiPen has taught me more in one year, than I had learned in my four years of high school. The school is constantly trying to be better than it already is, and constantly evolves with the industry. Everything you learn is closely related to what employers are looking for today. DigiPen by far is the best school!"
College Student,5,"From what I've heard, they will be excellent. They really know what sorts of advice a student of that age would need, as well as plenty of connections and resources."
College Student,5,"According to past alumni, it's very easy to get a job straight out of school, as well as internships while still attending. There are many of the top companies employing from here, as well as doing guest speaking sessions and such. Not to mention a wide variety of career fairs and very supportive career counselors."
College Student,5,"So far, I've had limited experience with the school. I've seen and read many things as well as visited the campus itself. The environment seemed just right for what I was looking for and the intensity of the workload, as described by the current students, will be an enjoyable challenge."
College Freshman,5,"Like I said before, it's actually difficult. The classes are enjoyable and the professors are amazing. Everything is pertinent to what I want to do after college."
College Freshman,5,"For once, classes that claimed to be difficult legitimately challenged me. I actually enjoyed the lectures because we didn't constantly go back and re-explain things - teachers helped students outside of lectures, not in the middle of them. I also enjoyed having classes that revolved around what I want to do with my life as opposed to a pile of English classes simply because it's state law."
College Sophomore,5,Professors at this school are extraordinary. They go out of their way to make sure students are doing the best they possibly can. Most of them are easy to talk to and will take time out of their day just to make sure that the student is pushing out their best work.
College Sophomore,5,It's the only school that gets anywhere close to what the industry is like. You will be a top pick for any and all companies because of the simple fact that you graduated from Digipen.
College Freshman,5,"I like the staff there, they are kind and very helpful. The courses seem to be challenging but helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is very demanding but the professors are have great industry experience.  The computer science degree requires 154 credit hours, so that averages out to about 19 credit hours per semester compared to 15 at other universities.  In the fall and spring, Digipen students put on a zombie outbreak event where students are divided into humans and zombies and battle it out for a week - it's a great spirit event!  I'm gearing up for my second year and, unfortunately, most of my friends from freshmen year are not returning - it's that difficult!  But I feel like I've learned a ton more here in the past year than I would anywhere else.  We were already learning C++ in my second semester; that isn't even touched on until sophomore year in other universities."
College Freshman,5,"The students are (for the most part) similar minded. A lot of the professors are fun to talk to, but also know a ton about their fields."
College Freshman,5,"From what I've heard from upperclassmen, students are basically ""snatched up"" as soon as they graduate."
College Freshman,5,"Basically everyone is geeky (into games, comics, etc), and we're very diverse. Everyone who stays gets along extremely well."
College Sophomore,5,"There's the Academic Support Center for tutoring, resources and guidance."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience here at this school was hard and excruciating difficult. Not because of the professors, but the curriculum. As long as you are getting the material and can apply it, you will do fine."
College Sophomore,5,"Academics offered here at DigiPen include the Computer Science program, both science and art, Fine Arts and Animation, Music and Sound Design, and the Engineering program. Video Games is mostly associated with this school. As enrolled in the Fine Arts program, I get to meet Disney animators, renowned artists in figure drawing, painting, history, and anatomy. I'm sure I will get to meet more as I continue my career here. I already met the Photoshop and Maya 3D professors this summer, so who knows what other amazing professors I will meet this year. All of them are kind and they want to help their students get into the industry."
College Sophomore,5,"This is the school for me. Heavily focused in what I want to study and helps you find jobs after graduation. The workload for my program is more heavier than the other programs, so some students couldn't keep up and had to drop out. The curriculum can be customized to your liking, but most students choose the easy option, which is a pre-made schedule. The faculty is very friendly and accommodating to the student's needs. Recently, art students needed more space to work and the faculty ordered the construction of a third floor. There's plenty of internships posted in the hallways, such as Playstation, Microsoft, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"Small school with a bunch of people with similar interests?  You bet you'll make friends for life here, especially in the BAGD program, where teamwork is something you're graded on. The school is surprisingly diverse in spite of its small size. There is a sizable LGBT community, and a good portion of the student body is a first or second generate immigrant. The only place where diversity is lacking is gender. There is roughly one girl to every twenty guys, and most of the female students are in the art department, so you don't see much of them."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The university does many career fairs to allow students to show off their work to industry representatives. In addition, some of the project classes can be replaced by actual internships within a company. It's not unheard of for people to already have a job lined up well before they graduate.

Even still, the university keeps a posting of available jobs, both inside and outside of the university. These jobs can range from student jobs managing the bookstore to by third party contract programming jobs."
College Freshman,5,"The professors at DigiPen are fantastic. All professors have some form of industry experience and are extremely knowledgeable. It is easy to get in contact with professors and seek help outside of class, all you have to do is ask."
College Freshman,5,The BSCSGD program at DigiPen Institute of Technology is extremely challenging but also very rewarding. The amount of knowledge you gather within the first year alone is incredible. Probably the most useful part of my experience here at DigiPen is the experience working on a project team. This experience is useful no mater where you go after your education.
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't trade my experience here at DigiPen for anything in the world. I'm only a second-semester Freshman but this is where I belong, and I have no doubts about that. My professors deeply care about the things they teach, and they are happiest when they can help a student realize something they never did before. I've found myself anew just by being here for this short time, and the heavy workload has been like sandpaper, in a way. Sanding away the rough edges and bumps that I've always had that confused me about what it really meant to be an artist - it helped me get straight down to the core of what I am here for, and WHY I am here. This is an experience of a lifetime, and by the end of these four years, I know I'd choose to do it all over again if I could."
College Freshman,5,"The students at DigiPen are some of the best I've ever met. Outgoing and eager to create, being part of a group of art students is where I was always meant to be. Everyone generally gets along, and there never has to be fights broken up. We're a diplomatic group and we talk about our issues."
College Freshman,5,"I had a very smooth experience, personally. I didn't even have to tell them that I had credits that could be transferable (I didn't even know I had any!) They told ME that they ascertained that I had several credits that would take care of elective and degree requirements and completed the transfer process themselves. It was a really great surprise!"
College Freshman,5,"Being a student at DigiPen in the BFA program is the most intensive experience I've ever faced. It's also the most exciting thing I've ever done, and it's so clearly been tailored to prime us for the industry. The workload is heavy, but those who complete it with awareness know what the purpose of each assignment is - the curriculum is built in cooperation with all professors who meet and determine who will teach what and when so that new subjects are introduced at the same time in all courses in ways that tie everything together. The facilities are tailored for each program's needs, and there is always ample work space and open areas, as well as quieter study areas. Job opportunities and internships are a huge point of interest for BFA students, and we are notified through various ways, (postings, emails, announcements) when new opportunities are available. Guest speakers and ""company days"" are frequent events to better expose students to what's out there for us."
College Freshman,5,"DigiPen offers many opportunities to either have your voice heard or to even join one of the many councils that help make changes in how things are done at DigiPen. It's a very open-forum as long as you go through the proper channels, and concerns are taken very seriously as the work students need to do and anything that may be impeding it, as well as student well-being, is always top priority."
College Freshman,5,"The library at DigiPen is an indispensable resource. The sheer amount of material made available to students ensures that even if students cannot afford to purchase required textbooks for the semester, that they will be able to obtain a copy for an extended, generous period of time from the library. You can check out cameras, drawing tablets, DVD sets on subjects like animation or film production, and even video game consoles and game titles are available for those needing to do research in the game design programs."
College Freshman,5,DigiPen will help you get a job
College Freshman,5,"This school is an awesome school and you learn a lot, but at the same time it is a ton of work.  As a student, you are at the school from about 9:00 am to about 10:00pm to 12:00am when the school closes.  Outside of lectures and class, you are studying and finishing up homework assignments.  It is a lot of work, but every one is going through the same thing that you are. We also, all have a huge passion for why we are there, so after a while you start to get used to the work load and actually start to enjoy it.  This is an awesome school and there is no reason why I wouldn't choose to go there again."
College Freshman,5,The Real-Time Interactive Simulation program at DigiPen is a great program.  The program goes over a lot and pushes you to your limits as a student.  
College Freshman,5,All the professors are knowledgeable in what they are teaching and are will to help students when it is needed.
College Freshman,5,DigiPen is one of the few colleges that offers the degrees that students may pursue.
College Freshman,5,"DigiPen has one of the greatest student bodies that you will ever see!  Everyone is welcoming and willing to help/push each other to greater heights in their studies.  The typical student at DigiPen may not have had the greatest GPA back in high school, but you wouldn't be able to tell because the people that attend there are some of the most passionate people toward what they are studying.  Geeky and fun would also best describe a typical DigiPen student."
College Freshman,5,The school dose their best to fulfill the students needs to do well in there classes.  They have tutors on campus that will help you with your classes if needed.  Students are all welcoming and help one and another.  The students are some of the most passionate people towards what they are studying that you will ever meet.
College Freshman,5,You never have to leave campus.
College Freshman,5,"While I have not had first hand exposure, career services at Digipen seem to be excellent."
College Freshman,5,I have no complaints. Digipen is a great life decision.
College Freshman,5,No one here can be called an underachiever and make it through.
College Freshman,5,The facilities are small but ever expanding.
College Freshman,5,I have had no issues with this school.
College Freshman,5,Digipen Institute of Technology deserves its reputation as one of the elite in CS education.
College Sophomore,5,We have company days available to the upper classmen every Friday. Companies such has Microsoft and Ubisoft visit the campus to talk to students and offer interviews.
College Sophomore,5,School's resources are very accessible.
College Sophomore,5,Several company days every month.
College Sophomore,5,"The student body is AMAZING. I feel guilty if I'm not producing something, since everyone is constantly putting forth effort into their work. Walking through the main computer lab, Edison, is almost like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory for technology. If you peer over someone's shoulder, you can see the creativity flowing from each and every person. Though they may be shy, everyone is relatively sociable and will tell you what they are working on, and how they did it, if you ask."
College Student,5,Digipen has the best career outlook of any game college. Their staff is there for you to help you succeed not only during education but afterwards.
Junior,4,Very knowledgeable about their subjects. Plentiful resources to help students learn and adapt. The only downside is that switching degrees can be very costly as most credits are degree-specific.
Junior,4,"The school has so far prepared me well for the actual industry because of the game team experiences that put you through the wringer. The teachers in charge of game try to help you, but sometimes they don't even know what they require from us and can't get it straight from each other. This, probably unintentionally, mimics the actual industry and when all is said all is done, the games turn out pretty good. However, most of the art teachers are great. They will put you through a lot and are understanding of your situation. There are a few bad eggs here and there, but teachers do take your feedback more or less. The school is hard because of the amount of work it shoves on you pretty much limits you to be chained to the school. The best part is that the most of the student body is very friendly and want to help you. Never do housing, it's overpriced and the apartments are sub par. It's just better and cheaper to find housing yourself at least after freshman year."
Junior,4,"It's been great so far actually. There was a lot of confusion at first, but IT surprisingly managed to get almost everyone onto Teams in time for the end of spring break. The quality of teaching hasn't really changed and it's actually easier to interact and get in contact with the teachers. The teachers have also done their best to adjust and do their best to ensure you get the best education as possible so that you can graduate. My gripe is the art licenses. There is not enough for everyone at all. A lot of students use the programs at the same time which has lead students who are actually in the class that need the program are unable to complete their assignments. The school hasn't really done much to address this problem."
Freshman,4,Great students as well as a fun time overall. I would love to see more people attend this school as it is quite small and will eventually lead to success however it is a little expensive
Freshman,4,Its very ahead of other schools and is very accessable for many students to learn together at once. Thats why I like it
Sophomore,4,For the BFA art program it has a really good disciplines line of work! I have improved in my freshmen year heavily! It is a huge workload but it definetly pays off. The professors are very helpful and have good input on how to improve your art. IF your into video games I do suggest coming there!
Sophomore,4,"DigiPen is a place you go to get the experience to make games. There's nothing else like it. It's incredible. Just we're going through a lot right now, but they're always trying to make the school better."
Junior,4,"DigiPen has excellent classes and professors and there is a real sense of community among the students. However, a lot of this comes from a shared feeling of suffering as classes are terribly difficuly (especially when all taken at the same time) and many problems the student body has are very often written off as ""going to be fixed for the next cohort"""
Freshman,4,"My experience at DigiPen has exceeded my expectations! While it may be very work intensive and challenging (for good reason), I have been able to push my skills to the limit, and meet so many new connections and friends that I am so thankful to have in my life!"
Senior,4,"An amazing school with so much to offer, but definitely not for everyone. The workload is pretty insane, backed by a student culture that nearly glorifies over-working and under-sleeping, but the resources offered by the industry-trained staff is nearly infinite. DigiPen does a lot to make sure students get as many opportunities to get a job directly in the industry, with a plethora of events and classes that help facilitate industry connections and simplify the application processes. If you REALLY want to make video games, you can't find a school better than DigiPen, but if you don't have a genuine intrinsic desire to make games, DigiPen can be quite a heavy burden, both financially and mentally."
Freshman,4,"Have yet to begin first semester, however have visited and toured campus multiple times. Beautiful area, campus is pristine. Diversity is excellent compared to my rural home state, however is likely average for Washington. No school sports. Current students inform me that the party scene is completely dead as all students are too busy with coursework. Seems like a great college for people who want to learn and get work done, but keep the steep tuition in mind."
Freshman,4,"I am a older (28 yo) Bachelor of Fine Art Student for Animation and Digital Art at Digipen with a little more interest in the fine arts vs. game art/production art, but I came here because I wanted a more technical education in drawing and painting both traditionally and digitally. I like that the school will make me into a jack of all trades type of artist, from which I will be able to refine as I leave school and start giving the professional artist life a go.

The school is definitely geared and accommodating to those who want to go into game design but also has an option for pursuing film projects.
The work load is pretty insane and time management is most necessary It's a little unfortunate, but most students don't produce stuff they're all that proud of for that first year but the improvement in quality and efficiency as artists because of the curriculum is very apparent.

Some of my peers are able to hold part-time jobs and attend school. I haven't found that balance yet."
Sophomore,4,"DigiPen is a school you need to be ready for. It offers alluring courses that describe ideal opportunities and careers that you may find fascinating, but it does not sugar coat the four years it will take you to get there. It is a grueling, difficult course sequence to get through, and they make that very clear. As a currently enrolled student, allow me to amplify that message: To get through any of the degree programs at DigiPen, you need to really know what you're getting into and be determined to get through it. This is not a cheap school. If you have second thoughts, spend your money exploring elsewhere. But, if DigiPen offers exactly what you are after and you are ready for a brutal first few years, there is no better school out there."
Sophomore,4,"Most classes are geared toward your actual majors, however when you first start there's a lot of general studies to get through your first year. Things get more specialized the longer you stay. Faculty is nice, and all of them have worked in the industry in some way shape or form, so everyone knows what they're talking about! (Mostly)"
Freshman,4,"I feel DigiPen is a good school. One thing you have to be willing to do is work. No matter what degree program you go into, you WILL be piled with work throughout a semester. It's important that you have decent time management; if you don't have time management, you can still get by, but it's crucial to get those time management skills."
Senior,4,"I'm love this school, not because this school is easy or stress me out less. It's because they gives us a chance to do, or learn what student want."
Junior,4,DigiPen is a school where you put hard work in and get out amazing work. I get to work countless hours on the things I love. All the assignments and art courses are relevant to each other. I get to explore something I love and continue doing it as a passion and a career.
Recent Alumnus,4,Availability in each semester is a problem.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's hard work, but if you can do it, then do it."
Recent Alumnus,4,It's a great school for those who love games.
College Student,4,"From what I've heard, there will be a large variety of classes that cover every topic imaginable. There have also not been any complaints about the scheduling."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are pretty great, but because of the lack of flexibility in schedules for a REQUIRED class, I either had to quit my job or wait to do the class the following semester. Seeing as how I live in my own apartment (cheaper than on campus), I had to wait to take the class."
College Sophomore,4,"The moodle system is a bit outdated, but it's simple to use."
College Sophomore,4,"The program is constantly changing, which is both good and bad. As a BDFA, the cirriculum has changed at least 3 times in the course of a single semester. This is because yes, the industry is changing, but it's also extremely difficult to finish the program on track, there are students that have been here an extra 3 semesters trying to finish up the program."
College Sophomore,4,"Digipen requires that you become the greatest industry level game designer you can possibly be before earning your degree. School is a 7-day per week job that students labor at from morning til midnight and sometimes later. There's little room for exploring the world outside of school due to time restraints but if your going to be here for 4 years and emerge with a job in your dream industry, then it's all worth it. 

A lot of Digipen involved learning from your upperclassmen who know better than yourself. There are countless experienced and intelligent people willing to help students and it makes asking for help your most valuable asset while attending. 

The only reason I would not give the school a higher rating is due to some issues with curriculum structuring. Digipen is constantly changing course ordering and requirements which often makes for unprepared teachers and frustrated students. Game teams require art to make a decent game even if they're not graded to harshly on art, but artists are not by any means required to work with game teams until their junior year. This kind of disconnect for designing games has been a struggle for programmers for a long time at Digipen.

Other than these minor issues the school is made up of industry professionals and those with experience making games for a living. You can't find this at a normal university very easily and it makes a huge difference in getting to know your professors and getting excited about learning."
College Sophomore,4,"400 freshmen signed up for this school and only about 50 made it to sophomore year. The reason why so many people leave is mostly because of the cost of the school and the workload. You are expected to work everyday with very minimal free time. However, if you have excellent organization skills, and make sure you eat enough and sleep at least a little bit every night, you just may make it through. I am one of the 50 people to make it to sophomore year and I have to say its not like a school, but a boot camp. You will work your butt off, but at the same time, you will never forget your experience here no matter how long you stayed. 21 credits per semester does sound scary and is even worse to experience, but if you have faith in your abilities and take care of yourself, you can make it!"
College Freshman,4,"DigiPen is a college unlike any other, as it seems like a school that could only exist in your dreams; it's a school that primarily deals with video game development. With my, admittingly short, experience with the school, I already know that the school provides a dedicated and experienced staff that are available to help a student strive for success in whatever degree program they've chosen. The curriculum is challenging, but it sets a realistic standard that pushes students to reach their full potential and push the boundries of their comfort zone. Furthermore, it has up-to-date and comprehensive labs for students to collaborate with their own teams or other teams to work on game projects, as the degree programs are mostly team-based and stress the importance of team-bassd skills. I'm certain I will be enjoying my time at DigiPen, and if I find out I'm wrong, I'll still stick with it because I know even then that it will be preparing me for the industry; plus they serve delicious wood-stone oven pizza!"
College Freshman,4,"The library is a great place to go to if you need any gadgets, games, books, or even high quality cameras."
College Freshman,4,So far I've loved my professors and courses (with the exception of 1 or 2 by my own personal preference).
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, so I can't review too much of the program at this point."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of the professors are really great, as well as the courses. I've only encountered one or 2 professors that I personally didn't like too much, but that's just personal preference."
College Freshman,4,"The only issue I've had with the school, is that sometimes the Wifi cuts out randomly for a short period of time."
College Sophomore,4,"The curriculum is strict, but some teachers may accommodate with the student."
College Sophomore,4,This school gives out Bachelor's Degrees in each programs. They also give out Master's Degrees in Fine Art and Computer Science.
College Sophomore,4,"The career service helps the seniors in finding jobs by holding interviews, conferences, and career fairs."
College Sophomore,4,"There's no other place I'd rather be. The student body is extremely diverse in both race and gender. Thus, we have clubs for those diversities."
College Sophomore,4,"This school even gives out its own scholarships, but it is heavily contested."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are pretty similar to professors you'll find at other colleges. Most know what they are doing, but are sometimes assigned to a class that doesn't suite them and they perform poorly as teachers. The biggest issue is that all of the teachers were hired based on industry experience, not on being trained as a teacher. They're all experts in their fields, so they are a great resource, but their ability to teach varies depending on their personality and whether the course they teach is a good match for their expertise. The core class teachers are usually the best, while the elective teachers vary widely in their competence."
Recent Alumnus,4,"A lot of hands on work and a higher expectation from students. Many of the professors here have a fair share of industry experience in addition to whatever degree they hold. Many students hear the horrors of coming into college as A students in high school and then immediately dropping down to a B or C average. I never felt that at the previous university, but here it is definitely true. I've yet to be ""given"" an A, but I 100% feel I've earned almost every one I've gotten.

As for the facilities; there is a lack of outdoor space and no athletic center, but I honestly could care less. The town of Redmond itself is a beautiful place, so any space could be an outdoor study area. As for athletics, most all housing here already provides it. Also, and to be very honest, I didn't come to a university specializing in technology and computer science based on their student athletics facility."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The technology is up to date and readily available. Even during a period where my home computer was damaged. I'm not even talking about general programs like Word or Chrome; the school had machines already set up with audio recording and editing software, so I could get my coding as well as my mixing done.


My only real complaint is the limited amount of quiet areas. There are certainly many spaces to study and work, either alone or in groups, but a lot of the space is delegated off to team or general use, so finding a quiet corner can be difficult sometimes. Having said that, I need to also say that this has never gotten in my way of working."
College Freshman,4,the professors are kind and knowledgeable
College Freshman,4,so intense but so worth it
College Freshman,4,digipen cares about the students
College Sophomore,4,The school does not support on campus sports due to liability. The student affairs office is easily accessible. And the academic support center always has great tutors that are able to help with most issues. The library is decently sized for the school and will allow you to reach for resources from other branches.
College Sophomore,4,The student body is rather diversified. One will meet many with different backgrounds in all fields.
College Freshman,4,"The wireless was a little iffy earlier this year, but the school has done a great job at improving it and I have not had any problems with it since October.  If you are ever have problems connecting to the wireless though, the school does have I.T on campus that will assist you during normal working hours and you could also use any of the few thousand computers that are on campus.  They also give students an allotment of points to spend on printing every month, which comes out to about 50 or so pages of paper. "
College Sophomore,4,I can't wait for company days and to see what the companies have to offer. 
College Sophomore,4,The workload is enormous. I've spent Over 10+ hours on classes with barely anytime to sleep. We have free tutors to help in every subject. Professors are willing to stay late to help students.
College Sophomore,4,The student body has no tolerance for discrimination of any kind. Different major work together to form game teams and produce games.
College Sophomore,4,DigiPen is a gaming school. They focus on mimicing what the industry is like and teach you the skills they want and more.
College Sophomore,4,DigiPen has not sports. Everything is focused on classes and they have excellent resources. 
College Sophomore,4,"Getting your internet setup for the first time can be a hassle. Wireless internet is on and off because of cellphones. Personal computers are suggested to do work at home, for programmers it is essential. DigiPen has several printers you may print from and one where you can print directly off your usb."
College Sophomore,4,Hard to connect to Wi Fi sometimes.
College Sophomore,4,School was more difficult than expected.
College Sophomore,4,School spends too much budget on TVs.
College Student,4,"School contains a vast majority of students from older to younger. We have international students, regional and local students. We all do come here for the same reason which is a career in gaming industry."
College Student,4,"Though the tuition for DigiPen is quite a lot, it is well worth the cost.  You will definitely have no problem paying off loans after school and the quality of the education is above all others.  DigiPen is the best school for video game design."
College Freshman,4,"I am in the Bleacher of Fine Arts in Digital Animation, and my classes are intense and exactly what I've wanted. As a BFA freshman I found that my classes have helped me expand what it means to be an animator and an artist. My professors range form Disney animators, to fin artists, to film experts all loving the proses of drawing and art. The work load is defiantly doable, but time consuming. There are many resources on campus such as light boxes, cameras for animation, figure drawing session through the week, and of course teachers who are in full access to get critiques. As a BFA freshman the topic of internships/jobs have not come up yet. This year we are focusing on developing the artistic skills and learning the basics to be successful out in the work field. With organization and a good work ethic once could glide right threw the BFA freshman year with out any trouble."
College Freshman,4,"The amount of information and the resources at digipen is vast. Form the library, professors, and peers I've learned so much about gaming, animation, and much much more. This school was way more than I had first expected, and for me it's well worth the price that the tuition demands. If i did not have financial aid I would not be able to go to this school. With help from outside/Digipen Scholarship(s) and Loans I am able to attend this school and learn what I truly want to learn. The financial aid office has helped me understand and guide me through the financial aid process smoothly and efficiently."
College Freshman,4,Freshman year is extremely rigorous (challenging and time consuming) from the beginning to weed out students who are not serious or who cannot keep up with the coursework.
Junior,2,"I am a Junior BFA at DigiPen, and I must say if you are wanting to work in the game industry as an artist, go find a different school. 
This school is filled with outdated professors who have worked barely in the gaming industry yet they pretend to be an expert in the field, and sometimes, professors with NO work experience in the gaming industry. The school is years behind. What I recommend you to do is really do your research and look for student works for multiple schools and see the quality difference. DigiPen's student works fall behind in quality compared to many other schools. If you come to DigiPen as an artist, don't even think about getting an internship as a 3D artist, because you just won't have a decent portfolio even after graduation which is really the sad truth.
If you are really wanting to find a good school for Game Art, then I highly recommend you to find a different school. Trust me, this school is NOT cheap and you will NOT get your money worth what so ever."
College Sophomore,2,"The school's tuition is really high since it's a for-profit school. I suppose it can afford to be pricey since it's the best of its kind in the nation and is located in the center of the largest concentration of relevant industries in the country, but its a huge burden on students who may not get a steady job due to the industry's unpredictable nature.  I'm a little displeased with how the financial aid department gives scholarships to incoming students, since there is little to no screening, and a person who doesn't deserve it (merit-wise) and will immediately lose it is just as likely to get it as a person who put in the effort to earn it."
College Sophomore,2,"Transferring credit was a huge hassle. A single person is responsible for it, so she will occasionally miss your e-mail completely. You have to send the occasional reminder if she doesn't get back to you. The school is also very, very rigid in it's curriculum, so many credits don't transfer at all. I was lucky enough to have attended college before and had some electives I could transfer. Math, english, and physics are your best bets when it comes to transferability, but getting out of any core classes is unlikely, and getting out of an art class is unheard of. The curriculum changes every year, so if you're trying to get some credits at another, cheaper school with the intention of transferring them, you have a very high chance that the course will no longer be apart of the curriculum by the time you get in."
College Freshman,2,"The wireless is really terrible, which is surprising considering that the school has ""technology"" in the name! My phone often connects automatically, and I know when it does because it begins to load things obscenely slowly. That's on the rare occasion that I'm somewhere on campus where my phone actually receives a proper signal. Having good wireless is very important for this reason, but it still seems to be an issue."
College Sophomore,2,"The main printer for the school is rather unreliable. As an art student, it is very important to be able to access a printer to print out ones' work for either homework or projects. The wifi is rather poor throughout the building and unreliable, but a laptop is definitely necessary along with a drawing tablet."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many options in regards to different class times at DigiPen, but, to be fair, most people don't work or do anything BESIDES schoolwork."
College Sophomore,2,"The reason for the low grade is the general lack of diversity. DigiPen is a fairly open and accepting campus, but for some reason there are not  many minorities (at least not in the computer science degree). Though the few minorities that do attend are welcome friends."
College Freshman,2,"Not great. The academic resource center and labs are good, but there's no athletic center, a tiny library, and not too many campus events except for club meetings."
College Freshman,2,"Nothing Transferred – But that is mostly because DigiPen is tougher than most other schools. It's small, so there is not many schedules to work with."
College Junior,2,"Not up to Par – We are a technology school, yet sometimes I feel like it isn't so. As digital artists, we require computers that are able to run cpu heavy programs. The computer amount is never lacking, but the quality of the computers is not up to par. The network is also frustrating. Most of the school year it is sufficient, but at the end of the school year the senior artists start rendering their projects which clogs up the system."
College Sophomore,2,"Rocky, but Shines When Helpful – My experiences with financial aid have very rarely been pleasurable and seems like a battle to get help at time. Often I get the feeling that my money is the only thing that holds value as it is a for-profit university. There are a few financial aid employees that will go out of their way to help you though, and is where the Financial Aid department shines at times. The tuition paid is definably worth the CS and GAM classes. As for the other classes, not so much."
Junior,1,"Digipen is not a learning institution in the sense that you don't go there to learn. You go to prove that you already know. Most of the teach are unqualified to even teach. In my experience, Digipen doesn't even test if the teachers can speak English proficiently or even have a viable academic plan. There is a reason why Digipen only less than a 30% retention rate and the dropout rate is so high. The degree programs are so experimental that they burden the students with unbalanced workloads and poorly planned assignments. There are many teachers who are simply unqualified to teach their respecting class. For example, some of the teachers who teach in the design degree program have never designed a single game in their entire life and just copy and paste their teaching materials from the Youtube channel ""Extra Credits."" If you want to learn and don't have much experience in coding and/or want to learn game design; go to any other college that has software engineering or psychology."
College Freshman,1,"In the BFA program you are expected not to even sleep. I took the Recommended course load and that was 21 credits my first semester. Out of the initial estimated 200 art students in this program, usually only around 15 graduate. This isn't because they aren't good artists or good students. It is simply because they are so ran dry and pushed to the point of extreme depression, suicidal thoughts and an extremely stressful life. You wake up, with maybe 3 hours of sleep, you work all day until you go home, where you work until maybe 3 in the morning to get it all done. I ultimately became one of the many to drop out. I promise you that this stress is not worth it. If you want to learn this then look up things online, study hard but don't put yourself through this stress."

Niche User,5,What I like about Alice Lloyd is the small environment makes you feel at home. They go above and beyond for your safety . And everyone is very friendly
Freshman,5,My first semester was great. I love how close everything is. I love the small atmosphere. All the staff are friendly and helping!
Alum,5,Alice Lloyd is amazing. The faculty/staff work with you one on one to help you achieve your goals. It is such a small college that I had the pleasure of knowing most faculty/staff by a first name basis. I was able to communicate with them ANYTIME I needed to. Most importantly they want you to succeed and will do everything they can to see that you do.
College Sophomore,5,The professors & administration know you by name
College Freshman,5,"Alice Lloyd College is something else. You become great friends with everyone and their is little cost. This is the best college to come to. There are small classes so it's easier to learn and also there is like little difference from class to class. Plus ALC is like being home, and there are really great people that go here as well as work here."
College Junior,5,one of the few good thing about this college is that it does have a very good system for finical aid. most people go here for almost nothing
College Sophomore,5,Everything was great thanks to the student work program.
College Freshman,5,It is a Drug and Alcohol free environment.
College Freshman,5,Every building has wifi that is accessible and the speed is great .
College Freshman,5,I like the weather here because you get to enjoy the scenery and enjoy the seasons.
College Freshman,5,"Knott County, which is where Alice Lloyd College is at, is a dry county so no alcohol at all is here. The school has a zero tolerance policy against drugs, so if you caught with drugs then you are kicked out.  "
College Freshman,5,I love the History department here. The professors know what they are talking about. They don't waste your time. They give tutoring every day.
College Sophomore,5,Computers are always available for use. Printers are always up and running. The WiFi is occasionally down when there are too many users on the network. 
College Freshman,5,"They have a wide variety to choose from in the Hunger Din. There are various salad bars, pasta bars, ect to suit everyone's personal taste. The taste of the food is very good at an very affordable price."
College Freshman,5,The campus police patrol very regularly to ensure safety. They often give rides to dorms so students don't have to walk after dark. They are very good at keeping the campus safe.
College Freshman,5,"Wow, We Have Great Teachers – Teachers here should be given an award for there hard work. They do everything in their power to make sure you are knowledge and have learned the material that has been given."
Senior,4,"Alice Lloyd College is a small college with a “home-like” feel. With a personal connection with professors, the educational experience can be extremely successful. Small class sizes paired with faculty that genuinely care about your progress as a student provide tremendous learning progress for each student."
Senior,4,"I only took online classes during the COVID-19 period, but it proved to a successful experience as I was still able to learn and grow through the semester."
Graduate Student,4,"At this college we work to help pay for the cost of going to college. It is a small campus so everyone knows one another. The teachers are willing to work one on one with you and the library has a tutoring group for any class a student may have trouble in. Further more each building on campus is ran by students who's hours range from 10 hours a week to 20 hours a week. Each student is required to work in order to be a student here, and if your time is not met you will be dismissed from the college."
Freshman,4,"Alice Lloyd College is a wonderful college. Alice Lloyd offers excellent educational experiences. The thing I love about Alice Lloyd is, the people there become your family and they will do anything in their power to help you succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Alice Lloyd College. Being in a Christian environment is awesome and I feel as if i fit in very well. I also enjoy the activites I take part in such as: cheerleading, tennis and cross country"
College Sophomore,4,"It great for good parties. Good food, fun & fellowship"
College Sophomore,4,It a great under grad school
College Sophomore,4,Alice Lloyd students get a good review
College Sophomore,4,After dark you can edit in the parking lot and Campus Security will take you to your Dorm or back to campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy attending Alice Lloyd college. It has a family atmosphere and is a fairly small college, which is what I like the most about it. The professors and students are always willing to lend a hand, even if they do not know you very well. It is a great school, and I have made many new friends and memories as well."
College Sophomore,4,the school does a fairly well job at keeping an eye on things.
College Freshman,4,The off-campus dining is as good as you would find anywhere around other colleges.
College Freshman,4,"The strictness on campus is for our own good. They aren't suppose to have alcohol or drugs, none of that on campus, so being strict for that actually is acceptable I think."
College Freshman,4,Everyone here on campus is really great at helping out. Also one could always talk to the women over financial aid to see what they can get.
College Freshman,4,"The food is actually pretty great. They have a really good salad bar in the hunger din and if one wants to go to Miss Erma's, the food is cheaper then a fast food place; and personally tastes just as good or better."
College Senior,4,I love sociology there's a lot of papers to write but it is enjoyable to understand how society in and of itself works and how we can contribute not just by volunteering but by getting a deeper understanding of the infrastructure and understanding the marrow of the bones of society help us understand what we need to do to help it.
College Sophomore,4,The students and faculty make the campus a great school. Everyone is so kind and polite.
College Freshman,4,It is very safe there.
College Freshman,4,I have no problem with the weather.
College Freshman,4,"Being a small school, you'd be surprised how much they offer. Student interaction is great because it is a really small institution."
College Sophomore,2,"The Hunger Din is not good at all, but Miss Erma's Café is really good."
College Senior,2,Alice Lloyd needs some serious work.
College Senior,2,"Small town, small college. 1+1=2 small college plus small town, it always equals out some people doing drugs."
College Senior,2,We don't have greeks we have idiots who parade around the dorm naked.
College Senior,2,The don't help with off campus housing.
College Senior,2,For a private college you would think there would be a plethora of choices for the students and staff of Alice Lloyd College but all you see is repetition. In the area surrounding Alice Lloyd College there are 6 restaurants and most if not all are fast food places where you order and go. There is no nice sit down restaurants with good quality food in Pippa Passes. In the town away from the college Hazzard is where most students go for good food because it is where you'll get the better variety but as for the town the college is in the dining options are poor.
College Junior,2,there are not very many options available but the few that are available are pretty good
College Junior,2,the best choice of miss erma's is not even that great of a choice and IS NOT included in any meal plan
College Junior,2,"Campus Housing is very poor, little to no options."
College Sophomore,2,The community that the college is located in is very impoverish which results in lack of choices when it comes to dining
College Freshman,2,The dorms here are very far from classes. The individual rooms are very small. There is nothing to do and nothing in the lobbies in the dorms. 
College Freshman,2,"There is not anything in Pippa passes,KY. There is not any locals because the entire town is literally the college. The closest store of any kind is in Hazard,KY which is about thirty minutes away."
College Freshman,2,The internet speed is low and that is major problem if your professor assigns an online assignment because it takes forever to get done since the internet kicks you off after a certain time of being on it. 
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do at or around campus unless you drive about an hour to the closest city.
College Freshman,2,"Varsity sports at Alice Lloyd are very poor. We do not even have a trainer or our doctor on campus is normally not working. The campus/students treat us like normal people we are not better than everyne else like at a bigger college. We are not put on pedistools that we have to fulfill. we only have three sports in the school. Basketball, Tennis, and baseball. Baseball is the most important sport at Alice Lloyd."
College Sophomore,2,I am currently enrolled in ALice Lloyd's campus and i am not impressed by their academics. Most of the teachers know about as much as the students and its hard to learn something they dont really know. im not trying to insult them but it is a very difficult school to learn anything by. When you ask a question they sometimes have to look back in the book for a few minutes because they really don't know.
College Senior,1,This college puts too much emphasis on college sports and the need to focus more on academics.
College Senior,1,"Bad food, have to dress up every Tuesday for no real reason, women aren't allowed in the dorms all the time, nothing to do in this one horse town, and everyone thinks this place is great when in reality it's one of the worst."
College Senior,1,"People always complain of Lot X and how they can't drive to class. Every other college does it, why can't Alice Lloyd?"
College Junior,1,"no Greek life, and students are not allowed to live off campus"
College Junior,1,off campus housing is not allowed! The college could better this one of two ways A) offering more selection in on campus housing ( i.e co-ed dorms or at least married housing.) or B) allow off campus housing.
College Junior,1,This school has outrages standards is totally out rages ! the opposite sex is only allowed in each others dorms at most 1 day a week ! and the door has to stay open and  all feet must stay on the floor !
College Senior,1,"Alice Lloyd college is one of the only colleges that does not have co-ed dorms. By the time you are a college student you should be adult enough to be around women in a dorm environment, if you can't handle that, be a commuter or take a cold shower. It's people who do stupid things that made living in the dorm terrible and sometimes I believed living outside behind a dumpster would be cleaner than living in these dorms."
College Junior,1,"there is no parties allowed on campus, so there is none of any kind ! 

according to the student hand book you have to get permission if there is a group of 6 or more having an event off campus !"
College Freshman,1,"This school is basically a dream for poor white Republican Christian people, but sadly I'm only the first two of those things."
College Freshman,1,The freshmen parking is a half-mile from the closest building with classes.
College Freshman,1,This school has no night life at all. There ain't a bar til you pass the county lines which is thirty to forty-five minutes away.
College Freshman,1,The food is terrible. The isn't any variety because its same thing every day. The taste of the food is disgusting. Prisons probably have better food. 
College Freshman,1,"You have to have a vehicle at Alice Lloyd because the nearest store is thirty-minutes away, and the school will not help get to it. You are on your own when it comes to transportation."
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't help you find an apartment or anything because they mainly want you to live on campus. The apartments around here are usually run down flats. 
College Freshman,1,Alice Lloyd College does not have any Greek life whatsoever. It would be great if we did though. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"There's not much to do in Pippa Passes or the surrounding community.  If you're looking for a life outside of school, it just isn't happening.  The next town over, Hindman, has a couple of restaurants, a grocery store, and a small strip mall.  Expect to travel at least a half an hour to Hazard, KY to go to Walmart, Game Stop, or other stores.  The nearest ""big city"" is Huntington, WV, which is two hours away."
College Freshman,1,"We ONLY have a Dairy Queen,Subway, and a Holly Hills restraunt which has low grade food. and these places are about 15 minutes away."
College Freshman,1,"With my expeirence the financial aid office at Alice lloyd was completely terrible. The women in the office who ""help"" are there for just a pay check and try to sneak around and get as much money from you as they possibly can. They will lie about your amounts due, unless you ask to see an award letter and have them explain it step by step. but even then will they just curve around your questions and leave you confused. Honestly the Alice Lloyd campus needs to get audited."
College Sophomore,1,"Apartments Are Expensive and Hard to Get – With the demand high for apartments and the supply low, the apartments are generally overpriced."

Senior,5,"The classes online are very accessible. The cost of the textbooks are rolled into half of the courses that I am taking, which is a big perk."
Senior,5,"So far everyone at Franklin University has been extremely encouraging of my success. After speaking with an advisor, they helped me find community college classes that would transfer over to Franklin in order to save me some money."
Junior,5,"I have been an online student since I started attending the college, and they are flexible with the different time zones. I am in the Air Force  which means that I'm constantly moving. The professors always lend a hand, and they never shy away from any of my questions. They make the learning environment something that I can look forward to. Overall, I wouldn't have it any other way!"
Junior,5,"I am enjoying my college experience. I have been an online student since I started attending the college, and they are flexible with the different time zones. I am in the Air Force and the University welcomes me with open arms no matter where I am in the world. Before that I was stationed in Alaska, and completed my Associates degree while I was there.Now I am pursuing my Bachelors in Accounting, and I'm currently taking an Accounting course while being stationed in Korea placing me 13 hours ahead of the EST. If that isn't accommodation then I don't know what is!"
Freshman,5,"What I like about Franklin University is they are always there to help you. I had so many questions regarding taking courses at CSCC and Franklin, and they were always responsive in a timely manor. I felt like they wanted to help me versus me feeling like a burden. I am really happy to be getting my Bachelor's degree from Franklin."
Junior,5,Everyone is extremely helpful and kind! They all respect my wants and needs on how I would like to finish my post secondary education.
Sophomore,5,"Franklin University makes attending college easy. The application process was painless, it's free to apply and they give you an advisor every step of the way. You also can log on to Franklin's website and track your application process. Once you are enrolled, you also receive a financial advisor and an academic advisor. I recommend Franklin University."
Junior,5,"Good School, online program. The school could be more uniform in structure when it comes to the course layout. Overall I am very happy with the school."
Senior,5,"I transferred to this university and truly enjoy it. Most of my experience has been online, but I tend to feel a close connection with my classmates and my professors. Class sizes are great and the workload is very reasonable. I can work and complete my degree with no hassel."
Junior,5,Just getting started with my online program with Franklin. The advising staff has been amazing. Making it almost too easy not to go back and complete my degree.
Junior,5,"Franklin University is the best university I’ve attended thus far! The staff give personal attention to you for your success, and the amount of resources available to you are more diverse than I’ve ever seen. Not to mention I’m just an online student. I can’t imagine what they do for there on-campus students. Thanks, Franklin University staff!"
Senior,5,Like the flexible schedules available for working adults. Easy to transfer credits from other universities. Fairly affordable and a user friendly web environment.
Senior,5,"I like the fact that Franklin university has been helpful with my struggles with getting back in school and they are super helpful with informing me about resources i can use to help me with academic success. I also like the fact that they have advisers that are there to help you every step of the way, the campus is located downtown so there is things to do to give you a study break and as well as restaurants to eat at"
Junior,5,"Franklin University offers online course for my major. I don't actually need to go to the campus which is very good for saving my time and convenience. Even online course I can connect with my classmate which is very good opportunity to know my class mate. All professor is so professional, knowledgeable and lecturing so detail."
Senior,5,"I love that as a non-traditional student this university offers many class options that allow my to achieve my degree while taking care of my baby and running my household. They recognize my achievements and support me to pursue my goals. They care about my success and offer free tutoring and assistance with learning. I feel that they are providing me with the skills and knowledge necessary to have a successful career. I really like how the courses are set up and designed, for they are easy to navigate and they are set up for students to know exactly what is due and when so they can prepare for weeks ahead. You really can work at your own pace online, as long as you stay up to date on deadlines. I’m very thankful that I chose this university to get my degree because the flexibility and support has made it easier for me to have a successful outcome and better work life balance."
Freshman,5,Everyone has been very helpful and taking time to assist me with the simplest things.  I have been out of school for over 30 years so getting back in the hang of things has been very interesting.
Graduate Student,5,Franklin University is a great academic school with a flexible program and schedule. Franklin University professors all currently work in the field they are teaching in which gives you a learning experience from a professor with real world experience that comes second to none.

Graduate Student,5,"I like that classes are online, books are fairly cheap to buy them online through the University. Also, the library and professors are super helpfully"
Senior,5,"I already have one degree from Franklin, and I went back for another! Academic advising is great, and I haven't had an instructor I didn't like yet. 

The only thing I would change, and probably would have the same answer for most colleges is lower tuition. Franklin is mid-range, so it's not a complaint for me, but any lower tuition would be great!

All the N/A ratings come from me being a distance student. Never even been there!"
Graduate Student,5,"My experience with Franklin University has been great. The course schedules are very convenient for working adults they only meet once a week, and the online classes are even better. I love the six week courses, they are intense but quick. There is nothing that I would want to see change except for maybe a little less writing papers."
Freshman,5,Great school. The school provides a lot of resources to help you succeed. The advisors and teachers are helpful and want to help you succeed as well.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my time with Franklin.  They make it really easy for adults with full time jobs to return to school.
Sophomore,5,I love that i can go online and on campus. The communication and technology is great. The tutoring in even available online. the options to rent text books really help. Everything is very easy to follow. My advisor has all my questions answered before I can ask them. We have a really great plan for my career.
Senior,5,The price is high but well worth it as an investment towards the future. The professors helpful and take the time to teach the material beyond what is required. The classes themselves are useful and push students into learning beyond the minimal.
Recent Alumnus,5,My experience at Franklin University has been fantastic.  I wish I would have started at Franklin rather than going to the community college first.

I chose Franklin University because they accepted up to 84 credits from my community college. This helped me save on tuition costs. In addition, Franklin University offers classes online and on campus. These classes can be completed in 6, 12 or 14 weeks. The academic advisers are very supportive and helped me immensely.The professors are very responsive and encouraged participation throughout the courses. I would definitely recommend this university to other students!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Franklin University is a unique school in that it prepares everyone for the workforce no matter how old they are. It has flexible scheduling for working adults, so they can either take online or evening classes if they are close to a campus that has Franklin classes. If I could do it all over again, I would choose this university again."
College Junior,5,THe online classed make it easier & affordable for me & my schedule.
College Senior,5,"I have had nothing but fast, positive, and efficient dealings with Franklin University."
College Student,5,The is not a campus where the students live

This is not a live in campus therefore no nightlife or campus parties"
College Sophomore,5,I love the idea of an online school.
College Sophomore,5,"I pick this degree, because alot of my classes from my other degree transferred."

College Senior,5,Strictness according to academic integrity is top-notch.
College Student,5,There is always something to do.
College Student,5,The financial aid process went very smooth.
College Senior,5,"The courses I take are very relevant to my major. The assignments, instructors, and activities are very effective in reinforcing course content.

The workload can be heavy, but most of the assignments have been very helpful in furthering my understanding of course concepts."
Recent Alumnus,5,I've never had an issue at Franklin
College Junior,5,Excellent!!!!!  I'd recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn and understand the material they are studying.
College Junior,5,There is all types of people.
College Junior,5,"I never lived on campus, but Franklin University is the best!"
College Junior,5,If the weather is really bad it will be posted on Franklin University's website and on TV.
College Junior,5,Franklin University computers are excellent.
College Junior,5,"Day time I feel very safe; sometimes at night if I left the campus before class was over and not too many students were walking back to their cars I'd feel a little scared. I'd always have my cell phone on hand if I needed to call the police. When I left the campus when all the other students left , I'd feel safe."
College Senior,5,"Printing is free, also copying is free also. The tech support people are the best that I have ever had to work with or talk to when I have had a problem with my laptop and could not get on the Franklin website."
College Senior,5,The professors are the best that I have had. They know there stuff. They are also great at listening to you when you are trying to put your words on paper but somehow are not sure what to say. 
College Senior,5,It is so great to learn about the criminal justice system at Franklin University. The professors are knowledgeable and have real world experience and are available to help. I love the field and it is growing more and more
College Senior,5,School policies have been set up and they are working just fine. Many of the students that attend here are happy for the policies so that they can continue to feel safe.
Junior,4,"My overall experience here at Franklin University has been good. The advisors are always willing to help. Every time I have had a question with any of my homework assignments my porfessors have always emailed me back in a timely manner. I have always felt like if I need help will anything, someone within the school will help me."
Senior,4,"My time at Franklin has granted me the opportunity to see a different point of view. On several occasions, I thought I was more informed and walked away with brand new respect for the subject matter. I would recommend the school to people because of affordability and access. Online classes, in my opinion, provide a decent amount of flexibility to work a full-time job, have a personal life and manage a family.  

Choosing to return to school, after such a long layoff (about 9 years), was a tough transition. The classes have challenged and have pushed me to open my mind to different perspectives. I have had great interactions with my peers and my professors. 

I am very appreciative of the opportunity that I have been given. I have been able to apply a lot of the knowledge and skill at my job and further look to utilizing as I continue on my career journey. The takeaway from my experience, have an open mind, learn to communicate and never stop working on yourself."
Alum,4,"Overall, my experience at Franklin was good because it made sense. I was attending another 4-year school. They were going to place me as a sophomore, but Franklin University was able to have me transfer in as a senior. I saved so much money and time by switching."
Junior,4,I love the online flexibility of the courses and the availability of the courses offerer. The instructors are genuine and very knowledgeable in the subjects they teach. They always make time for the students and do their best to give us the classroom feel during our online sessions. It is easy to go to school when you have a supportive educational staff that wants to see their students succeed.
Junior,4,The academic advisors and financial aid staff are incredibly friendly and very helpful. I feel comfortable contacting my advisor or a member of the financial aid staff if I have an inquiry. I’m honestly happy to have chosen Franklin University to obtain my degree.
Junior,4,Franklin University makes it easier for non-traditional students to earn their degree.  The online courses are easy to navigate and submit work and the professors are very knowledgeable.
Freshman,4,I am a transfer online student and have enjoyed my experience at Frankin University.  The understanding and cooperation of the advisors in coordinating classes and working around my work schedule has been very helpful with my success to finish my degree.
Junior,4,"I am currently at student at Franklin and I have enjoyed my time there so far. I was hesitant about returning to school after a long gap but the advisors and staff made it a very easy experience. I have about a year more to go and I am looking forward to my graduation from Franklin. I do not live on campus as I work full time and I am a single parent, so I do not know about the dorms/housing or the ""party scene"", but what I know about Franklin thus far is good."
Senior,4,"Franklin has been a great school so far. The teachers are all very nice and helpful. Personally, some of the coursework has been a bit easy, but that may just be my situation. Overall, it is a pretty good school."
Senior,4,"Enrolled as an adult working full-time job.  Unlike other colleges, the professors and advisors do what they can in order to help students succeed without having to sacrifice too much.  They will work with people who have jobs and families to take care of.  I doubt my success as a student would have been possible in another college."
Alum,4,"You get out of Franklin what you put into it. The university constantly strives to improve student life, curriculum, etc., and the instructors are passionate about their work. I would suggest Franklin to any adult student who needs a reputable degree program that allows for a full-time job."
Sophomore,4,"I love Franklin University because, they are determined to have students succeed.  There is so much support, whether its tutoring, financial assistance or advising.  They make it super easy to get in touch with someone and get help or answers!"
College Junior,4,Feel secure when attending classes.
College Junior,4,No sports or music programs are available.
College Sophomore,4,Franklin University is great for students who also work full time.  They offer many night and online classes.
College Sophomore,4,"I am very pleased with Franklin University and their willingness to work with me, a student who is employed full-time and that must commute to work 2 hours a day.  The online classes and instructor flexibility is phenomenal."
College Junior,4,I work full time. Franklin has tons of online classes and I am able to easily find a class to fit my schedule. The instructors all respond in a timely fashion.
College Senior,4,Franklin offers a lot of resources for students to find jobs.
College Student,4,My experience at Franklin University is truly Amazing. It has one of the best online degree programs in Ohio. I love this school because it has a small classes that I really feel comfortable in.

College Freshman,4,Center for Career Development has lots of events and job fairs.
College Freshman,4,Good balanced learning format. Professors are very helpful and understanding.
College Freshman,4,Good campus security. Escorts are available for after class.
College Junior,4,All of my classes and teachers have been great
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed going to Franklin University
College Junior,4,I have had a great experience with Franklin University this far.
College Junior,4,"Franklin University is a great choice for those who needs the flexibility in their schedule for classes. The important thing for me was that they offer the major I had been looking to get into and the staff really know what they are teaching and will not hesitate to help out if you become stuck or overwhelmed. The location of the main campus isn't too far away from my apartment and in the rare occasions that i cannot make it to the downtown location, there are alternate campuses within driving distance. The staff is pretty much hit/miss. There are really good instructors that make time outside of class to answer any questions or address concerns about the course material, then there are the few that really make the college experience, especially for those working 40+ hours a week, a chore. So far I do not regret my decision in choosing Franklin University."
College Freshman,4,Faculty is very helpful and supportive. Good flexibility with courses.
College Junior,4,I love that the professors whom teach the classes have actually worked or are working in the field I am studying.
College Senior,4,"I started out going to a community college when I was 18. I was very pleased with my choice because I saved a lot of money and the class schedule was convenient. I also started working full time, between 40 and 50 hours a week on top of being a full time student. I studied very hard and received excellent grades. I loved attending the community college because I could attend school at night while working full time during the day. I worked hard to take and succeed in all of my classes. Within my first year of attending school, I was on track to graduate early. I recently transferred to Franklin University to pursue my bachelor's degree in Financial planning. I love the flexibility of this school and the locations that they offer classes at. However, it is over 4 times more expensive for one class than it was at my community college. I am glad that I chose to go to the community college first because financially that was the best choice for me. However, I do feel like I am not getting the full experience of being in college because other students at both of the schools I have been too are older adults and not many people my own age are in classes with me. Although many people in my classes are older adults, it has been a blessing to be able to learn from their experiences and better prepare myself for my future as a financial planner. One day, I hope to help students in a similar situation to mine choose the best choice for them financially."
Recent Alumnus,4,Excellent for busy adults.  Online format is very convenient.
College Student,4,Everyone is respectful of each other
College Student,4,Plenty to do in Columbus Ohio
Recent Alumnus,4,"My overall experience at Franklin University has really been great. The professors really know what they are talking about when it comes to class discussions, and the students are very engaging when it comes to class discussions. Most students are active in discussing group assignments and everyone takes accountability for their work. The class sizes are very small, normally 20 students to one professor."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Franklin University is very cool in the way they set up each class. Every week is set up to where the students know what to do during the week and what is due before next class. All of the assignments for the class are uploaded to the student's myFranklin account 10 days before their first day of class. Franklin University also has no tests in their curriculum, but there are a lot of papers students need to do in each class."
College Senior,4,There are always plenty of places to go providing you know the right people :)
College Senior,4,There is always plenty to do in Columbus but not much transportation and limited parking!
College Senior,4,Columbus has one of the best restaurants in Ohio in my opinion!
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is very strict when it comes to attendance, because it is very important for all students to be in every class."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Student life on campus it great, the environment is very comforting."
College Senior,4,IT IS NORMAL FROM THE REST
College Senior,4,I have never had any issues
College Senior,4,"Teachers on campus are great, they are very eager to help."
College Senior,4,Lots of different backgrounds and points of view!
College Senior,4,I plan on raising my family here!!!
College Senior,4,It's your own fault if you go hungry!
College Senior,4,The parking issue is not a hassle!!
College Senior,4,I have no complaints but I've also worked very hard and everything has gone smoothly.  The financial aid process is very slow compared to other schools and the money from grants and scholarships doesn't get awarded until two months into classes!!!
College Senior,4,There are tons of resources and the staff is very helpful.
College Senior,4,Professors are very responsive and helpful.  Curriculum is challenging and demanding.  Registration is easy.  Lots of options for help and flexible hours!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Since, the university doesn't provides any scholarship for the Master's Degree. The only way for the international student is to get a graduate assistant ship or fellowship or a aid from a financial institutes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is great because it serves very health and fresh foods, which is made in the canteen in open kitchen where you can see how the food on your plate are made."
Recent Alumnus,4,The clean environment makes the on campus housing good for the student for living and quite and chill environment so that the student won't be disturbed while studying.
Recent Alumnus,4,Since the college provides the worldwide online course the diversity is also great.
College Sophomore,4,The process went pretty smooth.  Just follow the instructions given by the financial department.
College Sophomore,4,"I would definitely do it over.  Right now, I am a Computer Technician.  I can no longer do the manual work associated with this job.  I am going back to school to become a manager of our tech department.  Right now I am the Computer Support Specialist."
College Senior,4,The financial aid office is very easy to work with.
College Junior,4,I live quite a way from campus
College Student,4,It could be better for a college student.
College Student,4,It is not an issue.
College Student,2,no one really pay attention to athletics
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since there is no athletic department for Franklin University in Shelby, OH, it is difficult to comment on this category."
Recent Alumnus,2,"To my knowledge, there is no parties on and around campus. The party scene, I believe, has a negative impact on students, especially when alcohol and cigarettes are involved."
College Junior,2,"It's very cumbersome, it's a lot of red tape..."
College Senior,2,"My financial aid package is inadequate and the alternatives suggested have not been very helpful. I maintain a 4.0 gpa, but I haven't been really offered anything to help with tuition. "
College Junior,2,"There aren't a lot of choices near campus. There's a pizza place, a burger place, a sub place, and a cafe at the near by hospital"
College Junior,2,"I was charged for a refund that was given to me even though the school admitted that the mistakes were their mistakes, I was still told I had to pay."
College Junior,2,"I was happy with the school until their system made assumptions about my tuition status, which generated a refund to me. When I asked about it a school employee told me my tuition was covered and that I could use the refund for whatever. Later, they said that even though the admitted their mistakes after reviewing the factors that I owed them the money back, however, the only factors were their mistakes. I felt as if it was a case of our mistake, your fault, you still owe us for our mistakes. I would not recommend this school. "
College Junior,2,"There isn't too much off raging parties. There is a bar district about 15 minutes from the campus, but there is a bigger school nearby. There is a lot more that goes on there. There are a few local bars that are nice within a mile or two. "
College Senior,2,"This school's financial aid department has been rapidly declining over the past year.  No matter how many times you call, you will get different and completely inaccurate information every time.  They will not make sure that you have the materials you need before your classes begin, and they don't care about the academic ramifications of that.  They no longer assign an academic adviser, you are simply thrown into a pool of people who don't know you, your life, your goals, your major....you might as well ask your librarian for advice, she will know you better.  The online classes should not even be academically accredited, as the lectures NEVER happen - you are told what materials to buy, when to have assignments turned in, and that's it.  No lectures, no class discussion.  That's not college, that's a correspondence course.  I am VERY disappointed in my experience with Franklin, as it was an amazing school when I enrolled that has gone down the tubes rapidly."
College Senior,2,There is not much campus life about franklin.  Most of the students that attend franklin live off campus.
College Junior,2,I'm married so not looking at other students in this regard.
College Junior,2,There are no transportation options provided by the school. Things are in walking distance but can be unsafe at night.
College Junior,2,I hate how Franklin always re-designs their website and it's very hard to understand how to navigate around it. The computers are slow when you log in and require a download of another internet program in order to view the portfolio and get your homework.
College Freshman,2,It really depends on the time you go to class. I don't really have a lot of trouble for day classes. The night classes appear to be the hardest ones to find close spots for. But you really just have to be familiar with the area to find great spots.
College Junior,2,There are many apartments near campus that students can either live in alone or share with other students.  Campus police and city police make these apartments and condos safe because there are other campuses close by it is also easy to find a roommate if that is needed.  These can be advertised for in the city paper or on the variety of campuses near Franklin University.
College Junior,2,"Although there are many fast food and sit down restaurants near campus and food vendors on campus, there is no dining hall.  There are many options within walking distance of campus for students to choose from in variety and budget factors."
College Junior,2,"There seems to be something going on all the time on campus such as an icecream social for Freshman recently to get to know other students and their faculty.  It is easy to find something to eat in between classes, there are several fast food restaurants just across the street and the city library is close by.  The library on campus has a lot to offer and state of the art help."
College Junior,2,"Not Much Variety – The only food choices around campus are Donatos, Subway and McDonalds, they do not offer any kind of dinning plan ."
College Senior,2,Largely Online Learning – The majority of students study online and do not go to campus. I've only been onsite to take exams. The overall facilities appear to be average.
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life.
College Student,1,Franklin Does not offer housing!
Recent Alumnus,1,There are no athletic programs at this school.if there was in believe that they would be good.
College Senior,1,"I have been to a few schools now trying to find the best one, academically Franklin has been the most useful and well taught. However I had such a nightmare of financial aid and once it was received it was revoked at the end of the quarter. I had to take out a different loan elsewhere to pay for fees for the one and only semester I went there. As I stated Franklin has the best academics however, if you cannot pay for it yourself WATCH OUT their financial aid department is full of amateurs who don't know what they're doing. I had to talk to the head over financial aid to get anyone to even call me back!"
College Senior,1,Franklin University doesn't offer Health and Safety services to the best of my knowledge.
College Senior,1,Franklin University does not offer sports or have any sports teams to my knowledge.
College Sophomore,1,"Franklin does not promoted Greek Life. There may be city-wide chapter that include Franklin University but it's difficult to find them. Franklin does not have anything on their website regarding Greek Life. If you call, they will tell you that they have no association to Greek Life."
College Junior,1,I don't think Franklin has sports.
College Junior,1,"It's not a typical college, it's a community college."
College Junior,1,There isn't really anything offered because the satellite campus is so small. 
College Junior,1,This school consists of mostly working adults so its usually very professional on the campus. And there is not hanging out as they say on campus after school.
College Junior,1,"I am online student. I don't know anyone from any of my class. All classes I took there is no interest of friendship, neither help from anyone."
College Junior,1,"I was pretty much unhappy with teachers, financial aid, and the online program."
College Junior,1,"Not helpfull and very slow in the process. 
I received financial aid; however when I have only 32 credit left when the quarter ended I received a notification that I did not have financial aid. 
Contact this people and they stated: No financial aid!. I asked them: What I am supposed to do?
Pretty much, don't know don't care."
College Senior,1,"I do not or have not had an Internship through Franklin University. I am 22 and currently am a Manager working 40+ hours for Target, while taking 4+ classes. I am majoring in Healthcare Management. I am using my current work experience as a form of managerial practice for when I graduate this next fall of 2013. I plan on pursuing a local internship through a retirement facility shadowing the director for more medical oriented practice. Franklin does however offer resources and suggestions to provide students with internships/shadowing positions. Since I am a healthcare administration major, academic advisors have advised me to explore my options through Grant Hospital that is located two streets away to obtain any potential internship. Overall they do not go above and beyond to find internships or work study programs for students. I'm assuming this is because they are mostly an on-line school."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a handful of scholarships, none of which I am qualified for, although having a high GPA. While Franklin has a strong presence in the local business community and often has sponsored job/career fairs by various established businesses, it would seem that these businesses should partner with Franklin to offer scholarships to those attending/future students."
College Sophomore,1,"I am a returning student and had a hard time getting financial aid other than loans.  There are scholarships available to me, but I had to find them on my own."
Recent Alumnus,1,Have a 4.0 GPA...but no scholarship offers. Poor.
College Senior,1,Nothing to Write Home About – They are lacking a formal dining hall at this University and rely on the surrounding areas to be accessed when wanting to eat a meal.
College Junior,1,"Housing or Lack of Housing – If I didn't live in the area, this is not a school that I would send my freshman child to because even though there is housing near by and campus security is very good about keeping students safe on campus and near campus, there is actually no designated housing for any student.  We are however, near Ohio State University and many students share apartments or houses near to the campuses."

Senior,5,"Overall, mostly wonderful people and wonderful experiences. Definitely challenging academically at times."
Sophomore,5,The courses are diverse and challenging. The school gives academic freedom to pave your own path to academic success. Brown is one of best institutions in the world to both discover yourself and set yourself up for success in the future.
Sophomore,5,"The online experience has been positive. Obviously, in person is the best but out of all online learning experiences this is about as good as it gets."
Senior,5,The community at Brown is absolutely amazing. I feel like I learn as much from my peers as I do from my professors.
Sophomore,5,"Very great school. Most liberal of the Ivies. Every moment spent on the campus, whether in an academic setting or simply conversing with peers, brings a multitude of information and introspection."
Freshman,5,"Couldn't ask for anything more. When I first step foot on campus I knew Brown was the perfect place for me, and although I didn't expect to get in, I'm so incredibly grateful to study here."
Junior,5,"Brown provides a truly special environment that fosters the interdisciplinary, self-driven pursuit of knowledge. Students are incredibly intelligent, interesting people, but are humble and grounded in a way that sets Brown apart from other Ivy League universities."
Niche User,5,this was an amazing experience and i love everything about it i only wish the dorms were a bit bigger.
Alum,5,"Brown University's open curriculum and lack of general education requirements made for a great educational experience for me, allowing me to both specialize in my major area while also creating opportunities to pursue other academic interests."
Niche User,5,The atmosphere in this university is amazing! I really enjoyed walking around and getting to meet student. 10/10 recommend!
Freshman,5,"I love Brown University because of its amazing resources, supportive community, and renowned staff. It is a very welcoming place where there are always people who are willing to help you. Compared to many elite schools, the students at Brown are so supportive of one another. Additionally, there are countless opportunities for research, community service, and extracurriculars like theatre, sports, and much more."
Freshman,5,Really love the school and Open Curriculum is amazing. The environment is supportive and everyone is really nice
Graduate Student,5,"This is the best school ever.  Diverse, spiritual, innovative, clever.  I am grateful the Sorting Hat placed me here!"
Freshman,5,"The best of the best for undergraduate education. Don't want to take a class? You don't have to. Want to take a class but don't want a bad grade? Take it S/NC. But that's not to say classes are a joke. STEM classes will kick your ass and they'll kick it HARD, but that's all part of preparing you for the real world."
Niche User,5,"The thing i liked about brown university is that one of the major fields of the university is biology and since i wanna be a doctor i know that brown university will help me take a big step in getting close to fulfilling my dream,"
Senior,5,The unparalleled academic freedom that Brown offers cannot be beat. I have absolutely loved my professors and my classes and I could not picture myself attending any other school. Go Bruno!
Senior,5,"The resources here are truly astounding...yes, as a first-generation college student, it took a while before I understood that I CAN use these resources. However, the resources that Brown offers are backed by real communities and real people who care."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, flexible curriculum, very adaptable depending on the student. The campus promotes creativity and the students had a very welcoming attitude. Not competitive like I expected from an Ivy league"
Junior,5,"I love nearly every aspect of Brown. The students are academically focused while maintaining a high level of socialization and fun. There area a wide variety of classes available to take, and with an open curriculum, anyone can try out any subject they'd like. The professors are extremely supportive, in my experience, and create a learning environment for success. The only thing I'd like to improve is attendance at sporting events."
Freshman,5,Every person on campus is unique and is truly passionate in their work. People want you to succeed and are willing to help you.
Freshman,5,"I like how the make the students welcome, I was quite surprised since my Headmaster graduated from there. I found it interesting that one of the presidents went there and also many more famous people."
Sophomore,5,"Brown is more than just an elite institution, it's a community of people who are all so amazingly brilliant in their own unique ways and I often catch myself surprised by how impressive everyone is."
Freshman,5,"Brown University's dedication to the undergraduate experience in all aspects-whether through academics, campus life, or career development-is the reason I chose to attend and I cannot wait to not only explore my own academic interests and personal growth but aid and contribute to the growth of others."
Sophomore,5,"Brown is a great place to be. The academics are excellent and rigorous, but the atmosphere is more relaxed than you would expect from an Ivy League school. The people are very friendly and collaborative, and there are a wealth of opportunities to pursue. One downside would be that the dorms are not fantastic, and that the school typically does not allow students to live off campus until senior year."
Junior,5,"Brown University has been an incredible experience and has allowed me to pursue passions that I wasn't even aware I was interested in! The unique open curriculum allows students to take courses from a broad range of subjects and helps to ensure they find the right area of study. I personally believed I wanted to go into biomedical engineering, however, after taking a variety of classes at Brown in environmental studies, I have switched my major. Every teacher, student, and dean is so incredibly passionate about the work and everyone is constantly striving to be better which makes the University an amazing place and experience!"
Niche User,5,Such an amazing school with an absolutely wonderful sense of community. They care about their students and want each and every one of them to succeed.
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful college experience at Brown. I felt supported and challenged by my excellent professors and peers. The process of obtaining a liberal arts education is intensive and requires significant reflection, but is entirely worth the effort."
Niche User,5,"This school has a particular, unique focus on undergrads that is hard to find at other institutions of its caliber. Brown is definitely a place like no other and I enjoy learning more about the school."
Sophomore,5,"Brown University is everything I could have dreamed and more.The professors are inspiring, the classes are tough but the grading is lenient and fair plus with the option to take everything S/NC and no requirements, your academic path is in your hands. The food can be a bit underwhelming at times in the main dining halls (The Ratty and V Dub)... but there are tons of other options which are fantastic like the blue room, ivy room, Josiah's and Andrews of course."
Freshman,5,"I adore this school. It’s not perfect, but it’s as close as it gets for me. I’ve met amazing people and formed such strong connections and have only been here one semester."
Niche User,5,It's wonderful and so full of life. I recommend everyone to at least visit it even if you don't want to attend the college.
Sophomore,5,"Brown University has been the best experience of my life thus far. I recently took a semester to study away and can comparatively say that there is no other institution that allows the substantial amount of growth intellectually, emotionally, and creatively. This university is truly a special place to be."
Niche User,5,"It's in a great location and is absolutely rich in diversity, culture, and history. The students are so involved in the community and the school offers so many programs available to the public."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love it here. I went to a subpar public school in Texas so it’s very different up here, but everyone at Brown is passionate and they excel at what they do. You can definitely surround yourself with the kind of people you want to be like. If you want to surround yourself with fun people who like to party, you will definitely find them. If you want to surround yourself with people who will encourage you to update your resume and go to class, you will find them. The thing is, at Brown, usually they’re both. Work hard play hard is definitely a thing here. Brown’s education is also entirely what you make it. Because of the S/NC stuff, you can really make your path as easy or as challenging as you want it to be."
Graduate Student,5,"Small classes, great faculty and very smart and talented students. I love the campus just as much as the dorms. RI in general is a very cute little place that allows just the right academic setting that Brown students need. The course work and homeworks are heavy sometimes, but worth it."
Sophomore,5,"I have enjoyed Brown since the first moment that I stepped on campus. It is important to highlight the professors' effort to get to know their students and see them thrive. The open curriculum has had a great impact on my academic choices, allowing me to be the captain of my education."
Niche User,5,"It's a great, beautiful campus!!! Everything about the school is amazing, from the the academics to the clubs."
Sophomore,5,"I love Brown Univerity. I met people from across the world in my freshman dorm. My professors were at the top of their fields and not only intelligent, but excited to share their class material with their students."
Junior,5,"I love Brown!!! My academic experience over the past two years has been truly incredible: I have been challenged by both my professors and the entire community. Beyond my classes, I have been participated in many great extracurriculars, from the orchestra to the swing club to the community engagement opportunities through the Swearer Center. What I love most about Brown, though, is the atmosphere of learning in a supportive, collaborative environment. No student is out to get anyone else. That doesn't mean we slack off; instead, it means that people are kind and ready first of all to look after each other. The reason we keep academic standards so high isn't because we compete with one another, but instead because we each have a remarkable drive to learn and really exceptional abilities to do so. This collaborative environment is a testament to the success of the Open Curriculum, as fostered by the faculty, administration, and students -- and staff, of course -- all working together."
Niche User,5,I attended Brown for a Pre-College Program and loved everything about it. From the classes to meeting people from everywhere in the world and you get to experience the Residential Life which is amazing
Sophomore,5,"I love Brown. It is a place full of passionate people who all have a love of learning. My time here has been life-changing so far. The open-curriculum gives me greater opportunity to study what I want to. As a pre-med student, that opportunity is a rarity. The environment in non-competitive, everyone helps one another which is so refreshing at a top institution. Really, it is the student body that is the most incredible part of Brown. Brown attracts a type of student who is open, diverse, and intelligent. There is no place I would rather be during my undergraduate studies."
Sophomore,5,"Brown is amazing! I am convinced it is the best school in the world. The faculty is incredible and genuinely cares about the students. The students support each other and work hard every day. The education is intense and very high quality. Class options are vast, and the open curriculum gives students the ability to try many different subjects and classes that they maybe would not have tried otherwise."
Sophomore,5,"Great environment, they give you your independence but there is a strong support system and advising body. Brown is a happy medium in terms of school size and location."
Graduate Student,5,"I am in the School of Professional Studies. From the very beginning, the faculty went above and beyond what is necessary to cater to my and my cohorts' needs. The professors are top notch too."
Niche User,5,What I loved about Brown was firstly the tour guides. There was a lot of information on programs dedicated to helping students of color.
Senior,5,"Brown University has so much to offer in so many different facets. The diversity is refreshing, there is a great variety of classes led by world class professors, the campus is well integrated into the city of Providence but still has a campus culture, etc."
Junior,5,"Brown University is a private, Ivy League research university in Providence, RI. The campus culture seems to live up to its reputation, boasting one of the happiest student populations in the country despite the amounts of work. Faculty and administration is often accessible and the party culture is balanced with a hard working ethos and an emphasis on personal well-being."
Junior,5,"Brown university's open curriculum is  unique and a completely amazing concept. We can take any classes we want over our 4 years here, and aren't restricted by distribution or core requirements. Students are free to explore whatever they desire, and aren't stuck taking history courses as a biology major."
Alum,5,"Attending Brown was one of the best experiences I've ever had. From the academics, to the people, the memories I made in Providence are ones that I will cherish until I die."
Freshman,5,"Brown University has been an amazing school and even after the first year I have fallen in love. The academics are amazing, especially compared to my high school. Despite the increased difficulty, there are so many resources and option available to assist in the transition. I feel as safe as possible as I could both on the campus and in Providence. Furthermore, the community here is amazing. People are genuinely kind and make me feel extremely welcomed."
Niche User,5,"Brown's Open Curriculum really makes me feel confident in exploring subjects outside my comfort zone. You can take elective classes pass/fail, which I think emboldened me even further."
Freshman,5,"I've had a great time so far, and the academic setting is a dream. Professors are accessible to undergrads and willing to talk with you about anything related to their field. The housing and food is hit-or-miss, but I have had good experiences with SEAS (accessibility services) when my needs weren't met."
Senior,5,"Brown is the most academically enriched, passionate place I've ever been. I'm entering my final year as an undergraduate, and have realized over the years that everyone I know at Brown is studying exactly the thing they most love. Many great speakers come to Brown, allowing students the chance to branch out from what they are familiar with and become well-rounded and knowledgeable about the world. I will say that as an Ivy League, it's inordinately wealthy and sometimes the attitudes that come along with high wealth like that can be frustrating. However, Brown will give you a challenging and creative academic experience, and you're likely to find a community you love as well."
Freshman,5,Brown University is one of the best undergraduate colleges in the world due to the attention it places on undergraduate studies rather than graduate work.
Freshman,5,"Brown is an excellent undergraduate institution with amazing faculty and an intimate feel. Fun fact: The CS department is really great, with CS now the most popular major at Brown"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Brown! It's got wonderful freedom available to all students and is a great campus with a diverse and eclectic student body.
Freshman,5,"I've really enjoyed my time at Brown. It is a place that emphasizes learning for the sake of learning, not just to get a grade or to be a means to an end. It has great opportunities for it's students and has the friendliest student body."
Niche User,5,Brown appears to be an awesome place to go to school.  I went on the campus tour and was really impressed.  Providence is also very nice.
Niche User,5,"A specific thing about Brown that I loved was that there are no required classes; the curriculum is very open. This way, I can take classes that I'm actually interested in. I loved the location in the city, the size, and of course the rigorous academics. I also loved the diversity of the students."
Freshman,5,"Brown University is an incredible place, that encourages students to take risks in order to follow their passions in life."
Junior,4,"As with any college, Brown has its ups and downs. I personally liked the academics offered here and there are plenty of resources that try to help students out. That being said, Brown may not do the best job of helping individual students out. Additionally, you will likely feel like an outsider if you are low income student from an urban area like myself. Overall, I’ve loved going to Brown and I know that the issues I have with the school are only worse at other schools, and for the most part, Brown tries to do its best to adapt to feedback."
Junior,4,"All things considered, Brown did its best to offer resources to all students. However, there are deeply rooted disparities between individual experiences from students, so there were plenty of people who felt their academics dipped as a direct result of going remote so suddenly. In the beginning, it was clear that Brown had in mind the generic student’s experience upon going remote, which ultimately left out a lot of perspectives from individuals who come from less affluent communities. It seems, however, that this is changing for the better as the university, and especially its professors, tries to improve on its mistakes."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my semester and a half at Brown, because of my friends, my roommate, my flexibility in academics, the campus and extracurriculars."
Junior,4,"Brown University is a great school with great faculty and staff. However, the administration could be improved by listening to its student body more."
Niche User,4,"It is a very good school. Very intelligent professors teaching for years. Diverse curriculum,but the school is open for students who only take a few courses as well. The night life and shopping in the area is good and the city is only 30 minutes from the major city of Boston."
Junior,4,My professors handled the transition to online learning well and were able to leverage Zoom and recorded lectures to accommodate students in time zones around the world.
Niche User,4,My sister attends Brown University and she loves it. The BSU has amazing discussions regarding current and important issues. During my time there I was introduced to the BSU house and had an amazing time being introduced to the student culture at Brown. Brown has an amazing campus and the relationship with RISD is dope. Having art students and intellectual students on the same campus (almost) is great. She has made friends at both schools and is having an amazing time.
Senior,4,"The academics and professors are at the top of their game, as expected. The deans are very considerate and work hard to make sure that any issues that arise for a student are taken care of with kindness. The mental health administrations in place try their best, but do not always succeed. With all that is happening concerning COVID-19, too much focus on the endowment and not enough on the workers and compensation is an issue that, yes, we students care about. The campus is gorgeous, food is generally okay, and the dorms--well, they're dorms."
Freshman,4,I really like the people at Brown. Everyone on campus is very friendly. The environment is not competitive like the other Ivies. People genuinely care about how you are doing.
Freshman,4,"My experience with Brown University, while limited, has been very good, especially when compared to the experiences of my peers attending other universities."
Niche User,4,"I studied here as a Pre-College student over the summer and I had an amazing experience throughout the time that I was there. Personally, the academic side of this school is not for me, however, the environment was so amazing and I would love to come back one day and work as a Summer Residential Assistant."
Niche User,4,"I loved that there were several things to do around the school. From the mall to the great variety of restaurants and weird shops, Brown is filled with so many activities in and around it. The dorms were not that nice as the paint was peeling off. It was also not very easy to navigate my way around campus but after close attention, I got the hang of the places I needed to be at."
Junior,4,"It is a very welcoming environment, however, nothing will be offered directly to you. You have to be able to seek out the help you need and know what it is you want to achieve. Additionally, the president of the University is unreachable and simply out of touch with student life, focused only on maintaining a good reputation of the school in mainstream media."
Niche User,4,Brown University advocates for a safe and interactive learning environment in which students can prepare themselves for their future careers.
Sophomore,4,"It encourages discussion and has the best undergraduate program in the nation, but I feel like it could do better in terms of reinvesting the money it receives in tuition to the students. There are many instances in which it came off as a money making corporation over a prestigious university."
Niche User,4,I really like the school overall for its academics which friends of mine which have attended Brown agree with. Brown provides a good supply of diversity by providing need based scholarships to minorities in need. The campus is gorgeous with excellent historical forms of architecture. Its a very safe school with excellent Dorms and chill party scenes. Brown University is a very good school!
Freshman,4,"My experience at Brown has been great so far. I enjoy having the Open Curriculum, and I think being able to take some classes for Satisfactory/No Credit grades allows for much academic freedom. The student community is generally supportive."
Junior,4,"Overall, a great school. Its just hard sometimes as the workload can be extremely demanding. But I love my professors!"
Niche User,4,A diverse community with interesting students and faculty. Many opportunities to create your own path.
Niche User,4,"It's reputation rightfully preceds it. I'm just now getting ready to enroll but I've worked with many who have attended or worked at brown, and I've always been impressed with the quality student they turn out."
Niche User,4,"I loved Brown university. They had amazing dorms, professors and food places. One thing I would like to see changed is the diversity , there was not a lot of minorities on campus so sometimes I felt discluded."
Sophomore,4,"Brown University is an amazing place with an amazing access to resources and diversity. There are a million and one clubs on campus that will ensure no one is left out (as long as you're willing and able to join those clubs). Brown has a reputation for being the ""easy"" Ivy because others think we don't have grades here. It's not true. Classes at Brown are just as challenging as other highly rated and top colleges. You will be challenged here. Luckily, it's easy to build a support system to help you out (formal and informal). It's not a cutthroat environment here."
Alum,4,"Brown University is an excellent university. It has a beautiful campus, great professors, and is nestled on top of the picturesque college hill. I attended for the academics, but found much more. Brown could definitely stand to improve the quality of the dorms/housing and should add more healthy vegan/vegetarian options to their food options."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Brown very much. If I could change one thing, it would be the premed advising process. Too many premeds are discouraged from applying to medical school, and this artificially inflates the statistics Brown boasts about medical school acceptance rates."
Junior,4,"Brown University is truly a place for exploration and self-discovery. The unique open curriculum allows students to explore and blend interests across fields. The student body is fairly diverse but there is room for an increase in diversity. I love that Brown University and its students actively work to make an accepting environment on campus. I do wish Brown made a greater effort to integrate themselves into the Providence Community since many students have noticed the ""Brown bubble"" within the community."
Sophomore,4,"The best thing about Brown is the students. My fellow classmates inspire me every day, and I have never met such hard-working, smart, entrepreneurial and socially conscious people. I also love the balance of work hard and play hard. Students are incredibly involved on campus and in the community, but all find time to relax and have fun on the weekends together."
Freshman,4,It is very relaxed compared to other ivy league schools.  Shopping period helps you destress about what classes to take and the option to take a class pass/fail lets you take courses which you are generally interested about without having to commit large amounts of time to them.
Senior,4,"Brown's open curriculum allowed me the flexibility to navigate multiple concentrations and decide which was best for me. Their diversity and inclusion efforts are also leading towards great institutional change. Most recently, these efforts have allowed for the creation of a First Generation and Low Income Student Center."
Freshman,4,"Great advising system, very welcoming community
I'm always impressed with my peers
Collaboration is encouraged among students, very little academic competition, which makes Brown unique among other Ivy League Schools."
Niche User,4,"Fantastic school, everyone there is to help you succeed and watch you grow into a professional. The classroom are the right size, so you can get the attention you need. The professors are always willing to go out their way to make sure you understand the lessons being taught in the classroom. There are plenty of on-hands activities to help you learn and advance in your field of study."
Sophomore,4,"Brown has excellent opportunities and everyone, from professors to students, is incredibly kind and helpful."
College Freshman,4,"Due to the openness of degrees here, careers range far and wide.  A problem with this though, is that it leaves a higher chance to not get a job in one's desired field."
College Freshman,4,"This is a great people, a great environment, and a great place to grow at.  Some things lack like housing and food but then again, that's not why we're all here."
College Freshman,4,Fraternities are generally open to the general student populace for events and there isn't much differentiation between non-Greeks and Greeks.
College Freshman,4,"So far, from what I'm learning about Brown, everyone is so different and I feel like that allows for a free flow of ideas which is amazing.  I feel so much more well-rounded as a result."
College Sophomore,4,I've learned so many things I never knew I could do.
College Sophomore,4,"There is an excellent selection of diverse classes offered at this school, as well as several fantastic and approachable professors; ones who are clearly passionate experts in their field of study.  There are also many classes of varying size, depending on the chosen department.  I have joined classes of 30 students and less, or over 200.  Writing and humanities classes tend to be smaller with the higher level STEM classes often dramatically shrinking in size compared to the introduction classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I am excited to pursue medical school after earning my bachelors in science degree, I believe there will be job/internship prospects with a degree from this school as well as after graduate school.  I have put trust in the alumni network as well as my own personal network to pursue a satisfying career upon graduation.  I have heard of excellent opportunities students have earned soon after their completion of undergrad.  The CareerLab on campus has also a few excellent mentors to aid students in their job search throughout their time here."
College Junior,4,It's not a state school but for an Ivy it's pretty great
College Junior,4,Not the same as a state school but for an Ivy it's pretty great
College Junior,4,Although varsity sports aren't the most exciting the extensive interest in intramurals makes up for it.
College Junior,4,"Most classes, especially in the humanities, are small which allows for more participation and discussion. It is fairly easy to get a hold of professors. Students are generally supportive of one another."
College Junior,4,"Most students usually get an internship, job, or research opportunity in the summer."
College Junior,4,Brown's undergraduate student population is very engaged in the issues across campus. Student groups are actively involved in making a difference outside of campus as well.
College Junior,4,"If you're intellectually curious, Brown is the school for you. I love the open curriculum and although the workload can be heavy at times, there is a lot of grade inflation and it is easy to get A's. There are only a few downsides to going here. Although the campus is gorgeous and the brick buildings give it that classic Ivy-League feel, but that comes at a cost- a lot of the amenities are outdated. Also, even though we have an amazing, intelligent, liberal student body, many (if not most) of the students seem to be very sheltered and immature, which is nothing out of the ordinary at an Ivy. However, with a reputation as the ""different"" Ivy, students at Brown are slightly less hoity-toity compared to the typical Ivy-Leaguer. As long as you're friendly to everyone and try keep an open mind, you're golden."
College Freshman,4,"Professors, even in large lecture classes, are always approachable and friendly. They are open to extensions when asked and even small talk. However, with the amount of time you have with each professor (this also depends on the size of the class) it's unlikely for you to become very friendly with any teachers throughout college unless you take initiative.

Classes can range from 7 people to 200. There are a variety of options, usually intro classes are big while seminars, language classes, and specific topic classes are smaller. With large classes there is an immense amount of TAs that are always available to help. They also run review/discussion sections to allow students to ask specific questions and get advice from experts who already aced the class. 

Most classes, in the humanities, make you do a lot of reading, have a smaller discussion section, and then 2-4 big assignments like midterms, finals, essays, take home exams, etc. 

The variety of courses speaks for itself. There are too many choices and they are all interesting!"
College Junior,4,During my stay here I have mostly had no issues regarding safety. Just use common sense and try to stay on campus late at night.
College Junior,4,"The facilities are excellent, but the hours can at times be limited."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is great, unless you get stuck at Perkins, which is WAYYYYY off campus. If you end up there, make sure to invest in a bike. Other than that, most of the rooms are either spacious, singles, or both. Try to avoid grad center sophomore/junior year as the singles are pretty tiny and gross. However, some of the other dorms are the nicest I've seen on a college campus and most of the freshmen doubles are spacious. Some even have bathrooms with bathtubs, and others have their own sinks. Many do not have either however."
College Freshman,4,"I would definitely say I am happy I chose brown, the number one reason being the open curriculum.

I am able to take whatever classes I want, and the 2 week shopping period lets me know if I'm going to like a class before I take it. Parties are just about the same as any other school, but more inclusive, which can be good, but sometimes they become overcrowded.

My number one complaint about this school would be bad grading by TAs. However, most of the instructors allow people to submit regrade requests and will fix poorly graded tests.

When I got mono first semester, I was able to work with my instructors and administration to come up with a plan and did not have to miss the rest of the semester."
College Sophomore,4,The open curriculum of my school makes choosing classes and topics that interest me really easy.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are great, professors are brilliant and engaging. I've learned a lot:"
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics at brown are important, but most students don't attend the events. Athletes are well treated and have access to the best coaches and facilities."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe walking around campus at night, and if you don't there are plenty of resources (Safewalk) for you."
College Freshman,4,"Sororities are becoming more popular on campus; therefore, it's getting more competitive to join one. I chose to rush and join a sorority because I could see the girls I met during the process becoming lifelong friends."
College Freshman,4,"Parties happen every week, usually from Thursday to Saturday, though sometimes on Tuesday and Wednesday as well. Many take place at clubs."
College Freshman,4,"If you like to party, there's a thriving party scene that you will find a home in. If you don't like to party, no worries--there are plenty of other things for you to do."
College Freshman,4,"We are a diverse and liberal body as related to ethnic/racial diversity, and we are generally very accepting of people of all races, sexual orientation, and religion. However, there is a strong anti-conservative feeling on campus, and most of the student body is very liberal and vocal about it."
College Freshman,4,"If you like drugs, whether they're hard or soft, you'll have access to them and the opportunity to try them. If you don't like drugs, you can avoid seeing most drugs (except marijuana), and no one thinks less of you if you don't partake. Alcohol is prevalent on campus, but not that many students drink regularly."
College Freshman,4,"With a degree from Brown, you can pretty much work anywhere you want."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are strange, quirky, and far too liberal"
College Junior,2,"Honestly, Greek Life isn't that big here, and the partying scene at frats are mostly frequented by first years. Greek Life actually suffers under the backdrop of this school's liberal atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,"There have been some robberies on the borders of campus. The middle is fine, but the side streets can be sketchy alone, and there needs to be more campus security on the edges of campus. It's mostly due to the location (Providence)."
College Freshman,2,"Not really big here. A lot of chapters got disbanded/kicked off campus, so the parties are usually pretty low-key."
College Freshman,2,Almost all of the fraternities are suspended due to sexual assault cases.
College Sophomore,2,"Few healthy options at most places. While Andrews has different food options, most of them are fried and/or greasy. The Vdub is not open on weekends, which is inconvenient. The only things available at Andrews after around 7 or 9 (don't remember which) are pizza and lo mein, which are not healthy. The salads there also aren't great, and the sushi is wildly expensive. The fruit is usually pretty banged up too. The Ratty can be okay, but usually the meals aren't great."
College Freshman,2,Not the best quality of food. Fruit is usually not ripe. Not a lot of healthy food options (limited types of fruits available). Should rotate fruit availability because I am allergic to almost every fruit they offer.
College Sophomore,2,There is a restaurant next to the school. The place looks old and unclean.
College Freshman,2,"Drinking and underage drinking is prevalent on Brown's campus as is marijuana use. It can be quite loud and distracting at times in the dorms, but I never feel pressured into joining drug and alcohol use."
College Freshman,2,"No one pays attention to the athletics at Brown. Occasionally, there is advertising for a sporting event, but more often there is not."
Recent Alumnus,2,"the administration is so bad! Getting them to respond to anyone's needs is an uphill battle, and they definitely are more liberal than the average Brown student- which means that if you have the slightest depression they can send you away for a year, if you're accused of sexual assault you're presumed guilty and punished, or if you want your place advertised as a summer sublet there's a good chance they will simply forget to advertise it and be unresponsive when you complain about it. All of those things have happened to people I know. Apparently Brown forgot to fill out a key question on US News college survey, resulting in very low rankings this year from that missed question. It doesn't surprise me that Brown would forget something like that, even though it's important to outside people. 

Most of the administration would have been great if Brown were the hippie-liberal-brainwashed school it was 15 years ago, but the students are now smart and sophisticated- which means that there's a lot of tension/hatred for deans and administrators. Although President Paxson is better at managing these things than Ruth Simmons was."
College Junior,2,It's pretty lame but laidback. Not a big deal.
College Freshman,2,"Most of our frats and sororities are kind of jokes, like really low-key, co-ed, and un-official, I think we only have like 4 or 5 stereotypical frats and sororities, and most people just think they're weird/insane. Greek organizations just live in certain dorms mixed in with other students, both independents and members of other frats/program houses."
College Freshman,2,I do not hear anything about our varsity athletics. I think we have some good teams but I'm not really sure. I've had athletes in my classes before but I'm not friends with any
College Freshman,2,"As with any New England weather, Providence's weather is not great. It's really cold for most of the school year (maybe a few warm weeks on either end) and often raining."
College Junior,2,Off-campus housing group does not help to find a house
College Junior,2,"i applied to a great deal of scholarships and haven't got any financial aid yet, even if now i really need it"
College Student,2,"It was very stressful and competitive, but the website and admissions officers answered many doubts."
College Student,2,"Cold most of the year, many rainy days."
College Sophomore,2,Providence is notoriously cold and rainy.  
College Freshman,2,"There are some great varsity and club teams, but games are generally poorly attended and some sport teams need work."
College Freshman,2,The main dining halls --Ratty and V-dub--aren't too good. They're really repetitive and the quality is mediocre. The campus eateries are alright but they get repetitive as well.
College Freshman,2,"Providence is pretty boring, unsafe, and gloomy. Now, other students will fight me on this (there are some Providence fanatics) but I personally didn't go to Brown for the fantastic city life."
College Freshman,2,"Don't come here if you want a classic sorority/ fraternity college experience. Most students don't join in on Greek life, but the frats DO host most weekend parties. Depends what crowd you fall into."
College Freshman,2,"College freshman don't have cars on campus, and only a small amount of upperclassmen do. I've heard finding parking is hard, but that's about it."
College Freshman,2,"Wifi is not the best. But with improvements to the campus, administration is working on it. "
College Freshman,2,"Campus police are present and there are many resources to promote safety. However, there are still occurrences of violence near campus, but not often at all. "
College Sophomore,2,"Most people on campus are involved in athletics, but there is limited fan support. "
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is commonly cold and very rainy, especially during fall semester. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking at Brown is difficult because of its location in Providence. The streets are somewhat narrow and the spaces available on the street are being made into permit parking only, at least during certain hours. The process to acquire parking is difficult and elusive as it is not highly advertised to those who may be interested. On the other hand, there is not much need for a car on campus because of the close proximity of dorms to classes and stores. Ticketing and fines are average and the parking enforcement is very diligent which can be both a good and bad thing depending on your view."
College Sophomore,2,"Frats are there if you want them, but they don't dominate the social scene.  The parties are open to anyone, although they sometimes charge a cover"
College Sophomore,2,"If alcohol is to be considered a drug, the availability and leniency of the substance for underage students is abhorrent. There is almost no addressing of this issue around campus as it pertains to underage drinking--although I do appreciate that judgment-free services are available for students who may sustain injuries from heavy intoxication without fear of legal consequence for their sickness. I only wish that there were more promotion against alcohol use instead of the ""blind eye."" 
While I am unaware of any heavy drug dealing at Brown, it's not uncommon for students to smell pot being smoked in or around dorm rooms, while preventative measures against it are not observed. It's also worth noting that Brown promotes its most popular concert series (Spring Weekend) around 4/20 day (April 20th, a day known for smoking marijuana in the States), and last year had its headline outdoor performance that day, no doubt to capitalize on the well-promoted social drug."
College Sophomore,2,"It rains ALOT for every season. Also, during the winter it snows and rarely is there a snow day. Luckily, classes are relatively close anywhere you live on campus and it is very lively when the sun comes out."
College Student,2,"Parking is impossible. Freshman are forbidden to have cars. Brown is in the middle of Providence, a busy city. It's always hard to find parking. But you don't really need a car - there's lots of public transportation, like a train or a bus to Boston, and lots of cabs and shuttles. Plus, the campus is all in a pretty compressed space, so it's easy to walk around. Just get out of the mindset of needing a car, and you'll be fine."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not very prominent at Brown.  There are many parties on the weekends, but one does not hear about community events as often.  There are only a few Greek houses so it is not a big deal to join a frat at Brown.  Currently there are no sororities, but one is in progress of getting Greek status."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is there for parties and some other events, but it doesn't dominate at Brown. It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. It's nice because you can go to frat parties, which can be fun, but it's not a status thing"
College Freshman,2,"Crime in Providence is pretty bad, and some assaults and robberies occur on campus--although mostly at night. Brown provides SafeRide and SafeWalk to help students deter situations such as these."
College Freshman,2,"New England. Tiny streets. Tourist attraction.
Its tough to find parking, but if you need it you'll find it (barring holidays)."
College Freshman,2,"Providence weather is very rainy and dreary most of the time. It doesn't always downpour, it's usually just annoying light rain and misting, just enough to make it humid and gross out."
College Freshman,2,"Brown did offer me financial aid but it was very little. My household is in the middle of their requirements for financial aid. We are neither rich nor poor, and they fail to recognize the fact that though my parents do make a decent living, it is still not enough to pay for tuition."
Freshman,1,"Brown University offers a great education, but unfortunately, they do not seem to sincerely care about their students. I had a terrible roommate situation, and the deans did nothing to help me."
College Freshman,1,Sometimes I forget that we have sports here...
Recent Alumnus,1,"1. Freshman housing is actually some of the best on campus.

2. BUT everything sucks from there. Grad Center is where many sophomores and juniors (and now even seniors) live, and the living conditions are deplorable. Black mold, concrete, barred windows, and rooms that haven't been properly cleaned since the 80s don't even begin to describe! 

Unfortunately it is the largest dorm on campus, so many unlucky folks are stuck there for 2 or even 3 years. 

3. Don't bank on getting a single as a junior…my lottery group was one away from having to be in doubles.

4. This would not be horrible if we were given the option to live off campus starting in say our sophomore year- but off campus is only really guaranteed to seniors. juniors can apply to live off campus, but most are not granted off campus permission, so you need to bank on living in forms for 3 years. 

If you care about the cleanliness or condition of dorm rooms, I would not go to Brown. Living conditions are a very important part of your experience (that I underestimated), and the lottery/no off-campus till senior year combo give you very limited (and often bad) options."
College Freshman,1,No drugs should be used on campus. Period.
College Freshman,1,Not much need for a car in the first place. But parking is sparse and not easily procured. 
College Sophomore,1,There is hardly any parking on campus and off campus spots can also be hard to come by or expensive. 
College Senior,1,Frats are not a very prominent part of life at Brown.
College Senior,1,"I love the people at this school, but don't come here if you want nice dorms or expect to have complaints taken seriously by the administration. The housing is run down to the point where me and my friends wonder whether the administration is trying to get upperclassmen to move off campus so that they can totally rehab the dorms. A majority of the student body live in Grad Center- the black mold is so bad there that I know someone whose asthma got substantially worse during the year they lived there and literally had mold growing in their lungs when they finally went to the hospital. 

ResLife also sucks, they don't care if your living situation is comfortable for your needs or even safe...the heat in my best friend's room was broken and she tried to get it fixed, the admin never really tried to, and she had to get through a Northeast winter without heat. Not good.  

The reason I didn't give housing an F is that the housing off campus is actually really nice, cheap and close to campus! I would highly recommend it!"
College Junior,1,Weather seems even worse then the rest of the east coast
College Junior,1,"Pretty terrible food. The  ""points"" versus meal credit system is also incredibly inefficient financially. in my opinion, protein is the biggest problem. no real consistent source ,and they got rid of a lot of the good protein sources at the salad bar."
College Junior,1,"It can be so icy that everyone is literally crawling to class, and they will not cancel classes. One guy broke his nose because he was walking with his hands in his pockets and slipped."
College Freshman,1,Providence is very small and there are a lot of people so it is always very crowded so there's hardly any room to park. The parking garage that is very empty is very far away from everything so it's not really worth it to park there.
College Freshman,1,"Providence Is a Small City! Parking for students at Brown is pretty much a no-go. Having said that, you don't really need a car - try walking across the city!"
College Junior,1,I think about 11% of Brown is involved in fraternities or sororities. Fine by me.
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Bring a Car. Parking is bad.  Don't bring a car if at all possible.  Only bring a car if you have your own place off-campus with a parking space, and that only happens your senior year (and very rarely as a junior).  You really don't need a car anyway, generally speaking."
College Sophomore,1,"No one really pays much attention to sports at Brown, as it is with most ivy league universities. There's always the occasional basketball or football game that many people will attend out of the year, but overall sports are not of much significance expect to athletes."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Do It – There are very few parking spots, besides the student lot. Streets are narrow, so inexperienced drivers beware."
College Senior,1,Freezing rain and high speed winds really keeps students indoors and makes me not want to go ANYWHERE beyond my dorm. The few weeks of nice weather in September and April/May are definitely not enough to cover for the crappy cold rain and wind October to March.
College Sophomore,1,"Saferide Sucks – SafeRide service does not have much room, and it is more of a van than a shuttle with rude and incompetent drivers."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in providence is always unpredictable, yet it usually gets very cold."

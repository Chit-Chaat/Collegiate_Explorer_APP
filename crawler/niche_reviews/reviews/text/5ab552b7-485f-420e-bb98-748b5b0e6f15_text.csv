Alum,5,I took a couple undergraduate classes and all of my graduate classes were online.  They use a program called Sakai and it was incredibly easy to learn and use.  Professors always replied back quickly if I ever had any questions.
Freshman,5,"This is a very very good college, with the help of leadership all around the campus you can do many things. The college is excellent for people with a outlook of being in a small college christian atmosphere. I would highly recommend this college."
Senior,5,"Kentucky Christian University has served me by being a place where I can grow spiritually, socially, and academically. Chapel services on both Tuesdays and Thursdays helped show me the importance of being immersed in the Word day in and day out. The professors in the Bible and Ministry department have poured into me and have given me ample opportunities to invest in the lives of churches around KCU."
Niche User,5,I loved the fact that everyone was so welcoming and polite. They would literally do anything for me to go there. The administration was so kind and I really couldn't have anything better to say about this college.
Junior,5,Kentucky Christian is such a great university. Everyone is such a great person. The professors truly care. I am so glad I picked a small Christian university.
Freshman,5,Small class size and everyone knows your name.  I have  enjoyed meting lots of new people from all over the world.
College Freshman,5,I live in a quad and its awesome. We have our own bathrooms and a living space in the main living area to socialize and have fun with friends.
College Freshman,5,I feel like a person at Kentucky Christian University. Not just a number or another student. It feels like home and everyone is so caring including the professors. That is why my university is different from other big universities.
College Sophomore,5,"I love living on campus. I am in the best housing on campus with 4 of my closest friends. We each get our own bathrooms and there is a very spacious common living area. It is easy slightly more expensive then the other dorms on campus, but it is well worth it! The housing process is easy and quick, no hastle."
College Senior,5,"A very modern, small, open campus with newly built and modern dorms and spacious parking."
College Senior,5,This is a small campus with about 700 students there is more than adequate and very convenient parking.
College Senior,5,"The handbook and guidelines for living on campus at Kentucky Christian University are very strict but fair. As Christian and a student of a Christian establishment, we have a certain standard and certain ways of life to uphold and our rules reflect that."
College Senior,5,Our athletes are one of the driving forces of our school. Without them we may not have enough students to be considered a University.
College Senior,5,"I love the weather in Kentucky. However, it is even more beautiful in certain parts and one of them being KCU. The weather is never too hot, nor too cold, depending on the time of year!"
College Student,5,"Eating in the Small Town of Grayson – We have a few fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, taco bell, Wendy's, Arby's all of which have reasonable prices. McDonald's however gives students of our university a discount of 40 cents off of our total meal cost. Then we have a few restaurants that are sit down style thelat serve a variety of things from Italian cuisine to Mexican each places costs are depending on what u get. One of the best places is probably tres harmonos it is a Mexican style restaurant and has good prices as well as variety and convienence."
College Sophomore,5,"Gals and Guys – The girls and guys are both smal town people.  Although there is a large variety of people at the school, there is a close connection between the small town students as well."
College Sophomore,5,Safety at Its Finest – I've never felt unsafe at school.  There are plenty of people around willing to help and make you feel as safe as if you were at home.
Recent Alumnus,5,Education Student AND Bible Studies Student – I loved both my majors at KCU!! I would not trade them for anything. KCU has a TOP NOTCH education program that actually prepares you for a real education career as well as preps you for life as a graduate student. The staff of the ed department cared about you a lot and knew everyone. The workload was difficult sometimes but it was not bad at all.
College Freshman,5,"Hills of Kentucky – Kentucky Christian University is located in a small town called Grayson... Not much to do in Grayson, but summer fun at Grayson Lake and local towns such as Ashland and Huntington are the center of night life off campus. ON CAMPUS, we have a family Life Center where we can play pool, ping pong, rac-ball, tennis, or just kick back and watch the game. The school library is extension and is an ideal location for studies and research. I am blessed to be a student here at Kentucky Christian University."
College Freshman,5,Yea to Drug Free – KCU is a drug free. And that is a big ok in my book.  I'm so against drugs.  I like the thought of going to a school were i don't have to worry about drugs being everywhere.  That is such a good feeling.
Alum,4,"God used KCU and the people there to change my life.  It quickly became home and the students, faculty, and staff quickly became family.  It's not a perfect place, but  it's a place where I was valued by my professors and challenged to be the best version of myself."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman, and I am looking forward to attending KCU. I look forward to the next 4 years of my life at Kentucky Christian and graduating with my degree in history."
Alum,4,"God has used this campus to change my life.  The faculty and staff mentored me and showed me they cared by inviting me in their homes and loving me as a person, not just a student.  I didn't go to a diverse high school, and KCU was a place I learned how to be a part of and respect others who didn't look or think like me.  KCU became my home and my family.  Honestly, choosing KCU has been the best decision I have ever made.  My connections, friends, and love for Jesus grew in extreme ways and I know it's because of the people I was surrounded by there."
Senior,4,"Atmosphere is everything to me , I believe that KCU offers a great positive environment that incorporates Christ and Character."
Freshman,4,"The school is pretty decent. I originally had a hard time with it but once I put more thought about it, it really opened up. There are good people here but you have to find him. The Christianity on campus is very liberal, a lot of people drink which is the opposite of what I wanted. I wish they would add more on campus but it is overall pretty good."
Sophomore,4,"Kentucky Christian University has become a place I like to think of as a home away from home. The faculty and staff are constantly there for students, and I feel like everyone is like a huge extended family on campus. I love being able to grow in my faith while also learning what  is need to pursue my career."
College Freshman,4,"Kentucky Christian University does not have a really big student section like other schools, but people still support the teams and it is a lot of fun. We have an awesome gym with new equipment, a sauna, and a hot tub. It is super nice and I love to work out in there. People are always willing to help you or show you how to do something in the gym. Everyone has a good Christian behavior."
College Sophomore,4,"solid facilities, just students do not always have access to them"
College Sophomore,4,"There is certainly enough variety, any fast food you can think of"
College Sophomore,4,"No problems with it, once again they hold your hand."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing process is super easy, I have never had an issue with it and the school basically holds your hand through the already simple process.  My dorm has a fantastic social atmosphere, there is always something to do either in the lobby or someones room."
College Freshman,4,"Weather doesn't affect the campus too much. However, snow can cause issues."
College Freshman,4,Security works well on campus
College Freshman,4,The school administrators and RAs take their jobs seriously
College Sophomore,4,Parking is not bad at all at my school. There are many parking lots to get close to the buildings you want to be in and everything is just walking distance! 
College Senior,4,"The student body is diverse in terms of SES and national origin but not diverse in religious background as you might expect at a Christian school.
"
College Senior,4,I worked in the food service at one time and I know that it is of good quality and well prepared.
College Senior,4,"The secret, as it is most places, is file your FAFSA as early as possible. Late FAFSA equals less money."
College Senior,4,"Many updated and modern facilities are available. Lot's of open space, contemporary housing, and virtually new athletic facilities.
"
College Senior,4,The Christian standards and atmosphere and the commitment to ministry and education working hand in hand.
College Senior,4,The main deficit at KCU is a lack of Music Education. There is Music Business and Performance but no Music Education program.
College Senior,4,"A good education with Christian standards.
"
College Senior,4,This school has offered me a quality education with Christian standards.
College Sophomore,4,"Throughout the Business Program, I have had plenty of opportunities from internships, the professors are very personal and care about you on a first name basis, not only do they care about your grades, but your home life and spiritual life as well. "
College Sophomore,4,"The workload in the Business Program includes a lot of group projects about real world situations, it is not bad, it can be very entertaining and helpful as a future reference. "
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is a Christian University so I believe that the required chapels and the worship nighs would set our campus apart. We also have a small campus, only 500-600 students so you never really see a new face. You get to know your professors on a personal basis which is wonderful with one-on-one help"
College Sophomore,4,"I love on campus! So much so that sometimes I don't want to go home on the weekends. We have atheltic events that are very popular to students on and off campus. We have a great lifecenter with a lounge and fun leisure activities such as a hot tub, sauna, ping pong, fooseball, a coffee shop, etc. We always have something going on on campus, weather it be KCU's got talent, open mic, movie night, haunted house, worship night, human fooseball, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of options for any person, includes salad bar, main bar, subs, taco bar, yogurt bar, and dessert bar!"
College Sophomore,4,"We have a great athletic program on campus, lots of sports, and even people who do not participate in the sports come to the games to support. We have a lot of school spirit. We have a great athletic training room, locker rooms, weight rooms, etc."
College Sophomore,4,I love our food services. Our cafeteria is open from 7am to 7 pm every night except on the weekends. Salad bar and sub line and fruit is always available and the hot line is available during meal times. There are many options and a variety of foods. 
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is very stric. No girls in the guys dorm and vice versa, unless it's an open dorm night or a visitation time in the lobby. Curfew is enforced every night. The Cost is a bit high if you ask me, it's around $5,000. Finding a roommate is never a problem, or never has been for me. Also, the dorms are in pretty good shape"
College Sophomore,4,"Neither drugs nor drinking is permitted on campus. The school is very serious about enforcing these rules and the students are not dumb enough to participate in such activity, knowing the consequences. If they do participate, it is usually off campus and they know to make sure no one finds out."
College Sophomore,4,I love the nursing program here! I would absolutely do it over again. It is very difficult but it pays off! I hope to become a missionary one day and travel around the world as a medical missionary providing aid to underprivileged countries. I do not have any concerns about finding a job later in life.
College Sophomore,4,"As a nursing major, an internship would consist of a big time commitment, many responsibilities regarding patients on the floor. I do plan to participate in clinicals in hospitals later. I don't have any concerns about finding a willing hospital. The nursing program definitely prepares their students to be successful in the real world after college "
College Sophomore,4,Over 85% of the students are involved in some type of sports related activity. The school and professors support our sports teams very well! 
College Junior,4,"It is fairly safe at this school. I don't think I have ever felt unsafe. Most people leave their dorms or even apartments unlocked. While I wouldn't recommend that, I haven't heard of anyone having any problems as of yet. There is a specific group of students that are a little more sketchy than the rest, but even then, I would say there is not much to worry about."
College Senior,4,"Parking on Campus has improved with the addition of a new parking lot. There are now more spots available closer to class, dorms, and offices so the walking distance has decreased. It is a huge improvement from previous years."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a variety of majors, but the small faculty size makes it impossible to explore activities not specifically in your major."
College Freshman,4,"When I first started at KCU, I was inrolled in the Social Work Program.  After one semester I realized that was not what I wanted to do.  My advisor helped me to change majors and it was relatively painless."
College Freshman,4,Kentucky Christian University is a Christian school.  Drugs and drinking are discouraged for obvious reasons.  Most students come here for their education but there are a few students that break the rules.
Niche User,2,"I attended KCU in the fall of 15-16’. While I love the Christian atmosphere, the chapel twice a week, the “small town feel”. It was NOT a Christian atmosphere at all. There was sex and drugs EVERYWHERE. The professors and staff don’t give a damn about you or your faith . They care about the sports. Worse of all they don’t suggest any advice for financial aid . When I went to ask about some problems they gave me basic answers, telling me to use internet . No REAL help. Hopefully with a new president coming they can go back to their roots . My minister and a bunch from my church graduated from there in the past when it was actually a credible college. It’s a money trap . Think before you enroll and that goes for ANY college ."
College Sophomore,2,"our administration is terrible. they make awful rules that no one wants to follow, so when some people end up breaking the rules they don't get caught, but If certain groups break the rules, then there are consequences for them. They are too strict about every little last thing and it gets incredibly frustrating and makes the students want to rebel even more then they already do."
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall is very small and cramped. It's always loud and somewhat messy. The food is sometimes good but it's always hit or miss. It's outrageous how much we pay and what little we get in return.
College Junior,2,There are only fast food restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,The wifi at my school is absolutely horrible and you can never depend on it! If you have anything due online you can't wait till the last minute or bad luck may strike with the wifi. Computer labs are available one in the library and one in another building on campus. As for a printer I refuse to pay 10 cents per page in the library so I bought my own. 
College Sophomore,2,The school is not very helpful with getting the money that you need for college. They give you some but are not helpful when it comes time for you to need more. I am currently dealing with trying to find more money so I am not in debt for the rest of my life. 
College Sophomore,2,its a really small campus its hard to be somewhere where no one could see if something happened i can walk across campus in under five minutes not walking fast 
College Sophomore,2,you got all the fast food you will ever want! theres little seasers right off campus ($5 pizza!!! its always a yes) and Italian and also Asian 
College Junior,2,The weather is the same as anywhere else. Completely bipolar and can change drastically between days.
College Freshman,2,The Food – the cafe is open from 7 am till 730 pm and you can go in as much as you want some times the food is not the best but the staff works their hardest to fix this
College Freshman,2,Grayson KY – This is a small town with not a lot to do. but the campus life is slow but the friends you make here will make it all the better
College Freshman,2,"Depending on whether or not your parents pay for your schooling determines whether or not getting financial aid taken care of is easy or difficult. I personally have had difficulty getting my financial aid worked out when I want it done, however the ladies in charge are very easy to get along with and they do want to help you as best as they can. Most of them anyway."
Niche User,1,"Homophobia? In my future college? No thank you🥵😤✌️ 










P.s. don’t claim to be an amazing Christian school and then not love people for who they are :("
Freshman,1,"Terrible student services director, horrible relations with parents and students. Mold in dorms. dangerous campus. security rarely around and unresponsive to student calls. Fines for literally anything the student services director can think of."
Niche User,1,My girlfriend goes to school here. She hates it. Right now she cant sleep in her room on the first floor because she is afraid of a perv who has been stalking girls and tried to grab on and tried to break in the dorms. This man has been on campus every night for a week and the police and “campus security” cant seem to catch him. The food is awful. 1/10 meals taste good. Today she got a moldy potatoe for dinner. The administration is absoulty terrible and all they want is money. The rules are pointless and very strict. They even have a curfew. College Freedom right? Besides the school there is absolutly nothing to do in greyson. I have visited multiple times and we simply sat in the student center for hours because the nearest anything is a 49 minuete drive. Im not even a student and i hate it just based off my girlfriends experience. She fears for her safty at this school and is leaving as soon as possible.
Niche User,1,"The only thing about this school that is good, is you are going to get you're degree, with no effort."
College Sophomore,1,"there are not suppose to be any parties on campus. However, if there is an occasional party i'd assume it would be pretty fun as long as it doesn't get too wild or out of control."
College Senior,1,"This may change as Grayson was, until recently, dry. Legal alcohol has only be available a very short time."
College Sophomore,1,unless you are in waters or jones drinking and drugs really arnt a thing here its part of the christian thing  (they are also strict on pda...)
College Sophomore,1,almost all student have to live on campus or with parents unless you are married or other special arrangements are made but those are seldom
College Sophomore,1,its southern food... theres a sub bar a allday breakfast area a ala carte area pizza barand the main meal some days its ok but others its nasty... i eat a lot of pizza it is not for the healthy minded 
College Sophomore,1,there are like 2 labs and a few in the library. and the wifi can be bad when everyone is on at the same time 
College Sophomore,1,if it were not for the football id be saying what diversity...
College Sophomore,1,"this area is prone to tornadoes but to me at least, winter isnt to bad but im form the north so thats just my opinions and there are warning sirens that are anoying they are tested on friday afternoon every other week 
 "
College Sophomore,1,its an expensive school your scholarships prolly wont cover it all get a summer job or ask your parents and have a good act score and gpa
College Sophomore,1,its ok depending on what dorm you are in for girls you want east or west but freshman never get them they are in dale :( and for guys it depends on what you do. if you are in soccer you're in jonse and get your own room or you're football or basket ball you are in waters (sorry waters sucks... yuck!) if you are non sporty you will be in pifer. 
College Sophomore,1,"the football and soccer boys are typical athletes and theres not a whole lot of ""preppy"" people here but many are pretty religous"
College Sophomore,1,kcu does not roll like that in waters and jones you can find booze but they don really party much some go to clubs in hunttington but that 45 minutes away
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is really no option to live off-campus unless you are over 23, married, or living with family. Otherwise off-campus housing is prohibited, something I severely disagree with. Most students will graduate before they are 23."

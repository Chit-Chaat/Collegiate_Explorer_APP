Also, I have been helped and supported by the staff in the university. Overall, I really love being a student at Emporia State University."
Graduate Student,5,"I really enjoy online classes. Professor are supportive to all the students. The class materials are available online for all of us. Also, professor meet with us outside of class if we need any help. Especially now, during Covid-19, professors are very understanding."
Sophomore,5,"Emporia's a great school, it's got an amazing friendly atmosphere, the teachers are understanding and the class sizes are small for more one on one experience. They offer a variety of programs and we're not limited by our degrees or extra expenses for the amount or type of classes we want to take"
Sophomore,5,Online experience was made very helpful! Professors are always welcome to help and answer questions.
Freshman,5,I feel at home with Emporia State University! The town and school are very cute and friendly and everything is nearby.
Freshman,5,"Between both students and faculty, Emporia State University is a very diverse college. They have so many opportunities for students and so many discounts all around town. The library is my favorite place, with four different levels of noise range for you to study."
Niche User,5,Emporia State is a great school for students from small towns. The class sizes are not as large as many schools are and many times students are able to receive any extra help they may need. There is also a lot of fun events for the students to participate in around campus.
Freshman,5,I liked that the college was homey and not too big. It is the perfect size for wanting Division 1 amenities without it being lonely. The faculty are all so accommodating and truly want the best for you.
Freshman,5,"In the few weeks I have been here, I absolutely love Emporia State University. The campus is gorgeous. The people, both on campus and in town, are very kind and have a lot of school spirit. The professors and staff members are very well educated in their given field, which bodes well for my education. There are some really refined programs on campus as well, especially the education department, which I am closely involved with. From the first moment I walked on campus, I was accepted and invited. I have enjoyed every moment on campus, even when I was still a high school student on a tour. The surrounding spirit and love for Emporia are extremely contagious."
Senior,5,"I enjoy the close and personal feel of Emporia State. The classes are small and manageable. The teachers take time to meet and know their students. I am in the Earth Science program which is great, but still small. I would like to see the program get more funding to do research and to buy more equipment."
Junior,5,Emporia State is a really close knit community and university. We are a smaller campus and I really liked that coming from a smaller high school. Class sizes are small and most professors would like to see you succeed and will do whatever to help you out. I am really involved on campus with several different band ensembles and I really enjoy that and being involved.
Graduate Student,5,Excellent facility and staff so far.  Good value for the cost.  Can not wait to spend  more time learning with them as an online student.
Graduate Student,5,I've just been accepted into the Graduate program to study library and information science and am very excited about the flexible program.
Sophomore,5,"I love my time at Emporia State so far. I just finished my first year (yes, I survived) There really has been no downside to the teachers, the classes, and the workload at all!"
Niche User,5,"When I first visited Emporia State University I instantly fell in love with the institution. The admissions team was very welcoming and made everyone comfortable throughout the visit. Not only is the campus and staff amazing, but so are the students. Everyone is very inviting and willing to help out with any issues you may come across. One thing that really drew me to ESU was how affordable it is. Not to mention the flat rate tuition. The fact that I can take as many classes as I want for just one price is amazing. I am beyond excited to be attending ESU and will be shouting STINGERS UP with pride!!"
Freshman,5,Emporia State University is a wonderful campus. They have a great community and fun activities to do all around town. I highly suggest on looking further into attending ESU.
Freshman,5,The smaller class sizes allow for students to make better connections with professors. The professors seem to genuinely care about student success and happiness. The school offers many great resources for all academic and social needs.
Graduate Student,5,Very nice people to discuss school options with.  Very informative when it comes to discussing the different options for going to school.
Junior,5,"I like the School of Business at ESU the most. The advisors are fantastic and the courses are great for those like me who want to earn a general business degree without settling on a specific discipline. ESU is a little behind when it comes to online classes, but they're gradually catching up, so there'll be plenty of online classes for myself and future students in the future."
Freshman,5,"Emporia State University is an amazing college campus. Emporia is a small community, and a great community to attend school at. I am very excited to be attending Emporia this fall."
Niche User,5,"The college has a small more personal feel. When you walk down the sidewalk you always seem to know someone and everyone is very nice and friendly. The college is a very good fit for me.  It is close enough to home that I can go home on weekends, but yet also far enough away from home that I will still have the freedom of a college student. The teaching program is amazing. I look forward to attending school there in the fall. The campus is very beautiful and all the buildings are within walking distance."
Graduate Student,5,The teachers at ESU are friendly and helpful. Online classes are made easy and possible with the help of staff members and oportunities given to each student.
Niche User,5,Emporia State University is very welcoming to students of all different backgrounds. There is something for everyone interested in attending a 4-year college at ESU.
Senior,5,"I have been at this college for one semester and it has been nothing but amazing. My instructor goes well out of her way to help me and make sure everything is running smooth. From admissions to the class, everyone is willing to help and make sure everything is taken care of so you can focus on your studies."
Junior,5,"Great school with amazing student body! Cute little town too! this was my dream school and I am so lucky to be apart of the student body! Teachers, and students do an incredible job on making sure all students feel welcome. The town is also very welcoming. I wouldnâ€™t have wanted a better place to call home."
Niche User,5,Emporia State University is a big school but is small enough for small town people like me. I am looking forward to attending Emporia for their Crime and Delinquency studies. They are open to many payment options and they have many great student activities to join.
Senior,5,"I love the sense of community ESU has!  I grew up in a small town, and ESU was the perfect transition.  Not to mention ESU has one of the best education programs in the country.  Also, Emporia has fantastic attractions and many things to do."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so sweet and friendly! I cant wait to become a successful teacher thanks to Emporia! The town seems safe, the apartments seems affordable and the school is extremely welcoming."
Freshman,5,I like the way they have the classes set up. They give a good family experience and better opportunities. The community is very helpful and nice. I hope there would be more exciting things to do but if you are looking for a relaxing environment and a place to focus on school this would be it. The sporting events are very exciting every in the community comes to watch and support and you knowing the athletes makes it a great experience
Senior,5,My overall experience at Emporia State University is great! ESU has valuable resources and professors to help you get along the journey. Emporia State University has a close knit environment and friendly community-university relationship.
Graduate Student,5,Good online program for Earth Sciences.  The staff is very nice and helpful. There seems to be a great opportunity to further my career.
Senior,5,"During my time at Emporia State University, I was able to have dozens of opportunities that I would not have been able to have at other schools. Between being involved in Greek Life, half a dozen student organizations, and volunteering on campus, I loved my time on campus. ESU does a great job of helping students find internships and jobs when graduation approaches, which makes the transition out of ESU just as easy as the transition into ESU. Additionally, because ESU has the 2nd lowest student debt in the Midwest, is a College of Distinction, and has a 98% Job/Higher Education placement rate after graduation, it is easily the best school in the state of Kansas. Flat rate tuition is a life saver, allowing you to take an overload of credit hours and pay the same rate you would pay at 10 credit hours."
Graduate Student,5,"ESU is a great 4 year university in Kansas that has great tuition rates.  I took my general ed courses at a community college so unable to talk about those course at ESU, but my core classes were great.  Class sizes were not big and I was not just a number.  The professors in the physical sciences department and education department were great. All of the professors I had were always available and easy to talk to.  The town of Emporia as a whole isnâ€™t too big and reminded me of my hometown growing up.  Great college."
Sophomore,5,"I love how Emporia State University loves their sports. I am a sporty girl and I love sports as well, and being able to be myself in the stands along with everyone else, is so cool. I love how small it is, because it is super easy to make lifelong friends in just a short amount of time."
Junior,5,The art program is my home! I love all of my professors except maybe one. I feel like I've learned so much and I still have two years to go!
Graduate Student,5,Taking online courses - instructors are very good at creating a virtual classroom environment.  The scheduling is done in a fair manner and course offerings are relevant to my major
Freshman,5,I love the small student to professor ratio and the awesome school population. There is always something going on at Emporia State and it is by far one of the best colleges in the Midwest
Alum,5,"The university is amazing! The campus is very welcoming and makes you feel at home. The class sizes are not to big, and not to small. The professors are there for you to make sure you get the best education you deserve. Overall, Emporia State University was the best fit for me and my career choice as a teacher."
Senior,5,I have only been at Emporia State University for 2 years but I have loved every minute of it! The campus is beautiful and just small enough that it is easy to walk to all of your classes. All of my professors have been super helpful and will work with you on whatever you need. I highly recommend this school!
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere is amazing! The town itself is fabulous and there is a lot of fun places to go and things to do in Emporia. I love the overall feeling of everything there and it's such an amazing place to be.
Junior,5,"Emporia State is a great small town school, even though they are D2. Everything on campus is a convienent walk (15-20 minutes from front to back). The Teacher's College is nationally rank and the school of business is AACSB accredited. The campus has flat rate tuition and fees within that such as printing, laundry, and campus wifi. There will also be a new residential hall opening fall of 2019. Overall, I love going to school here and would not want to go anywhere else."
Niche User,5,Everyone was really nice and the teachers sat down and talked to me about different ways I could go with the career I wanted
Freshman,5,"Emporia State's environment is one to remember. The college is an average sized Division 2 school, but has the environment and student involvement as a Division 1 University. One can tell that everyone on campus is there for a reason and it is to succeed farther in their education and meet their career goals. The faculty is excellent when it comes to making sure students are there and engaged in order to keep them motivated as well. Emporia State is an excellent campus and an excellent place to get one's degree."
Freshman,5,This university is great!! The teachers are very helpful and nice. You won't be disappointed. I am from Emporia and the town is very nice but it can get boring. Not much variety for shopping. The bars are a lot of fun. Emporia State will give you a great education and the sport events are a tradition. Watching the Lady Hornets and Hornets play basketball are so much fun!! Football is starting to make a comeback and tailgating is amazing!!
Freshman,5,I love the home town atmosphere that Emporia State has to offer. As a student you don't get lost in the crowd like other universities. You have endless opportunities to get involved and have fun.
Freshman,5,"I would like to say that Emporia State is one of the best colleges in Kansas. If you are looking for a great college experience, a lot of extra-curricular opportunities, excellent education, and significantly cheap tuition, Emporia State will be the place for you. This school has such a great learning environment, the people here are so nice and so embracing to one another. I have never thought that my experience in college would be that great."
Niche User,5,"Love the School, very safe and friendly environment. Teachers care about how youre doing in the class and outside the class. Food takes a lot better than most any other college food tastes, dorms are super nice and brand new."
Niche User,5,I am from a small town and went to a tiny high school. I went to ESU and felt at home. The campus is absolutely spectacular and the class rooms are very nice also the food in cafeteria is great too!
Freshman,5,"I love the campus atmosphere, though I wish the food provider was different. The closeness of the buildings helps me to get to classes on time. The small class size allows me to have a better relationship with  my professors, and feel more comfortable asking for help."
Junior,5,"I thoroughly am enjoying Emporia State. Academics are great despite being a Division 2 school. Diversity and inclusion is phenomenal and progressive. There is not so much visual diversity, but there is a wave of understanding of diversity equity and inclusivity and an entire department dedicated to it. Athletics are great. There is a lot of money invested into Athletics and many of the teams reach state competitions. There is quite the variety of professors at Emporia State. There are some that are only interested in their career, but an equal amount are also dedicated to their students. Dorms are great. There is currently construction for a new upperclassmen dorm. Campus is beautiful and has an abundance of squirrels. The party scene is about average in Emporia with a 18+ club/bar and multiple 21+ bars. House parties are not a thing. The local area is very friendly, especially to students. The town has some big town/city amenities with a small town vibe."
Freshman,5,"They have your best interest and want you to succeed. My adviser and Resident Assistants are amazing and help me step by step until I get what I needed. When I first applied I wouldn't have thought of such a great college. Students become family and staff becomes mentors. The professors are awesome, they don't want you to fail and are willing to give you extra chances if you are willing to try harder."
Sophomore,5,I love emporia state. campus is so pretty and I love the community on campus. It's small enough where I know quite a bit of people but still big enough that I don't feel well known.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed Emporia State University for many reasons. One of them is that they have a great campus and it is very well put together. It seems that everything is in the right location for efficiency. The diversity of the students and staff is just fantastic. Everyone is very friendly and I look forward to attending Emporia State.
Freshman,5,"I love Emporia State and I'm not saying that just because I've lived here all my life. Emporia is so charming and lively. We always have something going on and the overall ESU campus is beautiful and inviting as well. You could walk outside and there would be a squirrel 5 feet away, it's awesome. If I were to have lived somewhere else and I had the choice to pick any university, I would still choose Emporia State. I like it because it's not too big and not too small, it's the perfect size so you can still get the help you need. It has a great nursing program and many sports and clubs you can get involved in. I also like how there are people from different backgrounds. I've only been at ESU for about half a year now and I honestly can't wait for the years ahead of me!"
Sophomore,5,I like the environment and people. It is a very small town and has a very quite comfortable atmosphere.
Alum,5,Emporia State is a fantastic school! With smaller class sizes you get to connect with your professors and are not just a number. The flat rate tuition makes it easier to pursue your dreams quicker or learn something that you wouldn't consider taking if you were paying per credit hour. There are plenty of things to be a part of on campus. Undergraduate research is also supported which would rarely happen at a large campus.
Senior,5,"I love this school. I was a residential assistant one year, president of a club the next, there are so many ways to get involved. Not to mention the learning environment is amazing. You get one on one attention with all of your professors if you take the effort to reach out and make the connection. everyone I have come in contact with in the community is excited to meet you and it is a really good atmosphere."
Junior,5,"Emporia State University is a small, friendly campus with excellent professors that are willing to work with you one-on-one. Small class sizes mean more individualized time with your professors to ensure success. The campus is small but beautiful and well-maintained. It is easy to get from one building to another."
Niche User,5,"I like the small town atmosphere, while still being able to enjoy the conveniences of Walmart. It's nice to know most of your classmates, while also being able to drive a short distance to get necessities and random impulse buys. Living about an hour away from any major store is kind of a bummer."
Sophomore,5,This university is amazing and beautiful. There is a lot of diversity and an organization for everyone. The teachers are amazing and willing to help.
Sophomore,4,I just transferred here from Wichita State University and I am very pleased. All of the faculty that I have met really cares about the success of the students. It is a very comfortable and safe campus. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is pursuing an education degree in particular.
Sophomore,4,Ally of the teachers are used to in person classes but they adjusted quickly and provide a great online experience for learning
Freshman,4,"well, i didn't take any online classes for them but if i did they probably would have been very good."
Freshman,4,"honestly, i don't really know what i would change just because i don't really know what to base it off of but i think i will love the school."
Sophomore,4,It has caring professors and a very close knit town that supports the sports. It also has an amazing church Flint Hills Bible Church!
Senior,4,"Overall, it was a very good experience based on the quality of the faculty I had within the Fine Arts degree. It's a very affordable school and town. The ratio of students to faculty is low, so you can get a really in-depth relationship and feedback from your faculty. Cons are the lack of diversity and the overall local area."
Sophomore,4,"I like how the professors are all very nice, and how the whole community is very close and supportive. I wish to see Emporia State University change the ways how people are grouped. For Example, geeks don't talk to preps and etc. It reminds me that I'm back in high school."
Senior,4,"The art department is wonderful. I really didn't expect to fall in love with ESU, or emporia. My classes are small enough that most teachers know names, even if you're a non-major. My professors really care about me and work with me."
Junior,4,I love the campus and the family feel here. It is not too big and not too small of a college. Everyone is friendly and there are so many outlets for help and assistance if you are struggling socially and/or academically. There are also several clubs for every interest and the classes are great as well.
Graduate Student,4,"The professors and program contacts have been very helpful! I had some issues with my enrollment, and the program coordinator worked everything out with the graduate school."
Freshman,4,"Friendly environment and very comfortable, the administration is helpful and will answer all your questions."
Freshman,4,"This spring 2019 was my first semester at Emporia State University. I chose ESU because of the reviews, distance from home (I live in the same town), and because of the affordable price to be a student at ESU. During my spring semester, I can honestly say that I had 4 incredible professors, I was greatly impressed. From the great care they give to the awesome availability they set up with their students. After finishing my spring semester I can say I am excited to be a hornet."
Junior,4,Emporia State is a very nice affordable college. It is one of the cheapest schools and kansas and it also provides a good education. The facilities are kept up to date and they are currently building new dorms for the incoming freshman.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the diversity and general kindness of all who attend. It is also relatively cheap for being a university, which is nice for those who want to study something they love but are worried about money being a problem."
Sophomore,4,"It has an incredible education program, as well as amazing faculty. The atmosphere of the town is very kind and peaceful, and has many amazing Mexican and Chinese food places to eat."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Emporia State and what it has to offer, but the city itself is very small and their isn't much to do here and if you want to go somewhere its at least a 45 min drive."
Freshman,4,"It is very interesting. You are welcomed by all and the police are always there to protect you. There may be moments here and there that may be iffy (like the crime rate and mischievous students), but the amount of love and support from others overlaps that. The art opportunities are also amazing! There are countless locations and jobs to fit with any artists dream!"
Freshman,4,"Emporia State University is a very good school academically. The teachers care and want you to succeed. The athletics are also very good. The cons of the school would be that some of the dorms arenâ€™t as nice as the others, but new dorms are being built so that will change. Also the campus food isnâ€™t the greatest, so thatâ€™s a big thing that the university could change. Overall, the school is a great atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"I love ESU because so far it has provided me with a very great education. I was nervous coming here because I did not know anyone, however, it has helped me get out of my comfort zone and meet new people. I am a very academic focused student and having so many materials and options available for studying has been very helpful in my academic success here at the university."
Sophomore,4,"I love the classes and the campus. I visited some friends here last year and loved it so much I decided to transfer here. They have top notch professors who have actually worked in their fields, even the classes taught by GTAs. Itâ€™s affordable compared to bigger state schools and itâ€™s the only school Iâ€™ve ever heard of to have tuition go down one year to the next."
Niche User,4,I like Emporia State because they have a lot of major options. The campus is really nice and the town is awesome.
Alum,4,"I transferred to ESU as a junior, so I did not get to spend a full four years there. However, my two years were great. As a music major, I played in the marching band, wind ensemble, orchestra, and flute choir. Sadly, the music department is underfunded and under appreciated. However, the music department is full of nice people, and the professors are always willing to help their students. It was also easy to earn a minor in another department (Spanish in my case)."
Graduate Student,4,"Personally, I have loved being at Emporia State University! Most of the teachers here have been exceptional and really care about what they're teaching and helping students. Of course there has been the rare time where I had a teacher who wasn't a good teacher, but those teachers are gone now which shows the school takes pride in having great teachers at all times. The school is affordable which is great when paying yourself for school. Campus is also small enough that getting from class to class is easy. Because the school is small, I get any extra time with the teachers I need since they don't have as many students per class to manage. Overall, I really love my college!"
Sophomore,4,"The flat rate tuition is so great, the location is cool because there is a lot of nature, and less than 2 hours away from Wichita and Kansas City! I am continually impressed by the professors and GAs, I love the school spirit :)"
Sophomore,4,I love the support from all of the professors at ESU. There is a family feel among all of the students and everyone wats you to succeed.
Graduate Student,4,Currently a distance-education student. The program has been wonderful in obtaining my master's degree. Professors are proficient and have experience in the industry. Would recommend their distance-education program to others.
Graduate Student,4,"It is a beautiful campus.  The advisors and teachers, financial aid, Library, and bookstore are all very accommodating and nice.  Even during hectic times they never lose their niceness and that says a lot!"
Sophomore,4,"Emporia State is very diverse as well as accepting. The campus and over-all environment is friendly and full of life. The professors really seem to harness the one on one student relationships and make you seen as an individual. The only major downside is the food in the cafeteria. I lived in the Towers Residence Hall my freshman year and then came back as an RA the next year. It is a very open and safe environment. The dorms and campus provide many program opportunities varying from speakers to performers.  As for the town life, it is on the more boring side. There is not a lot to do here other than local restaurants. This makes it easier to focus on academics though!"
Alum,4,"The small class size is great, your professors get to know you and you get to know your professors. Sometimes the class selection is limited depending on your major, just because it is a smaller university. It is a great place to get your undergrad though. And the cost is ver affordable."
Junior,4,Emporia is exactly a place to be for students who is pursuing a teaching degree. I have found the campus is where I have met several friendly students. I have meet professors who were willing to help and support you.
Freshman,4,"I love the homey feel of Emporia State University. No matter where you are or what class you're in, there's always a familiar face. Living in the dorms isn't great but even in the dorms it feels like a community. We always have somewhere to call home even if we aren't close to home. One thing I would change is the food in the cafeteria because most of the time its some variation of a grilled cheese or some variation of a cheese burger. Overall Emporia State is a very good college that is very welcoming and nice."
Junior,4,Emporia State is a tremendous university and has benefited me in ways that I couldn't have imagined. The community itself is filled with friendly faces and generous people.
Freshman,4,Emporia State is a small college with friendly and helpful individuals. It has a very good football team and education system
Freshman,4,"Life at Emporia State University has been a great experience for me. At Emporia, I didn't just get accepted into the school, but also got accepted into the community. The security rate at Emporia and the university to me is one of the best in America. The school is very safe for living that parents won't need to be worried about the children especially those from other countries like me. At Emporia, one can be rest assured to get the best quality education, learn from multiple cultures and traditions, get help when needed even from peer or community at large. Talk about funding, Emporia has also been rated among the top hundred most affordable schools and also of those that award the best funding. Low class size at Emporia also ensures that teachers know there students one on one and can always be there to help out when in need."
Freshman,4,"The professors all have your best interests in mind, so far I have had an amazing experience with taking art classes here, they aren't a walk in the park, but the teachers are always there to help and encourage you to think as creatively as possible!"
Junior,4,Overall my experience at Emporia State University has been enlightening. As a transfer student from Washburn University I feel like I made the right choice. The only thing that I wish could change would be providing more equal opportunities for minority students
Senior,4,"My experience with Emporia State was a good experience as I was able to improve myself in many areas of life, especially in my academic career. The best part of ESU is undoubtedly the professors. They take the students' learning very seriously, yet get to know them on a personal basis. The facilities have become more impressive in my time here, yet is not a huge focal point of the university. 
While other univerisities have chain vendors arounds camous for food, the ESU campus is rather limited with the cafeteria and just a few other places to grab a bite to eat. For the amount of students that are on campus, the party scene can be rather disappointing. This can be attributed to Emporia being within driving distance of KU, KSU, Wichita, and KC. Many students leave town on the weekends. Overall, academics are the main focus on this campus, making the return on investment very high."
Freshman,4,"ESU has a pretty campus that isn't too terribly big, but I didn't completely enjoy the classes. I only really loved one or two classes, and all the others seemed to be taught by teachers who couldn't connect to their students and help us learn. My college algebra teacher was the absolute worst I've ever experienced, even more so than my high school teacher, and I didn't think it could get any worse. He honestly seemed too smart to be teaching college students because he struggled to help us learn the concepts and what he was trying to say. The town isn't extremely glamorous either."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed how small the campus is. it allows for an easy commute, from one side to the other. there are really small class sizes."
Freshman,4,I love the facilities. The people here are awesome. I also really like the student to teacher ratio.  I would change the girl to boy ratio. 
Junior,4,One of the most supportive colleges I have ever experienced. They finally helped me find what I truly wanted to do. Now I have chosen elementary education and it was the best decision I have ever made.
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently a graduate student here at Emporia. Although it is an online degree I live here and have built great relationships with my professors. I also am doing a Graduate Assistant program. They are so helpful and the community is extremely supportive of Emporia State Students and Faculty. They have great food options from multiple grocery stores, fast food, and great sit down dining options as well. The city itself is in proximity to Wichita, Kansas City, Manhattan, and Lawrence, making it a great central location. I recommend this school to anyone who likes the big city but hates the traffic. You are able to easily travel to a city on the weekends and don't have to worry about the city traffic and commutes throughout your week. The parks surrounding the area are beautiful as is the weather that compliments them."
Niche User,4,"This is an amazing college! The atmosphere, the campus and the student life are all a complete package.  Whether you live 100 miles away or 1,000 miles away this University makes you feel at home.  They offer so many great courses and the faculty truly care about your success.  I would recommend this University to anyone looking for the best all around college experience.  "
College Senior,4,Overall experience has been positive.
College Freshman,4,"My experience with my professors has been a good experience for me because not only is my professor my professor but she is also my academic advisor! I am always welcomed into her office with open arms and with tons of answers to whatever questions I have. My class size  is fairly average but nothing is average about the individuals that are in my class. Full of different minds and opinions on topics we discuss everyday is very exciting to watch and hear. The course can be challenging but all my professors will give you some sort of way to get a tutor or time to come an visit their office during their office hours, or get you any help you need to be successful."
College Freshman,4,"The Greek life at my school is very welcoming because they strive hard not to be seen as having  "" typical Greek"" stereotype behavior. Even if a non-Greek and a Greek life member interact it is nothing but acceptance and true friendship. Regardless of titles we see each other as human which only brings us closer together."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at my school is 100 percent supported by ESU. We have people who use sporting events at my school to meet other students and make friendships as they enjoy seeing their Hornets play a great game. At this school we have a drive to get people determined to come to football, basketball, softball, baseball, tennis and so much more sporting events to not only have the team feeling uplifted but also our cheerleaders, fans and whoever else enjoys everything we have to offer."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience A t Emporia State has been wonderful. When it came to finding classes the University had these ""Hornet Helpers""  help me and my family find my dorm and move in properly. My school has a small campus but a big heart in the way it cares for it's students in facility. If I had a chance to choose to go to another school I would not change my mind to attend Emporia State. I felt a ""at home"" feeling when I visited during my sophomore year for a school field trip. Somehow Emporia followed me all the way to my senior year and have been very grateful to receive a letter of acceptance from them."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a member of the marching band, Emporia just finished remodeling the football field. It will be exciting to see if that encourages more school spirit."
Recent Alumnus,4,I did sports myself in high school and I believe it is amazing how many sports are available at emporia.
Recent Alumnus,4,everyone is nice and so helpful. they care where you want to go and really want to help you succeed in getting there
College Sophomore,4,The staff and students have been very open and helpful to new students. My first day on campus I felt included and that I could accomplish so much at this campus!
College Senior,4,I like going to emporia state. Every school has its ups and downs but here at emporia if you do have a down the teachers here are always ready to bring you back up.
College Senior,4,It was the perfect size for me! I love how there are so many ways to get involved!
College Sophomore,4,I had one Indian professor in two semesters. Other than that it's been good.
College Sophomore,4,There were a few cases of discrimination in the freshman dorms this last year but it didn't involve me so I didn't get get into it.
College Freshman,4,"I've had a few mediocre teachers, but I've had many more great teachers who are helpful."
College Freshman,4,I feel even safer on campus now that the university installed help centers around campus.
College Freshman,4,"I know a lot of people on campus went to the varsity events, but I never really had time to go to them. What I did see, though, were great."
College Sophomore,4,always there when they are needed.
Niche User,2,Everyone has told me it is a really nice place to be and the community really supports the atheltics there
College Freshman,2,"Not much employment help to actually get a job off campus. They tell you what you're good at and what you should do but in a small town like this, opportunity doesn't come around like rain."
College Sophomore,2,There's not very many restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,"Few students support the teams, very little school spirit. I'd say ESU doesn't do a very good job of trying to get off campus students involved and could do a better job advertising and promoting campus involvement activities."
College Senior,2,There isn't much of a selection here for students or the community.
College Sophomore,2,The wife is terrible and I never know where to find the computer labs.
College Freshman,2,"Kansas weather is all over the place, but it's ok."
College Freshman,2,Very poor school spirit. :( 
College Freshman,2,"Medium-sized town, but extremely secluded."
College Junior,2,Printing cost is expensive and the wireless connection is pretty slow. 
College Junior,2,Non-Greeks are indifferent towards them. They are almost not known and have no social effect on campus. 
College Junior,2,"Printing fees are terrible and the wifi is really bad and slow. It is nice though that they have opened up a learning space 24/7 and have provided students with enough computers and vending machines for late night studying. For the first two reasons listed, the university could be much more efficient with their facilities. "
College Freshman,2,"Sure the police keep things safe but they do it in a manner similar to that of Gestapo or MPs. They aren't friendly, they don't chat or mingle with students, and they often will stop you if you're out walking at night even across campus and somewhat interrogate you. These are more like LAPD not really like Sherrif Andy Taylor in the Andy Griffith Show"
College Freshman,2,"The Wifi is a piece of crap here, I am currently typing on my own personal laptop using an Ethernet cable because the wifi system won't let me access the student wifi, so if I do use the wifi I have to use the guest wifi (which makes you re log in every 24 hours). Wifi sucks. Skyprint is a rip off, BRING YOUR OWN PRINTERS. SAVE YOURSELVES. Also a laptop is a MUST and a vital piece of survival equipment here."
College Freshman,2,I wanted guitar performance major. They don't offer it. The freaking Russian Army can have guitar players but ESU in the USA says NO
College Freshman,2,"The school does not support student based activities on the weekends such as rock concerts, stage productions, etc so going out drinking is kinda the only thing to do on the weekends other than just sit around and wait for Monday or you can go home (provided you have your own car and you don't live a state away)"
College Freshman,2,People gave me the old run around like you would expect from the US Army.
College Senior,2,"It's about average ethnically.  Politically, mostly republican.  Lots of religious diversity, but there are few Jewish. There is no temple close by."
College Senior,2,"Downtown is poor.  There are a few parks.  The scenery can be pretty, but the upkeep of the town is poor.  They do support the school very heavily, because it creates income!"
College Senior,2,"The houses next to campus are old and rundown. There are a few apartment buildings that are new, but are harder to get into.  The parking is on the street, and the streets are pitiful."
College Senior,2,"I do not live in a dorm, but the dining hall is open to all students.  It is atrocious. The food is mostly overcooked or cold and there is little day to day variety.  It is not open on weekends.  It is very expensive."
College Senior,2,It's midwest weather. It is never great. 
College Senior,2,I would love an internship.  They are hard to find here.
College Freshman,2,"the main public transportation provided around ESU is the l-cat, a public bus that makes somewhat frequent stops around town. there are also taxis but I've only rarely seen those used."
College Junior,2,"Not much around, most just go home on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,Kansas weather is bipolar. During the fall and spring months it can vary up to 30 degrees daily. It is never consistent outside of the summer and winter months.
College Freshman,2,"We have taco bell, mc donalds, braums, kfc, arby's, and sonic. Those are the cheapest options. Limited specifically for those trying to be healthy."
College Senior,2,A lot of snow on the ground and they didnt clean the parking lot.
College Freshman,2,"The food is extremely bland, and they only switch up the classic line leaving everything else the same every day."
College Freshman,2,There are 5 girls for every male and a vast majority of international students (from Asia). But we have lovely squirrels :)
College Freshman,2,"My school is not very strict concerning alcohol policies and quiet hours in the dorms.  Students get away with sneaking alcohol and other illegal substances in the dorms and in some cases, the Residential Assistants know about it and ignore it."
College Junior,2,"On campus dining can get old real fast. The ESU Hornets Nest doesn't change up their food choices very often so the main caf is boring. There is the Hornet Express which is wonderful and keeps the options coming, but if you go there all the time it also can get old."
College Senior,2,"The summer can be very hot with the humidity, and winter can be bitterly cold. Spring and fall typically have heavy rain and thunderstorms with the potential for tornadoes."
College Senior,2,"There are many apartments throughout the city, but it is important to find one early or there might not be any super close to campus."
College Freshman,2,There are many computers in ESU. The library and many other departments have computers for students. Although they are slow when logging in due to the fact that many users are logged on. The good thing is if you have your own computer you can use their wifi which is a plus. A laptop is not necessary but it is a plus especially when writing papers. As for printing the library does not charge and some departments charge you five cents per page.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a very large population of Asians on campus, which makes dating difficult because most of the Asian population do not date outside their culture."
College Sophomore,2,There is a great deal of diversity on campus however there are alot of people with of asian ethnicity and caucasian ethnicity. there are not enough hispanics or african americans on campus. also our peers sexual orientation is not diverse there are only a few homosexuals around campus
College Sophomore,2,"The strictness is average. The police and safety do a good job to make sure the campus is safe, but they also let students be students and be free."
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife is okay. There are various clubs and bars around town as well as a bowling alley, a skating rink, and a movie theater. The parties are okay as well and getting around Emporia is up to you. The clubs and bars tend to get repetitive, but there are other things to do when going out."
College Sophomore,2,"The students don't really get into sports a whole lot here. At football games the largest part of the crowd are people from the community. The students don't really go to a lot of the games, which makes it difficult to get excited about our teams. Most of the sports teams are not very good either this could be partly due to the poor facilities. The track team doesn't have an indoor track to practice in, so if it is ever snowing or the weather is just really bad their only option is pool workouts or running in a gym."
Alum,1,I don't have anything to say about online learning experiences at Emporia State University since there were not a lot offered in this program
Alum,1,This university has race relations problems and is in an isolated location...........................
Works Here,1,"The school is stuck in the 1900's. Diversity issues so watch out if you are a person of color. Lots of turmoil on campus that embroils students and staff. Lots of unranked programs. If ranked, many tend to come from low-end organizations touting the school as higher than it really is. The school is 50+ miles from any cities. There's not even a major transportation service to get to the town. No bus, no train, no nothing! The town is immersed in its own cultural petrie dish, so people in the community only want to hear feel good news or fake news to appease those who want to keep the town alive."
Senior,1,Safe campus. Not much diversity around town. Especially if you are from a different country and background. Professors are there and there. School don't really look to help student but look to take their money. Trash overall.
College Freshman,1,I don't go to parties or drink
College Junior,1,It's expensive and the campus police are the worst. They are mean and not friendly. Good luck finding parking on campus.
College Freshman,1,"For Theatre, there's a lot of favoritism. Zoiks a student comedy troupe is excessively nepotistic and the people here can be outright douchy when it comes to audition night. I guess that's acting though, regardless of how unpleasant this is, it's just life."
College Freshman,1,"Tiny town, nothing to do, excessively religious, just a bigger version of Louisburg, Kansas."
College Freshman,1,"Being a guitarist, it is my way of life. I have dedicated my life since I was 4 years old to playing. Here I have to give it up entirely because some asshole in charge banned guitar amps. Also there's nothing to do here whatsoever if you're under 21 unless you want to go out and risk getting arresting at a party for drinking underage. Terrible terrible place to go to unless you want to be a teacher or if you're a devout Christian. The school has a lot of student groups, but far too many are Christian based (ruining the groups for those of us who are not Christians) and the rest of the groups are Fraternity or Sorority Groups. VERY FEW groups are actual student based groups that are fun and worth enjoying. The only group I am a part of is Nerf Nation and it is surprisingly fun, but other than that and the theater department, this place is totally not worth it. You will enjoy fighting in Vietnam/Afghanistan/Syria more than here"
College Freshman,1,There's just one bus in the city called the L KAT and it tends to show up RIGHT as you have class. Also hitching a ride with others just to get to places like Wal Mart to buy much needed supplies for hygiene and food or other items is a pain in the ass because nobody ever wants to just go.
College Freshman,1,"I'm 18 years old. If I were 21 I'm sure I would have a different outlook on nightlife here, but for those under 21 years old nightlife SUCKS. It's actually fairly depressing. The school doesn't allow or provide any form of social event at night for students so some students get so incredibly bored and depressed with nothing to do that they go out to parties and drink underage just to have something to do."
College Freshman,1,"If you are a guitarist, this school is hell. They don't allow amplifiers ANYWHERE on campus, and no you cannot perform, don't even try. They also banned skateboarding. This college however allows highly offensive music to be played over loud stereo systems in rap, country, pop, etc but god forbid you want to play some Eric Clapton or The Beatles. They also really don't give a flying f*** about you if you are a guitarist. Also Emporia is the capital city of Lyon county, so there are WAY too many police officers for this small town and they do treat you like criminals. I have never had an officer actually be friendly to me even once here, they question everyone (even international students) for just being out after dark walking from the dorms to the cafeteria or the library which is on campus. They also are parking/traffic ticket happy, so remember to click your heels and shout seig heil when you park your car. Also if you're atheist or non-christian finding a student organization is impossible it seems. The school has tons of groups, but most of which are Christian related."
College Senior,1,"Again, the town is small.  The restaurants are poorly maintained, far away from campus, and can be expensive.  Few give student discounts.  There is little variety. "
College Senior,1,"There is a small bus system, but it is for the elderly and disabled."
College Senior,1,"The town is really small. There are only bars, no dance clubs!  The restaurants are far away, if you don;t have a car you are out of luck. There is no public transportation.  There is a cab service but it expensive. 

The places keep getting closed down for different reasons.  Usually the place stays vacant. There are a lot of vacant buildings here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No place to really go, as this is a very small town, in the middle of nowhere."
College Sophomore,1,"When I lived on campus there was not much option at all and the food was really terrible. I am not a picky person at all, but the food was unbearable. There is only the cafeteria and a place to buy snacks on campus. Last year the school remodeled the cafeteria, but a lot of my friends said that the food quality did not get any better. Plus the cafeteria closes at 7pm. Sorry but I get hungry later than that."
College Student,1,"This university and town are dying-don't waste a year of your life on it â€“ The university is miserable as is the town. The town is failing economically, uninteresting, and unaccomodating to students in general.  Go somewhere else. If you want a smaller school, go to Pitt state or Hays state, not emporia-those are smaller schools that are doing things way better. "
College Student,1,"There are 30 minute meters everywhere but class is at least an hour.....what sense does that make? Parking passes are ridiculously expensive.  If you get a ticket from the campus, you cannot plead your case to the parking department or appeal your ticket until the end of semester, meaning you have to pay first either way. Furthermore, the woman that heads up the parking department is a total jerk.  She is unhelpful, rude, and stuck-up to any students coming in to talk to her department about the ticket they gave out.  Unprofessional, strict, and badly managed. "
College Student,1,"Lacking Interest or Passion in 2012 and beyond â€“ Emporia lost Tyson as a source of many meat packing jobs a few years ago and hasn't recovered from it.  The town is on the downhill economically and its dragging the college down with it. There are many closed businesses (from restaurants to clubs to gas stations) and many vacant lots in key areas of Emporia.  The town doesn't feel compelled to support the university and vice versa. The college has no solution for this and the town doesn't care about a solution to this....It's sad because Emporia used to be a viable alternative to larger colleges, but the whole town is struggling now in many ways."

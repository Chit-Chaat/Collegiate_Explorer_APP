Graduate Student,5,The university is amazing and the teachers are really great. I first got my Bachelors degree in Criminal Justice and now I am going back to pursue my dream of becoming a nurse. The town is great as well and the university is very centrally located.
Graduate Student,5,"It is very easy to access online learning, and now that COVID has happened, many of the classes are now offered online which makes it nice for a non-traditional student like me!"
Alum,5,"I attended CMU 2014-2017. I found the school was very accomedating and helped me make informed decisions about my education. I atttended the Counseling psychology program which had amazing professors, quality classes and facilited opportunities for a well rounded education (internships, group classes, individual work etc.)"
Junior,5,I like how the profesor give us time and will understand with the pandemic that is going on. Online is very different but at the same time it's better than not going to school.
Freshman,5,I am taking online classes and the set up and introduction is really easy to understand and get the hang of.
Freshman,5,"At Colorado Mesa University everyone is so close, the gym workers remember you and are very friendly, one thing that could change about the school is the parking."
Sophomore,5,"As a student, I've found that the staff is always there to answer questions and help you to be in the place that you want to be in."
Sophomore,5,The teachers were able to help me and answer questions when there was confusion. There is a lot of support.
Freshman,5,"Cmu is an awesome school  and I get to live close to home. I originally wanted to go out-of-state for college, but could not afford it financially..I am very glad, because cmu is the best college, and i have met amazing people. I am excited to pursue my social work career, and help others."
Freshman,5,"I did take a few online classes because of coronavirus, and it was a weird experience. Everyone seemed anxious, but the professors really helped with making the platform work. They were very patient and direct on what they expected from us online."
Junior,5,"The online platform is very user friendly and although everybody takes a short orientation course, there are always resources for refreshers and help navigating."
Freshman,5,It has been hard switching to online during covid but I am able to find help when I need it. I feel the main people of CMU have been really trying to figure how to better the process and make it complete and easier for its teachers and students to be successful.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy their ability to be student based. The staff I have talked to have been very helpful and encouraging. It has been awesome seeing everyone come together especially during covid-19 to help students succeed this last semester and future semesters.
Alum,5,"As I stepped into the city of Grand Junction, I noticed how lively downtown was, the stunning scenery surrounding the desert, and a green campus full of opportunities. CMU is a university equipped with all the resources that any other “big name” schools had, but it made me feel like home. From the residence halls that are filled with smiling Resident Assistants all the way to the concerts that the Programming Activities Council had, CMU began to feel like home. I began to develop tight-knit relationships with my biology professors, and they would recognize me years later in the halls of Wubben. I was able to dissect various animals, culture bacteria, grow fruit flies, and perform other incredible experiments. I got my first job ever and gained invaluable experience from it. I immersed myself in various clubs and organizations and obtained passions that I never thought I would have."
Sophomore,5,"I am a transfer student and I love this college so far! With the coronavirus restrictions happening right now the classes are online, but they have announced that classes will resume in the fall as normal. I have a teacher that has moved her class to online already for the fall due to the virus. They are very connected with the students and communication within the university is awesome."
Freshman,5,The thing I like about Colorado Mesa university is the environment and the beauty of the school. Through out my application process I had students communicating with me and telling me the good and the way how I would like the college. I did more research and looks they have a good nursing program the stuff is friendly the advisors walked me thru every step and there where there for me every time I need help and I would recommend my friends to go to this school.
Freshman,5,I didn’t do any online courses with the school.  But I did you process over the phone online and they system was easy to learn and there was someone to all for help
Freshman,5,This school offers so many different degrees. Its easy to apply. Plus everyone I talked to was super helpful during my transition!
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful! All of the staff really wants you to succeed. There is a large amount of diversity on campus as well.
Niche User,5,"I love my Concurrent Machining Classes. I am Learning so much and cant wait to learn more. I cant think of any changes at this time, it really has been an amazing experience."
Niche User,5,"The campus is gorgeous! Additionally, the students and staff are all so warm and welcoming which really makes this school feel like my home away from home."
Niche User,5,"Colorado Mesa University is a very diverse and welcoming school. They offer many different programs ranging from Liberal arts, professional, and technical at the master's, bachelor's, associate and even certificate levels. The faculty and professors take great pride in providing students with many educational opportunities and tools that help us succeed in today's extremely complex and interconnected world. Their focus is on providing us students with quality academic programs which they meet expectations to the maximum. While the majority of students are full-time, Colorado Mesa University makes it very easy for students who have families or other jobs to get classes in. They provide a wide range of evening classes and online courses to help non-traditional students the opportunity to further their education, accommodating to students needs are one of their main priorities."
Niche User,5,"I love how they recruited students and how they make accepted students want to join the community.
I have been accepted there and am excited to do a full visit and learn if that will be my future home."
Freshman,5,"A University's rate is typically completely dependent upon the student, for me CMU is a five out of five because I love the outdoor adventure which is just ten minutes away from campus. The size is also perfect because the classes are large enough to be diverse and small enough to get a sense of community and build relationships with your teachers. There are a lot of excellent programs tailored to help students find careers and gracefully glide into those careers."
Freshman,5,"When I visited the food was amazing and the staff was extremely helpful and generous. The Campus is clean, collective, and organized. They are very well known and liked among the community. It is the heart and soul of education in Grand Junction. They are an impressive school considering their growth throughout the last few decades. I want to be apart of the school because I enjoy the community, and because I live in Grand Junction."
Freshman,5,It was my first year being a college student. First time in my family as well. I had no clue what I was doing to be honest. I talked to the counselor and he helped me get setup and enroll. He helped me out with absolutely everything from enrolling to the right classes to my financial aid. It's been a pleasant experience with them so far. I am at my towns campus doing general ed classes. After that I will be headed out to the main campus.
Sophomore,5,Well rounded university.  It offers a very good variety of studies.  One of the top five nursing schools.
Sophomore,5,"My school is honestly the perfect place for me, it provides small classes, is affordable and provides the programs and classes that I want. They are huge on school spirit and provide a  happy and healthy environment. Especially when it comes to finals week and spirits are low. It may not be the place for everyone, but it is a school that should definitely be considered if they have what you are looking for."
Freshman,5,"It's a great place to have fun and meet new people. I love how live people are and friendly. It's more different than SoCal, but in a very good way. There's also all four seasons to live through. Beautiful weather. It also ""providing quality academic programs, built on a strong liberal arts core that support students' interests and regional employment needs, as well as technical programs that respond to vocational workforce demands"""
Freshman,5,"I am currently attending Colorado Mesa University as a first semester freshman. I came here last summer for a volleyball camp and fell in love with this place. I was fortunate enough to be offered a spot on the CMU Mavericks NCAA Volleyball team.  I was instantly drawn to CMU when I visited and knew it was where I want to attend school.  The team and the coaches are inspiring and amazing.  CMU also offers a bachelors in Psychology, which is what I am pursuing.  I plan to be a child psychologist.  I live in the dorm and this is a new experience for me. I love getting to know all the people around me. I hope I will be able to continue to stay at CMU for my four years of college.  Oh, did I mention that it is beautiful here!"
Senior,5,"better than a massive D1, still a friday night lights feel !! Love the community and support from the community to continue to grow CMU."
Freshman,5,"I love the overall experience.  The classrooms are small so the teachers have really good one on one ratios.  I also like that there is a sense of camaraderie, even among new students.  The dorms are clean and oversized compared to other schools."
Sophomore,5,"Colorado Mesa University is an amazing school to challenge yourself academically, as well as make connections with other students and your professors. The classrooms are fairly small, giving you the opportunity to make connections and bonds with your professors. There are also multiple different clubs that you can join to meet new people. Grand Junction is a great town, with plenty to offer those that have a love for the outdoors."
Freshman,5,"I would like to see a lot more programs on campus, there is not enough majors in my opinion. Also I would love to see a more expansive campus, there are not enough dorms for the people that go here, they are nice, but good luck finding parking. Also there are some parts of Grand Junction that are not very nice, and I highly recommend anybody who decides to attend CMU should have an idea about where the safe parts of the city. Overall, this place is very good and should be considered if you want to go to college in Colorado!!"
Niche User,5,Well the school was very well built and was very comforting for being not home in my own state. The teachers there are excellent and can help you when you need it and understand extracurricular activities like myself that I do. The dorm rooms were very nice considering they are dorm rooms.
Sophomore,5,"I'm a recent transfer student and I have had nothing but the most professional and supportive experience possible. The campus is great, the classes offered is excellent and the student services are outstanding."
Senior,5,Professors are all willing to help you if you show how much you want this! the campus is filled with tons of food options. Starbucks is on campus! who doesn't love Starbucks. The nursing program is one of the best!
Junior,5,"awesome college, great place to learn, all the professors really care about their students. There are of course some not so great professors but that it with any university you go to. CMU really provides a great atmosphere for students to learn and they also uphold a safety standard to keep fellow students safe."
Freshman,5,"Great school, great opportunities. Many different ways to find help. Everyone is willing to help when needed."
Niche User,5,"This is a great school, fun and friendly environment, respectful staff,  and many activities to keep yourself busy."
Senior,4,I have been attending Colorado Mesa University for almost three years now and I simply love it. This is my second time around at college and I could not have asked for a better place for my second attempt. The professors have become mentors and friends and I appreciate every minute I have with them. Studying geology in such a geological mecca is a dream come true.
Alum,4,"I did take some courses online. The professors did well about connecting their online materials to the selected texts and activities. The MavZone application helped me keep track of assignments, grades and tests. It also helped me connect with my professors when needed for help."
Freshman,4,"I have two fully online classes and the rest are hybrid, which I really enjoy. Overall, it is easy to get in touch with professors and they are very helpful. The material isn't insanely difficult but it pushes you to learn and make sure you study."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the campus is lovely and the people are genuine.  The president takes campus safety very seriously and has put good measures in place to keep students safe."
Junior,4,"Colorado Mesa is an amazing school! I love the campus life, all the new people you meet, all the fun and amazing clubs there are. Mesa is just an amazing school."
Junior,4,I love how the class room sizes are small enough that the teachers can get to know there students on a more personal level. The campus is also a great size not to small and everything is a good walking distance.
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman I. really like the atmosphere  created and all the activities, what I don't like how expensive  the dorms are compared to any other college. Couldn't live on campus because of it."
Freshman,4,I am attending first semester this fall therefore  I cannot accurately give an appropriate review of this university as of yet
Freshman,4,I am attending first semester this fall therefore  I cannot accurately give an appropriate review of this university as of yet
Junior,4,Colorado Mesa university has been great to me! Teachers are super helpful and they really work with you to give you the best in class and out of class experience possible. I’ve had two teachers accept me into their “full classes” simply because I asked! It can be a bit of a hassle to reach the financial aid office by phone but it’s a minor roadblock.
Sophomore,4,"I don't think any college could've done any better of a job then Mesa to help mold me into the person I am today. I showed up an average student, over weight, and dealing with mental health. With the student aspect I got to watch other students, and by this I mean how much of an effort they were  willing to put into there craft; made me want to grind for whats mine. The teachers were always extremely engaging and would stop on a dime to actually help you, something a rarely saw in high school. As it elevated my grades significantly. Then the school gave me confidence! I took up a weights class with Dr. Martin. He helped changed my life as I lost all my weight and went from a 250lbs to now 190lbs. To this day I still have a great relationship with him and to be brutally honest me lifting saved my mental state, made me feel more sure about my self like I could do anything I put my mind to. As they say the wolf climbing the hill is always hungrier than the wolf sitting at the top."
Sophomore,4,"There were a lot of activities going on that were available to everyone. The RA's were very helpful and tried to get everyone involved in the activities the dorm had to offer. I hope they change the food they serve on campus, they need to have more variety."
Alum,4,"I only took online classes one time over the summer and during COVID-19. The professors do a wonderful job of keeping you on schedule, delivering clear and concise lectures, as well as enhancing your learning experience."
Sophomore,4,My online experience has been good. The professors are very easy to connect with and are very understanding despite all the troubles of COVID-19.
Junior,4,It wasn’t bad but the online isn’t what you want from this school. you want the in person learning not really the online stuff
Junior,4,"With the covid19 on going pandemic, I have felt the online education has been a step down from the classroom education.  It is not that I haven’t grown, but nowhere near as much as I did in the classroom."
Junior,4,"Being at CMU has been a great experience.  Most of my professors have made my growth and learning a priority.  I have been challenged and because of it, grown as a student.  The student life aspect is good and enjoyable.  The student body is diverse and openly interested in their education."
Sophomore,4,"Mesa is a very good school. All of the students are very nice and I found it really easy to make friends. There are some pretty good professors too, some bad ones but that's every college. There are also parties every weekend if thats what you like to do."
Alum,4,"I loved the small classroom environment, and my professors were fantastic! My professors were accommodating and precise during their lectures. The classes were small enough that you learn everyone's names, but the discussions were diverse. I became so close with my fellow students that we would hang out. The political science club provided a chance to visit the state capital and hear about legislation within the state. The size of the classes allowed you to make a connection with the professors. My relationship with these educators still stands today three years after I had graduated from school! I loved my experience!."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful. I also love that the class sizes are not too big or small. I feel like the professors are easier to talk to when the class size is smaller and the teachers are able to focus on the students. The professors are really approachable and each and every one has office hours to help you if needed.
Freshman,4,I have had amazing teachers and oppurtunities to be assited when needed. The staff in all the departments are so welcoming and helpful.
Graduate Student,4,"Big time school, for little price. Very up to date campus and advisors will help out alot. many doors will be opened, dont miss the opportunity"
Freshman,4,"The community on campus is so diverse! Plus, there is always something to do almost every day. The teachers are nice and only want what is best for you. Only as a freshman, I got to experience a new life within my own hometown."
Niche User,4,"I will be attending CMU in the fall of 2020. While trying to figure out the next step for college, Mesa has been very helpful and good at responding and making this experience enjoyable and exciting! Overall very excited to be attending this university."
Alum,4,"CMU gave me the opportunity to really learn and grow as I transitioned from a high school student to an academic adult. The classrooms have a small-college feel with a campus that keeps expanding. I had instructors that I absolutely loved in my pre-nursing requisites and ones that I didn't jive as well with, pretty typical. CMU has close relationships with the hospitals in town so clinicals were always available and interesting. I was very quickly employed by a hospital and felt prepared to take care of others."
Freshman,4,"So far, CMU has felt like home to me. I enjoy the surroundings and the atmosphere in campus. It is a welcoming place. I enjoy seeing students who work hard and I also love how willing professors are to help their students. It’s growing school, but it keeps on caring for each student."
Freshman,4,Colorado is so beautiful and the people there are amazing it was refreshing to get out of Arizona. The housing is super nice and the way they are layed out is super easy. The best thing is is that I am not a Colorado resident but still get in state tuition because of WUE! The other great part about it is its super easy to get into you can have a 2.2 GPA and still get in.
Sophomore,4,My experience throughout my 2 years at Colorado Mesa University has been amazing! There are a majority of that professors care about the students' passing their classes in order to get their degrees.  The students there are very diverse and it makes the college a great place to meet people from different backgrounds and states.
Junior,4,Colorado Mesa is a small school. It provides intimate classroom settings and the professors are readily available to give advice. As a physics major I got to do research as a freshman under the wing of my adviser which is unheard of. The politics of Mesa lacks in terms of how the school is ran. But as far as my education is was great. And the grand valley is beautiful.
Sophomore,4,"So far I’ve really enjoyed attending CMU, most of my professors have been great, and students are generally very friendly, interested in learning, and respectful of one another. The campus is super nice, and most of the services are as well. However, I do not like IRIS, the department you have to go through first before you can talk to anyone from financial aid, registrar, etc. Although it’s a good idea in theory, I’ve had so many problems with them, to the point where I now avoid IRIS at all costs."
Sophomore,4,Colorado Mesa University is a wonderful college and enjoy attending and living in Grand Junction. With plenty of things to do in town and out in the national monument it is not hard to find something to do. Colorado Mesa has good things and it has bad things like very college campus. One major problem i have with the college is the activities board and their lack of effort with advertising sporting events without staying on top of knowing what event is happening it is near impossible. The surrounding town is somewhat rundown and the drug usage and homeless population is quite high. Overall Colorado Mesa is a wonderful college and highly recommend this college.
Junior,4,I just applied to this school as a transfer student. I was able to meet with an advisor within a week of contacting the school. My transcripts were evaluated promptly and put into my degreeworks asap! The staff for the nursing program truly have gone above and beyond for me in aiding with my transfer. I am eager to continue to work with them throughout my educational career.
Freshman,4,"I love CMU! It's small enough that the professors remember their students and have high standards for success. Living on campus makes it very inclusive, everyone is friendly and respectful. Grand Junction community welcomes the new students to their home and welcomes them to participate in the local activities."
Niche User,4,The programs that they provide need to b a little better organized. This has caused vary preventable problems. But all around a very good school
Sophomore,4,"Every professor here has always been super kind and helpful and very understanding when it comes to things out of your control. Class sizes are smaller which makes them better for me. As a ""newer"" state university in Colorado the school is constantly and expanding and growing and always offering new opportunities. I feel great knowing that one day this will be a truly great and recognized university and that I am helping them achieve their goal of the 2020 initiative. Cons I have found so far is that technology and the website don't always work and some of their offices can be very slow about getting back to you. Both my friend and I had some trouble with the Financial Aid office, and it took a bit longer than we liked to resolve those issues and get everything cleared up."
Sophomore,4,"I swim for Colorado Mesa. The team is amazing, and I love my professors for the most part. The class size is small, so it is easy to make a good/bad impression on the professors, and they can help you more. The food and town is alright, but the campus is amazing. It is so open and easy to navigate. Overall, I am having a pretty good time here."
Niche User,4,"I am not yet a student at CMU. I am starting in the fall but I went there briefly to see the school. I really like it there. The town is adorable and the campus is so nice. My favorite part was, as I was touring the campus the guide ran into people that he knew every place we went on campus. I feel like that is the kind of connection and communication that you might not get at a bigger university. I'm really looking forward to that."
Junior,4,I think the best part of Mesa is the beautiful campus! The second great thing is your peers you'll definitely find someone that you will click with very well if not a whole group. If you truly focus and balance yourself you will exceed in your classes. Campus wifi could improve though!
Sophomore,4,Colorado Mesa is a beautiful school with many opportunists to get involved. Not to mention the town is nature's playground. If you like outdoor activities this is the place to be. The campus is very clean and welcoming.
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time so far here. The people are great and very diverse. I am involved with alot on campus and it feel amazing. The campus is amazing and the weather is outstanding. I cant imagine going anywhere else. I am glad to call Mesa my home. MAV UP!!
Alum,4,"What's to Love:
Rigorous, yet balanced academic courses
Wide variety of programs offered
Frequent on- and off-campus social events 
Low teacher-to-student ratio
Flexible learning opportunities offered (in-class, online, hybrid)
Dedicated, personable, knowledgable staff
Continual infrastructure development (new buildings, lots, fields, etc.)

What Would Make it Even Better: 
Offer more graduate programs
Offer more online courses/programs"
Sophomore,4,"CMU has a great community and academic environment. The professors are nearly all wonderful and the courses are engaging and exciting. 
I wish there was better communication about events and opportunities available to students."
Niche User,4,"Colorado Mesa University is a medium sized school located in a small city. The school is good for people who don't want to be in the city and like outdoor activities. The school is very diverse, its a fair amount to be paid, and the classes aren't too big and aren't too small, to me its just right."
Freshman,4,The College is very good. The staff is very helpful with anything that you need. The application process is very easy and user-friendly. The campus is very clean and safe.
Sophomore,4,The teachers here are very helpful. They are usually available whenever its needed and work with you if you are able and willing to communicate with them.
Senior,4,"As a transfer student from a small community college, I was nervous about joining a larger institution. CMU made it very easy for me to adapt by having  small class sizes and wonderful resources!"
Freshman,4,"I really like attending CMU because the staff works hard to create a positive experience for all students. Going into my freshman year as a 22-year-old I was worried that I might seem old to some of the recent High School Graduates, but to my surprise I was in class with many kids my age!"
Freshman,4,I am mainly focusing on my academia but it’s hard to not love all the other characteristics of this college.
Freshman,4,"This is a very good college however it is more on the expensive side and of course with college comes college parties. Despite it being more known as a ""party campus"" it is filled with very intelligent teachers, students, and many amazing opportunities."
Freshman,4,"Very nice campus, super helpful staff. Thus far I've had great professors and am looking forward to another 4 years here!!"
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the small class sizes that CMU has to offer. I also enjoy that the University Center has a variety of food (including a Starbucks and an Express Chick Fil A), but the food is kind of pricey. The recently redone library has an Enstroms Coffee for breakfast and there also is new buildings that appear quite often. I do not like the fact that there is limited parking for commuting students."
Senior,4,CMU is amazing! Great location! Great programs of study! Nice teachers! Great extra curriculum programs!
Junior,4,"It's a small university, but that's a good thing, because you feel like a closer community that way. Every proffessor on campus absolutelly loves what they teach and it shows. The campus has a variety of food options, and if your not happy with what the campus provides there is so many restraunts within walking distance."
Sophomore,4,"CMU is an amazing school for people who don't want to go to a university too big or too small! the professors are wonderful and helpful. Cmu has various activities and sports constantly, and there is also end of the year concerts with various artists!"
Freshman,4,It’s a good university that has been expanding in the last couple years with new buildings and gaining more popularity. Gaining these new building for the programs offered at CMU has caught the attention of many students looking to go to a university that offers what they are looking for and is a little more affordable.
Junior,4,Colorado Mesa University has provided me with an outstanding education and experience. I have grown drastically as a student and as a person.
Freshman,4,"I would definitely recommend Colorado Mesa to one of my friends or family. They make you feel at home when your living on campus and the people are great! The town isn't too crowded so there's not too much traffic. This school gives many opportunities to the students to interact with each other such as clubs, club sports, and special events."
Freshman,4,"Colorado Mesa University has a beautiful campus that is surrounded by the mesa and the Colorado National Monument. However, if you aren't an outdoor person and come from a big city, then CMU might not be the place for you. Aside from the environment, the professors are very helpful, there are a decent amount of clubs to join, the facilities are great, and the dorms are quite nice."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Colorado Mesa University is limited at this point in my life. However, I am excited for that to change because I will be attending there in the Fall of 2018. I am a senior in high school, and have committed to play lacrosse at Colorado Mesa University. I have been to the campus multiple times and have even spent the weekend on campus during my official visit. I love the campus at Colorado Mesa, the facilities are all up to date and provide an amazing learning and training environment. As of now I know the campus has a large variety of studies, but I will soon find out what I prefer and don't prefer about the atmosphere. I think I will love the next four years of my life at Colorado Mesa University and I'm excited to see where life takes me while on the campus."
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is very open and friendly and there are lots of different clubs to choose from. There is also lots of resources to use and utilize.
Freshman,2,"There were some bad teachers at CMU that were careless and boring. At Colorado Mesa University it is very hard to have free time, a job, and study. Sometimes teacher want students to study more than two hours."
College Junior,2,"I know nothing about greek life, but we have little to none and that's part of the reason I chose Mesa!"
College Sophomore,2,Help the school but aren't large like other universities
College Freshman,2,"The dorm I live in is Garfield, and it has not been the best experience. A lot of the time our bathrooms are are not cleaned by the cleaning area, nor is our kitchen area. Also the dinning plan that comes along with the room is disgusting. The food is not good, and not always cook all the way or has been sitting out for an extended amount of time. Living on campus has not been as good as what the university makes it out to be."
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid at this school is a joke. There were a few scholarships that I qualified for and for all of them they said I, ""do not demonstrate a need for financial aid."" Right, because my mother who makes less than $20,000 a year is more than enough to help me pay for my education. Whereas the person who received the scholarship that has two parents that BOTH make six figures a year demonstrates a need for financial aid more than I do.

Brilliant."
College Freshman,2,"Our Greek life at Mesa just became a thing in 2015, only like one or two frats and sorority."
College Student,2,"I was in the theatre department for 3 1/2 years working on a degree in technical theatre with a concentration in management and production. It. Was. The. Worst.

The staff was unprofessional; professors sleeping with students, openly bad mouthing other staff, stating in class that they hate teaching and don't really care about their classes or what you're learning, they're just there for the pay check. Out dated equipment, a lack of recent real world experience, a department head more interested in community politics than the success of students who genuinely enjoyed seeing students mistreated and struggling (to the point that the school president had to intervene at one point).

The rest of the college was ok, but there is very little help in guiding you in how to reach your goals. Bad advisors. The school spends money unwisely - a huge focus on making the campus pretty as opposed to updating labs/equipment (unless you're in a medical or science/math based program - they are pushing that big time).

I wouldn't discount the whole school, but if you're seeking a degree in performing arts I would not attend this college ever. You will not find happiness or success during or after. Most of my classmates whom completed their degrees in technical theatre have gone back to get different degrees and start new careers or had to drop a similar amount of money to educate themselves on what current day employers are looking for. The performing arts department at CMU is a huge waste of money. Out of state tuition at a more accredited school would be more cost effective."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, the campus dining hall caused many illnesses and the food is of poor quality. The Bookclif Cafe has provided me with a better food quality through their transfer meal plan. However, the transfer meal plan includes 3 different choices that eventually become redundant."
College Sophomore,2,The housing within a short distance to campus is very expensive and many landlords will not accept applications from college students. Housing in this town is a bit expensive but there are plenty of places within driving distance of the campus though.
College Junior,2,I've never had an issue with safety and I never really hear anything bad that happens
College Sophomore,2,"The counselors work with you, but they awarded me a grant then took it away after the first week of school because they accidentally gave it to me. Not the best experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Getting into the nursing program isn't always the easiest. It is a selection process, you have to have met the class requirements and have good grades to get in it. But it is open for everyone to apply but not everyone is going to get in."
College Freshman,2,I have only received one scholarship from the school for being on the Student Conduct Board
College Junior,2,"For the bar/club scene, there isn't much of a variety."
College Sophomore,2,"There's no nightlife in Grand Junction... Pretty much all students want to do here is relax, smoke a bowl or sleep..."
College Sophomore,2,I've applied for 35 scholarships and financial aid within the last year and I haven't heard back from a single person.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't received an internship, and I am not sure if there are any available."
College Freshman,2,"The campus dining is okay for about a month.  Then variety gets old.  If you want to eat at the cafe and pay for it it is very expensive you can walk across the street to a fast food restaurant for more food, and cheaper price.  They have salads and things you would think are healthy but the type of food they serve you can taste the plastic package it came out of."
College Freshman,2,"In the atmosphere currently reside in, there is not a lot of options if you do not like to go outdoors.  Majority of what there is to do around here is outside.  When the weather is cold, there is snowboarding/skiing.  When it is warm, there is hiking, fishing and camping in the near buy mountains.   As for other attractions there are not many.  A small mall in town, a few parks with baseball fields, and a theater.  Restaurants are larger around here, nice variety.  If you are really looking of something to do you can find it, but we are not the most rural area."
College Freshman,2,we're going to die of clogged arteries
Recent Alumnus,2,Halfway through the Fall semester I received a letter saying they were going to take away all my financial aid. I had to write this letter explaining myself and it took them months to process it. I had to call them multiple times just to get them to go over my paperwork. It finally went through a week before classes started in the Spring semester. It is just a pain whenever I have to deal with the people in the financial aid office.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking lots are kept in poor condition, and regularly removed for a new building, but not replaced elsewhere. Often they're full."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't yet received any scholarships so I don't know how the school handles them.
College Sophomore,2,"As the school continues to grow, Parking continues to shrink."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I attend school on the Montrose campus, so getting around is not too difficult if you live in town because you can ride a bike, otherwise a car is required. There is public transit but unless you want to stop at every stop on their route and make it to class on time, then I suggest against it. When I have class up in Grand Junction then I try to car pool with somebody, but that also can be difficult because you are not on your time, you are on whomever your car pooling with, being up in Junction the whole day for a one hour class isn't always covenant."
College Junior,2,"I never trusted the meat to settle with my stomach from the cafeteria. Sometimes the options were okay, but never consistent or healthy. The philly place on north was a good option for flex money as well as the yogurt shop. Pita Pit got old after it became one of the few options after 8pm."
College Freshman,2,Again I cannot give a proper review because I have not experience the college life at CMU.
College Freshman,2,"I'm currently not enrolled at CMU as of this moment. I was accepted just this December and hoping to attend next fall. I am currently working right now hoping to make enough money for housing, supplies, and tuition."
College Freshman,2,Students get sneaky with the drinking and the smoking on campus and the RA's find them and write up.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly our Greek life is semi-nonexistent. A fraternity just started last year and the members are the football team. They have their own house, which is where the parties are, but other than that I don't hear about them. CMU is trying to start a sorority group soon."
College Freshman,2,"The school does enforce the dry campus. Meaning no drinking and no drugs. However, it does also depend on your RA (resident assistant). Some of them are very strict, others just want you to be in control and what not."
College Sophomore,2,"There is enough parking, but it is not always convenient.  You may have to jog to your next class if you don't give yourself enough time.  What is annoying is that the University restricted off campus parking and put in off campus parking lots that the University controls.  On the main campus, this means you need to pay the hundred or more for that parking pass, though you can live without one on the WCCC campus."
College Sophomore,2,"CMU is somewhat diverese. CMU is mainly a white dominated campus, but the students are very accepting of one another. I have many friends at the school, and most of them aren't white. I meet new people everyday by living on campus. There are many hispanics, Hawaiians, blacks, etc. It seems to me we have a very accepting community on campus and not many students feel left out of the loop."
College Freshman,2,"The people here are nice, mostly, but are interested in things I personally am not."
College Freshman,2,The mall food is not that great. But this is just the mall food there are other places to eat as well that I have not tried.
College Junior,2,Greek life is a very new thing at CMU. They just started this year and host events typically in conjunction with another group. The way they are starting their chapter is not fully appreciated by the whole of the student body. They still need to develop.
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the kids here seems to love this school, but there is not a lot of diversity. If you like skateboarding, biking, trucks, and country music, this is the place for you. If you're a laid-back wallflower that likes rap music, you may have trouble finding friends. If you are not white and like to have other people of your race to socialize with, I would not suggest this school. The teachers and the classes are enjoyable. The academics at this school are outstanding, but be prepared to pay an outrageous amount for books. I would transfer if I didn't have to lose so much time transferring schools last year."
College Sophomore,2,"The computer lab in the library can get pretty crowded. It definitely helps to have your own personal computer. However, many of the academic buildings have computer labs available to students outside of class time. I have never been in a dorm (so far) in which the internet outlet (in the wall) has worked. The WiFi works, but the network often goes does. The internet is slow most of the time and can make doing online homework a pain. If possible, to avoid all hassles you should have a personal computer with your own internet or do all homework on the school computers in the out-of-the-way labs."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a wide variety of restaurants off campus. Grand Junction is a very small town. There are all of the major fast food restaurants. However, when it comes to healthy, well-made meals the pickings are slim. I like Noodles & Company, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Which Wich. The are a few good more expensive restaurants too, like Boston's."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never been involved in any citations. However, the Grand Junction police are always patrolling the parking lots at night and have stopped to question me because I was sitting in my car talking on the phone. It's a little bit ridiculous. I was clearly not breaking any laws. Everyone else on campus abides by the ""as long as you're not being overly obvious"" rule. Just keep it discreet or stay off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"too few available. unfriendly staff and hard to find when needed. unclear as how to get extra scholarchips or met with the ""look on web"" response."
College Freshman,2,"Not Enough Space – There are MANY parking lots all around campus and they're full at pretty much anytime of the day after 9am to about 6pm. I live very close to the college so I just walk, but if I'm running late, I still have to walk because finding a parking space that's not near my house anyway is virtually impossible."
College Freshman,2,Not Many Options – Just transportation to airport 7 minutes away is extremely difficult and overpriced. Can't seem to get help from people on campus either.
College Sophomore,2,Drinking Is Happens More Than Drug Use – People mostly drink but there is some smoking depending on the group of people.
College Junior,2,Not That Great – Fall 2010 there 9/10 chicks were hot and easy to meet. Now by 2012 its has decrease to about 4/10  hot chicks.
College Sophomore,2,"A Few Concerns – There are a few safety concerns at CMU, but for the most part they seem to be under control. Harassment is the biggest worry, but there is little violence."
College Junior,2,"Drugs are a problem everywhere, it doesn't matter where you live. However, since I have been at CMU there have been 2 drug incidents (that I know of) where students were making and selling from their on-campus housing. It's really scary, but luckily they were dealt with accordingly. It's good to know that our RA's are persistent and watchful over these things, which makes me feel better, but at the same time it's frustrating because it makes you nervous. It's not something huge, but definitely something to watch out for."
College Junior,2,"Some New, Some Old – Since CMU (formerly MSC) became a university a lot of remodeling and additions of new buildings has been occurring. So construction is everywhere. Our oldest building on campus recently had its guts torn out and renovated and most of our buildings are state-of-the-art ... except for our biology building. It had a flood 3 years ago and they only renovated half of it... so you dread having class in the ""old"" part. It's sad, because we have so many great things going in the biology field at CMU and so much great equipment but the facility to house it and show others is severely decrepit and reflects poorly on not only the building, but also our department."
College Freshman,2,"Dining Hall – The first semester it was terrible, then they did a thing where we could give them feedback and things have gotten a little bit better but honestly the food still isn't very good."
College Freshman,2,Just Getting Started – I am just starting in my kinesiology degree. I have alot of free time as I only have one class on M/W/F even though I am taking 15 credit hours. The classes are pretty easy. I would like more challenge for what the cost is.
College Sophomore,2,"Social Atmosphere – The atmosphere of the dorms is almost terrifying. I lived in a newer dorm for a very short period of time. I couldn't find my way away from those who party, drink, and do drugs. I couldn't find a safe environment where I felt comfortable sleeping until I moved off campus. This is also basically the same thing I hear from everyone who has lived on campus. If they don't want to party, then on-campus living is not for them."
College Senior,2,"Only a Shuttle – There really isnt any transportation for the school itself. However, there is a shuttle to the community college if your classes are at that campus."
College Senior,2,Diverse groups abound at CMU but it is hard to get one stared since the population is relatively small.
College Freshman,2,They're Trying – There is no Greek life at CMU right now but they are trying to incorporate it. I wouldn't join but I do think it would be nice for some people as a place to fit in.
College Sophomore,2,Chilly Winters – Grand Junction is in a valley of the Rocky Mountains and winters can last up to 5 months.  This is great for the ski and snowboard bunnies but if you're from warm climate then double pack extra socks and sweaters to get through the winters.  Drivers are the worst in Grand Junction in cold weather.
College Freshman,2,"Over crowded, even with a parking pass, you are not always going to find a space near your dorm..."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't any fraternities or sorrorities at Mesa State College, so the greek life is really non-existant. I don't think it's not available because it's frowned upon, I think it's because there aren't enough students to create any greek atmosphere. Seeing that this year (2011-2012) Mesa State is becoming a university, it may change and there may be Greek life introduced to the student body."
College Sophomore,2,"eating out is expensive, no matter the city or college"
College Sophomore,2,kids are not really safe when it comes to partying and make stupid decisions
College Sophomore,2,"some are state of the art, others need major overhaul and are luckily getting it.  as a dance student, we do not have enough space for our program"
Junior,1,"Professors are useless!! I tried to get some help from them and they took forever to respond.
If I could I'd give this school ZERO stars. I transferred here from a CC and my experience there was horrible! I had a rough time trying to find help with tutors, not to mention that my academic advisor was helpless. Stay away from this school, it is cheap but definitely NOT WORTH IT!!
BTW, Grand Junction is super depressing and the atmosphere there is unwelcoming."

Sophomore,1,"This campus is highly unsafe and dangerous for any minority student (black, hispanic, gay, disabled, etc.). I am a member of the Student Government on campus and have been privy to several situations reported of students of color being assaulted on campus with the University failing to respond. Our University has no Diversity or Equity office so there is no resources on campus for minority students or their allies. With all of the hate crimes taking place across America, this campus is definitely a prime example."
Sophomore,1,"This review is for the Montrose campus. I can't speak for the Grand Junction campus.  I did the welding certificate program. If you plan on taking this course, then I must employ you to look else ware. The program is nothing more than an afterthought and, a weak attempt at robbing hard working families. When I arrived, the tiny shop had over a dozen OSHA infractions. This review has to be under a 1000 characters. I won't be able to publish all the problems. Simply put they are crooked liars and you will be robbed and misled."
Senior,1,"All future business students, I highly recommend going somewhere else to get your business degree. The Business Department is an absolute joke when it comes to the concern of students grades, health, and overall academic success. For example, the professor Fossett of the accounting field leaves students to fail and does not teach the curriculum but rather rushes through it. Another example would be the department head, he does not care about the students who are cheating or using advisors for advantages such as private trips to Denver or Salt Lake City. The lack of ethics is concerning, especially because CMU pushes ethics down students throats like some kind of holy water. The business department has failed and they need a restructure of the department. Do not go to CMU on the hopes of gaining valuable information, go to CU Boulder."
Alum,1,"I am a recent graduate from CMU/Western in the Electrical Linesman program.  This program offers a unrealistic opportunity upon graduation earning a position with an Electrical Coop as an Apprentice Linesman.  I have applied to 100's job throughout the US and have not even received an interview.  There are many other colleges/trade schools that offer the same certificate and are more reputable than CMU/Western.  This is a great profession if you can get a job, from my graduation class of 60 there are less than 10% have received a Apprentice position.  There are 100's of graduates with certificates each year in the state of CO with less than 25 real jobs with elect coops.  Most of the subcontractors use the recent graduates are there temp labor force with no real long term commitment to the employee.   I wouldn't recommend a high school graduate to enroll to CMU/Western Linesman program."
College Freshman,1,"We currently have one fraternity and one sorority. I tried joining a sorority interest group, trying to bring more Greek life to campus. The girls would complain about how cliquey it was within the group but whenever my friend and I would show up to meetings they would walk away from us. They are cliquey and aren't friendly."
College Freshman,1,Grand Junction is a run down town. There are lots of homeless because we are right next to the meth capital of Colorado. They aren't usually violent or do anything except the other day some were standing in the street waiting for a car to come up so that they could yell at the car. The people here are also very cliquey. It feels just like high school here where if you don't have a clique then you are completely alone. No one is overly social here and I can usually make friends pretty easily. My one friend and I currently are suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. She went to the school and the clinic to find help and the school at first said she was faking until she broke down in front of them. The clinic has never answered her calls or emails so this school is by far the worst and it is by far a terrible town.
College Freshman,1,I'm not sure if Colorado Mesa University had Greek Life.
College Junior,1,The faculty working in both the registration and administration don't really seem to work for the students but more for themselves.  I dislike working with any of them especially the Veteran Services office.  Would not recommend this school for veterans.
College Sophomore,1,People pee in public here..
College Sophomore,1,Go somewhere else if you can afford to.
College Sophomore,1,There is barely any Greek life here because it's a very recent addition to the school.
College Freshman,1,"One of the major reason I am no longer going to be attending school at Colorado Mesa University is because of the housing.  They have many roommate problems that administration does not deal with properly.  There is a lot of theft within the dorms.  The dorms are not taken care of, physically or on a social level.  If you have any sort of problem with anything no one helps you in the way they should."
College Freshman,1,I cant even get a job because everything is too far to walk. im going to be in debt forever
College Freshman,1,I did not qualify for any financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"I've lived in GJ for a while, it's a small town with an even smaller choice of restaurants. Expect nothing."
College Sophomore,1,We have a frat but that's all and they don't do anything. We may or may not have a sorority I don't know cause not much is said about it. I know we r trying for Greek life though.
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife is for students who are 21 or older. There are a few 18-and-older clubs, but I say skip the clubs, house parties are very hard to get into."
College Freshman,1,"You have to stay on the financial aid office and make sure that you get everything you can. Be  proactive or you will miss out on economic opportunity. Due to an error in the system i lost 2000 dollars. It wasn't my fault it was the schools, but because i wasn't on top of it i Missed out."

Sophomore,5,"When COVID-19 hit, they switched to online learning. I think they did the best they could in the little amount of time they had to make the switch. The professors seemed educated on how to continue the classes and help the students with any difficulties."
Sophomore,5,"I originally didn't plan to take online classes, but covid caused courses to switch online. My teachers were very adaptive and understanding with the new course situation. They understood that this was a big change for us all and in my opinion helped me feel less stressed about the situation."
Sophomore,5,"The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The campus is beautiful and makes you feel like you're at home as you walk from class to class. The small class size allows you to feel like you're actually seen and listened to, and the teachers are all helpful and encouraging."
Senior,5,"York College is one the best colleges in the world. The classes offered cover a wide range of topics, and the professors who teach those classes are the best. While there are a few professors that aren't the best, they certainly aren't the worse in the world. The school offers numerous clubs and out-of-class activities, and they offer the chance to create your own club. The surrounding city of York offers a great nightlife for students to unwind from the stress of assignments.  Overall, York College of Pennsylvania is a great place to attend."
Junior,5,"York really is an amazing school, you can be sure that everyone there wants you to succeed. The small (but not too small!) campus size really makes it feel like home."
Junior,5,With covid-19 all of my classes had to be taken online for the end of the spring semester. All of my professors handled this huge change wonderfully.
Junior,5,The professors in the education department are very helpful. The academic buildings and athletic facilities are amazing. York is a very well kept school with very friendly employees.

Sophomore,5,"York college is a great school! I never thought I would enjoy a small school in a small town but I love it there. Truly feels like home.

Freshman,5,i like the campus it is very nice and the professors are all very helpful also the nursing program is amazing and the dorms are pretty good could use some improvement but its ok also the area is real good its 45 minutes away from where i live so if i ever needed to go home its not a bad drive the admissions staff is also very helpful there is alo of diversity on campus
Freshman,5,Overall as a school York College is an amazing school to get an education that will help you go far in life. The professors really care and invest in your education.
Freshman,5,"I love York! Professors are great and campus is a great place to live! I really feel at home here, it's a small school so you really get to know a lot of people and a lot of professors."
Freshman,5,"I just got excepted and feel so welcomed already. I'm so sure I made the right choice, just excited to start this fall 2020. Everyone I talk to says such great things about the college from cost to administration. For me the best thing is that's it's close to home and I don't need to give up anything in my life and move away for 4 years."
Niche User,5,About a month ago I went on a college visit to York and I loved the campus. It was so nice and pretty. The Psychology program looks very interesting and I hope to study there. The dorms are so nice and the students seem to love the campus.
Freshman,5,"Fantastic small college experience, 15-1 student to faculty ratio, small class sizes with an engaging and friendly environment. Great student run events every weekend, lovely campus vibe, able to walk every where in 10 minutes or less."
Freshman,5,York College is a fun and open environment to all students and faculty. Here you will be pushed but encouraged to work hard and achieve your goals. Everyone here works hard to make sure they put you in the right position to succeed. While every student will welcome you in open arms to make you feel comfortable and that's exactly how it is for me.
Sophomore,5,I love this college from he people who work here tot he students that attend i have not had a true bad experience here and would recommend this college to anyone.
Junior,5,York is a very open and inviting school. They make everyone feel special and unique in their own way. They really help prepare people for their careers and their lives' ahead of them.
Sophomore,5,York College is a small school where teachers are actually concerned and want you to succeed. Many opportunities to get involved and very good nursing program.
Freshman,5,So far I like York college. The way they’ve been keeping me in the loop ever since the day I submitted my application and throughout the days I called more than once to check up to see if they reviewed it. I have no doubt in mind that I will love this school.
Alum,5,"York College has helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly professors equipped with real life experience.  After 3 years in the workforce, I've been able to apply the knowledge and experiences I had at YCP in the real world.  I highly recommend this school!"
Junior,5,York College has provided me with all the tools I need to succeed both in and outside of the classroom. The advisors and professors are always willing to help out in any and every way possible.
Sophomore,5,"I began York College of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2018. I had a tough first semester with my major, but after working and talking with many of York’s great staff I was able to make the best career decision for myself. I had a complete turn around and had a great end of the school year. The staff at York College of Pennsylvania deeply cares for you and your future and works with you to make the best decision for your future. York College of Pennsylvania offers many great clubs and activities to get involved in, making it a great home away from home."
Alum,5,"While applying for a multitude of colleges, York College of Pennsylvania (YCP) was an easy choice. The campus is beautiful. The professors are accessible and knowledgeable. Most importantly, you feel safe on campus as you receive a first rate education. I was fortunate enough to attend and complete a Bachelors in Arts. No class that I ever attended, whether in my major or not, was over 30 people. This creates an atmosphere that promotes healthy discussions between students and professors. This is essential as too big a class can limit students from accessing their professors directly."
Freshman,5,"I love college so much. It is so beautiful, the professors are absolutely wonderful. I genuinely enjoy going to school here. I am a biology major and seeing the professors get excited to teach us is amazing. I am not just being positive for the scholarship, I mean it. They are amazing people. I am getting a great education and it’s worth it... even at 8am!"
Freshman,5,I love my school !! Great people !! I could change the size and make it more bigger and have more to do like clubs and places to have fun
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere here at York college of Pennsylvania. The students are very friendly and outgoing and are always willing to lend a helping hand.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy attending York College. I love the life long friends that I have made. The Professors really show interest in their job and love teaching us. They genuinely care for their students and set us up for success.
Freshman,5,"York College of Pennsylvania has great professors that want to see their students grow in their majors. Most of the majors have great opportunities to add experiences to students resumes. For example, like Sport Management, students have a great chance to get practice in the field as a freshman."
Sophomore,5,"York College is very open and inviting. They want you to achieve your dreams and goals, and they will do anything to help you get there. The only thing I would like to see change is the amount of paperwork and deadlines there are for transferring students. Being one of those students, it was a bit stressful to try and meet all deadlines without any help from the people who worked there. Overall, everything else is great!"
Sophomore,5,I love York because everyone is so friendly including the faculty and they really care and look out for you.
Niche User,5,York College provides a supportive atmosphere with great academic instruction.      The professors are excited about teaching which envelops the students with the same excitement and interest.  There is so much to get involved with at York College.
Freshman,5,"My experience has been great so far. I love our campus and the programs are second to none. The food here is great, and because I have so much time between classes I'm able to go in and out of the cafes as I please."
Alum,5,I loved York College of PA because the class sizes were small and all the faculty were very supportive. Instead of being just a number I was known as a student by all my professors and received a great private education.
Freshman,5,So far tgey have been great. Easy application process and a great campus atmosphete. Flexibility in spending is great option.
Junior,5,York College allows students to experience a private school education with a public school cost. YCP has given me much more then I can express.
Freshman,5,This college is very diverse and has a great atmosphere. The inclusiveness is excellent as well as the overall experience.
Senior,5,"My experience thus far has been an amazing journey from timidness to confidence, inexperienced to knowledgeable, and  unskilled to professional. York College does a great job at preparing you to be an equipped individual who is well-rounded and ready to take on any task. Also, the personal feel here, is second to none. My professors know my name and genuinely care not only about my performance in academics, but also my personal well-being. I would like to see more diversity on campus concerning race and ethnicity. However, each year there is an increase in diversity ratings and it's noticeable."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy going to york college very much. The york college experience is packed with excellent academics, very good teacher-student relationships and plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities; not to mention the different performances that come to the college. My all around experience has been amazing."
Freshman,5,I like that it's a smaller school and it's a lot of hands on. The people and upper class are very helpful. It also a very clean school and the student also keep it clean . They also have a lot of active and group for the student to do or join and keep them busy.
Freshman,5,"My experience so far has been very good. The campus food is either hit or miss. Some days there is good food, other days there is not so good food. As expected with any college classes, there is a heavy work load. It is manageable, but it can get stressful sometimes."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small classes that YCP offers. The campus is gorgeous and easy to get around. YCP has the nicest professors and wonderful campus activities. The only downside I’ve seen is the cost of tuition, however YCP is a private institution so it’s okay I guess."
Junior,5,"York College of Pennsylvania offers many different programs to many different people. Each program is staffed with friendly and very knowledgeable professors who will work with their students so that they are able to succeed in their career. There are many different opportunities that are made available for students including many sports programs, clubs, internship availabilities, career fair and much more. York is a fantastic school to start off anyone's college career and you are guaranteed to succeed."
Freshman,5,"I like the school because it is smaller and more intimate. Students really get to know one another around the campus. I would like to see the classrooms become more modernized, however; many still have chalkboards in use."
Freshman,5,"I lov e going to York, all the professors and people are super great and helpful. Everyone is looking out whats best for you as a student and they offer amazing sources to go to when help is needed. I would like to see a change in any in the security of driving in and out, though I know they are now adding more check in podiums so its a step in the right direction"
Sophomore,5,"York College of Pennsylvania is a great school to gain further education. York College creates a community with their students and the students have many opportunities to grow and expand as individuals. The professors of York College encourage students to do their best work, and they help students reach their goals. The academics and courses are challenging and beneficial to real world situations. Overall, York College of Pennsylvania is a awarding school that provides students with the most in order to improve their future."
Senior,5,Classroom size allows you to get to know your professors one on one and build a relationship. The sports teams are a fun way to hangout with friends and cheer on fellow classmates and friends.
Alum,5,"I am a 1989 graduate of YCP.  My college advisor was a mentor for me as I grew up at college.  She guided me to where I needed to be.  I stayed in contact with her a couple years after I graduated through an intern from York College that I supervised.  My former advisor came by my work place to see how the intern student was doing as well as how I was progressing in my field of study.  
My experience at YCP was a positive one that I introduced York to my daughter as she started to look at colleges.  My 
daughter also decided to attend York College and is now in her second semester of her sophomore year.  She has embraced YCP by being part of the theater program, being a RA, & also the campus activities board.  
York College has been a wonderful experience for myself as well as my daughter.  I highly recommend York College of PA to anyone who is looking for a small college with a family cohesive experience."
Freshman,5,My experience at York college has been great from day one. Everyone is so helpful. Can't wait to continue this year's there.
Freshman,5,"I am currently enrolled at York College of Pennsylvania and I have to say I love it! The campus is so beautiful and small enough where you can wake up five minutes before class and still make it! My experience here has been nothing but great and it has to do with the kindness of the students, professors and even the workers. Everyone here is so welcoming and makes you feel at home even when you are living away."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my experience at York College.  I am a nursing major and I have found that all of the professors and academic advisors are overly helpful.  The program is set up very efficiently and I wouldn't change a thing.  Being only a freshman I have a lot in store for me, but I am confident that York will provide me the opportunity to acquire all of the skills I need to be successful in my career."
Freshman,5,"Such a great environment, so much to do, and always feel welcomed with support. There is never a day you could be bored here, so many activities in a great area of the town. Many verities of almost anything and everything. It's perfect in my world."
Freshman,5,I honestly love my little liberal arts college. College really has really been a time for my to learn a lot about myself and the world around me and I believe York truly has helped with that.
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely wonderful college.  I love the class sizes, the faculty and staff, and the stunning campus.  I would definitely recommend coming here!"
College Sophomore,5,"York College of Pennsylvania does a great job of making sure that their students are safe on and off campus. Between local police and campus safety, there are many resources in which students can get help or assistance if needed."
College Sophomore,5,"York College of Pennsylvania is a great school for anyone looking to really succeed. They make it possible to do your best from day one. From professors to counselors and other staff members, they have all of the resources you need to do well in your classes. I went into college feeling very confident and prepared and I ended my freshman year feeling the same. I really do believe that YCP will prepare me for my future goals in the best ways possible!"
Alum,4,Overall I had a great experience with york college the professors truly care about you and seeing you succeed.
Senior,4,"Not perfect obviously, but I've had a pretty good experience. My major is really small (even at a small school) so my average class usually has around 10 students in it max. Big emphasis on academics here, so athletic events and greek life aren't really that much of a thing. Definitely liked the small private college experience much more than I would have ever a big state school or something."
Sophomore,4,"York College of Pennsylvania is a great place to study! The faulty and staff are always super helpful and always willing to help you, no matter the question or situation. The dining halls are always clean, and the food is always good with a wide selection to choose from. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the students are always pleasant."
Sophomore,4,"As of right now, I haven't taken any online courses with York, but from what I've heard, it actually good and professors take the time to help you out as much as possible."
Sophomore,4,"So far, the college is really good, they're taking COVID extremely serious.  As of right now services are pretty slow, but it makes sense considering how many students are enrolling as of now.  York is also in a small area so it wouldn't be city like or anything, and you won't be a number there, they'll actually take the time to get to know you."
Junior,4,I am enjoying york so far the enviroment and facilities are nice but the school is very disorganized administration wise when it comes to being financially affordable.
Freshman,4,I did not take classes online but I have only heard good things about it. My roommate said the professors were easy to contacts and would make time to meet.
Freshman,4,it was extremely good and fit me well. I had some struggles adjusting to the new environment but teachers and advisors made it easy.
Sophomore,4,"The college has been great so far, transferring here has definitely been worth it!  The professors are great, they are fun yet very knowledgable and have given fair exams throughout my first year here.  Overall, coming from a transfer commuter student, York has been a welcoming environment, one that has already elevated the capabilities of my learning!"
Junior,4,"Put AC in all buildings, and have the police actually care about the wellbeing of their students not underage drinking."
Sophomore,4,"I just transferred to York College this school year of 2019-2020. The environment of the school is warm and welcoming. However, everyone's really busy with their own school works that no one really talks to each other, but if you approach them they will talk to you, so I guess it's pretty okay. And everyone can work on their own phase and stay anywhere inside the campus. I also like how the professors teach their lessons and everyone is participating in class and trying to pass the course."
Junior,4,"Most of the professors are very helpful and flexible. The classes are small and makes it easy for each student to get the help they need. I was a commuter, and parking was sometimes a pain. The parking lot would flood, or the parking garage would be shutdown because of falling concrete."
Freshman,4,"I love the people at York, everyone is friendly. I also feel safe on and around campus. On top of that the College is very connected to York City and the surrounding community."
Alum,4,York had an excellent Communications program. The surrounding city of the campus wasn't exactly safe.
Sophomore,4,Average college experience for a commuting student. Campus is friendly and nice. Advisers and faculty are helpful and knowledgeable.
Junior,4,I love the teachers. They are also helpful and can accommodate and needs you may have. The campus is also beautiful.
Freshman,4,Great behavioral science program. Student involvement is highly encouraged by all faculty members. Many clubs to choose from when looking for something that interest you. There are many job opportunities on campus for students who do not our a car.
Junior,4,"The academics associated with York College of Pennsylvania has been fulfilling. The safety of the campus could definitely be better, and taken more serious. The school is expensive, so I would think the campus looked better in terms of the inside of the buildings. Overall, I would recommend the school solely based on their academics."
Sophomore,4,I transferred to York College Of Pennsylvania for my Sophomore year of college. The campus environment makes me feel at home and comfortable. Every person I have come into contact with so far has been nothing but nice towards me.
Freshman,4,"My experience at York College of PA was excellent. Everyone here is very friendly; professors can work with you as much as they can. Dorms and food have had no issues, and their athletics are pretty good as well."
Freshman,4,My freshman experience at York College has been amazing so far and I cannot wait to continue my education here for the upcoming years.
Freshman,4,I really like it here at York College only being a freshman. I think the things that could change is more food options everyday instead of the same stuff everyday.
Freshman,4,They made my transition from high school to college very smooth and welcoming! I absolutely love York college. It has a welcoming and quiet atmosphere. They provide great places to study. The teachers also want to be involved and help the student succeed in their class.
Sophomore,4,"This school is a place where people of all different backgrounds can go. The school is small enough that you do not seem overcrowded and teachers are helpful outside of the classroom. Living on campus and being involved is made simple. For a private institution, the tuition is extremely affordable."
Junior,4,"Professors are willing to work closely with students to ensure that they understand the material and leave class with an abundance of knowledge. As with every college, you have to love the classes you are taking to succeed, and YCP offers a great selection of majors and courses to choose from. The downside is that classes are not always offered when needed and there are very few online classes, and no classes to take over the winter to help finish the degree early."
Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is very well. There isn't much diversity but there is some. Most professors are amazing, especially in the psychology department. The dorms are nice and cozy. For freshman they really help you transition from the high school routine. They are always extremely helpful with any problem you have."
Freshman,4,"I haven’t started at York College yet, but I have taken the tour, learned about the school and spent the day with current students. Everybody there is super knowledgeable and eager. It made me excited to start my journey as a Spartan and continue my education for my future."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing, they are willing to help you as much as possible and will direct you to others who can help you if they can't. There are plenty of resources on campus for students. The campus is gorgeous, and dorm life is good if you get the air conditioned dorms."
Senior,4,What I like most about York College is the small classrooms. My classes only have about 20 students (at most 30). This has allowed me to have great one on one contact with my professors when I need help with course material. The food is alright some days. Overall the school is what you make of it. If you surround yourself with great people and are involved on campus it'll become more than just a small campus.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the atmosphere as well as the staffs interest in helping the student body. All students are very welcoming of other new students.
Freshman,4,The people here are really friendly and ready to help with any of your needs. The teachers are really passionate about their forte. The tutoring center is also one of my favorite resources on campus.
Niche User,4,"I have been accepted into the class of 2023 at York College. I thought that the campus was really nice. The professors were friendly, and the food there is great!"
Senior,4,York College is a great private college. You feel very connected to people here. It has a small college vibe. The area right around the campus is not the greatest but Downtown York is very up and coming.
Sophomore,4,"I am so happy I chose York College of Pennsylvania as my school. I am an education major and I love the program I am in and I absolutely love how many activities there are on campus to meet new friends. The campus is not in the safest area but I have never felt unsafe on campus and I believe the college takes amazing precautions to prevent incidents occurring on campus. If you are looking for a small, close-knit school York College is a great place to go"
Junior,4,"I like that there is a wide range of majors available to pursue and travel opportunities to take advantage of. Virtually anything ranging from sports management to psychology. If I could, I would change  the moodle system of grading that most of the professors use because as with other things to do with technology, in some cases the system is flawed."
Niche User,4,"My cousin attends York College of Pennsylvania as I will be in the fall of 2019.  I have been on campus, taken tours, met professors and have been nothing but impressed!"
Sophomore,4,York College of PA is a great school! The advisors are super helpful and the professors are amazing! The students are great as well.
Freshman,4,"Great academics. Student life seems a bit lacking, though. Even though the surrounding neighborhood isn’t that safe, campus is well protected by campus safety. Freshman dorms are really small. Professors seem to really care about you and want you to succeed. Gym is on West Campus so it’s a bit of a walk, especially in the cold. Just got a Starbucks on campus, so that’s super exciting. There is a wide variety of class options and study spaces. Food from the dining halls are okay, but I prefer Spart’s Den."
Freshman,4,The reason I chose York College is because of its Sports Management program. I have enjoyed my classes and met so good friends during my first semester. I look forward to my next three years.
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love attending York college of Pennsylvania. I am currently a sophomore in my second semester and have worked very hard to get the grades I have. Most of the classes are taught by great professors. However I have had an experience with an accounting class that was so hard over half of the class dropped out. I passed with about a 72%.
Sophomore,4,This has been an overall good school so far. There is so much support when needed and the teachers are very helpful.
Niche User,4,I liked the campus and the student life seemed like a lot of fun.  The food was good and the nursing program seems great too! The dorms for Freshman need updated. Shared bathrooms and boys and girls have every other floor.
Junior,4,"Overall, I think YCP is a great college. The class sizes are fairly small,making one-on-one help from your professors available. In all the classes I have had, the professors are always willing to help and I feel that I have truly learned a great deal since I have been here. There are always activities going on and plenty of clubs. My biggest complaint is that the college definitely caters to their resident students. The activities and club meetings are usually at night or on weekends, which are inconvenient as a commuter student. There are plenty of job opportunities on campus and internships available. My other major complaint about the school is that they don't have many scholarships and financial aid options available, making it difficult to afford an already pricey school."
Junior,4,The campus is very nice along with everyone who works there. On the smaller side but but still large enough to the point where you can constantly meet new people. The bonus to the size of the school is that you are a name and not a number.
Sophomore,4,"York College of PA is a nice institute with great academics and campus life. The staff and student body are friendly. However, I would like to see more diversity among the student body."
Junior,4,"The main campus is beautiful in the spring and in the winter when it is covered in snow, but when it snows they completely disregard the disabled. They push the snow into the wheelchair ramps outside of the buildings, and some of the buildings are not very accessible. The student union building has the disability bathroom located upstairs down a very narrow bathroom. On weekends the shuttles do not run, so disabled students on North Campus have to walk to main campus to eat, and thats if the dining hall isn't closed on that Saturday because of one of the many Open Houses that they close access to students for. Classes are normally good, and there's normally stuff to do on campus, but accessibility is an issue."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my experience at York College, I made so many new friends. Also the ratio of student to professor is amazing you can really get some one on one time with your teacher if needed."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at YCP, but in hind sight I wish I had used my time more wisely and gotten involved in academic programs outside of the normal program. It's a good school for education majors because it gets you into the classroom freshman year."
Freshman,4,"The academics are very good at York College of Pennsylvania and at the end of the day it is what we all came here for. Even though the main reason for coming here was for my education, also came to build up my social skills because I did not give myself the opportunity to do that in high school. York does a good job at getting the students involve with the activities they hold. I wish there was more diversity when it comes to the student that attend the school. I'm there are ways to work on it though."
Sophomore,4,"York is a small, but beautiful school that provides many of opportunities if you put yourself out there and take them. There is many activities that happen on campus on weekends, although many people still go home. The location isn’t the best, but if you use good judgement you’ll be fine. Couldn’t see myself going anywhere else"
Junior,4,"I love how York College is small enough that you are able to be known personally by professors and peers, but large enough that there is still a lot of diversity among the student body. I like that the professors are always willing to help both in and out of class, and I truly love how pretty the campus is as well."
Senior,4,"The small classes, greenery, and close relationships with my professors and major have made my last 3 1/2 years at York memorable and cherished!"
Freshman,4,It is a very nice campus. The area is not very nice when it comes to the dark night hours. If you come to this campus and need to go outside in the dark take a buddy. Other than that the college is very clean and nice.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at York College of PA and it has been a good experience, I've made friends and excelled academically. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved and everyone is very friendly. There are lots of things to do such as attending basketball games to movie nights. I've enjoyed going to school here, classes have been challenging but not so difficult that I have to study all the time."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to York College and I have never felt more at home at school! I felt so welcomed by faculty, students, and peers."
Sophomore,4,I was very happy that I committed to YCP because it has become a home away from home. I have met people I see spending my life with and growing into who I am supposed to be. The feel of the college is very welcoming and most employees are very helpful. Professors go out of their way for the students that make an effort. I am happy to call myself a Spartan.
Freshman,4,York College of Pennsylvania is a good college with excellent professors. There are many opportunities to do around the campus and it has small class sizes. York provides you with a strong education and successful future careers.
Freshman,4,"York college is a great school. The campus is large, but small enough that you can easily walk to all classes. The professors are great at getting to know you, and making sure you learn the material. Highly recommend the school."
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see the school improve the website and make it easier to keep up to date. The food on campus is very limited, with everything being closed before midnight. I would like to see some of the places to eat on campus to stay open at least as late as the library is open. The safety of the students could also be improved a lot by increasing security."
Freshman,4,"I liked York College because the other students and faculty were very welcoming and personable. The school seemed very safe and campus safety was everywhere. I liked that the professors had real world experience in my major so I know they know what the real world is like. The dorms are very nice and spacious, friends that come over say ours are much larger than other schools. The technology is very up to date and taken care of. The IT department is on top of things and are very quick to take care of any technological problems we have. The only concern that I have is that main and west campus are separated by a neighborhood and it is not very safe especially at night. Shuttle services don't run on the weekends when most students are out and could use a ride around campus. Otherwise things are very good."
Sophomore,2,Old and outdated technology. Paying full price for terrible online courses that I could take for 1/3 the price at my local community college
Sophomore,2,"Most of the dorms are extremely old and run down. Constant problems with meal plan balances and having to go to administration to get my meals fixed. Extremely aggressive (or bored) Campus Police harassing students for anything and everything, meanwhile people are getting shot right outside the campus. No extra Curricular activities to speak of. Food is terrible, except on parent and new student visit days.  Poor online classes during COVID, and they raised their rates on top of it. Paying more than full price for half the experience. Look Elsewhere!"
Junior,2,Online learning was very disorganized and messy. Some professors were fine while others were trash at it. I got little to none of my money back spent on housing for that semester and was forced to cancel my internship that I already worked so hard for with mo word from the college.
Junior,2,The teachers did the best they can. Some did great other fell short. The leadership of the school did not help at all they set everyone up for failure in this situation.
Freshman,2,"I am a freshman at York College this year and so far I do not like it there. The week of move in day and orientation were so fun and gave me so much to look forward to, just to see that two weeks later the campus was dead silent with nothing to do. It is so boring at this college that I go home every weekend because I hate it. Academically I love the education at york and everything they have to offer in that aspect but, as far as college experience and college life I would not recommend going here. There are parties on Jackson street fairly often but there are cops everywhere, which does make you feel safe while there but at the same time so many people have been drug out of the frat houses on Jackson street simply just for partying and minding their business. This is just not the setting for me."
Freshman,2,"The college is oversold at ALL pre-enrollment events.  After the first week, it is aparent that the food is severely lackluster and eating healthy is rarely possible, the shuttle system is inefficient, as a freshman you must park your car on the opposite campus (apparently living near your car is a ""privilege""), and some professors are out to help you, but the small class size really just leads to a High School 2.0 situation.  Most students being commuters or living within 45 minutes of their house means that there is nothing to do on weekends, unless you're a big fan of laundry and guessing what time the dining hall is open."
Niche User,2,"York College is meant for certain type of people. If you do not fit into that mold that they have created for their students, you will not survive. Most professors do not care to help you, and are just there for a paycheck. The school does have lots to do for student life, and the sports teams are okay. I would not recommend this school."
College Sophomore,2,"Some days, you can walk around campus for a while before you see campus safety. The emergency lights are not reassuring or comforting. Generally, at night I feel moderately safe on Main campus, uneasy on west, and VERY uneasy about walking from main to west.

I addressed the health in a different review, but I'll say that the health services as far as mental illness and counseling services are lackluster. The office is only open during business hours of the school which is incredibly inconvenient for on-campus residents. Not everyone has a car or access to mental health services after office hours. I can count the amount of counselors on one hand, and the availability and scheduling convenience is terrible.

I will say that the counseling office does TRY to be helpful. And their events are definitely visible since they often do things in the student center. However, the quality of their services are often lacking."
College Freshman,2,Not many people  who are not directly connected to sports teams in some way really care
College Junior,2,"Sports are NOT York's strong suit. Many students have never been to a sporting event at any time in their college career here. While the sports teams will attend each other's event to support one another, not many other students come out to games. As for school spirit, I believe that we have great school spirit. Our mascot, the Screamer, can be seen around campus at all events and is one of the identifiers of the college. The athletic facilities at York are really great. Our gym is state of the art and the pool is fantastic. We also have a variety of other fitness activities at the Grumbacher Sports and Fitness Center to get involved with such as racquetball, intramural sports, and the rock climbing wall. The Grumbacher also sponsors quite a few fitness classes that have kicked my butt over the past three years I have attended the college."
College Junior,2,There is a lot of drug useage here
College Junior,2,I am afraid of walking around campus or near campus at night alone. I also think the counseling services have a lot of room to grow
College Junior,2,Somehow I have always gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to on-campus housing. To say that my dorm room freshman year was probably the nicest is terrible.  My housing situations should have gotten better each year rather than worse.
Recent Alumnus,2,Trying to get off campus housing a hassel. They do not let you know whether you are approved and some people have to wait until the summer to find out. It is rediculous! It is like they have no method.
Recent Alumnus,2,Campus safety is extremely strict and it is like you can not do anything fun like even make noises without them coming to get you.
College Freshman,2,"The food in the dining halls leave a lot to be desired. The food options are quite limited and don't often taste good. There are a few good meals that I make a point to eat in the dining hall but they are few and far between. West Campus Dining hall is better than main by a longshot and the other dining options like Sparts Den and Pura Vida are excellent. However, if you don't have dining points, they can be very expensive."
College Freshman,2,"lots of things are undercooked, and not enough options other than the dining halls"
College Freshman,2,"For my dorm, I hate the people here. I'm trying to move to a better dorm."
College Freshman,2,"I wish I would have received more since dealing with hard financial times, but basically what you get is what you get."
College Freshman,2,The party seen is pretty boring.  Unless you have your best friends with you and you're drunk then its boring.  No one dances and its small.  The best places are frats or sports houses which are on jackson street but those get pretty boring plus they charge not only guys but girls as well and then kick everyone out when they get the amount of money they want.
College Freshman,2,The campus food is nasty. Its the same things.
College Freshman,2,The city my school is near is known as a bad area there is crime and safety issues and the town doesn't have much going on.  There is not really good shopping unless you have a car and you can drive 15 minutes to a mall.  The town isn't all that warming.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know what they put in the food, but even chicken does not taste like chicken."
College Sophomore,2,We are out in the middle of nowhere
College Freshman,2,"Campus safety takes away the positive connotation many people have about police before they enter York. It's sad when once a student experiences the verbal harassment/brutality of an officer, they will almost never think positively about police again. I hope that campus safety will recruit more personable officers during my years at York. The crime that occurs off campus is also a little scary. I frequently hear gunshots outside at night. Fortunately the campus notifies students every time an armed robbery occurs near campus so the stud eye will then be prepared to be on their guard."
College Senior,2,I do not feel as though there are enough eating places in the immediate area that offer student prices. They are farther away and only a few in walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,dining halls are only available with by a monthly rate. I don't typically eat at school. If I do I may get a sandwich at Pura Vida. Somewhat reasonable.
College Sophomore,2,No real nightlife in York.
College Freshman,2,"Not only is it nearly impossible to get the school to allow you to live off campus if you started out on campus, but the houses are all in a pretty shady neighborhood. If you're looking for off campus housing to avoid the cost of living on campus, it isn't worth it."
College Sophomore,2,Basically if you do not have a car you cant go anywhere off campus.
College Sophomore,2,To be honest the greek life here is really annoying. If you are not in it people look down on you and you can tell. For such a small school the greek life system should not mean that much.
College Freshman,2,There aren't really a lot of place to go off campus if you do not have a car.
College Freshman,2,"It has been described as ""5 steps away from Lights out."" Meaning it's very similar to a boarding school."
College Sophomore,2,"yes, people do it but there isn't a huge scene and a need for them."
College Sophomore,2,The school does not offer as much help and scholarships as people truly need and deserve.
College Sophomore,2,it rains a lot here so bring boots and an umbrella
College Junior,2,"The atmosphere is so dry. only thing to do is bowl, go to movies, and eat dinner. But its not too far from big cities and schools"
College Junior,2,"Mostly McDonalds and taco bell. If people want to eat at 4am, the only option is Mcdonalds. There are a few nice restaurants but they are pricey for the average college student"
College Freshman,2,I didn't get much financial aid but got a nice scholarship. 
College Freshman,2,Not may areas to park and find a spot but the parking lots are close to classes and dorms. 
College Senior,2,its pretty disgusting and really expensive. once youre a sophmore and up you dont have to buy the meal plan.  
College Senior,2,"the rabbit transit (public transportation in york) is infrequent and not the safest, the transportation for on campus is decent "
College Sophomore,2,"York seems to be a very rainy city and during my time here so far we have had school cancellations because of Sandy a two hour delay due to the snow and timely warnings to move our cars in areas that the bridge may over flow. I have heard rumors of cars as well as student dorms flooding and property being ruined from the rain, none the less when it nice outside campus is really beautiful especially in the Spring. "
College Junior,2,"I would not say there is a real bad drug problem here at York. the only thing i see a lot may be marijuana use, and a little molly hear and there. a lot of people drink on the campus despite it being a dry campus, but campus satisfy and RA's are pretty strict in citing people caught doing it. People still drink and greek life still parties, and if someone doesn't want to do something no one is going to try and force a person to.   "
College Sophomore,2,"Parking isn't awful, if you are an upperclassman that is. If you are a freshman then you really get the short end of the stick where your car is anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes walking distance from your dorm room at any point in time. As an upperclassman it can be anywhere from a 3 - 15 minute walk to your car. The real downfall though is that if you commute, don't ever park next to the creek on a day that it's going to rain because the creek WILL overflow and flood the surrounding area."
College Sophomore,2,"The police in town do their jobs well in cracking down on underage drinking, but the campus safety will write up anyone who is with an underage drinker if they're in the same room. Then there's a whole trial process with the folks at residence life to make sure their innocent. Drugs is worse. If you get caught with pot, you'll get placed on disciplinary probation for one whole semester. If you get caught again during probation, you are in danger of losing your scholarship, but you might be able to keep it if your GPA is high enough. Sometimes it all just depends on who busts you and what's at stake."
College Junior,2,"All the dining options are currently owned and operated by Chartwells, therefore, overpriced and not too many options and pretty low quality food."
College Freshman,2,the health services and campus safety do an okay job but nothing special.
College Freshman,2,"The quality of the dorms is dependent on which dorm you stay in. A few have air conditioning, but those are only available to those who ask for them early, and that can afford them. If not, the other dorms are more of an older style and don't have air conditioning."
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, the weather is very unpredictable on an hour-to-hour basis: one day it will be very cold outside and it will be raining hard , then later that same day the sun will come out and it will be at a comfortable temperature outside."
College Freshman,2,"The police in the area are very strict. First time offenders for underage drinking can get a large fine just for being at a party serving alchohol even if not caught drinking. Any party that's advertised is not the place to go. Be discreet or you will get caught, fined and possibly placed on probation. If involved with a sports team there are even more reprocussions for getting caught."
College Sophomore,2,There is really no night life available for under 21.  The school does have clubs but they do things on like Saturday afternoons.
College Junior,2,"The police force/campus safety are strict. They camp out on campus to find students that come back onto campus drunk. If you're going to drink, be careful and don't be obvious about it unless you want to get caught. The entire campus is dry except for one small part, and if you're caught drinking you have to go to a disciplinary hearing."
College Junior,2,"Campus safety is a joke, they either do nothing or come down too hard on students. I often feel like campus safety is ""out"" to get students instead of help them. Keep your doors and windows locked, and you'll be fine."
College Senior,2,"When it rains a lot the creek that runs through campus floods, flooding part of a commuter parking lot.  They usually only cancel class if there's a state of emergency.  When it's nice out, everyone's outside."
College Senior,2,You have to be approved to live off campus and res life doesn't like to approve many people.
College Freshman,2,"There a number of students how do drugs, however if you do not know them personally, it is hard to tell how actually does any."
College Sophomore,2,"Very, very few people go to any sporting events. People never talk about how the sports teams are doing because nobody cares. The teams are relatively successful in some sports but have no school spirit behind them. There is NO FOOTBALL TEAM. yeah, crazy right? On the plus side the field/track is nice and the gym is also a very nice facility."
College Sophomore,2,"The two dining halls close early, and their food is quite bad. Get a room with a kitchen and cook your own food as soon as possible."
College Sophomore,2,"The food here is pretty go when you first come, but living here for months on end, you start to realize that there aren't a lot of options to choose from. I like that ever month or so we have a theme and they switch up the food but other than that the food is boring."
College Freshman,1,York doesn't want its student to pursue off campus housing. It became a prevalent issue this year in the housing lottery system because Res. Life didn't approve anyone to life off campus but couldn't provide housing for all of the residents.
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much school spirit or attention towards the athletics. The ""screamer"" is our mascot which doesn't makes sense because we are known to be the spartans. Since there is no football team, the school overall doesn't feel that proud or supportive about the athletics."
College Freshman,1,"As I mentioned earlier in the survey earlier, campus safety acts more like the drug enforcement agency than a task force that is meant to keep students safe. Many of the campus safety officers are verbally brutal and closed minded. They also tend to recurrently follow certain students they are bothered by. They only choose to protect and serve the people they deem worthy instead of everyone. It's upsetting. Personally, I was verbally harassed by a member of campus safety, who wasn't even an officer. The man threatened to write me up because he felt as though I was smoking a cigarette too close to a building when in reality, he was bothered by the smoke. The man had no authority to write me up or even threaten to do so. The verbal brutality of the officers are also very bad. Some officers constantly question and accuse students of violating codes of conduct who in all reality are innocent. I feel unsafe being supposedly ""protected"" by these people."
College Senior,1,"There are not enough spaces for commuters and with the price of parking passes, you should always be able to have somewhere to park. I feel that if you pay tuition, then for students parking should be free. Likewise, there needs to be better parking off campus as well, without the threat of being ticketed."
College Freshman,1,Literally nothing to do. No where to go.
College Freshman,1,"If you aren't in greek life, there is NOTHING to do. Everyone acts like they are so much better for being in greek life."
College Freshman,1,We have had multiple armed robberies on campus so far this year
College Freshman,1,The weather this winter has been disgusting and they don't tell you when you come on a tour that when it rains the entire campus floods like crazy and the walkways get soooo slippery and they aren't cleared often.
College Freshman,1,Nobody really gets involved in Greek life at my college. 
College Senior,1,"landlords are terrible and will rip you off, dont rent from mike you will have mice, cold water, and no heat.  scott jacks up his rent. theres no win win landlord but if you live off campus rent from scott."
College Senior,1,campus safety and the local police pry on college students. keep in mind we are located in the 18th most dangerous city in america and a 19 year old drinking is more important than a meth lab or a rape one block away. priorities need to be changed 
College Sophomore,1,Surprisingly this school is not diverse for the city it is located in
College Sophomore,1,"I have to park about 20 minutes from where I live.  If I get home late from work and don't feel like waiting for the shuttle for forty minutes, and I don't feel like walking home in the dark, I will park by my dorm.  I always get ticketed for it.  No matter what.  Campus safety always feel the need to check every parking lot to make sure everyone is in the right spot, even when there are clearly lots of spots left for other people to park in.  It's as if they don't care that you were going to walk in the dark home instead."
College Freshman,1,"The only scholarships are available based only on your high school grades which I think is crazy, since most people get better grades when they are in high school"
College Freshman,1,"Some days the sun is shining, but the very next day it will snow! And it rains at some of the strangest times"
College Freshman,1,It's not that great there are decent frat parties but the college and local police crack down hard on partying so most people dont go out because its not worth being cited.
College Freshman,1,"Were not a very large school, but we aren't all that diverse either. I can only name one person that isn't from the upper east coast, and can no longer name any black students (the one I did know could not afford the school any longer). As much as I love this school, it isnt racially or religiously diverse; however, we do seem accepting of all sexual orientations."
College Freshman,1,Terrible. Registration sucks you can never get the class you want or need to take because they fill up so quickly. Athletes and seniors get first pick.
College Freshman,1,"Its terrible the shuttle service sucks. the school owns 5 shuttles and only runs 1 out of 5 on a daily basis. the buses are always late, even with the new shuttle app we got they still aren't very accurate."
College Sophomore,1,The professors are literally all awful for international relations. It is dumb how they force you to study abroad when many can't afford it. The workload is very easy but most tests are dumb because many professors don't make study guides for students. Very few internship opportunities worthwhile.
College Sophomore,1,"It's the same boring thing every day. People hang out with roommates and very small friend groups. All most people do is watch netflix, play video games, or talk. Some people play sports at the gym or workout. There is nothing to do around campus but sit around and talk because no one goes to sporting events. The few people who are studious go to the library a lot but that is rare."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a few professors who are funny, intelligent, and cool to be around. But for the most part, I would say 90% of the professors here are either ignorant, unable to teach the material, or do not care at all. Scheduling is impossible here, you never get any of the classes that you want until you are a junior. The workload is a joke unless you are an engineer because the school is very easy to get into. People usually don't study much and when they do it is always in the library."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only a few different african americans and most people are white. Very few homosexuals, most people dont discuss religion and politically its about average. Theres a little bit of every part of the political spectrum."
College Junior,1,"Parking is great for commuters. They are able to park conveniently on main campus and west. As for resident students you mind as well forget main campus parking all together! As much as everyone pays, they should really allow a lot more resident student parking on main. And if you park ""out of place"" in the wrong spot. You will get a ticket. Even if it's your 1st time. More combined parking needed on main for residents throughout the day not just after 5pm. "
College Sophomore,1,"Safety Issue. Permits cost 90 for the year, which is pricy but reasonable.  The parking lot however was on the opposite side of campus from my dorm through a bad part of town.  Don't bother trying to get away with parking anywhere you're not supposed to, you will get a ticket, without a doubt."
College Student,1,"Ewww......Proceeds to Vomit! The food is HORRIBLE especially at the Johnson Dining Hall. They had better food at my high school cafeteria. the salad is never fresh always soggy, they make disgusting food, the eggs for breakfast aren't real eggs ewwww, and its really greasy. They never have any fruits either accept for bananas. West  campus dining is really good though, good food well made just overll way better than Johnson's."
College Freshman,1,"Terrible Experience – The only thing I have noticed about this school is that most students transfer after there first year, some after the first semester.  The teachers are not good and most work two jobs.  Classes are cancelled constantly, teachers make money on writing their own books needed for classes.  No social scene.  I'm not a party girl, but I would like to go out but I'm too afraid of getting another violation.  The RAs creep on your facebook, twitter or any other online pages and send incriminating things to Resident Life.  It's a very weird place.  I have friends who are having a great time at their school and I am counting the days until I get out of here.  Only two people on my floor are coming back next year.  I hope this helps someone make a decision NOT to come here."
College Freshman,1,"Too Strict – This school is sooo strict.  You can't do anything here and even if you go to a party and don't drink they still give you a citation for being in the presence of alcohol.  There are no activities here, no transportation to go anywhere and the surrounding town is full of homeless and criminals.  Can't wait to transfer"
College Freshman,1,Big Alcohol and Drug Issues – There is nothing to do at this school. There are parties but the police break them up or camp outside of the houses and wait to prey upon the people as they come out.  This school thrives on their students to make money.  They should be keeping the criminals off campus so we don't have lock downs so often.
College Freshman,1,Don't come to york they are doing away with all partying. This use to be a great all around school now its just boring. Really dont come here. The school is ending the fun
College Student,1,Fast Food – There really isn't anything around except mcdonalds and pizza hut. you have to travel all the way over to the mall to hit chickfila which isn't that bad.
College Junior,1,"Registration Horror – York College at least bases their registration on credits, but the scheduling process is random. Classes that are not core curriculum are hard to register for, most classes that students need to graduate are sometimes, most often conflict with other classes or offered only one semester a year. The workload is extremely horrible, piled and piled on top of each other with no possible way to finish without skimming or skipping class. For my major, most classes offered are not flexible with a career choice in mind."
College Student,1,"Not Very Diverse – about 80% of the student body is all white, I have only seen 1 Indian person and he lives in my building, barely any hispanics and a few black people. Oveall not very diverse. The school and student bdy are very accepting of people from all backgrounds and race, also sexual orientation. Political beliefs are not forced apon you, nothing is. At York you are free to choose and be anything/person you wish to be,"
College Freshman,1,"Parkign is difficult and again campus safety is too strict and will give anyone parking tickets, they look for cars without stickers and are annoying.  There needs to be more parking."
College Junior,1,"Greeks Are Not Important – There are only a few fraternities and sororities at York College and they are not very popular. They are where most of the parties are though, which are sometimes fun. But Greek Life is not big."
College Freshman,1,"York is not a very big sports school.  We do have rugby teams, soccer teams, lacrosse, baseball, softball, etc., but not a football team."
College Junior,1,"Dont Expect Day Off With Snow – No matter what way you take to York College you either have to go on turny back roads, or a 65 mph highway. It snows a lot during winter and classes are usually never cancell which is bizarre. Teachers usually relaize it's rediculous to drive in certain conditions and they'll take it into their own initiative of cancelling calss. But not all do. i dont think they consider commuters."
College Junior,1,never hear about volunteering or fundraisers....only parties.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Shady Men – The houses off campus are not great but theyre good enough, its the landlords you have to watch out for. I have been moved out of my house for 4 months and am still waiting for my security check to be returned. Another landlord stuck a friend of mine with so many misc. charges that she didn't get any of hers back at all. My car as well as several friends' cars were broken in to repeatedly. The school does not encourage off campus living and actively tried to convince you not to live there."
College Junior,1,"Unless It's Sunny You're Screwed. It is genuinely cold from October through April but the heat doesn't get turned on until after Thanksgiving. Really rainy in the fall, to the point that our commuter parking lot floods with several feet of water at least 5 times a year.
The past 3 winters we (like most of the North East) have had insane amounts of snow. However campus RARELY cancel classes for weather even when all roads leading to the college have not been plowed, sidewalks and outdoor stairs have not been shoveled, and a walking bridge that about 70% of students must use to get to classes is covered in ice. All in all it's a hazard to get to class during a storm no matter if you live on main, west, or north campus and downright impossible if you are a commuter."

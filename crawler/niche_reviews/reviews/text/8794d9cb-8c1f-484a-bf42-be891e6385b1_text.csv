Senior,5,This school isn't like most. Professors care about how well you're doing. It's a small campus so everyone knows each other and it makes your time at the school like home.
Senior,5,Professors are amazing here! They are involved in every individuals learning career trying to assist in anyway they can.
Freshman,5,I will be attending in the fall of 2020. The staff and instructors have been so helpful in helping get everthing set up for me. They have offered several Virtual tours. And virtal meetings with professors have been very helpful. They have in close contact. I am very glad I chose this school.
Freshman,5,"The Lyon college staff have been uniquely available, personal, and effective since I began communications with them months ago. The campus is beautiful, and I have yet to meet an unfriendly face."
Niche User,5,"Lyon college was a very nice college to visit. i would rate it as one of my top 5 colleges i have visited so far. The student life is excellent, it's like everyone knows everyone. The time as you walk on campus its pleasant greeting and smiles."
Freshman,5,"Love the people, activities available,  environment,  and beauty of the campus.  Only thing I would change is the food.  It would be nice to have more eating options on campus."
Freshman,5,I love it here.  So far my experience here has been amazing. The professors are very helpful and remind you every class that if you have any questions or worries go to their office hours. The students are all so kind everyone here is so friendly.
Niche User,5,Lyon College has a very beautiful campus. The staff and other students were very friendly and very informal.
College Sophomore,5,"Lyon College has over a 90% acceptance rate to most graduate schools, so a student has a very high chance of getting a job."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are all really great and approachable. They care for their students and learn their names. The teachers care about there students success and talk to them if they are having trouble.
College Freshman,5,Lyon College is the best around!
College Freshman,5,Lyon College is the best around!
College Sophomore,5,Most people say and tend to believe that a B from Lyon is more respected than A from most other schools. Lyon's high acceptance rate into medical school is big part of why I came here.
College Freshman,5,It is just like any other college dorms.
College Sophomore,5,A bit expensive but I love living in the dorms. For the most part they are clean and everybody is friendly
College Sophomore,5,They try and give everyone a scholarship
College Sophomore,5,Everyone I've met both guys and girls are really nice. The school has a strong family vibe.
College Sophomore,5,Off campus dining is nice.  Most of the dining is local restaurants that are great!
College Sophomore,5,The academics are the best.  The professors are the best and they are completely preparing me for graduate school.
College Sophomore,5,The school provides as much help as possible to get the student into the school.
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe on campus.  Campus safety is always on campus and monitoring.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are amazing.  They offer extra help and will meet with you at any convenient time even outside of office hours.  They provide challenges but know the right balance for homework.
College Sophomore,5,All of the staff is extremely helpful.  The houses have an older style but are very large and well priced.
College Sophomore,5,"Being a Biology major, I have a huge workload. The Biology department is super helpful when discussing anything from a simple quiz to life plans. They also open many doors to internships and research opportunities that probably wouldn't be available if they weren't there."
College Sophomore,5,"The coursework is challenging from the very beginning. Though it is challenging, you get a lot more education for the cost."
College Freshman,5,No matter who you are the college will help you out with a scholarship of some type!
College Student,5,There's no peer pressure at all. If you wanna drink you can and if you don't nobody excludes you. And hey if you smoke most people are cool with it.
College Sophomore,5,"We have, in my opinion, one of the best teams of campus safety. They are friendly and enforce school policies such as underage drinking and drug use. They patrol the campus hourly and they make me feel safe on campus."
College Sophomore,5,One of Lyon College's top priorities is student safety. We have campus safety patrolling the campus at all hours and I feel safe at all times of the day and night.
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek life at Lyon College contributes a lot to the atmosphere and feel of the campus. When I first arrived, I was greeted by all the fraternities and they were all friendly and made this far off place feel like home. If it weren't for the Greek life, I might not of gotten rid of my shyness and made friends at this college. They have really become a big part of my college life in the short time that I have been attending Lyon College."
College Sophomore,5,"No one is kicked out of social life due to their beliefs or ideas, although some people feel uncomfortable around certain groups with their differences. Many students are highly political. There are both major political party clubs with no other political clubs on campus. Religion comes down to a personal choice with a chapel service provided on Thursday. The religious affiliation of the school does not create a requirement for any student to be religious in any form."
College Sophomore,5,"There are times when the school seems to be the most stressful time ever. However, the people that also attend or work at Lyon College are some of the nicest and greatest people."
College Sophomore,5,"The people are great for the most part. With effort, anybody can find friends that they can talk to everyday. Lots of student groups are on campus with different goals and interests. Some people remain in a clique type of social life but not anything unnatural or unexpected. No one's going to shun you for hanging out with someone random for a change."
College Sophomore,5,The professors really care about the students. They all seem to enjoy their work and their field. They are willing to find opportunities for internships around the area. The courses are challenging although you can tell that they don't skimp on quality. 
College Sophomore,5,Excellent school and programs offered. Professors are top in their fields
College Freshman,5,"The buildings are great! Most of them are newer, and there are plenty of places to get together with friends to study, or just to study alone."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are some of the most trained in the country. Many of them are specialised in more than one field. My chemistry teacher was a very sharp BioChemisty. 
For those interested in foreign language, I can only speak for the Japanese program. Peek-sensei is one of the best language instructors I have ever had. She gives you the full ""Japanese experience"" with lessons on language and culture. The Nichols Program allows you to travel to Japan aswell. 
I have never been tested in my academic ability, until I went to Lyon. Many graduates continue to Ivy League.
You will be pushed to your limit here, but you will grow and you can do it. The professors are there for you, and the information is around every corner."
College Freshman,5,"There are people from all different walks of life at Lyon. While there are many Christians, I have never felt pressured as a pagan. I recently did a paper about Pagan struggles in America, and received possitive support from the community.
I am personally friends with a Buddhist, Atheists, agnostics, and Christians. There is also plenty of opprotunity to make friends with citizens of other nations. While I grew up with other immigrants, others are not as familiar with non-Americans. The international members of the Lyon community are more than open with helping you understand their culture. 
It is truly a learning experience of its own."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm extremely happy with it. I'm worried about finding a job when I graduate, but I think everyone is."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty at Lyon is superb. They work with you closely and help you succeed in your individual field.
Sophomore,4,"Lyon College has great views, academics are pretty decent, the student life is good and has pretty good outdoor activities around campus. the community around the campus is very diverse and very helpful."
Alum,4,Lyon is a great college if you’re looking for a small university. There are great professors who will take time out of their busy schedule to listen to you. It is easy to find ways to be involved. I had a great experience all around.
Niche User,4,I like how they respond fast and they give you all of your info straight up. The coaching staff was amazingly nice. I emailed the head coach and he emailed me a minute later.
Senior,4,The professors are really nice and truly care about their students. They are willing to answer any questions and meet with students outside of classes. The general staff is also really friendly and ready to help.
Sophomore,4,I think that Lyon is a really good school. By far the best parts about it are the professors and community. There is always something to do and the professors work REALLY well with everyone.
Freshman,4,The teachers help students one on one whenever they have a question they don't know and give great feedback to eliminate any doubts.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small campus, the student to teacher ratio is also a plus. There is a lot to do on campus, you just have to go out and do them. I didn't my freshman yea, but am getting more involved, also I am going to more school sports events (when I am not wrestling myself)"
Niche User,4,"Lyon college is a very good college. The professors really try and get to know the students, working one on one with them to help improve the areas they are weak in. The campus is also very beautiful. The chapel, library and other buildings give the campus an older, castle like feel. The older dorms are the only thing I would fault them on. The air conditioning does not work sometimes and there are ant infestations."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on campus, I have stayed the night where it was only me and a handful of other people on campus and felt fine. Campus safety is available at any time when they are needed, which is a good comfort."
College Sophomore,4,You will be close to classes no matter where you live on campus. There are always dorm meetings that help build better relationships among the dorm residents.
College Sophomore,4,"The Greek life is very friendly and open. Each of the three fraternities and three sororities has either one or two apartments on campus, and you are welcome at any time. The have parties where the entire campus is invited. There is always a fundraiser going on for different charities, sponsored by the Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience at  Lyon College has been great. All of the teachers care about their students and try to insure their success. The community of my school is close as well, people know each other. It's different from most schools because it is small, and the professors know your name. I would choose Lyon again in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,4,There are a few groups on campus that actively participate in drug use but there's no pressure to do drugs as well. Anyone can have a good time without the use of alcohol at parties and events as well.
College Sophomore,4,The only problem that has happened on campus would be small thefts that were quickly stopped. I feel extremely on the campus at all times of the day or night.
College Sophomore,4,It's fairly easy to choose the dorms you want to live in and have a couple different options as to the style of the dorm. Overall the dorms are clean and the people in them are friendly.
College Sophomore,4,I'm a non-Greek student and am openly invited to many events held by the different sororities and fraternities. Whether or not a student decides to become a Greek will not have much overall effect on their general school life.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone at Lyon is really open-minded and accepting of many different races/ethnicities/religions/etc.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't experienced trying to find an internship or job yet, by I have heard that a degree from here usually is excepted. I know nothing of the sewer services and employer recruitments, but Lyon does a good job of informing students when these opportunities come along."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a small crew of campus safety, but about the worst thing that ever happens is people parking in the wrong spot."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part the professors are amazing and very understanding. If you choose a major you don't really have any choice in what classes you take, and the fun one fredit classes are always full."
College Sophomore,4,"The newly added dorms are great and other on campus housing isn't too bad, but college owned off-campus housing is pretty sorry. The house I was in for a short time was at least a hundred years old and there were six of us sharing one bathroom. 

Dealing with maintainance is an absolute nightmare. We were without A/C for the first two months in the fall (and in Arkansas this is especially miserable)."
College Sophomore,4,"I very seriously considered joining, money and time were the only reasons I didn't."
College Sophomore,4,"Lyon's reputation for extremely prestigious academics and amazing professors are the main reasons I chose this college. The courses are more than challenging (post-grad work sophomore year), but almost every professor is more than willing to help (even outside of normal office hours sometimes). Aside from its academics, Lyon has the usual college problems: bad interenet, lack of parking, unappetizing food, etc. 

Recruiters say that class sizes are usually 15-20, THIS IS A LIE!!! Most of the classes are around 40-80. This being said, the school is still quite small. I rarely see an unfamiliar face."
College Freshman,4,We had a color run.
College Junior,4,"I love how small my school is. The professors and students are friends and it creates a fantastic learning environment. My classes are harder than most bigger schools, which challenges me and prepares me for after I graduate. Of course, there are those who hate the school. We have students transfer to other schools. But, you'll find those kids at anywhere. I would choose this school again in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,4,"Lyon College definitely isn't for everyone, but for those that want to go to a smaller school where the teachers know your name and are passionate about what hey teach, I'd strongly consider Lyon."
College Freshman,4,"We operate on the Honor and Social Codes. This means that we trust that you will hold yourself to do the right thing. When someone violates these codes, they are dealt with, confidentially, by the student run Honor and Social Counsels. Problems such as plagiarism and cheating would go to Honor Council and issues like fighting and public indecency would go to Social Council. Overall, Lyon isn't very strict, but we expect you to hold yourself to certain standards. Be your own enforcer."
College Freshman,4,"Publicly the policy is great. Enforcement is not always consistent, but major issues do get dealt with. There are both Social and Honor Councils but their activities are not public knowledge."
College Freshman,4,"It was easy, but I got an Honor's Day scholarship. Major Caveat - 30% of your campus scholarship is contingent on you living in campus housing or at home if you are under 21. If you are not local to Lyon, accept it and learn to deal with dorm life."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of parties both on the Row and the Temp. Where you go depends on what you are interested in, but there is usually something going on somewhere most evenings and weekends."
College Freshman,4,"You have lots of options to choose from, anywhere from taco bell, Wendy's, Dairy Queen or even Mexican restaurants or a nice sit down restaurant."
College Freshman,4,"I love that they have rules and follow them for the most part, it makes me feel safe and secure."
College Freshman,4,I got approximately a third paid for by the school and another third paid by the FAFSA.
College Freshman,4,The food isn't wonderful. The campus's small size is wonderful. Beautiful campus. Nice home like feel here and great staff as well.
College Freshman,4,"The schools Honor and Social council are very good at keeping students who deviate, and perform unacceptably from continuing to break rules, by looking into reasons why the student would be doing what he or she is doing and by helping the student fix what is going on, or by punishing the student if they are found to be guilty."
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of facility's for the schools athletes.
College Sophomore,4,The policies are strict but followed and used fairly with every student.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not much of a partier, but the parties are fun and many people go."
College Sophomore,4,"It may seem strict with the Honor Code and the Honor and Social Councils, but in all honesty, if you do what you're supposed to and use common sense, you'll be fine."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, Greeks and Non-Greeks are amicable towards each other. The sororities are always very cooperative with one another. The fraternities as well can get along decently. The Greek societies are all pretty involved on campus. They participate in various events at sporting events such as Blue Out and tailgating. They have various campus-wide events that is available for everyone to attend."
College Freshman,4,There have been a few instances where creepers were in campus and campus safety took action and banished the person from the premises. The nurse is really caring too.
College Freshman,4,"Even though it is a pretty small town with roughly 10,000 people, there are plenty of things to do around town. You can eat out, go to the movies, go bowling, or even take a boat out into the river."
College Freshman,4,"It is basically a wet campus in a dry county. Due to the high level of academics that we have to deal with, people turn up here. It does not matter if the nearest liquor store is about 30-45 minutes away, we WILL have fun!"
College Freshman,4,"Just attending the school, you will get a discount from the fast food chains around town, and it is really close. You probably could even walk to them. Also, there is a great variety from Popeye's to Hardee's to Taco Bell."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very willing to help students.
College Freshman,4,"There are labs in two out of the three buildings and printers in the dorms. WiFi is offered in every building, sometimes there are technical difficulties. You could survive with out a lap top but it's much easier with one of your own."
College Freshman,4,For how small the school is they offer a lot of different classes and many majors and minors.
College Freshman,4,There a lot of the fast food chains and some unique restaraunts
College Freshman,4,There is little or no campus crime and the campus security is easy to get a hold of if need be.
College Junior,4,"Everyone gets financial aid. I've had problems with the financial aid being combined with state scholarships. Since a high GPA is so hard to obtain, but is required for my outside scholarship, I lost my outside scholarship freshmen year and am unable to reobtain it. Now I have to pay a lot of money out of my own pocket. If I hadn't received that scholarship freshmen year, then Lyon would have given me a bigger scholarship from the beginning and I would be paying less now. I wish Lyon had given me a bigger scholarship."
College Junior,4,"There are many places to eat off-campus… like Taco Bell, Mcdonald's, Burger King, etc. There aren't very many restaurants of quality or chain restaurants. There isn't a chili's, dixie cafe, nor Red Lobster. I wish there were more chain restaurants to compete with the chain fast-food places."
College Freshman,4,"You can get away with pretty much anything, and I mean anything!"
College Freshman,4,There have been a few cases where non-students have caused trouble on campus but campus safety and the administration intervened quickly to fix it and keep everyone safe.
College Student,4,I'm not the frat type but they're all cool guys and will hang with you even if you don't rush.
College Sophomore,4,There is a very diverse population of political beliefs on campus. One can often overhear a political debate walking around campus at any hour of the day.
College Sophomore,4,Peer pressure is a problem in certain groups on campus. Plenty of students smoke weed and claim its their every ambition in life at the moment. Alcohol is pretty common and can be clearly seen on the weekends. Policy on alcohol mainly comes down to a question of the person's immediate safety. Policies on other drugs are much stricter.
College Sophomore,4,The weather is normally very mild with a couple of days of rain. Winter causes occasional freezes and snows that cancel classes for a few days. The fall looks great with the warmer months making campus a great place to be.
College Sophomore,4,There's plenty of computers on campus available for use by any student. The network is hit or miss and can be very slow although this might be from the amount of people all trying to stream HD movies. The printers are easy to use on a school computer although personal computers have to go through a process each time to print directly to a printer on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Some of the teams do really well while others don't. Most people skip over sporting events unless they are on another sports team or really like the sport or a special event is occurring during the sporting event.
College Sophomore,4,"Honor's Day provides most students with the largest portion of financial aid and is a must for someone interested attending Lyon College due to the high cost. I had no problems with this part of my financial aid. However, despite being overqualified for work study, I again for the second year have received no placement even with my status as a sophomore. This has caused problems as I have no car to find a job off campus while still really needing the help from a job. Especially one that doesn't require more than five hours a week like the work study jobs."
College Sophomore,2,"Lyon College focus more on education than athletics. The athletic facilities are good, but aren't used often by non- athletes. The teams do not do very well, so the school spirit is not high."
College Freshman,2,I have gotten my valuables stolen and never got them back. Need more cameras
College Sophomore,2,I attended when Lyon added a football team and it seems to be dragging the college down. They even lowered they're acceptable ACT score just to get players!
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of choices and you must be 21+ to live off campus if you have a scholarship.
College Freshman,2,I am a vegetarian and very picky on my food choices. So it is difficult to find a place to eat for me.
College Freshman,2,"I do not enjoy the attendance policy that much, and some professors are not the best. Other than that it's okay."
College Freshman,2,School spirit here is lacking. There isn't a lot of talk about when the sporting events take place. Athletics are not discussed frequently.
College Junior,2,Almost no one attends the sporting events unless they are on another sports team at Lyon. Few people attend intramurals other than the Greeks who are required to attend in order to win the President's cup. The majority of intramurals participants are Greeks or other athletes. I wish more people attended the varsity sports events.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of options and the food is expensive.  It really sucks for those who have a budget.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't any public transport in Batesville, but the town is small enough it's not an issue. The school also has bikes to rent!"
College Junior,2,"Very Strict – The campus is not very strict about drinking and parties. They are very strict about students' academics. Students are required to sign an honor code. Also, the adminstration has taken away students' scholarships for inappropiate behavior. Sometimes they can be strict to the point of over-reacting."
College Sophomore,2,I do not live in housing I own my own house. I am a non tradational student.
Freshman,1,"If you’re not an athlete, expect to be treated like crap.  RAs pick and chose when they want to punish someone for the same thing, so be ready if you are not one of the “desirables”.  Some professors are really nice and help out; others will let you know how terrible of a person you are.  Many rude students who will talk about you behind your back if you are not one of the “desireables”, and don’t expect the college to do anything about it.  SGA does nothing.  Dorms are great in Whiteside.  Come to this college if you enjoy being treated like crap from your fellow students (unless you’re a student athlete)"
College Freshman,1,I don't enjoy the area
College Senior,1,Very diverse but people keep to their corners and have difficulty bridging differences.
College Senior,1,Too much drinking.  Lots of Dealers
College Senior,1,Everyone knows to avoid health services unless it's really an emergency
College Senior,1,"Very bad housing -  far from campus, or near a noisy campus bar, or a tiny room in a Co-op with a 5ft ceiling"
College Senior,1,"A lot of alcohol, tons and tons"
College Senior,1,"Uninterested or positively dismissive teachers and TAs.  Health Services was known by word of mouth as a ""last resort"" since they were so bad.  Services non-existant.  Safety issues.  Bad food.  Student needs and safety are not taken seriously.  Very classist.  Dingy housing.  Racial and economic disparity in what kind of experience students have.  Not a positive environment."
College Senior,1,Go for another comparable school if you can afford it.
College Freshman,1,"The cafeteria is the worst place possible. Dishes are unclean, food is disgusting, undercooked, and also they sometimes drop things and put them back in the food pile. Not many choices either. It makes me sick to eat there."
College Junior,1,The food in the cafeteria is horrible. There aren't many options and the food is of low quality. I get the lowest meal plan with the most flex dollars because I'm required to have a meal plan since I live on campus. I went to the cafeteria three times last semester. I spent most of my money on eating at drive-thrus because it's faster and the food is better. I wish I didn't have to have a meal plan even though I live on campus. It's a waste of money for me.
College Freshman,1,need more dorms and existing dorms need to be renovated

Junior,5,"With small class sizes and with teachers that care about their students to understand the material, Marymount has a great learning environment. Marymount is also great because they want you to get involved within the community."
Senior,5,"I transferred mid year spring semester. It was scary to transfer to a school my junior year second semester because I was scared I was not going to fit in. However, the staff and coaches made everything such an easy transition. The staff all knew my name by heart within 2 weeks! Classes are easy to find and professors are easy to talk to and communicate with. They have a mental health center which has been so useful at times. I am so glad I transferred and have a year left with an amazing campus and such an amazing view. There are plenty of study spots and even more resources for student athletes. One of my favorite things about MCU is that they have textbooks you can borrow for a few hours in the library if you don't have yours yet. I have used this resource many times. the only thing I would change or add to MCU is more athletic facilities and soccer fields. Other than that, the school is amazing."
Senior,5,I struggle with mental health disabilities as well as financial disadvantages which made going to in person classes challenging all the time. Having hybrid and full online classes made learning easier and more manageable. I was able to contact my professors for help or even have zoom meetings with them. Learning was made possible through powerpoint and textbook work. I found learning at my pace was more manageable and allowed me to focus on what I was learning.
Sophomore,5,I love it and can't wait to graduate from there! This is a nice small but well rounded school. The views are amazing!
Niche User,5,There's a nice small campus wonderful view. The staff and students there makes  everyone feeling like family.The classes are small and doesn't seem too stressful.
Alum,5,"It's a beautiful school, the view is amazing here and the class sizes are very small. Some people have pride for the school, and some don't. The two campus location can be a little annoying at times because you have to drive at least 15 min to get there, but honestly, coming from a big school, this is much better then walking 20 min to get to class from one end to the other. There are great professors that really care and explain every detail if you put effort on asking question. Although, some don't and wonder why they didn't pass the class. It does have a high school vibe because the school history and regulations that do not allow further renovation and expansion in the area. If you like to party, this isn't the place for you. If you genuinely care about your education, I would recommend Marymount California University. Finally, the athletic program is awesome, most of the programs are very competitive and an overall great experience."
Junior,5,"Marymount California University has gone above and beyond to make me feel welcomed, supported and successful in my journey. Staff are kind, helpful and encouraging with each of their students. I believe it is a great quality to have, they stand out in being humane."
Niche User,5,Very Beautiful And Has My Major. Professors are very great and helpful. Their food is alright and housin cleanin is awesome i like unversity.
Niche User,5,Marymount California University has an outstanding campus. The ocean view scene is beyond beautiful. Marymount has a lot to offer each student there. It seems that the can provide a lot of helpful needs into each student's life. Also the housing is great!
Junior,5,"Marymount University was exceptionally different from the other Universities that I applied to. They were the only school to take additional one on one help with me and any concerns I may have had. I love the fact that they are a smaller school which will give me the attention that I need in the classroom to succeed. The campus is beautiful, right on the water and everything is extremely clean. The staff is all very kind and wants to do their best to help us as students achieve our ultimate goals. Although they aren't as known as some of the schools I have applied to, I believe in quality over quantity and this school certainly equals that. I look forward at potentially becoming a student at Marymount California University."
Freshman,5,I like Marymount California University because it helps students get through their work. Marymount is not like other schools that they don't care about the students they just care about getting paid. My teachers have always helped me getting my work done. Also helping me on stuff that I don't understand. Something that I would like to see change would be the school more organized because the school has lost some of my documents and I have to get them again and again.
Freshman,5,I Love The Enviornment and The People There And All That The College Has To Offer The Only Thing That I Would Change Is All Of The Work That The Professors Give Out Lol
Alum,5,"My time at MCU really feels like a sort of Instagram montage- just a reel of amazing people and memories- but I think the opportunity to study abroad was a standout for me. Spending a semester in England as a Sophomore and in South Africa as a Senior really changed my life. I was able to deepen friendships with other mariners, explore cultures different from my own, apply classroom concepts in an entirely new context AND discover parts of myself I might not have known had I stayed in the States."
Junior,5,Marymount is a great school. Professors and academic advisors are always available. The students there are nice and welcoming. There are several clubs one can join as well.
College Junior,5,"The online courses at MCU are designed to help students who are either working full time, or cannot always make it to campus due to personal obligations. It is very easy to access our student portal from virtually anywhere, we can complete our work before the due date if we wish, and we get immediate feedback with grades and comments from our professors. I think adding online classes was a great addition to campus because we have an option of either being in a physical classroom or at home. Online courses also require a lot of discipline."
College Junior,5,"As a business major at Marymount California University, we have to take more ethics and accounting class than the average students. Although it seems like a heavy course load, the professor teaches us in a way that we can apply to our day to day lives as well as apply to an exam in class. This program is rigorous, but completely prepares us for what's to come if we decide to go on to a graduate program. After receiving an undergraduate degree, there are numerous job opportunities in many industries as a business major because being a business major allows you the luxury of choosing two concentrations. This diversifies your undergraduate degree and gives you an opportunity to work in multiple areas."
College Junior,5,"After reviewing the university and deciding to apply, once the admission advisors realized my ambition and desire to complete my undergraduate education, they reached out to me several times during the admission process to get letters of recommendation, letters from myself explaining my personal background, and decided to admit me and even add in the university based grant to help pay for my tuition. I have never been accommodated in such a way it made me excited to walk onto a campus and know I will receive the help I need without being turned away and unable to pursue my education. Marymount California University believes is getting to know their students personally to identify and assist with any and every need possible to make sure we all succeed."
College Freshman,5,A lot of the teachers that teach are adjunct professors who teach at other colleges such as USC and others as another job giving us the benefit of a higher level education. Also three out of the seven classes I have at Marymount have had successful businesses or have worked at a successful company under a high position. Also they have many connections offering internships and ways to get your foot in the door.
College Sophomore,5,we have lots of clubs
College Sophomore,5,I met the love of my life and he is amazing and I wouldn't choose another school
College Sophomore,5,It is amazing. Its a great place to chill.
College Sophomore,5,I had 3 online courses. It was amazing. Its great because you could manage your time well.
College Sophomore,5,"The unique thing about my school is that because its so small, everyone knows everyone. People are really nice. We have a great view of the ocean and Catalina Islands. Campus life is amazing and housing is awesome."
College Student,5,"What makes Marymount unique from the rest of the schools is its student size. Although there are only 1,045 students on our campus, its comforting to know that a student to teacher ratio is about 17:1. At Marymount, it is continuously said that students are not just a number and it is completely true, because due to the small class sizes students are able to meeting with their professors at a one on one level, as a bigger school where it would be much more difficult to meet with the professor. What's very neat about the Residences Halls is that they are town homes that come with a kitchen, living room and a full bathroom and a one and a half bathroom. The staff and faculty at Marymount genuinely caring for the students and will go out of their way to show it."
College Freshman,5,The give a lot of help in the resource of financial aid
College Freshman,5,Good teachers that actually care about what you think
College Junior,5,"Its a beautiful campus. The student center is great. The library isn't huge, but it has everything you'll need. There's usually something interesting to do on campus."
College Junior,5,Its a smooth ride at Marymount. The professors are always willing to work with you if you're having troubles and their offices hours are good.
College Junior,5,My school is pretty small and hands-on. The people who work at career services really get to know who you are and work hard to find the most suitable path to further us students.
College Junior,5,small class sizes really allow the teachers to know you as an individual.
College Sophomore,5,There are several campuses and it's very easy to commute to all of them.
College Junior,5,I believe that the off broad programs are a great way for students to go to different countries and learn about different cultures and people. We get to explore new thing why we learn for a semester
College Freshman,5,"What is great about this school is the options of classes and their schedules. They offer so many courses at different times of the day it's wonderful. If I want my Fridays free and have to take courses to transfer to a Cal State, it is possible to do that at Marymount."
College Freshman,5,"The career center is fantastic. No matter the question you have, they can easily answer it right away. The alumnus still come to the school to take classes specifically for them. The career center can hook you up with a job and help you transfer to another school."
College Sophomore,5,"No Where Like Southern California – My school is beautiful. It is right off of the coast of Rancho 
Palos Verdes. Even though I may not be rich, my eyes sure are for getting to see those views. I like that the school is very small and is private. It allows for a bit more intimacy and feeling as if the faculty
actually cares for you. I'm happy with the school."
College Senior,5,"Worth It All – I feel like with the small, personal class sizes, the helpful and professional professors, and the guaranteed transfers, I got my money's worth."
College Junior,5,"The student body at Marymount is very diverse. There is a lot of students who are out-of-state and from a different country. All those students have different religions, views, etc. But we all most likely share the same interests in things. I love how the school is so diverse because we can learn about each others culture and views."
College Freshman,5,Unique Shuttle Program – The shuttle will drop off and pick up anyone along the scheduled route. B
College Freshman,5,"I love the facilities. The student Center is a great place to hang out or do homework, same as the library.I enjoy either doing homework in the library or just watching TV in the student center.Those facilities are my absolute favorite that are always available to me."
College Freshman,5,"Wireless Access – The wireless access that Marymount college has is amazing and you will be very happy with it too. The whole school has wireless access, plus when you go to the off campus housing, that has wireless access too. You cant get any better than that!"
Junior,4,"Teachers make learning online very easy, with communicating through emails as well as office hours. Teachers help you and advise other on campus services to all students. Not too many courses are offered online, (one con of a small school), but the material covered with online classes are just the same as an in-class course."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Marymount. I was not only involved with the school, but I was also an athlete. Being an athlete was great at this school. I was able to manage my work, school and athletics because my teachers were amazing. I miss this school everyday and I wish I was back there."
Junior,4,"It is probably the most beautiful campus in the entire country, so peaceful and serene overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Every professor I have had has been extremely attentive and devoted to each student's progress. The university has a focus on the success of graduating students, they are constantly working with students on how to become employed following graduation. Very skills based with a focus on practical skills and real-world acumen/experience."
Senior,4,I love Marymount. I think it's a great institution if you prefer a smaller school setting. The professors at the school are also really good when it comes to developing personal relationships. All professors I've had these past three years know me on a first name basis and genuinely care for my performance in the classroom.
Freshman,4,Marymount California University is a small school and great faculty. The professors are willing to help you when asked. The small class sizes are great for learning and it’s clear to see that the Professors want you to succeed.
College Junior,4,I have a lot of fun doing what I do and with the right professors it makes it all the more worth spending time there
College Freshman,4,"There are few majors at marymount, but the academic advisors are helpful. They let you know what classes you need to take, and they always let you know when there are internships available."
College Freshman,4,"Marymount is great if you want a small campus. Everyone knows eachother, and the professors are very helpful."
College Junior,4,Graduate students are often offered job opportunities on campus to give them opportunities and the opportunity to work while pursuing their degree. They are also given a list of local internships and career opportunities by the career and academic counselors.
College Junior,4,"Marymount California University is very close knit to Loyola Marymount University and students that transfer or go to graduate school at LMU had a great chance of getting in because of attending MCU. The career prospects are great from what I;ve heard, but I am not completely sure yet because I have not yet received my degree. The campus offers career fares to assist students with deciding what they would like to do after they receive their Bachelor's Degree."
College Junior,4,"The professors on campus are pretty straight forward with their academic and attendance policies and we are also given a syllabus at the beginning of the semester that outlines what our course load will be for the next 16 weeks. The class sizes are ideal because the classroom is not a large lecture hall and the professors have a chance to get to know their students by name and face. We have an abundance of classes on campus, but I wish we could add an African American Studies minor or course load to give the campus more of an insight on African American History."
College Freshman,4,"The ability to get a masters at the same institution is the best thing in the way tat you make more long term connection with your professors as well as getting the full support of the school. The teachers will readily help in the job search as well as pulling strings, we recently had a student get a job at space x"
College Freshman,4,Being at a school that is a liberal arts school isn't that great in the variety sense however they do try to update course offering frequently as  they have added a coding and other programming as well as the addition of a new campus specifically for arts and media. The courses are very thorough in the lessons they teach and most of the time make it a good environment.
College Freshman,4,The university has an area dedicated to getting people an internship as well as a job listing of people looking to hire students as well as a staff member heading the section. There are several people who are hired and have attended Marymount.
College Freshman,4,I have had a great first semester here. I am on the golf team and found that the teachers really accommodate to the needs of the student as well as help them when falling behind or to improve. In having such a small school everyone knows everyone and it is a great thing to know that you can trust the students to be open and inviting to new students and staff.
College Sophomore,4,No A/C in housing and it gets really hot.
College Sophomore,4,"I only don't like how the houses don't have A/C, so it does get hot but other than that I love the location and weather."
College Sophomore,4,Accessibility to administration is definitely one of the highlights of this school. Any issues were resolved nearly immediately in the two years that I went here.
College Sophomore,4,I love the view from the classrooms. It's definitely what got me through stressful days.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed the personal feel that was created through small class sizes. It was easy to build a close relationship with faculty because everyone seemed to be available and they were not overcrowded with students they don't even recognize.
College Sophomore,4,People will help me with that
College Senior,4,There are some AMAZING professors but others suck.
College Senior,4,"Stress free, not demanding, but interesting."
College Student,4,Campus resources at Marymount are easy to access.
College Student,4,Students are provided with internet and print money.
College Student,4,"The online classes are designed by the professors themselves in order to best help the students taking the online courses. How online classes differ from the traditional classroom experience is that the student is allowed to work on most assignments at their own pace, unlike the traditional classroom setting in which students would be forced to follow a certain deadline."
College Student,4,"My experience as a student and student worker has been very neat. Being a full time student taking 17 units while working two on campus jobs has not only pushed me to give the best of myself, but it has encouraged me to organize myself and prioritize the things that need to be done. My first semester I was given time management workshops where I was able to learn how to better manage my time. It has been an amazing experience."
College Freshman,4,Marymount has a beautiful campus with nice facilities.
College Freshman,4,The best views living at this school
College Freshman,4,Good service if you stay at the school
College Sophomore,4,Some professors seemed very interested in what they were teaching and showed enthusiasm to be in that class with us. They were engaged and showed interest on how our day was and especially tried making finals much more bearable for all of us. Everything the professors taught us was useful and they made our exams much more easy and fun.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, faculty and staff have been very accepting, understanding, and flexible. It has been a smooth experience to figure out what classes I need to transfer."
College Sophomore,4,"As a transfer student, learning the fundamentals of math and science in a small class size is going to be very beneficial to me in my future academia. I am able to approach my professors with questions about the lectures and they can give me an immediate response without the means of email."
College Sophomore,4,"Since there is a small student population at Marymount College, it is easy to approach faculty and staff with questions and concerns. I am transferring from Marymount College to a prestigious University with an engineering program. I feel prepared transitioning from Marymount College to any University I select."
College Freshman,4,the school is great and teachers are wonderful we just need more extra curricular activities
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very helpful. they email us to make sure we have sent our essays to them or when our assignments would be due. Some of the professors even gave us a chance to get our work done a day after it was due. Registration for new classes is easy because they have workshops to help the students and it has made it much easier for me to choose my spring classes. I though it was very helpful. The school also created something called"" eportfolio's "" that will save our work's and will come in handy in the near future. Something I would preferred is if they had let freshmen students choose their classes at the same time seniors, juniors or sophomores were choosing their classes."
College Freshman,4,We actually have our mymarymount emails and it is very useful because we can ask teachers about anything that we may need or any concerns we have. Another thing is that a lot of our homework can be done through the website. Doing homework online has also been very helpful because we have many opportunities to re-do something that was done incorrect. Another thing is that carrying a computer is much less heavier than a whole stack of books.
College Freshman,4,Something very great about the school is that it's on top of a hill and you can see a beautiful view over at San Pedro's beach. The air is fresh and the people are kind even if they don't know you.
College Freshman,4,It's been great here at Marymount. The teachers help students first hand and are always asking students to come by their offices if they need any more help .
College Freshman,4,"The student center is great , people are able to play pool or watch tv every so often and one new game I had never played was ping-pong but here in Marymount I learned how to play it and it has been very fun to have these games for us during our free time. However, something that would be nice for them to add is a new gym!"
College Freshman,4,"Everything in campus works great, the school has wireless printing, therefore its easy print from any place in school. There is also many computers accessible to the students and I've never had to complain about it."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like the student body is great. Students help each other on the work and sometimes even push each other to not give up. Marymount is small, so people are able to interact as a family."
College Freshman,4,What I love about this college is how well students and professors are able to interact as well as everyone else that works or goes there  . The professors are extremely helpful and passionate in their teachings. I Love the way they are organized and how its so easy to schedule your classes and have a variety of options. The classes are small and very helpful. You feel like a big family there. If you ever need help in anything there is always someone there willing to help you. It is an amazing college with many doors opening. I feel happy and comfortable there.
College Sophomore,4,"The small class sizes really give me one on one time with the teacher. everyone is really nice and always willing to help. when i first started at marymount i was lost, i had no clue what i wanted my major to be. the councilors listened to my future goals and helped me find the best major that fit my unique interests."
College Junior,4,They surprisingly have a lot of class choices and are all usually at reasonable times.
College Freshman,4,"I am taking two classes related to my major considering I am a freshman. I am majoring in Film production and in one of my classes I am learning the basics of every art program on the MAC computers. The other class though is pointless altogether. It has no thought into the process of art. Although, the work is easy to do therefor giving me a good grade."
College Freshman,4,"This institution is so small that they do not offer many night classes however, the flexibility they have concerning classes is quite reassuring. The entire staff only wish that you succeed in your career so, they help you when creating your education plan and transferring credits."
College Freshman,4,I have received financial aid from my school because I was awarded a scholarship. I believe this institution strives to make your experience a great one and so they help you as much as possible. The office holds reasonable hours and are fairly easy to contact.
College Sophomore,4,It is a strong mix of a diverse crowd with a friendly vibe.
College Sophomore,4,As a freshmenm they make you take classes that are not for your desired degree.
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty Good – The school is very friendly and even though it is small, one can do many things on campus."
College Junior,4,Make Your Money's Worth – The education I am getting is worth the money that i am paying for my education. There is a little financial aid that i recieve every year that am attending. I have learned that not everything is done for you like when i was in high school they helped me fill out my finacial aid and in college you have to keep in mind when its deadline. School's tuition is a bit pricy at the school am attending but thats because its a private college with small amount of students per classroom. Other then that there is alot of one on one with professors so thats worth it.
College Freshman,4,"Small School Wonders – I never thought small schools would interest me. I was into going to big universities with over 20,000 students. At first I was very closed minded to the idea of going to Marymount and was only looking forward to transferring out. To my amazement, this school has offered so many oppurtunities for me that I would never have at a larger school. I get the luxury of having small classes with one on one time with my professors. I even get to see my professor everyday in his office hours and can recieve personal help from him, something I would not have been able to say if I were to go to a larger school. Marymount accomadates to your needs and I am so fortunate to have them helping me."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes Are Great – I love the teachers, classes and the people all around my campus. Fitting in was very easy and the teachers teach well."
College Junior,4,"Marymount College has a lot of resources for us students to use. The college provides computer labs, study rooms, and the computers at the library for students to get work done. They also have accessible printing in every building and the wireless connection is okay."
College Freshman,4,"Fun Out Going Students – Even though the students at marymount college may party and have, it is always after the hard work is done. After a day of hard work students take time out to relax."
College Freshman,4,Helpful Professors – Most of my teachers took the time out and gave me special attention I needed on certain assignments.
College Sophomore,4,"small classrooms, teachers know you by name, good advacing."
College Freshman,4,"I'm an English Major and I Am Proud – The English teachers I have encountered thus far have been just great. The dedicate time to our papers and it is the best feeling to know that your work is being revised in a just manner.

Other English majors that work in any department of the school are more than willing to give you tips and insight to their journey through college as an English major as well."
College Freshman,4,"Nice, Easy and Pleasing – All of Mary mount's features from bus transportation to school and academics, Mary mount delivers."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of diversity among the student body, but there isn't a lot of acceptance within the community. I, for example, don't drink, but it's become so much of a social thing that people judge me for it instead of just understanding. I don't make a big deal out of it, and have no problem with other people drinking so long as they know how to handle themselves accordingly. But the judgement based on my preferences regarding drinking/partying make the general student body here seem pretty ignorant and superficial."
College Freshman,2,"I've experienced nothing pertaining to my specific major yet. In order to experience the 'unique aspects' of my program, I have to be at least a Junior, but I hate the school so much that I'm going to transfer out of it long before then."
College Freshman,2,"Professors: Pretty bad. I've only had one good teacher so far; every other teacher I've had have been painfully ignorant, slow, and overall not very good.

Curriculum: Average/Below Average

Class Registration Process: Very easy, this was good.

Workload: Very easy, very little work to be done."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't taken an online course yet, but one of my roommates has. She told me that half of the online class had to withdraw because the teacher wasn't responding to any emails and the assignments were too vague. I've spoken to others about this issue, and they have said very similar things."
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid is not applicable to me as a student, but in terms of tuition? Although it's less than other colleges, I certainly don't think the value of the education being received is worth the cost of tuition. I'm currently in the process of transferring out of the school, it's so bad. My first semester, I had some of the worst teachers I've ever had before; that, and the coursework is far too easy."
College Senior,2,It costs so much... I hate it.
College Freshman,2,i have huge gaps thanks to the inflexibility of the schedules they offered.
College Freshman,2,"i think this school needs more spirit, no one cares about anything here."
College Freshman,2,"they have people to help you out, but they're never at school, you basically have to hunt them down."
College Freshman,2,"the food here is horrible, how are you supposed to concentrate when you have diarrhea"
College Freshman,2,"The internet is often very slow or does not work at all. Overall the school website is easy to use, however, teachers do not always follow it or update their page."
College Senior,2,"Marymount College, what can I say? Don't get me wrong I have a lot of fond memories here and have met a few wonderful people and really kind staff but overall I feel like Marymount is deeply flawed; here's why: 

1) It's a very small school and somewhat cliquey, if your friend group isn't established within the first week of orientation it can be exceedingly difficult to meet people. Another disadvantage to a small school is that there's a lot of gossip and more likely to get into the rumor mills (even if it's against your will). Plus it can get incestuous when it comes to hookups which I think is pretty gross. 

2) What people fail to mention is that a lot of people with severe emotional problems also go here. (I had a stalker my freshman year) plus a lot of people are just kind of strange but not necessarily in a good way. Which can make housing situations problematic (I've been roomed with a lot of emotionally unstable people). 

3) Administration sucks at handling conflicts with housing and practically encourages bullying! Not to mention the dorms are in a pretty unsavory part of town. 

4) The food is mostly terrible and has made a lot of people (myself included) sick. 

5) A lot of extremely immature people.

6) The BA program is fairly new and from what I've heard it's a mixed bag, I'm not doing it but they're still trying to smooth things out. 

7) It's easy to become a hermit here. 

The plus side: 

1) More one on one help with work, professors get to know you. 

2) Overall helpful and friendly faculty and staff. (especially the bus drivers and security). 

3) First Thursdays are great fun, especially for artsy people. :)

4) A good place for someone who thrives in small environments. 

5) A view that is to die for!"
College Senior,2,"Working on It – The students at Marymount vary from a wealthy student to get away from mom and dad to a poor student taking every opportunity they can get their hands on. I would say most students lack school spirit, but have ideas to make this place better. The problem is that making Marymount better usually will take time. Marymount is newly a four-year school and for the longest it has been known as a two-year so the students are very lost. Although there is a lack of school spirit amongst the students I would say that the average student is hard working and determined to make a change in their lives. Whether it's transferring to another school or staying for four-years at Marymount some students, again, want to make change in their lives."
College Junior,2,"Not So Nice Advisors – The advisors at the school are not so nice. When I asked about help with scholarships, they told me to google it and did not inform me that there was a scholarship book in the library. At this school, if you need help with scholarships, you are on your own."
College Senior,2,"I don't think they hire post-grad students to work at the school, I'm actually not too sure."
Niche User,1,"If this school had any good intentions for the future youth, they should close down. Thankfully, I have grown and transferred out to a real college. This isn’t a real college, its a joke. Students who attend here couldn’t get to their 1st choice, or safety schools or back up of their safety schools.  I made mistakes in high school so I attended here. I  strongly believe the rich parents whos kids were so dumb couldn’t get into any established universities, kept this place open so they can say their child attended a university. My high school teachers made jokes that we were better off at a cc than here and professors complain about working there. I can see why this school accepts everyone and has a low graduation rate. The people I met here are too stupid to function. They act like this is some elite school. For any future students, study hard, and apply elsewhere. A degree from here isn’t something to be proud of because you wasted your money and time. You could do better."
Junior,1,"Don't come here. Don't waste your money. This school sucks! They don't know how to handle problems, they're not open to change. Student life is weak, this is a commuter school so they don't care about having weekend events because most people go home. Teaching is meh. The food is trash mostly. Most of the students here are shady and fake. I want my money back!"
College Freshman,1,"Think of it like doing high school all over again, they sit there and baby you instead of trying to help you grow up"
College Freshman,1,"Youre better off going to a community college, half my grade is trasferring and im a freshmen, everyone hated this school that much"
College Freshman,1,A small handful of good professors.
College Freshman,1,"Unaware about post-grad services, but undergrad services were awful so I assume those are too."
College Freshman,1,Wouldn't value a degree from this school very highly.
College Freshman,1,This school is a giant expense and overall inconvenience.
College Freshman,1,"There is a small handful of good professors, but not enough to make this school worth staying."
College Freshman,1,"This school is so small that EVERYONE will know your business. There is nothing around this school, so if you don't have a car you will be in the house 24/7. The dining hall is not open on the weekends and neither is the library.  Something is seriously wrong there.  Both are located 15-20 minutes away driving from the main campus and are very inconvenient to get to from the residential campus.  Not to mention, the residential campus is located in the suburbs of Los Angeles county which is DESPERATELY undeserved by public transportation. 

If you're filthy rich, with enough money to pay for the outrageous tuition, a car, and food on the weekends, you MIGHT be able to enjoy you're time at Marymount, but I wouldn't count on it.  You'd be better off saving money, going to a community college, and transferring to another school after a year or two."
College Freshman,1,"no one likes to party, the weekends are dead here, most people just go home, or go to visit other amigos in santa barbara."
College Freshman,1,Theres nothing to do at this school.
College Sophomore,1,"Tuition Nightmare – When one is like myself, from a low income family, paying for school is hard enough. When tuition is up to 28,000 and the only financial aid for my ""low income/non taxable award"" is 17,000 there is a problem. I have had to take out two loans and still don't have enough money. My family and I are struggling just to pay the monthly payments. The education will be worth it if I could just get through these payments. The financial aid office is very nice and understanding but the government is not."

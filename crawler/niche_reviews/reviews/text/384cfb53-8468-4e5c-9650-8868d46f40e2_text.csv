Niche User,5,Easy classes and amazing professors. Would high recommend taking dual enrollment or regular classes here!
Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved my time at CCC. One of my favorite aspects about CCC is the level of importance that they put on getting students involved. There are always events going on and people are always hanging out and connecting. The feeling of welcomeness is tangible in the school. The faculty and staff mostly seem to enjoy their jobs and wish to help students as much as possible. Carroll provided me a quality education at a low cost and I will never regret my decision to attend.
Sophomore,5,Throughout my time at Carroll Community College so far I have had an excellent experience! The staff is awesome and the work environment is phenomenal.
Niche User,5,"Very positive atmosphere, growing moral for a small community college, a great place to earn basic transferable credits, and a growing STEM program."

Freshman,5,Carroll Comunity College is a great campus to start your college career. There are so many career pathways you can take because so much is offered! The staff is incredible and the classrooms are great too!
Freshman,5,"Carroll Community College has actually helped me since being in my freshman year of high school. They offered concurrent enrollment based on my GPA and the fact I had already accrued all necessary credit in high school. They talked to me about my future goals and plan, and discussed with me the importance of maintaining a 3.0 GPA or higher, especially since I am planning to become a Criminal Journalist and attaining a masters degree. Carroll Community College is also well equipped with personable staff who work with each individual student to ensure they attain nothing short of excellence."
Sophomore,5,The professors in the cybersecurity program really have the knowledge and enthusiasm to promote this field and make it as interesting as possible. I had a great time here.
Freshman,5,"Carroll Community College has given me a great introduction to the college workload and has prepared me to move on to a four year university. Because the classes are made up of 30 people or less, there is a lot of opportunity to interact with your teachers and get help with material if you need it."
Freshman,5,"I was really doubtful and discouraged when I first found out I had to attend Carroll, but every day I like it more and more. I am in the Hill Scholar program and it is one of the best choices I made. I save money by being a Hill Scholar and have lots of fun opportunities. The program has helped me create new friends quickly and made me feel a good sense of community. Through the program I get to go on fun trips like a trip to DC, a camping trip, and a retreat. I highly recommend applying for this program if you are thinking about going to Carroll."
Sophomore,5,"Most of the teachers here were amazing!  Specifically Kristen Hadden, she taught Statistics and she changed my life! I have made good friends and strong connections in my community. I would highly recommend all late high school students to attend this school, as I have saved so much money by attending community college instead of a four year university."
Sophomore,5,Its a great school to go to and easy to afford. Easy to make friends. Very easy to get help when needed like essays and math assignments and other classes. The teachers are nice when they want to be. The food is great but very expensive. Its a good college also because people that want to be very close to home and not live at a college and the people can go home after class and easily come back when their next class for the day comes up
Sophomore,5,"Awesome 2 year college. Inexpensive and high quality professors. Have yet to come across a professor I didn't like and I'm in my final semester. For those who have a tight budget, I highly recommend this college."
Senior,5,"I love Carroll !!!! Everyone is free to express themselves, no one questions you for bveing different. Everyone is there because they want to, the whole atmosphere at carroll is just so homey. Honestly if Carroll offered a four year degree/ masters I would stay there forever. Prices are sooo reasonable and the professors are AMAZING. LOVE IT there :)"

Sophomore,5,Most of the teachers i had were very nice and very helpful. the school is full of fun activities and people.
Sophomore,5,"This college has exceeded my expectations. The professors were always friendly and willing to help. Faculty and advisers were knowledgeable for the most part, however, not always helpful with transfer questions. I attended this college in order to save money on my prerequisite courses. However, it was still pretty costly compared to other community colleges."
Alum,5,I did my CNA/GNA class here and had a great experience. The teacher and staff were so helpful and I knew I could always count on them.
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. there is free tutoring which I have utilized every semester. Love the environment.

College Sophomore,5,"From what I have been told, the success rate for employment after graduation has been good. But I personally do not know yet"

College Sophomore,5,"I love the friendliness of the staff, especially the library staff. I have been out of school for a long time and have decided to go back to better my education. I have been having a very hard time when looking for stuff and doing researching topics, and the staff has been wonderful!"
College Senior,5,I love this school. I am so glad I saved my money and went to a community college. Best decision ever

College Senior,5,There are so many different types of people at Carroll Community.
College Senior,5,So many things to see and do on campus
College Senior,5,The career development center on campus is extremely helpful. You can get tons of help on resumes and interviews. Lots of workshops available.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The student body has led to many great friendships and people to learn from in my experiences. At this college, many students are relatively local but come from a variety of backgrounds. Some are studying to expand on their education, others are transferring or changing careers. I have found some diversity however based on the size of the college not as much diversity as in some other places."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The financial aide is excellent. The process is easy and when accepting a scholarship there have been no questions asked. When paying for classes, the process is quick and easy. There are several payment plans available for a very small fee that is well worth it. The value of education matches that of courses others may pay four times as much for. The courses transfer and it is encouraged to be involved in transfer programs."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Campus resources are quite extensive and have grown over time. There is a gym on campus available for use. Athletically, the college would greatly benefit from a track if space allowed. The student center is large and there are always students studying. The tutors are often openly offering assistance and are very friendly. The library is updated and includes a wide variety of reading material. Aesthetically, the campus is kept tidy and clean. There is art work and plant life to provide a positive environment."
Niche User,4,"Despite some teachers being unable to connect, overall tutoring and aid from the resources available have been significant in my experience."
Sophomore,4,"Good program for what I was majoring in (Cybersecurity). Mostly competent professors. Auxiliary programs and facilities are good, and they run the soup kitchen, not bad."
Freshman,4,I would like to meet teachers that are willing to help me a bit in college and I want to feel welcome there while I study my major there.
Alum,4,I liked easing into college classes. Many of the professors are absolute angels and only want to see you earn your associate's degree.
Niche User,4,Professors and staff are nice as well as helpful. Small campus setting where everyone is nice. The library is great for studying and the staff inside are super resourceful!
Sophomore,4,"Small classes affordable, a good place to start your college career and figure out what you want to do without bankrupting you."
Freshman,4,"The teachers create a really fun learning environment, everyone who works there is very polite and helpful when you ask them questions."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed going to Carroll Community, but the school lacks student life activities. There are only a couple clubs. Most of the professors were nice and helpful. The class sizes are great because they are only 15-20 people and sometimes even smaller. The campus is a good size so you don’t get lost, but there isn’t much to do at Carroll. It is definitely a commuter school. The tuition is a good price and they offer a lot of scholarships if you apply for them."
Freshman,4,"The professors are all knowledgeable in their fields and share a common goal of enlightening their students with information crucial to development in their careers.  With a welcoming community and few expenses, Carroll Community provides an incredible experience that will never be forgotten."
Junior,4,"I've been going to Carroll for 3 years now, and just graduated with my Associate of the Arts degree. I've grown to love Carroll and the environment it has. The professors are fantastic and the school is beautiful. The programs and degrees are very slim, especially if you are looking for a degree in Science. However, the programs they do have are great."
Niche User,4,"Carroll Community College is a great bang-for-your-buck school. The tuition rates are low, however, the teacher selection here is touch and go. I’ve personally had horrible experiences with their chemistry department but a wonderful experience with Anatomy and Physiology. It all depends on the teacher you get, look at rate my professor.com before choosing."
Freshman,4,"Awesome school. Small class sizes, accessible campus, wonderfully attentive professors, and a variety of clubs to choose from to get involved."
Sophomore,4,"a nice quiet school. class times are flexible, lots of on campus resources. recently lots of not so great adjunct teachers."
Sophomore,4,Carroll Community College is a great two year school. It is a great school to start at because of the variety of degree choices they offer. Highly recommend.
Junior,4,Very casual enviroment that allowed me to easily attend part time and work around my schedule. Offers help if you know where to find it.
Alum,4,"I loved the school. Everyone is very welcoming and there is always something to do. Some of their proffesors are not the best, but they are good enough for a community college."
College Sophomore,4,Carroll Community college brings in a lot of the community businesses and programs for students to sign up for.
College Sophomore,4,The workload is overwhelming in the Bio and sciences classes but the professors are willing to help you learn ways to study to become a better student.
College Sophomore,4,"Carroll Community college is an amazing starting point for anyone seeking a higher education. The sciences at Carroll are very vigorous and competitive, however the tutors and professors are willing to put in the effort to help you succeed. You can go to Carroll earn credits and transfer to any other college of your choice."
College Senior,4,"I have really appreciated most of my professors. They have been extremely helpful and understanding. They want what is best for you. The courses are good, and I enjoy my classes. The class classes are smaller which is very nice. I have been able to find specific courses that I need for my major."
College Senior,4,"I have been able to, for the most part, have a very good experience with my schedule at Carroll. I usually have to change my work schedule each semester to comply with my class schedule. At the beginning of the semester, scheduling can be frustrating, but once it is figured out, everything usually works well. I have not transferred credits yet,but it doesn't seem like it will be difficult."
College Senior,4,"As a health science major, I have been offered many interested and helpful classes, as well as professors that know the field that I want to go into. There are health fairs during each semester, as well as fitness center. One of my professors is currently helping me find an internship specific to my field of interest."
College Senior,4,"Going to this school has not only made it possible for me to pay for school, but have great professors who are willing to help you"
College Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my online courses because you still get the interaction with students, whether it's talking over a disscussion board or meeting up to study. The registration process is the same as any other class. The main difference between online courses and traditional classroom courses is that you have access to everything without having to leave your home or take a serious break in your day to go to a classroom. It's very convenient for busy people who want to get an education."
College Sophomore,4,There are actually a lot of different courses to choose from and the professors are pretty good for the most part. Classes are small which is what I prefer and everyone is just so helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Carroll Community College doesn't seem like a great institution until you actually experience what it has to offer first hand. The professors, tutors, and other students, are just overall great and helpful. Teachers care about your performance and help you as much as they can both inside the classroom and outside. I would choose Carroll Community College again because it's a good platform that will help me transition into the four year college setting."
College Freshman,4,Its very affordable and a friendly environment for a community college!
College Sophomore,4,"It's a pretty small school which is one of the reasons i like it so much. The class sizes are small so the teacher knows everyone's name, so if you like having a good teacher to student relationship its great!"
College Sophomore,4,very friendly staff and very helpful with any problems or question I may have
College Sophomore,4,The staff for financial aid has been very helpful with all the forms that need to be filled out for each semester
College Sophomore,4,"I have not started my official class yet, but from what I have heard from other students, that the courses are absolutley wonderful!"
College Sophomore,4,Its not like it was in High school when I was enrolled. Everybody is very friendly and helps with any help you may need
Recent Alumnus,4,I would choose this college again in the future. It is an excellent place to launch an adult education. There are many core classes offered and at great prices. The curriculum matches that of four year schools. Some of my favorite experiences involve club involvements and stretching my learning curve.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Academically my school performs well. The professors are professional and keep communication open with all students. The curriculum of courses aligns well with other schools in the area. The registration process is easy, and it is not complicated to sign up for, cancel or change courses. Enrolling in their payment plan is easy as well and is a nice option to have. The workload of classes is about the same overall. Some courses are harder than others depending on what sticks well based on personal study habits. It would be nice to see more night class and online options. While there are some, it is hard to map out a schedule in upper level courses and work during the day at the same time. There are many clubs and programs to choose from, although more growth would allow for more academic options."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am currently involved in a transfer program at my school. Nearly all of the courses I am involved in will transfer to another college without much of a hassle. Uniquely, we get to partner up with other schools in the area in order to have more class options at the same cost. The workload can vary depending on the subject matter, however it tends to be moderately heavy. All classes and faculty I am involved with pertain to math and science. I think that I have built a strong background in these areas. The lab facilities are equipped with enough materials to complete labs. The curriculum includes enough to get to a good point in the sciences and meets expectations for a two year school. Of course it would be nice to see more of a variety however."
Recent Alumnus,4,The career center is easily accessible and is available for anyone. They often send out emails to give word of upcoming career events on campus. There are pamphlets of information outside of the office to invite students in. The career service is also available for alumni to use. I have used it before and found that there are options for many different interests and many opportunities for student jobs present themselves that can continue into post-grad. Career services is a tool that I can keep in mind during my job searches after college.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Online courses in my experiences have been well structured and assignments are given with clarity. Most online courses begin with an introduction where all students are required to give a statement about themselves to include their interests and reasons for taking the course. The workload is often less than traditional courses because time is used more efficiently. With online courses, students can focus on areas of peak interest and time is not wasted for reasons such as driving. The registration process is the same for traditional classes, as the same process is used to set up communication for all courses. The professors are easy to communicate with and respond within reason. The online classes differ from the traditional classroom experiences as it is the responsibility of the student to allow enough time for studies."
College Sophomore,4,The two times that I sought help from the post-grad departments was when I was looking at schools to transfer to and when I needed help creating a job resume. The counselor that I worked with on transfers was very helpful and gave me useful information and tips. The career center is awesome and the person I worked with to draft my resume was very helpful and I was able to get a job using that resume!
College Sophomore,4,Going to school has been very convenient for me because I was able to go to all my classes and do all of my work and very rarely did it ever get in the way of anything else I was trying to or wanted to do. I was also able to maintain a social life and do other things in addition o my courses and workload.
College Sophomore,4,"In my opinion, there is a good amount of diversity within my school's student body. It is not comprised so heavily of one group that I felt like there was no diversity at all but not so heavily diverse that I felt like there was no one else like me that I could relate to due to religious, social or ethnic differences."
College Sophomore,4,"The school offers a large amount of resources including a library with books, articles and magazines that I use for pleasure reading but also books and articles, etc. that I used to complete assignments and do research. I also used the various computer labs in classes but also outside of classes to do research, work on assignments, print things and check my grades. The biggest bonus however, was that every print job was already paid for by the school so I never had to pay for a print job!"
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed each year that I have been a student there and have made friends and memories that will last a lifetime. I have also gotten a great education that has prepared me to apply for and be accepted for a job in sales and also to continue my education further and get my degree in the future.
College Sophomore,4,"Carroll Community College has a very prominent sense of community and from the minute I started classes, I felt like I was a part of the college ""family"". That feeling just increased the second year as I met more people and came in contact with more faculty. I knew that no matter what, there was always something to do, someone to talk with and a place where I could go and do work or just relax and interact with others."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that I have gained the knowledge that I need to continue to pursue my bachelor's degree elsewhere. I also feel that if I were to change my plans, the knowledge that I have already gained would be enough to assist me in getting a job in my intended career field and performing that job well."
College Sophomore,4,The school offered a wide variety of classes that fit into my degree program but that also interested me. I was also able to find the resources and help that I needed to assist in my studies relatively easily.
College Senior,4,People are nice and hardworking.
College Senior,4,Printing on campus is free!!
College Senior,4,The student center is great and so is the library!
College Senior,4,The teachers are great and know how to teach.
College Senior,4,The value of education I am receiving is worth the tuition I paid.
College Senior,4,The workload is not as much as in-class.
College Senior,4,The classes were flexible and trasnferring my credits was easy.
College Junior,4,Very flexible with class registration
College Junior,4,"Professors have been great so far, class registration process was fairly easy, and workload is average but challenging"
College Junior,4,Thr courses of my major are fun and challenging. They cover all of the topics needed to help me in my future career. The facilities we use also provide a wide range of useful resources.
College Junior,4,Online courses at carroll community college are very user friendly and instructors provide many useful resources to help complete assignments.
College Junior,4,Carroll community college provides much help and information for these topics
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid office is great they tell you ways of how you can receive there loans
"
College Senior,4,They always have seminars going on.  They love for you to come in and meet with them.  They will help you figure out where your interests in and how you should determine your educational path to set you up for success.  They are more than willing to meet with you...and not just once!
College Junior,4,"Carroll has transfer school road trips, that take yhou to the college you want to visit by bus.  They also have colleges come in and discuss transfer options with students"
College Sophomore,2,Almost impossible to make friends. Seems like people are not there with the intention to make friends.
College Senior,2,"No one really interacts with each other. Everyone keeps to themselves or friends they had made in high school. I haven't made any new ""friends"" mostly just people I talk with in my classes. Most people use Carroll as a stepping stone to a four year university, and I don't blame them."
College Sophomore,2,I dont even know where the library is.
College Sophomore,2,They don't really talk much about after you graduate
College Freshman,2,"The tuition seems to be fair for the most part, I have had some trouble dealing with the financial aid office, and trying to get help paying for school and seeing what my options are."
College Senior,2,"Creditable Classes Transferring – I wish their would be more classes creditable for transferring students. However, most classes I've taken at my school, have not been creditable at other colleges. It makes the student take more and more classes, also makes them pay more money for classes they obviously don't need."
College Senior,1,There is nothing unique about this school.

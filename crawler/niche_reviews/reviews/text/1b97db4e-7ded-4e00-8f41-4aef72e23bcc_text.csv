Junior,5,"Muskingum University is my second home. My time here can never be forgotten. Administration and Professors are out of this world, and I love every second I'm in class with them. Greek life is also a major plus, as well as the scenery around campus. My college life is very enriched due to my choice at Muskingum."
Sophomore,5,"I never intended to take any online courses through the school since i am a student who is living on campus but due to the Covid-19 outbreak all of our classes were moved to online instructions. I will admit, I believe that it was difficult for everyone because no one was exactly prepared. Although, it was a struggle at first, Muskingum university and my professors worked with me very well to make sure I was still getting the best education possible."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Muskingum University so far has been amazing. I have met and interacted with so many new, great people. The staff and faculty are all very helpful in my process to further my education. 
One thing that i love about attending school at Muskingum University is that there are unlimited things you can do as a student there and it's a great social environment. As high school student who never really got involved, Muskingum university has helped me become more joining and interactive with others and events at school. There are many different clubs, community service opportunities, sporting events and other activities to attend to on campus. I love my school and there is not much that I would change about it but if I had to choose something, it would involve the dinning hall, not the employees because they are amazing and so helpful but the food options could use a change."
Freshman,5,I love it here Iâ€™ve made great firmed and the environment with others is very welcoming. The teachers are very understanding of things and mishaps in day to day lives

Niche User,5,I enjoyed how active the community is with the university. It is located in such a quaint village to where it is hard to not get involved. Making friends is not a hard task here!
Alum,5,I was a MAP student and graduated with a BS in Health Science. The smaller school atmosphere transferred over to online courses as well. Almost all of the professors were very available and willing to work with you and help you succeed. I really recommend it if you are considering finishing a BS but don't have time to go to a brick and mortar school.

Alum,5,"I love Muskingum University!!!! The University itself might be small, but it is like a family to me. I am so sad that I have graduated from this college. I wish I can still stay there for ten more years, honestly. The University has a great psychology department; all the professors are super kind and helpful. Additionally, they are always trying to challenge students and give students' outside the lecture opportunities. Matter fact, the student residence life staff are super friendly and helpful as well. Overall, I had a great experience at Muskingum University. It has given a great college experience."
Freshman,5,the profesors all want to see you sucseed and they will try to help you the best they can. what I would like to see change is the seporation between the freshman and the upper classes. the freshman get their own dorms while the others share dorms.
Junior,5,"Very Happy. More 1 on 1 learning than expected, which is good. Has a great community and very welcoming staff."
Niche User,5,"Muskingum University is a beautiful campus with a magnificent library. It was also a perfect size for a student from a small school to adjust to.

Freshman,5,"My first experience going to college, was the best experience of my life. Seeing so many different diverse people in one area, means making friendships with any race was possible. I also played football for the school, and it was nothing better than playing on a Saturday and having fun the night of. Teachers were really helpful, as well as the administration people. Very friendly and helpful to those in need."
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed the people on and off campus. Everyone is very friendly and very welcoming. Everyone is very close with each other and is a very connected community. The staff tries very hard and succeeds, in my opinion, to get you involved and interact as much as possible. There are many events hosted on campus that get you to meet new people. On top of all of that, the campus has a a beautiful scenery."
Senior,5,I transferred colleges twice. This is my third university and I'm absolutely in love. The professors are so involved and really want everyone to do well. This school has helped me more than I could have asked.
Sophomore,5,I love the professors at Muskingum. They will go out of their way to see you succeed and accomplish your dreams. The campus is beautiful and the people are fantastic. The WiFi is pretty bad though so that is a turnoff and the dorms are a bit outdated.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE Muskingum University. The people and community are absolutely amazing  and such a close group of people, and they are all so accepting of each other. The professors are great at interacting with students and and providing a rigorous curriculum. There are endless opportunities to get involved too such as Greek life, multi-cultural life, music and the arts, sports, everything under the sun! The residence halls could use some updating, but that does not take away from the absolute beauty of the rolling hills and classic brick featured all over campus. Go Muskies!"
Niche User,5,"Very ""at home"" atmosphere of the whole campus and student body. A small school with a nice campus and great education plan."

Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I have very much enjoyed my first year at Muskingum University. The campus is beautiful, and the people on and around campus are nice and friendly. The professors are fantastic, and the courses I have taken  have been very interesting. Muskingum has made my first experience of college not scary at all, but rather something comfortable and enjoyable."
Freshman,5,I love Muskingum so much. It is probably one of the best decisions that I have made in my life. It has so many different opportunities on and off campus and I never feel bored or like I have nothing to do.
Freshman,5,"I love the college that I ended up choosing. The faculty here are so caring and involved with the students. They really want all students at Muskingum to succeed. The students at Muskingum are also really close to one another. One of my favorite things about Muskingum is the Muskie ""hello."" Everyone here is so friendly and caring. My only concerns are the campus food and housing. They are not the worst thing in the world, but it could definitely be improved. But despite that, I couldn't imagine attending college anywhere else."
Freshman,5,Muskingum University really makes you feel like you are a part of a family.  They people here are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  The professors really care about the students and how well they do in their academics.  There is a lot of one on one work that can be done with each professor. They will set aside hours that work well for both of you so you can get the help you need. They make sure every student has what they need to succeed and make sure everyone does well. It's a very safe and close environment and I am happy that I went here.
College Freshman,5,"I'm a greek so this may be bias. Our greek life is phenomenal. Our greeks hold ourselves to a higher standard on campus, We try to involve ourselves in charity work and things like that."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors at Muskingum are very understanding and are easy to work with. Once you declare your majors, you get an advisor and they help guide you and make sure that you complete all the classes that are needed for you to graduate in four years. The work load is pretty manageable. It seems that the lobby's of dorm and the chess center are a pretty common area to study."
College Sophomore,5,"It is a very tight knit community, that is built with many connection to large companies to small local companies."
College Sophomore,5,Professor are very accommodating to a students needs and they also enjoying getting to know their students. Class sizes are very small.
College Sophomore,5,Muskingum University offers really nice dorms and housing options for students. The maintenance  and custodial workers are very nice and very cooperative with the students.
College Sophomore,5,"Going greek was one of the best decisions that I have ever made in my life. Being greek has fulfilled my passion of helping out the community and people who are in need. Also going greek has also helped me make one of the best support systems and helped me discover some of my best friends. Students are not looked at differently if they decide not to go greek, because greek and non -greeks co-mingle all the time."
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy attending Muskingum University because of the community that the students, Greek life, and the residence of New Concord help make the campus feel like home. One of my favorite experiences of being at Muskingum is all he friends that I have became friends with. I meet a lot of friends by joining a sorority and receiving 60 sister, friends and classmate that are always there for you. As far as faculty and staff, they are very nice and caring individuals. They want to see you grow as an individual and become successful.  Another thing that I enjoy at Muskingum all the different clubs that are present at Muskingum. Last fall, my friends and I recently started up our own club called The Outdoor Initiative, my role for the club is Treasure. Our goal for this come is to initiate the students to get outdoors and enjoy the outdoor activities that are surrounded by campus. Some events that I have came up with and lead are a geocaching event, a trip to Ray's Indoor Mountain Biking located in Cleveland, Ohio.   I'm also very involved in Muskingum Programming Board (MPB), MPB is in charge of putting on weekend activities such as bring bands, comedians, movies, bingo and several other activities. Last semester, I also attended a four day conference in Michigan were I learned how to improve our events on campus."
College Sophomore,5,Top notch profs and courses I need for my pre medical Bio degree.
College Sophomore,5,It is a very safe place to be. I go running outside by myself at like 10 or 11 at night and I am not worried for my safety at all. We have never had a problem with safety on campus.
College Sophomore,5,I really do love the school. It is a strong community and I would not want to go to school anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,"Muskingum's small, beautiful campus makes you feel you belong.  Most  of the professors are great and very accessable.  Classes are challenging in my science major.  The students are mostly very friendlly and easy to make friends with."
College Sophomore,5,I love attending Muskingum University!! The community on campus is amazing and very supportive.
College Freshman,5,"I, personally, am involved in Greek Life at my campus. I love it and do not retreat anything about joining. Many people like the greeks and the events they put on. Before I came to college, I thought that all Greek Life was, was a bunch of drunken parties. I soon learned that this was not the case. Our Greek life here at Muskingum helped raise money so a young girl with special needs could ride a bike. It was such an awes,e thing to witness and showed others what Greek life is all about. 

Greek housing varies depending on the fraternity or sorority. The Greek organization has either a lounge and floor of one of the dorms or their own Greek House. Both are nice options and everyone in that organization has the option of living there."
College Freshman,5,Tough but fair.  Facilities could be a bit better but faculty is great!
College Freshman,5,Just the way I dreamed it would be.
College Freshman,5,As a science major it has been great!!
College Freshman,5,Lots of new buildings on campus
College Senior,5,"Greek life is a great opportunity at Muskingum. They do a lot of philanthropy, community service, and charity. I am a member of Kappa Sigma and I can personally tell you that Greek life is a big deal at Muskingum."
College Senior,5,I really enjoy the classes and the professors at Muskingum University. Everyone is really friendly and truly cares about your education.
College Senior,5,I love my professors in my major field. There are great opportunities for learning and jobs. You just have to be willing to talk to the professors about them.
College Freshman,5,I love going to my fraternity and having a good time.
College Junior,5,"The majors aren't hard to get into. All you have to do is have your advisor sign a paper that you also sign, stating your major and any minors. It can be changed at any time."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone seems to be motivated towards their goals in life.  They are there for the right reasons.  Yes they want to have fun with freedom of being away from family, but everyone is very nice and personable.  They are much the same as anywhere else.  A variety, but mostly good looking over all."
College Freshman,5,The school has it's own official police force.  They have the same abilities as the city police.  The school is set off on a hill above the town.  It sets back to itself.  Very peaceful and quaint.  The dorm doors are always locked so you have to bring your key with you at all times.  They have safety buttons if you feel scared or need help that alerts them immediately.  They parole the area continuously.  It is a very safe area and  crime is minute.
College Freshman,5,"My school helps out each student in their interests.  The school has a greek unit for my education, history and french.  They have a lot of opportunities open for students and if they don't have something in particular that you may be thinking about, they will help you find it."
College Freshman,5,They have all kinds of clubs and extra curricular items for students.  They try to help students out as much as possible.  They are very helpful in every way you can think.  The curriculum is varied and challenges you.
Junior,4,"Due to COVID-19, students and professors were sent through a loop. It was all a very sudden change to us, but we made the best of it. My grades did not suffer from the switch to online, and I believe my professors did an excellent job."
Junior,4,"Muskingum University is in a village, so there is not much to really do outside of campus in-town, unless you drive to the next bugger cities nearby. However, I love the size, it makes me feel at home and is not overwhelming in the slightest. the cafeterias have excellent food, but it can become repetitive every so often. The dorms are okay, they could definitely use some remodeling and fix-ups. i think the school has a lot of focus on sports, and should take some of that focus and redirect it to more education, and learning. I have learned a lot and been tested, with the academics. One of my professors I had i struggled a little in his class but loved that I did. He didn't just have you memorize the content he taught, he also had you take that information and apply it in various problems to come up with a solution, or answer to the problem presented. This is really important to me, because it teaches critical thinking, being the next step in education and learning."
Alum,4,Muskingum University is a wonderful college. The faculty at this university really make a difference in the lives of their students. They are committed to making sure their students truly understand not just what is being taught in classes but what they should expect from life as well. The only downside to this university is the poor dorm/housing situation. Housing is old and is not well taken care of. If the university would direct some funds to remedy this situation then I would not hesitate to recommend Muskingum University as a five-star school.
Freshman,4,"Muskingum University is a great place to study academics and play athletics. As a student athlete, they are very cooperating with time management and help student athletes succeed. Although their campus has a small number of students enrolled, there is a sense of community around the campus. All students are very welcoming and friendly."
Senior,4,"I went to Muskingum because it was close, but stayed because of the supportive atmosphere and wonderful professors. I'm hoping that I will graduate this year, but I'm not a traditional student. I'm 27, have a mortgage and responsibilities that make it hard to pursue an education, but I'm trying my best."
Sophomore,4,"I love Muskingum University. Starting with the location and the campus itself. It is a smaller school which I think fosters closer relationships with professors as well as other students.  The location of the University could, however, be viewed by some as a drawback because you have to drive a distance to get to the nearest larger town.  Academically it is challenging, but that makes it feel like more of an accomplishment when you get a good grade in a class.  The campus itself is clean and picturesque and the people are very friendly.  Because it is a small school the party scene is a bit limited, but it does exist and can be a lot of fun.  There are also a lot of extra school sponsored activities involving members of the local community.  The on-campus job opportunities are good for the size of the school and all the athletic facilities are top notch. The school recently renovated the main cafeteria and the food is fantastic"
Junior,4,The professors and fellow students are extremely friendly and it won't take much time at all before you'll find a group that fit's your interests. The campus itself is lively and there are plenty of events to keep you entertained in your free time.
Freshman,4,I love all the friendly people and environment. I wish the freshman could be More informed about activities happening.
Sophomore,4,I love Muskingum because it's small and cozy. I feel incredibly safe and welcome here. The faculty and staff are wonderful and super helpful. The campus is beautiful and you really get a workout walking all up and down the hills to and from classes.
Freshman,4,"I love Muskingum. The rooms are small- but it is a dorm in college. Our president is amazing. The professors, however are not the best. One argued with me multiple times about what my belifs are on a certain topic in a diversity class. The Greek life on campus is amazing. The sororityâ€™s and ferternitys are amazing. Stacy Allen has a great program going and I couldnâ€™t have picked a better college. A student (junior) passes away a few days before Christmas, and our community came together and donated money to his family, including our president who donated her personal money to his account. The people at Muskingum is quite honestly amazing! I love it. I am so proud and blessed to be a Muskie. 10/10 would recommend."
Alum,4,I love the fact that Muskingum University is a small hometown school that makes students feel safe and the campus is beyond beautiful in every season. I would like to see more helpful tactics in after college prep.
Freshman,4,I have loved every moment here! The dining hall isn't great but you get that everywhere. The faculty is amazing and is so helpful. It is Alamo a very safe campus and the parties are great!
Niche User,4,"Great school and campus! Fun programs and clubs, great educational experience overall! Cost was higher  than others. "
Freshman,4,"What I like about Muskingum is that the professors try to work with the students. If a student is struggling in a class, the professor offers office hours for them to come in and discuss their problems. I also like the openness of the campus. for instance, I can walk anywhere and always see someone I know. I concluded that by the end of the day, the ""Freshmen Fifteen"" was nonexistent. Something I would change about Muskingum would be the lack of enough handicap accommodations. I have a few classmates in my classes who are handicap. They have trouble getting to class sometimes of the weather. I feel that the school needs to make more accommodations for them. For instance, in one of the dorms, the ground floor does not have an automatic door. My friend lives on that floor and she has trouble getting to her room because the door does not open automatically. I'm not saying that Muskingum needs to be a more friendly handicap accessible campus, but they need to make changes and additions."
College Sophomore,4,Muskingum University has many athletic sport teams and over the past couple years they have even added more sports too.  The students and the community do all come together to cheer on the Fighting Muskies.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of friends and roomie is great.  Dorms are older but have air and are well kept.  Newer dorms available for upper classmen.
College Sophomore,4,Greek or not you are all friendly at Muskingum.  They co-mingle all the time!!
College Sophomore,4,Dorms are older but well kept.  Most have air
College Sophomore,4,I am a soroity member and not treated any differently than anyone else.  Greek anbd non greek get along great!
College Sophomore,4,Not a big problem at all.
College Sophomore,4,Overall great profs and small classes.  All the courses I need are offered.
College Sophomore,4,They are difficult but doable.
College Sophomore,4,"At least in my program because it is so small, there are alot of opportunities. And my professors are very helpful with this."
College Sophomore,4,Its a normal college campus housing. Its not perfect but it could be a lot worse.
College Sophomore,4,I love Muskingum. Its a very close group. The academics are challenging but doable. It really is a great place to be with great people who truly care about you are your success.
College Sophomore,4,Muskingum University has a very close-knit and friendly atmosphere. I felt welcome here the moment I stepped foot on campus. Every one of your professors gets to know you and care about you because of the small class sizes. The professors are all very friendly and willing to help any student.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Muskingum University has been great. The environment is unbelievable because everyone shows love and want you to feel at home, in which I do. I think with me playing basketball helped me as a freshman because the people there treated me with care and respect as I learned throughout my freshman year of college. It will only get better as I finish out school."
College Freshman,4,We have a lot of frats and soroities. They are mostly all friendly and respect everyone.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of rules set on what you can and can not do. But there are still things you can do that doesn't involve a lot of strictness.
College Sophomore,4,The people are less boring
College Sophomore,4,The chess centers not bad
College Freshman,4,"One of the main reasons I chose Muskingum was for its Diversity. We have people here from all ethnic groups and I love it. In addition, the people here are all very accepting. One of the girls in my sorority is from India and everyone loves her. I know another girl from France and it seems like everyone wants to be her friend. It seems like the main religion here is Christianity, but everyone is still accepting if you claim to be something else. Over all, the people here are very friendly."
College Freshman,4,"I never feel unsafe when I am on campus. Everybody knows everybody and we have campus police near by. All of the buildings require a key card to get in, so I know that not just anybody can come in. 

As for campus crime, it's something I don't hear of often. At the beginning of the semester, we had a few car break ins in our back lot, but other than that, I haven't seen or heard of much crime on campus."
College Junior,4,Nice but most live in houses or dorms
College Freshman,4,Must interveiw well.  High GPA and entrance test scores are a plus.  Take all the AP classes you can in HS.
College Freshman,4,The prospects are theere to take!!
College Freshman,4,no problems that couldn't be fixed easily.
College Freshman,4,The science dept. is outstanding
College Freshman,4,Love the small town atmosphere!!
College Senior,4,I strongly believe that Muskingum gives you the best chances at furthering and succeeding in your field. They give you every thing you need in order to be successful.
College Junior,4,The class sizes are small and nice. The professors are friendly and genuinely care about their students.
College Senior,4,I thoroughly enjoy my program. I just feel like I have learned so much. And I have a great relationship with the professors.
College Senior,4,"The police are there to help you, but sometimes they aren't in the office. Just know that if you do need help, it might take time but they will be there. I feel very safe on campus."
College Senior,4,"Most of the professors are great. The curriculum is difficult, but is worth it. Registration takes time, but it is easy once you understand how to do it."
College Senior,4,The Greeks on the campus make sure to include everyone. It can be easy to get into if you are willing to show up for the events.
College Junior,4,"The most unique thing that sets Muskingum apart is The Hollow. The Hollow is Muskingum's personal forest. It is very peaceful to walk through, and you find lots of interesting things when you are hiking through there. In addition, The Wilds is very close to Muskingum, so their are opportunities for students to do research at the Wilds."
College Sophomore,4,All you need for the English Department is an expressed interest and an application.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are friendly and encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a very well-known school. Senator and astronaut John Glenn, Agnes Moorehead from Bewitched, and ""Jungle"" Jack Hannah graduated from here. The John and Annie Glenn museum is right beside us, as well as the house they lived in. Everyone is usually pretty friendly as well."
College Sophomore,4,I feel appropriately challenged in my courses.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are supportive and involved. There are many work labs available to do homework or study.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone knows the officers, they are very friendly; especially to chief. They are always showing their presence, walking or driving around campus."
College Sophomore,4,The locals are very friendly toward the college students.
College Sophomore,4,It's an expensive school but they give out lots of grants and scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Police does their job well, maybe too well."

College Freshman,4,I fully enjoy being in my program because I am doing what I love every day.
College Freshman,4,"With my intended major it is somewhat challenging to gain acceptance in. All it takes to apply is just a signature; however, one must also complete a set of required classes to fully gain access to the program."
College Sophomore,4,Plus program helps all students that have problems learning and makes it easy for them to graduate.
College Sophomore,4,Muskingum is a great university for everyone that is looking to attend.
Junior,2,Please do your research on this university before attending. If your want knowledge and experience in your career field then don't go here. Way to expensive for a degree that won't get you anywhere. Very clicky atmosphere and no school spirit.
Alum,2,There is nothing around the campus to do so student involvement is extremely low. Sports are poor. Education is even worse than the sports. The teachers do nothing to prepare any of the students for the real world. I highly regret going to school here. This school should be shut down because of how poorly it is run and controlled.
Graduate Student,2,If you don't like your emails to be returned you've come to the right place! However there is one professor who always promptly replied back in a timely manner.
Freshman,2,"If you bring a car, they will ticket you asap for any reason to make money for their college. if you are trying to get out of big lecture halls from a big school, well the only difference is, the lectures have half the people in them. police there are not there to help keep you safe because nothin dangerous happens on this campus, all they are there to do is help you fix a flat, they bust every party within 10 minutes of the party, so if you are looking to come here to party, don't come here. since this is a smaller school profs dont have to grade as much and they will be harder graders. Hilly school. If you find yourself liking the city more than country, also do not come here. dorms are tiny. food is absolutely terrible. and you ca tell people are not too interested in the college, because more than half of the people find another place to go on the weekend... but if you like a smaller school and seeing college as a slightly bigger high school, then this might be the place for you."
Freshman,2,"This campus has very good professors and everyone is very nice. The acedemics are very strong, however campus life is extremely boring. There is never anything to do on campus and due to its location there isn't anything to do for miles. "
College Freshman,2,"It is a D3 school, so the sports are not really as important to people. Students still attend events, its just not a huge deal"
College Senior,2,"There are only four places on campus for food. There is only one place for late night food, and you have to use other money for it than your plan. The meal plan is just used for that other than a meal exchange, but it does take from your weekly total."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm bored most of the time, people look at the ground when you walk past them."
College Sophomore,2,"Very old buildings, just now starting to install air conditioning units in the windows."
College Sophomore,2,"Girls always wear sweats and a bun, and are not the most attractive. Guys are either awkward or cocky."
College Sophomore,2,Every fraternity is on probation or on the verge of being kicked off of campus.
College Sophomore,2,Campus is extremely quiet on weekends because of the police.
College Sophomore,2,"Good if you like the quiet, small town life."
College Sophomore,2,Some dorms have no air conditioning and are often too hot. In the winter the heat is always either too hot or too cold.
College Sophomore,2,"Subway and a few pizza places, that's about it unless you drive 20+ minutes."
Recent Alumnus,2,There really doesnt seem to be a lot of things to do while at school
Recent Alumnus,2,Small Town â€“ Muskingum is a very nice college to not be right next to everything.  The problem is that we are not near anything.  It takes us almost 20 minutes to get to Walmart.  There are no places to do anything off of campus.  The closest shopping is also twenty minutes away.  The town is small and very nice and the people there are great.
College Junior,2,"I think that the greek life on campus is lacking, but seems to be pickin gback up at least a little bit. The academic programs specific to your major are nice and the teachers want you to do well. However, the Liberal Arts part of the school is irritating. It makes you take classes that are not in your major, causing you to extend your stay in some cases. this is hard to do when the school is more expensive. We have some new facilities at our school, including the Chess Center which is a very nice little workout area and study center. Also, walter hall is a nice facility which holds music classes. Overall though, the school is pretty old. Most of the dorms are in pretty poor shape and need an update."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no bars or nightclubs around. There may be a few parties on the weekends, but they are usually off campus."
College Freshman,2,Pretty average.  I live on campus so I don't know much.  Very small town though so I would say it is hard to come by.

College Freshman,1,"Our school is in the middle of nowhere. Unless you want pizza or subway, there isn't much offered. If you want good food, you have to drive to the neighboring cities 15-20 minutes away...not very convenient. 

The prices of the nearby places aren't bad, but I couldn't afford to go there everyday. 

The best places to go are Crenos and Subway! I love going to Special K on Tuesdays to get coffee for $1 since we don't have any coffee places near by."
College Sophomore,1,"Very quiet, police shut down mostly everything by 11."
College Sophomore,1,Can't even watch youtube most of the time.
College Sophomore,1,"No transportation, If you want to leave you better have a car or a friend with a car."
College Sophomore,1,We usually lose at everything.
College Junior,1,"There is a subway and pizza places nearby. They are affordable, but the options are very limited. You get sick of them pretty quickly, but the only other option is eating food from the school which is either expensive or not so great."
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation on campus unless the students own a car. They have no buses or anything. The only way to get around the school is walking.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Wouldn't Do It Again â€“ Campus is very isolated, so you have to make your own entertainment. There is a strong religious undercurrent in most activities, which is a huge turn-off. I went there unseen and unaware of this aspect and couldn't wait to graduate and leave the isolation."

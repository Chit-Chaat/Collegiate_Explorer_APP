Junior,5,I love Cal State Bakersfield! I’ve really enjoyed the student life and the dedication that I notice from my professors. You can tell that they care about you personally. I love that the campus is small enough to make connections but large enough to be very diverse.
Freshman,5,"My experience although it has only been online for classes is great. i used to go there in the summers when i was little, so i am very comfortable with the campus, the only thing will be that i will have less experience in knowing where my classes are. The staff is doing a great job."
Freshman,5,I really like how despite the pandemic and online classes CSUB reaches out to their  every day. They make sure students are doing well and catch them up on what is going on both with school and the outside world. It is a bit difficult to learn but CSUB offer several help and options. I really like CSUB and i look forward to being able to attend the campus in person once the pandemic is over. CSUB took great precaution and was even the first university in this area to announce spring semester to be online. I think this was a smart decision to keep everyone safe. I also give the props for their super fast adjustment and overall how they dealt with online school.
Sophomore,5,The school environment is great and very welcoming. Even the professors and staff make it easy to talk to them if you need anything. I would recommend this school to any of my friends.
Junior,5,"CSUB was quick to take students safety into consideration and switch to online instruction. The online experience was favorable in a sense that I was able to learn from home but still receive the same level of instruction. Fall 2020 will also be online instruction and professors have been thorough in outlining expectations. Despite not being in a classroom, I was able to receive good grades in all of my courses. CSUB was quick to adapt and was still able to put forth great educational standards."
Freshman,5,I’m barely starting my online classes this year since I’m a freshman so I don’t have much to say nor a review.
Freshman,5,"I’m only a freshman starting this year online due to the Pandemic so I don’t have much to say so far, but I have gotten help with a few things and the advisor that helped me set up my classes was so helpful and nice. So if that counts as a experience, it’s been great so far."
Junior,5,"I had two classes online, I enjoyed and felt connected to the professors. It was not hands on, or face to face obviously, but it felt like it. The communication was daily, and the responses were detailed."
Sophomore,5,Being a student here is overall good.  Everyone here is ready to offer help when needed and provide support.
Graduate Student,5,Professors were easy to reach and very helpful with the courses.  I will be attending to their online Master of Science in Kinesiology program this fall so that will an interesting experience relating to this.
Senior,5,I honestly love this school! Truly a diverse environment and has such a great staff. It is only my second year and I absolutely love how many school events they organize to make the student feel more comfortable.
Senior,5,Definitely a good experience. I enjoyed how easy and manageable each online course was. I also enjoyed how the professors were very helpful in understanding the material as well as the course online.
Junior,5,I think this school does a good of communicating to it's students. One thing I would improve though would be providing more class opportunities the students.
Freshman,5,What I like about this college is that it is not that expensive You are able to complete your college education in a very relaxing environment and the staff there will welcome you with open arms. There are numerous activities you can do to ease your mind off of stress and provide food for you.

Graduate Student,5,"CSUB is a diverse campus with student housing,  sports recreation and fitness building,  fastfood, and open outdoor spaces.  There's a theater across the street from campus and once a year there is an outdoor jazz concert. Lots of team spirit, dances, and extracurricular activities. The health services and on site counselors are top notch."
Senior,5,It is a calm school and great for students who commute! I like how there are programs like CAMP that help students. There is a lot of help on campus to help students with their academics.
Works Here,5,CSUB is a great place to work. It is very much a family type atmosphere and has a really good NCAA Division I Athletic program. Love the ‘Runners!
Freshman,5,CSUB has been a wonderful experience. I have made so many friends from different parts of California/the U.S. just during my first semester here. The campus life is beautiful and they offer many programs in which each and every student could participate in. I truly believe there something here for anyone.
Sophomore,5,I like California State University Bakersfield because the environment is just great and all the professors that I have had thus far are very helpful. I feel very welcomed  when I am there and I could have no chosen a better college. I do not think I would like to see anything change.

Niche User,5,A beautiful campus that offers so many opportunities to their students. They offer a variety of academics to achieve many amazing careers for their students future.
Freshman,5,"I've only been there for two weeks but I love it. The staff is great and very helpful. I also like that most of their students have jobs on campus which is great. They offer so many clubs, and they always keep in touch with students via email. It's great!"
Freshman,5,"It is my first year at California State University Bakersfield Antelope valley campus, I like this campus because it is small, so you can’t get lost when trying to find a class. The staff is very friendly and greets you with a smile and it makes you feel like you belong while on campus. The professors are friendly and understanding when it comes to their assignments they make sure that their students understands the assignments that are given."
Freshman,5,The campus is a very big campus and the dorms are really nice also clean. I am a freshmen and i am loving what  i am seeing for now. Go Runners

Freshman,5,"My mom went to CSUB and loved it and now I will be attending in the fall. Being in my hometown I wasn’t very excited to attend but the campus has a lot to offer in activities and being involved. The gym or SRC is incredibly nice and offers various classes such as yoga, spinning class, and even kickboxing. The sport scene is also very apparent on campus being D1 and is overall a great atmosphere while getting a good education."
Junior,5,"Deciding to go to California State University, Bakersfield was the best decision of my life. I love the atmosphere of the campus. It feels like we are all one when I am at school. Most of the my classes have been good, but some of the professors do not understand that their class is not the only one we are taking. I am on the golf team at CSU Bakersfield and I love it. My coach and my team have made my experience 100 times better than it would have been if I was not on a team. I would most definitely recommend my school to a friend."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about CSUB is that there are always fun activities being held to get students more involved on campus. The staff is friendly and because I am part of the honors program, there is a special lounge that I can study in during library hours, which is a big help. I also love the spirit weeks we have, ESPECIALLY the days where they bring in therapy dogs so students can de-stress."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the price of tuition, and everyone was very friendly and nice. The professors were a mixed bag, but everything was good overall."
Freshman,5,"What I like about CSUB is the environment of the campus. Being a first generation college student, I was pretty scared from the transition between high school to college, but when I arrived, there was nothing but greetings and smiles. This was the first step to me becoming more comfortable with the campus and with my surroundings. My first academic year is ending and I have to say that I have had a blast being at CSUB, I have found the love of my life and thats thanks to CSUB."
Freshman,5,I love the faculty and the professors. Every professor is available to help at any time even outside office hours. The career center is very helpful and they are set in enduring every student have an opportunity at a career or internship.
Senior,5,I have loved coming to CSUB. The professors for the most part are caring and want you to succeed. It is a small school and feels that way. The Student Recreation Center is amazing and is included with tuition.
Senior,5,I love how the school actually cares about their students. I am enrolled in the CAFS program and all the staff and the teachers are wonderful and they are dedicated 100% to their students. It amazes me to see just how many wonderful instructors we have and how our counselors are so great!
Junior,5,Great University and staff. Really enjoyed my experiences and felt that I developed professionally over my years.
Junior,5,"Amazing and beautiful campus, wide variety of classes, great food and awesome student recreation center with MANY types of activities throughout the semester."
Niche User,5,What I like about this college is that they have lots of majors to choose from they also have a good engineer program. They also have lots of extra-curricular activities that help you learn new skills.
Senior,5,This is a great school to go to. The teachers could be a little better but they do help you find a job for after you finish school and that is very important I believe.
Junior,5,The professors are so dedicated and passionate in helping students succeed in the futures. The best part about going to California State University of Bakersfield was the student recreation center.
Freshman,5,This school is great for those who like a small school but still want the university experience. I live just 30 minutes away from campus and love that i'm still able to live at home while go to a university to get my degree. There was no need for me to worry about the cost of living somewhere else just so i can attend a different university when everything I need is offered at California State University Bakersfield. GO ROADRUNNERS!!!
Junior,5,Most of the professors at CSUB have Ph.D. which is really good. Overall it is a nine University to go to and get masters.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about California State University, Bakersfield is that it is a medium sized school that I was able to find my way around easily. I enjoy what CSUB offers students and I like how we are always in the loop with what changes/updates are going to happen and we are free to give our opinions."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the proximity of California State University of Bakersfield to my home and being close to Edward's as well.
Alum,5,"Best decision I ever made. I make well over 200,000 dollars a year as a result of the excellent education I received at CSUB. 

The Teaching staff is great, dorms are convenient and nice new library is stunning. The ratio of diverse students is amazing. The soccer team was from England, Swim team from Slovakian area, women's tennis from Sweden. 

Amazing group of students and teachers very well rounded and bets kept secret / you are a person there not a number."
Freshman,5,"My experience at CSUB has been wonderful thus far. Any help that is needed can be found on campus. For example, if you're looking for someone to look over your assignment to check for errors. There's a student resource center that'll make you feel welcomed and offer lots help when needed. The help does not need to be school related you can get help on campus even if it's personal matters that you can not solve on your own."
Niche User,5,"Overall this University is a quiet and lovely place. It's campus is nestled in a small, yet busy, city and near local shopping. Great campus, great teachers and great people!"
Graduate Student,5,I love that it is somewhat of a smaller campus because its easier to get around. I also like the tranquility of the campus and how everyone is just out doing their own thing.
Senior,5,"The campus is beautiful and the staff is very caring of their students.  The students are dedicated to their studies as well as bettering the campus, we have monthly campus cleanups.  The teachers are dedicated to teaching and bettering their students, the classes are small and you are able to connect with the professors and better your education."
Freshman,5,My experience at CSUB has been amazing. The staff is very helpful and the professors are always willing to help you understand the material. Housing staff are always informative and are willing to help send direct us if we need help paying our remaining balance without falling behind. Campus police is always available and are willing to walk with you to your car to make sure you are safe.
Graduate Student,5,"CSU Bakersfield has offered me the privilege of earning my degree, and it is my desire to pursue a graduate degree on the same campus. CSU Bakersfield values diversity and inclusivity and the efforts of the student body reflect that."
Junior,5,This university is awesome! Everyone on campus is super friendly and the staff truly cares about the students. Campus is always clean and there are lots of opportunities to join clubs and meet new people. Great atmosphere.
Freshman,5,Overall i think Bakersfield is an excellent college. I feel like my safety and education really matters there.
Junior,5,"CSUB is a great place to further your education! The advisors here are amazing. They help guide you through your college years, it’s a great school to attend."
Junior,5,"amazing school. staff is very helpful. I'm freshly disabled with spinal cancer, and was informed that theres a disability help office for students like my self, who need and extra hand not only in school, but life as a whole."
Sophomore,5,"I love many things about my school and I’m proud to say I’m a runner but a few things really have made my experience great. The things that stands out to me right away is all of the great teachers and staff, you’d think that a small university wouldn’t have as many diverse professors but CSUB does. Every single one of my professors has been more than helpful, and has been so invested in helped their students. The teacher to student ratio is about 1:30 and that really matters, having a smaller classroom size allows the teachers to become more personal with their students and give one on one help. Another thing I love about CSUB are the amenities. The school gym is fully equipt and easy enough to get a good session in between classes. The student union is planning to expand and make for more available options for students and that is all because the students spoke up and voted on that. I think it’s amazing that we the students have a voice in the school and the community!"
Junior,5,"Overall, California State University has been a great school. I've gotten the opportunity to be myself and challenge myself in every way possible. CSUB is quite a small campus, but it's full of great people. The professors that I've had have all been great. California State University, Bakersfield is very diverse with many different type of people. I was definitely able to fit in. There are a variety of different clubs and organizations to be part of. CSUB is located near plenty of shopping centers and cafes where students are able to study or share some company with friends. This University is everything I've expected and even more."
Freshman,5,California State University of Bakersfield is a very resourceful and helpful place that has made my college experience an easy one. The professors are great and class sizes are not very big. The only thing I would change is the parking permit prices.
Junior,4,I did not get to experience Cal State Bakersfield before it went completely online but I do enjoy the online learning experience. I am still learning even though it is online.
Junior,4,"There is a lot of help if you talk to the people around you.  Usually any one person can point you in the right direction for the help you need.  Most students are welcoming and offer help.  The only details about this school I have had a bad experience with is the inefficient bureaucratic system that slows down paperwork/admissions, tuition was not lowered for the online only fall 2020 term, parking is expensive and a nightmare, and there are only a few classes for concentration courses. Other than that, getting through the school is easier if you just network a little bit."
Sophomore,4,The online experience is new for me and honestly the school made it pretty easy to stay in touch with the professors. Although it wasn't the same as physically being in the class I still managed to learn.
Junior,4,"Overall, CSUB is a great university. I have had great experiences with the faculty and with the students. CSUB is very accommodating to certain needs and is able to efficiently switch modes of teaching to accompany certain learning styles. The professors are very involved with their students and do their best to help their students succeed. The student life is accommodating to all differently people and it is easy to find and interact with people who share the same interests. The campus is safe and clean. The classroom setting is small in order for students to receive the best learning experience and maximize learning outcomes."
Junior,4,"I love that it’s close to home. I love the services they offer one that I utilize the most is the food pantry, it has really helped my family out. I am not as involved in the social aspect of the university, not that I don’t want to. My timing is off, I was a transfer during spring, and I just had a baby. I have a 6 year old at home too."
Sophomore,4,The transition to online learning was smooth. I was able to finish all my remaining classes for the past semester with very few struggles.
Graduate Student,4,Great professors and colleagues!  I would love for more hands-on courses but I believe that to be a lacking quality in most universities.  Everybody was so helpful there.
Freshman,4,"Csub is a good school to me, mostly because i can afford it.  business school is good. It's average, but not highly ranked or anything. You can get a decent education at a good price."
Junior,4,California State University Bakersfield is an excellent university.  I feel like the only problem is the amount of classes offered for a specific course. CSUB should open more classes for students in order for them to graduate on time. Besides that CSUB is an extraordinary university.
Sophomore,4,I love the environment. Everyone is really helpful and willing to see you succeed. I do feel that the academic advisers need to be more precise with their recommendations on courses.
Senior,4,"Overall I have liked my experience attending California State University, Bakersfield. It is pretty hard to make new friends there but that is not a problem of the university. Some of the professors are boring and some are strict but that happens in every college/university."
Sophomore,4,"I like how friendly most of the staff is and there are resources to help students, like tutoring, financial aid, etc and I love the food options on campus. I would like to see the tutors not be older students, but qualified teachers, and also less politics."
Alum,4,I felt supported by my professors and that the faculty was more than willing to help ensure my academic success.
Freshman,4,What I liked about CSUB was the fact that it was so close to me as well as it being in my hometown Bakersfield. It's a great school that's only expanding even more throughout the years. As well as the food being pretty good the campus looks very clean the students there at the school are all pretty nice to be around. The teachers are pretty helpful to me and it's just an overall great experience. As well as the classes being pretty easy to go to you don't really get lost as much. Probably due to the fact the school is not as big as like a UC. The only thing that I would like to see change is to make the college even more bigger than it is right now. I do like bigger colleges that's mostly why I didn't want to go to BC. But if this college gets even bigger than it is now then that would be pretty cool. Don't really know what they should add to it but they should just make the campus more bigger than it is now.
Freshman,4,"I am still a student for CSUB but, I have enjoyed studying at CSUB because the professors provide so much support for us that we have to take that chance and ask for any help we have. There are so many people from different countries and places that we have a very good chance to meet new friends and know the place more. There is housing and I did enjoyed living in the dorms because I met new people and the other residents were very nice."
Niche User,4,I will be attending the college in the Fall of 2019. Based on my experiences so far in the college when i went to visit. It was very welcoming and felt like I was already part of the college. Right when I walked in the atmosphere was really cheerful and I was very happy that i'm able to attend such a wonderful College.
Niche User,4,"CSUB is a great school for and is very convenient for students who live in close by cities like Lamont and Arvin. It provides very good programs and it varies on its majors, although I think that diversity is a  bit low. Personally, I would like to attend a school with a variety of cultures, but other than that, it is a great and safe school. My brother is attending the school currently and he has not complained much in his four years attending. The party scene is not so big either, and there is not much campus life. The time that I spent there, it really just seemed calm and everyone was just minding their own, trying to get to their next class. The campus is not glamorous or anything out of the ordinary. It is a very simple campus, but it is very clean and calm for its location."
Freshman,4,"The only bad experience I have had here is parking. Finding a parking spot is worse during traffic hour. If you don't have the right of way, then you will most likely be there for a good ten minutes. Other than that, my experience here has been wonderful."
Junior,4,"I'm enjoying my first semester at CSUB. It's a little difficult at times, but I am one step closer to my goal in getting my bachelors degree. I just picked my classes for Fall and will be considered a full-time student because I'm taking 12 units."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved the professors and the classes I took. However, I wish it would increase it's attention on student life and include more activities so the students feel more connected to their university."
Senior,4,"I was a student-athlete here who was involved in extracurricular activities and was always seen interacting with everyone on campus. This school has brought me friends that I will never forget, and has given me opportunities and memories that I would not trade for any amount of money. From the basketball court to the classroom CSUB has shown me how to find my confidence, and use my talents in the most effective ways possible."
Freshman,4,"CSUB is a nice, cheap university with many different majors and opportunities. The professors know the struggle with student life and try to work with you."
Freshman,4,Overall my experience at California State University Bakersfield has been pleasant. The school gives access to late library hours for students needing a quiet area to focus on their academics as well as provides other helpful sources that can be fundamental for students.
Junior,4,I attend the AV campus in Lancaster. The campus is just right. It might be small but it works. Seems to be just enough classrooms. The faculty members are very nice and helpful. The campus is always clean. The room are usually set up nice and clean. The students and professors seem to be very nice. The dean is available most of the time and takes the time out to connect with students and make sure things are going well and work out overall. The majors offered are sufficient.  The counselors are decent and are there to help whenever you need it.
Sophomore,4,I’m currently a sophomore at CSUB as a nursing major. The campus is quite nice and it is easy to find where the classes are. I just wish there were more stuff to do on campus where I can be more involved.
Sophomore,4,It was a good start.  I loved the small class rooms and the campus had good parking.  The professors where a treat!  Lots of opportunity to get mentorship especially in the psychology department.   Is a commuter school so student life is a bit dull but overall its a great university to come and focus on your studies and immerse yourself in the learning.
Sophomore,4,The people at CSUB are very helpful and motivated. The professors care and help. The school prepares you for degree or transfer
Graduate Student,4,It is a great school with a wonderful campus and professors. The only bummer I found was the lack of community because it is such a commuter school.
Junior,4,"The education and classes offered at CSUB-AV is impressive. Although the satellite campus only offers a few majors, it is a great campus and really focuses and works with the students in getting a BA degree. Teacher credentials are available as well which a big demand in Antelope Valley."
Sophomore,4,California state university is a great diverse university that has amazing professors to teach various subjects. I have been here for about a year now and I have enjoyed the people I have met. It is really great to see how much this school is improving everyday.
Sophomore,4,"California State University is one of the least expensive Cal States that exist. I am proud to say that I can receive my education as I would at other Cal States and Universities at a cheaper expense. I am currently a sophomore and I have lived in the dorms my freshman year. Living in a college dorm has given me the experience of living with strangers and growing as a person. The staff members could be more understanding when it comes to cost, but overall it is a great experience."
Junior,4,"The best part about CSUB is the academics because most of the professors in this campus are really passionate about their subjects and are really there to lend out a hand to students. Another great aspect about CSUB are the students in terms of being extremely friendly and always helping one another whenever another is struggling. Because most of the students who attend CSUB live near, there is not much life in the school, and there are very few clubs that students can join in on."
Junior,4,"So far I have enjoyed the atmosphere at CSUB. It is close to home and has many trees, giving it a beautiful scenery. The professors are also very helpful and understanding. If you don't care too much about he party college life, CSUB is for you. Very peaceful."
Alum,4,"I love CSUB. I think it is such an underrated university, and it is so beautiful and green. The faculty in my department were always so encouraging and helpful, not to mention, intelligent and incredibly knowledgeable about their academic discipline. The facilities are not what you would perhaps find in other more prestigious universities, and I wish CSUB had postgraduate studies available, but as a Bakersfield native, I saved a lot of money going here! I feel very confident about the education I received and I feel great about my degree."
Junior,4,"Good school with decent classes and tuition. Campus life is a bit average, but there are things to get involved in. Class sizes are decent, and professors are great."
Freshman,4,It has been a good experience with regards to professors and other students. Although miss information from the offices do tend to disrupt the flow of a new students' schedule.
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed the professors that I have met through out my experience at CSUB.  They are all extremely helpful and educated.  However, I do not appreciate that the financial aid office has students working rather than adults.  Sometimes they are not qualified to answer certain questions and it makes solving a problem more difficult than need be."
Junior,4,Cal State offers many opportunities to get involved in the school. They also offer help to students who seek it.
Niche User,4,The atmosphere is amazing. You have to remember it's in the middle of no where basically just a lot of farm land. It can get really  hot or cold depending on the time of day.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is fairly small so it is easy to navigate around. There are also a lot of extra curricular activities to partake in and classes are pretty simple to get in to. My one recommendation would be to make professors more available during office hours. I've only had one or two experiences with professors not being available during designated times but it was only a slight inconvenience during the time. Overall, I love this school and I plan on staying all 4 years."
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed the class sizes, ability to communicate with my peers and professors, and social experience."
Senior,4,"Throughout my four years at CSUB, all of my professors have provided an amazing education experience."
Senior,4,"My experience at Cal State Bakersfield has been pretty good so far. The environment is a good place and there is a lot offered on campus to get involved. The only bad part is the food, there is not much you can just grab quickly and eat on the go. There is a few places on campus but in my opinion they are pretty pricey. There is one food truck but it is on the other side of the campus and not easily accessible. Professors are pretty nice and understanding from my own experience and from what i have heard from other students. I am glad i stayed in town because Cal State Bakersfield has been a good experience for me."
Niche User,4,I have graduated CSUB with a bachelors degree in Psychology and I returned to achieve a bachelors in Nursing. I have noticed that Professors want students to learn and do their best.  They are open to questions and always open for students to come to for help. Very warm atmosphere. Students always helping other students.
Junior,4,I like all the help Cal State Bakersfield has to offer as long you are willing to seek it. I don't like how so much of the staff does not understand that students have jobs and other responsibilities that they cant assign certain activities outside of class.
Graduate Student,4,I have taken a class at CSUB and the environment is a beautiful place to be. The people there are so nice that they helped me find what building to go to.
Sophomore,4,"The CSUB campus is not huge so it is very easy to get around and very hard to get lost. The campus has many features such as; the SRC, where many activities are always taking place, and the library, where many students come together to study in groups or study alone in a quiet environment. Professors are great in updating blackboard with announcements and assignments for students."
Senior,4,"Overall CSUB is a great school to attend if you're interested on a peace and quite setting. Though I've had a stressful situation, I wasn't able to graduate on fall 2017 because I missed it by .6 of a unit which I was notified two days before their spring semester started and no I have to enroll and still pay for some of my tuition fee which is absurd because its their job to notify students on time to be prepared."
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere of the campus and its people. The only thing I would probably comment on fixing is advisor schedules. I lost a semester because I was not a freshman and they couldn't see me till after the date that we couldn't add anymore classes.
Senior,4,"It's a studious place and everyone seems to know what they want to do and how to get there. And if you don't, any of the teachers are pretty willing to talk to you about it and help you out. There's a good variety of teachers and students alike, and once you have a major you'll get to know your classmates fairly quickly. CSUB isn't really a party school, but it's fun in its own right."
Freshman,4,"I was afraid that I wouldn't fit in my first semester but I was glad to make new friends, have a good relationship with my professors and achieve a great ending for the semester. I really like that everyone gets along here and no one feels left out. I would like to see more people socializing with one another because it's important to talk to each other, even as strangers. We're all on the same path and we all share the same goals in life and I'm sure we can relate on many levels if we simply TALK to one another. Overall, my experience here at CSU Bakersfield is great and I'm glad I made the right choice to stay."
Freshman,4,California state university tries very hard to interact with there students. They have many activities and events on campus to keep everyone interested and interested. It would be great if there was more  announcements about these events.
Alum,4,I loved the History department. Top notch professors and yet really push you in the area of writing.
Junior,4,"After completing my first semester at California State University Bakersfield, I have found myself very happy with my choice in college. I have had a great experience in the short time i have been here, not only with my education, but with the overall environment that comes with being a student here.  The professors are generous with their time, patience, and commitment to every student's education. The smaller campus and student to faculty ratio is appealing as well as being in the heart of California. Only two hours from the beach and two and a half hours from the glorious Sequoia National Forest, Bakersfield has been a great experience and I am happy to have came here."
Niche User,4,California State University Bakersfild is a great school everybody treats everyone like a family member.
Freshman,4,"My experience at the California State University of Bakersfield has been great. This school tries to help every student, for example, I was not eligible to go to CSUB but there was a program that I had to go for two weeks and it was called EOP. EOP stands for Educational Opportunity Program and if it was not for this program I would not be going to CSUB. This program was like going to college for two weeks. We had to move in and we had a class schedule from 8:00 to 2:00 and in between classes we had breaks and lunch. CSUB has tutoring available for every student that needs it, and the best part of it is that its free. Another great thing about CSUB is the professors, the professor put in a lot of effort in teaching their students, they also enjoy helping students on a individual level. I love CSUB and I'm happy I got accepted to be a roadrunner. One thing I would change about CSUB is they should put more benches for students to sit."
Niche User,4,It is a nice warming school. Faculty and students respect one another. It is underrated on the university system. You will get a great education there.
Freshman,4,"Cal state University of Bakersfield is home to the rowdy roadrunners. This college offers a great education along with a scenic campus in the heart of a great area in Bakersfield. It was currently ranked as the best college for the bang of your buck. In turn saveing more money for the struggling college experience. If you want a inexpensive education that will set you up for success, Cal state University of Bakersfield is your school."
Senior,4,"The new Computer and Electrical Engineering program that is offered at CSUB is fantastic.  The material is extremely difficult, but the professors know the material well, and many have been involved in the industry working for wireless communication giants.  As far as the academics goes for the maths and sciences at the university, it is ahead of the competition.

I feel that faculty at admissions, financial aid, and academic counseling services leaves much wanted, however.  I have yet to have a reasonable and logical conversation or solution to any problem I have brought to their attention over the last four years--and I have heard about people not receiving their diplomas until months after graduation due to clerical errors."
Freshman,4,I love the environment its very nice and it will be my first year here at Cal State Bakersfield. So far I like it here I've heard there is so many opportunities here. I am taking classes in the summer and I love the campus.
Senior,2,They overcharge for everything or want you to pay to have extra services that we do not have access to.
Sophomore,2,"Horrible at communication, the administration never respond to emails, are extremely hard to reach by phone etc. The location is in the worst, most boring overgrown suburb of a city in the US. There’s nothing to do on or off campus. There’s no art scene, there’s no music club yet there are a handful of religious ones. Super boring, super unprofessional and subpar education"
Freshman,2,"This school has horrible dorms with no supervision at all and if you want to go to this school as someone in the dorms I would highly advice against it, the dorms themselves are cheaply made and caused multiple issues like the hot water being out for two weeks straight with no real solution or apology, the cafeteria food is horrible where I know someone who received a raw chicken sandwich because the younger staff they hire aren't good at their jobs and don't care. The residents were and issue personally mainly because the RAs never did anything to stop them from being disruptive and let them break campus rules by their being multiple rooms who smoked weed and it causing the whole floor to smell like weed and the RAs never stopped it cause it happened throughout the entire semester and the one week we had quiet hours people still were playing loud music and messing around in the halls without intervention."
Senior,2,The school does not provide enough internships for their students. Students have to search for internships outside the college. The school does not provide opportunities for students.
Junior,2,"I didn't like it so much, i feel the school doesn't have so much to offer, no research position or pre-health advising offered"
College Freshman,2,"Academically it has not challenged me, and socially it does not give me the college feel."
College Freshman,2,"you only have a few options like the Runner Cafe, Rowdy's, Peet's, Togo's, and Walter Stiern Library food section. The food in the Runner Cafe is always the same. I'm getting tired of their menu. I wish they serve different food from different ethnicity every week or at least have Panda Express, Chipotle, Subway, etc. on campus."
College Freshman,2,You can only turn up in your dorm if you're 21 or older. if you're not 21 it sucks.
College Sophomore,2,You never hear about them.
College Sophomore,2,If we do have a lot of parties then people never talk about them.
College Sophomore,2,It is so difficult to work with our financial aid office
College Sophomore,2,I find our greek life to be rude and irritating.
College Senior,2,"Sports are not advertised enough, events are never mentioned"
College Freshman,2,"we don't have any real fraternities, they just meet every so often and talk. no parties on campus either. high school in this town is more intense"
College Sophomore,2,Getting into the nursing program is extremely hard and great grades have to be earned
College Sophomore,2,nothing to do if you're underage unless you know friends who have parties
College Senior,2,There are only a few places to eat at school so that leaves very little variety.
College Senior,2,"Living in Bakersfield, California it gets very cold in the winter and extremely hot in the spring/summer. It is hard to be on campus in the winter because it's cold outside as well as inside the classes. In the hotter times, it is more bearable."
College Senior,2,The athletics at my school aren't highly emphasized. I would have more involvement if I knew about what was going on in athletics. School games are not well announced and not enough school spirit is shown.
College Sophomore,2,"I have received very little financial aid since my dad makes enough on paper. However, his debt takes up most of his bills. So my tip for others is to make sure to participate in community service and.....don't be white."
College Sophomore,2,Its Bakersfield. Come on now.
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares for the sports team on campus. There is basketball and soccer, but come on we don't even have a football team. I believe our college needs a football team. "
College Senior,2,It gets quite hot and sticky in the summer.
College Junior,2,Greek life in California State University of Bakersfield is somewhat a big deal. Personally i don't belong to one but i do hear Fraternities and Sororities events going on in my campus. I been to one party and its fun. Earning a C is because it gives a vibe like a regular club.
College Senior,2,"Spending the summer in Bakersfield is downright ridiculous.  Temperatures can soar past 110 degrees F.   However, the fall quarter starts in mid-September.   By that time, the temperatures start to lower from the mid-80's to the mid-90's.   Compared to the scorching summer, it feels like a walk on the beach.   Winter can get cold, but it only ever snows once every decade or so.   Spring is, by far, the best season.   The campus, city, and surrounding mountain ranges (20 miles away) are just magnificently beautiful during spring.  Be sure to absorb it all in; you won't be seeing it again for another 9 months."
College Senior,2,"At CSUB, you'll need either a car of a bus pass to experience any sort of adventure.   It's a fair walking distance from anything that could constitute as a nightlife.   Most of the popular clubs are either downtown or in the Rosedale area (10-15 minute drives in either direction).   There are a few pizza/wing/grub places around the campus.   Just-Wing-It is within walking distance and would be the closest thing to a ""bar.""  But you really need to have a car (or befriend someone with a car) to experience the nightlife in Bakersfield."
College Sophomore,2,the food is expensive and their hours dont always fit peoples late school hour schedules
College Junior,2,"This will be my first quarter at the school, so I haven't got a feel for it yet."
College Sophomore,2,"Not really around the Greek life to speak for it, to me it's not really a big deal."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm receiving a little amount of financial aid, and the amount that I'm getting I believe would only cover one class. I would really be satisfy if I had gotten more than what I'm getting so that way I could take plenty of classes and graduate the year that I'm attending to graduate."
College Freshman,2,"Well, if you look for what you want I'm pretty sure you will find it. However, if you don't well opportunity isn't going to come knocking on your door."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking on campus can be a huge nightmare, but it depends on the time also. Just be sure to arrive on campus about 15-20 minutes before your class begins to make sure you have a good parking spot and have enough time to get to your class on time."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is mostly focused around parties and not necessary around what benefits they could bring to students. If your in a frat or sorority or not its your business and your more then welcome to join a frat party to see how good it might be if you join one.
College Junior,2,"Parking is available, but most of it is far from where classes are held. Finding a closer parking spot is like winning the lottery at times."
College Sophomore,2,It's Okay with people hanging out on campus but there is not much action.
College Junior,2,"there are more african americans and hispanics than there are whites. the diversity is very good in my opinion but asians are rare at CSUB. people bring different opinions around and as students, we get to learn about different cultures and backgrounds"
College Junior,2,There are several fraternities on campus.  They are small.  One in particular has problems with hazing.
College Freshman,2,We don't have a ton of them and the ones we do have tend to be kind of slow.
College Junior,2,"Public transportation (GET bus) is terrible. Dirty, expensive, and takes longer than it would to just walk wherever you're going if it weren't too hot outside to do so. If you have your own car, the traffic around the campus is minimal most of the time."
College Sophomore,2,"Finding an apartment in Bakersfield is quit easy, but sometimes it costs a lot to students who want to find a place closed to school. Transportations are very complicated in Bakersfield, Bus are slow, there's no train... If you don't car In Bakersfield, it's would be very difficult for you to go to different places you want."
College Sophomore,2,Public transportation doesn't give you many options to go places. They normally take long when it's most needed.
College Sophomore,2,"Get Use to It! The weather in the Valley is very emotional. When it is hot then it is HOT and when it is cold, it is FREEZING! In the summer the weather can be very treacherous to out of towners. For the locals who have lived in this region, many have gotten use to the weather to the point where it is bearable to live."
College Senior,2,The only decent campus dining is at the Runner Cafe.
College Sophomore,2,Night Clubs Are Good for Those Who Party – I hear the clubs here are great and fun to go to. The school throws parties and the dorms have their own parties too.
College Sophomore,2,"Its Bakersfield – There are bus options at the school, but its bakersfield... most people drive, there is no parking, and bakersfield is so spread out that unless you live close to campus its a 15-45 min drive depending on where you live."
College Sophomore,2,"Good Teams, No One to Watch – Our athletics for the most part are decent, but no one on campus cares. There is no school spirit and no one shows up to the games. Boys basketball and boys soccer are our most highlighted sports teams and they are pretty good, but everything else is just unheard of and never attended."
College Freshman,2,"Process Could Have Been Easier – I received financial aid that only covered my tuition and not housing. Therefore, I had to come out of pocket about two thousand dollars. Everything was done online, yet, their email was never working so whatever sent online was never received. I suggest in-person or through mail more often to make sure it is received or delivered efficiently."
College Student,2,Not Many Dorms – There are not many dorms on campus. Most people live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Needs Improvement – You need to be on campus before class starts to get good parking. When you're right on time finding parking can be a pain. Sometimes it feels like theres no parking, expect in the back and furtherest place possible."
College Freshman,2,parking is a big issue in campus because many students take a long spot to find an available parking spot and there is not many big parking lots.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Updated – I did not live on campus, but I have been inside the dorms. They are very outdated and extremely small."
College Junior,2,"Academic and Social Life – well since there isnt really a college social life, the scholing as no effects on the social scene. most of the kids who attend the school dont hang out outside of school. everything is really seperated and everyone has their own clicks outside of school. i would say the only way school affect the students social life is if they get to much homework on weekend to actually enjoy the social part of their weekend"
College Junior,2,Guys and Girls Looks – The guys and girls that attend Cal State Bakersfield are more into school than the whole social scene. The school is not very big and really doesnt have a college feele to it. The guys and girls just look at it as a big community college for people from bakerfield. There are a lot of nerds and smart kids that attend the school. the sororitys and fraternitys are a joke. no one is even in them and they dont have parties or even have a single house where they all live at. so there is not really a college atmosphere.
College Freshman,2,"Stictness Is Average – I feel like our campus is a great community as a whole. I feel that there is no need for the police force. I see them around all the time though, they do a good job of patrolling the whole campus."
College Freshman,2,"No Clubs for 18 and Older – Our night out is going out to movies, out to eat, or out for hookah. To me, those activities are not entertaining. There are all of house parties and they do get crazy. But, it is always better to stay away from that."
College Freshman,2,"My High School Had a Better Hot Girl Ratio – It's like whatever. There are a lot of girls but they are not that girls hot. I am more into Caucasians,and their not that many Caucasians at my college."
College Senior,2,I would consider Bakersfield to be a cheap place to live in all definitions of the word. This is not that great of a place and the infrastructure is not set up to sustain people who want a good quality of life that is affordable.
College Junior,2,Not Much to Do – Bakersfield is a fairly large town with not very much to do. There is hardly any life in the town only if there are people to put the life in it. Living in this town is tolerable but people would rather much live somewhere else.
College Sophomore,2,"It is a good school, and the community really does not treat people like outsiders.  However, you if dont play a sport or are in the music department you are pretty much a unknown."
College Sophomore,2,"Rent a Room – My best advise is if you happen to know some one or even if not rent a room, it is usually cheaper and you get all the benefits of having something better and cheaper than dorms."
Sophomore,1,"As expected, very lazy , professors don’t teach anything, just send slideshows or YouTube videos. You basically teach yourself, and then take multiple choice online quizzes that are very poorly made"
Graduate Student,1,"CSUB-AV is a mediocre campus at best. The instructors, the office staff, and leadership perpetuate student struggles that make higher education inaccessible. The Financial Aid Office is unresponsive and provides conflicting misinformation while remedial/archaic content is taught by disinterested professors. If you have no other choice but to attend CSUB, prepare to be given the run around. Attending this school has caused so much undue emotional stress, I question if the credential is worthwhile."
College Sophomore,1,"Outside of Bakersfield, CSUB offers very little in terms of an alumni network, job and internship prospects post undergrad, and employers looking to hire. The University degree by itself probably won't impress anyone."
College Freshman,1,i didnt recieve ant type of financial aid. i would like to get some tyoe of help from finacial aid
College Freshman,1,"They only pick on the people they don't like, be cool with them and they'll be easy on you."
College Freshman,1,The food is terrible and there is no good options to eat.
College Senior,1,I hardly receive any benefits and the process is horrific.  Best advice is to handle the process as quickly as possible and to do well in your classes in order to receive a higher reward amount.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing good and there is no late night options besides for McDonald's which I don't eat.
College Freshman,1,"100 degrees for weeks at a time. the other seasons are nice though, usually 70 degrees mabey colder"
College Sophomore,1,my school and town dont have many parties or much to do.  I dont mind because i dont like partying.
College Senior,1,Not many students are around at the school at night. It is very quiet and dark.
College Sophomore,1,Its BAKERSFIELD. Come on now.
College Sophomore,1,Not the best. the players are not that good but its not their .
College Senior,1,"Being that our school is small for a CSU, our nightlife doesnt exist. If your looking for nightlife, it would have to be off campus. Depending on what day of the week, certain events are held throughout the night."
College Sophomore,1,"Make sure you get there before 10 a.m. and keep watch for pedestrians, hot-shot motorcyclists, and terrible drivers otherwise; parking fills up very quickly on campus."
College Junior,1,"Summer in Bakersfield is horrible! It gets up to 110, so when students come back in the fall, it is still in the 100's. The winter is not that bad. The only thing to worry about is the end of spring, the whole summer, and the beginning of fall."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is not a major social thing at Cal State Bakersfield. Yes, there are many people who are part of the greek life but even if you decide not to be, they will still be your friend and invite you out to the few parties that they do throw. I feel as if the sports teams throw way more parties than the greeks."
College Junior,1,"Parking can be horrible, especially for the students who like to show up right before class. The most horrible times to find parking would have to be from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. just because that is the time that campus is the most busiest. I would suggest getting classes in the evening or early in the morning just to avoid parking problems."
College Freshman,1,We have a lab in my English class but the printer doesn't work so we have to print at home.
College Freshman,1,"Although I do not have first hand experience with parking, I know for a fact that parking at CSUB is an absolute nightmare. Not only are the parking lots far from classes, but it is nearly impossible to find an available parking space when you need it."

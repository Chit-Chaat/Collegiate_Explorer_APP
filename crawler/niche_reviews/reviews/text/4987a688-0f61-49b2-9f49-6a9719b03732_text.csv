If I could change something it would be improving Blackboard, which is the website students use to complete most of their work."

Freshman,5,The campus is fairly large but once you learn your way everything just seems like a couple steps away.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the atmosphere and sense of community.  It's a smaller sized school (so very few huge lecture halls) with big school resources and opportunities.  The professors and faculty are great, the amount of green space on campus is incredible and both the local Edwardsville community and city of St. Louis (which is only 20 minutes away) are all reasons why I loved going to school here.  It's also extremely safe!"
Sophomore,5,"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville is in the perfect location, with being only 30 minutes from St.Louis, Missouri and surrounding be the ideal town. The students are very friendly, and the teachers are very accommodating. The campus is a little spread out, but it is the perfect scenery, you can find deer wandering around the school at any time of the day. The nightlife is quiet on the weekdays."
Sophomore,5,"There is a big school and small community feeling. The professors and administration really do care about your success and they try their best to help you achieve success. One thing that I do wanna see changed is the administration being on the same page in regards to which department is responsible for what information. Other than that, it is a wonderful university."
Alum,5,"SIUE is a great value. They offer lots of scholarships & have gold-standard accreditation for engineering (ABET), business (AACSB), nursing (CCNE), etc. The campus is only about 20 minutes from downtown St. Louis where there's lots of stuff to do. The Edwardsville area is upper-middle-class and there's a Walmart, Target, Best Buy, clothing stores, bars, shopping centers and restaurants nearby.  The local bars on main street are usually busy on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays with college students."
Sophomore,5,I chose to be at this school while I was still living in Germany. I was set on this school and am quite content I picked it and was accepted. Highly recommend this college.
Freshman,5,The people at SIU-Edwardsville are all very kind. They are always striving to make people feel welcome as soon as they step foot onto campus. That is the type of community I wanted to be apart of which helped me make my final decision to attend SIUE in the fall of 2019.
Freshman,5,Everyone gets along with everyone.  The professors care that you learn and go the extra step to make that happen.  This includes the academic advisors that have been with me every step assuring I am taking the proper classes and staying on track.
Alum,5,The teachers and staff a SIUE were very caring and understanding.  Most were always willing to work with students.  I had professors who would take extra time to ensure that every student was successful in their program.  You could tell that they were invested in their job and in their student.  I was able to obtain a full time teaching job right out of college.
Alum,5,Beautiful campus. Friendly students and professors. Welcoming to students of all ages and backgrounds.
Freshman,5,"Since I am a freshman, I have only experienced a little of what this school has to offer. The campus is beautiful during the summer and winter and has deer that like to roam. The students are all friendly and so is the staff. The distance between classes is not bad if you have classes in the main buildings. The food options is somewhat limited but it has fast food chains like Chic fil a, Pizza Hut, Auntie Anne's, and Starbucks. There are always activities going on in the main building along with billiards and bowling. I have enjoyed my time at this school very much and I am glad I made the decision to attend this University."
Sophomore,5,"I love SIUE! The campus is not only one of the largest in the country but also one of the prettiest. Instead of being part of a town, it's secluded from it. It's also only a five minute drive to the local town from the center of campus! It has been ranked one of the safest schools in the country as well! The professors are almost all encouraging and the students all seem happy. I think the parking price needs to be changed, but it's about the only downfall of the school!"
Niche User,5,"I met students who attended SIUE and gave me a tour of the class rooms, dorms, after school activities basically the whole campus and let me know how college works, the financials statements, keeping organize, time management, study works, and having time for your self. I even met professor at SIUE and he he gave me basically a whole break down on how to make it in college and just being there seeing how the students and professors were willing to converse with me about things like that made me feel welcomed and loved"

Sophomore,5,Nothing i love the place as a whole after my first year there. Nice places to eat and a gym to work out at.
Niche User,5,SIUE is a wonderful place to earn your bachelor degree. It is a safe environment with lots of parking. The professors are experienced and knowledgeable. My four years went by quick with ease.
Sophomore,5,This college helps you succeed. What i like most about this college is that if you are feeling behind they have so many resolutions help you soar.
Senior,5,"The school is very beautiful and inviting. You feel safe all over campus no matter the time. The faculty is very friendly. They take the time to get to know you and help you the best way they can. The courses are very informative and each class I've taken has help me grow as an individual/student. I've made many friends here and through joining organizations I have been given many opportunities to better myself. The university housing is also great, living on campus(especially as a freshmen) is the best way to meet new people. Southern University is like a second home, the campus, faculty, students and more will prepare you for the future/workforce."
Alum,5,"I received my Bachelors degree at SIUE and loved it! All of my professors were very professional and supportive. The classes were hard, but  the material was taught effectively. We lived in family housing on campus. There was a free after school program so parents could attend class or study. Living in a place surrounded by others reaching for similar goals was amazing."
Sophomore,5,"I recently transferred here, and I don't regret my decision. Everyone has been very kind, and the classes are better than my previous university."
Graduate Student,4,My online experience with SIUE has been been very smooth and well administered. SIUE has taken great measures to ensure quality education and excellent response to COVID-19.
Graduate Student,4,My overall experience with SIUE has been a positive one. This school not only provides a great place to learn but adheres to a high standard of equality for all students.
Sophomore,4,SIUE was a great school to attend. Everyone knows you have to be well prepared without distractions to go to a university especially when attending after 45 years of age. The teachers were very helpful and willing to do their jobs professionally. Parking was affordable in most areas without a school sticker.
Senior,4,Online learning is a bit hard. Especially now with COVID but every teacher has been accommodating and willing to help the students.
Senior,4,SIUE is a great opportunity to learn and broaden your thought process. I have loved it from the moment I moved here.
Freshman,4,Based on other students that have taken classes that pertain to my major I would say that the professors are really good at their job and helping out students in need.
Freshman,4,"So far I am only enrolled in SIUE and haven't experienced an on-campus semester yet but based on the size of the campus and my alumni sister's experience, I can proudly say that I am confident that my path to success starts at SIUE."
Graduate Student,4,SIUE is a university that creates a diverse and accepting community for all of it's students and creates many opportunities outside of the classroom for students to grow. It has a very small town feel.
Graduate Student,4,"I took two online classes and in both classes, the professors made the course requirements clear and kept constant communication with the students about assignments and requirements."
Freshman,4,The online experience was actually not too bad. The professors offered various videos and lectures to help us stay engaged.
Senior,4,I liked that they offered online classes and it seemed to be more personable with small classes. Some instructors did not give very good instructions on how to complete assignments.
Alum,4,"I graduated from SIUE in 2014 with a bachelor’s in business administration. Overall I think my degree has good ROI and has opened up doors for me professionally. I’m not originally from the St. Louis area, but I am still working here 6 years after graduation. The campus provides a traditional college experience and most of my friends lived on campus. The campus is also very scenic with plenty of walking trails."
Junior,4,They really care about their students. They offer multiple opportunities for us to network with companies to earn internships that could lead to potential jobs.
Alum,4,I loved being an SIUE student. There’s so many clubs and organizations that you can join. The professors I had were amazing.
Sophomore,4,"SIUE is such a safe, clean, and beautiful campus. Everyone will have different opinions about every school but I would never choose another school. At SIUE, every single professor I have had cares about their students. At some colleges, many say their professors do not even know their names, but here even in a lecture with 100 kids, I have had professors learn their students names and get to know them. SIUE is very modern with beautiful buildings, inside and out, they are constantly making improvements, the dorms are super nice, and everyone is very friendly! Edwardsville itself is VERY nice and safe with lots of stores and restaurants. Many college towns are run down or not safe, but Edwardsville is beautiful with many things to do and there are many nice off campus apartments too for students such as Axis and The Reserve."
Senior,4,"Love the engineering program. Professors want you to succeed, and will give you as much help and time as they can."
Sophomore,4,"Love this school. Beautiful campus, many programs, and clubs to join and many resources to aid in studying. So happy I chose to come here, instantly felt like home. I just got accepted into the Nursing Program, excited for the next chapter!"
Junior,4,"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville is a great public college in Illinois to attend. Not only is the price lower than most other universities, but the education is just as good if not better. The professors are dedicated to their work and the university itself is committed to diversity and inclusion. There are so many clubs with various interests that you can join and amazing people to meet. Overall, my experience at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville has shaped me into a different person, a person I am glad to be."
Freshman,4,It was a very nice college. They had plenty of resources for your every day life. You never really have to leave campus. All the teachers there are very nice and helpful.
Senior,4,"The curriculum is challenging enough that you have to work for your grade but not so much that you don’t feel like you can succeed. Most of the professors care and want you to succeed, they’re easily accessible to their students. The campus is beautiful and there’s just enough to do locally (if not, St. Louis isn’t too far away)!"
Freshman,4,Great campus to be on! Edwardsville is a wonderful town with lots to do! Very safe! Lots of activities and helpful professors and faculty
Sophomore,4,"So far, so good! I’ve completed my first year at SIUE. From what it seems, they provides tons of opportunities for success! It’s really up to the students to use them. They are also always doing fun things on campus to get students involved! Good school"
Sophomore,4,Overall my freshmen year was great! Being at SIUE I gained so much knowledge towards my major and had a wonderful experience. I am very much looking forward to the next three years to come!
Senior,4,"On campus, there is a lot of diversity regarding students, staff, and faculty. The campus is fairly large and there is never a dull moment in its popular areas."
Sophomore,4,"There are good programs, but freshman and sophomore year credit amounts are a bit high for people who aren't used to having a challenge. The school site has a lot of outdated information, most things not being updated in over 2 years.  The food gets a bit repetitive after a while, but it's nice to have a lot of on campus options."
Junior,4,"Good state university that offers return on investment. 
I know many people who have also graduated from this school and have given faculty high praise. 
The price of books is also covered in with your tuition which is amazing! 
The only real drawback I've found to this school so far is that the campus was designed for students to be constantly walking. Though this is nice in fair weather the winters in the midwest can be punishing, and the school never ever cancels classes. That makes far walks to the buildings from parking lots awful."
Niche User,4,"I visited SIUe, before my tour I was very undecided about what college I wanted to attend. When I arrive they got directly into the tour, which I appreciated a lot. The campus is very big. The dorm rooms are decently sized. Although, I wished they showed me the other dorm options they have. The food is great! At the end of the day I made my mind that I would b attending the school."
Sophomore,4,"SIUe is an amazing school, but that is not to say it is not without its own problems. To start with the positives, the school is extremely well-maintained and safe. Additionally, most of the instructors and professors care immensely about providing a good education. Most. This is where the issues somewhat arise. I have had instructors who are far better at teaching a class than some of my professors, who rely on what seems to be copy and paste lecture information that I can just as easily find online. This is a small portion of professors, but it is unacceptable to me that a professor can make considerably more due to tenure in comparison to better instructors, when education is what I am paying for. This being said, I realize this is a common issue among many colleges, not just SIUe. Admissions and registration was also a hassle when I started here. This being said, if you are looking for an affordable yet quality education, SIUe is a great place to invest your time."
Freshman,4,"SIUE has a great engineering school and program. It is close to home. I live in Illinois. I am about 45 minutes away from it. so, i can visit my family if i want to. It is very cheap and affordable."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed my time at SIUE for the most part.  The professors and advisors are committed to helping students succeed and meet the needs of the students when possible.  The students are a diverse and friendly group and the area surrounding the school is very peaceful and undisturbed, which really creates a feeling of comfort in your surroundings.  I think SIUE is a great school for students to get life experience and the degree they're seeking."
Junior,4,"Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville has a great campus environment. Not only is it beautiful, but it is also welcoming as many students and staff are willing to help out."
Sophomore,4,"I love the beautiful campus, and friendly staff. The campus offers a ton of ways to get involved, and there are always different events happening throughout the year."
Junior,4,"SIUE is a good school with many clubs organizations and activities to be a part of while having a rather cheap cost compared to other universities. There are some issues with sexual assault and racism that continue to be worked out. However, it's a good environment with good people and connections."
Freshman,4,"SIUE is an enormous and diverse school. You won't want for anything on campus: If you can think of something, they have it. The buildings and facilities are state of the art, and the professors are genuinely awesome people. The class sizes are relatively small for the school, so you feel like you're getting the most out of your experience."
Sophomore,4,"Nice campus with beautiful scenery, good professors and plenty of activities to be a part of. One of the things that could be changed is to update the materials used for class advising."
Sophomore,4,Pretty good school.  I enjoy! The food is also good and the academic life is great. The only thing is they don't have and football team so there's only basketball games. The campus itself is pretty well kept as well as the dorms. The safety around the campus is good too I never felt unsafe before.
Senior,4,What I love about SIUE is how easy it is to get involved! There are lots of clubs to get involved in. I also like the size of the campus....it's not to big or too small.
Senior,4,I really loved that it was very affordable and they offered my major which is Exercise Science. I really loved that upperclassmen had affordable apartments to live in for Fall and Spring semesters. They have very professional professors who are very educated and experienced in the courses they teach at SIUe.
Junior,4,"Edwardsville is a good place to go after high school. Their beautiful campus, along with the caring staff, makes it so much easier to adjust to a four year university."
Alum,4,"The professors I had who were employed permanently by the university were all excellent. There was one visiting professor who was exceptionally bad and, unfortunately, was teaching the capstone course for my major. He is no longer with the university.

The campus is beautiful and very safe and has adequate public transportation available to Edwardsville and St. Louis. Uber and Lyft are also available in Edwardsville.

While athletics seem to comprise a significant portion of the student body, the events don't seem to be a big part of the culture.

SIUE is an excellent school in a great community. I highly recommend it!"
Sophomore,4,Some professors are terrible and make the classes very difficult to succeed to your full potential. Although the class may be challenging students are always willing to work together to help each other out and learn from their mistakes.
Junior,4,"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville provides students with a diverse and inclusive community. It is tight-knit and student-focused, and the professors are knowledgeable in their fields and are passionate when teaching and interacting with students. SIUE's campus is safe, being ranked the 11th Safest College Campus in the nation. Residential life on campus is a great way to stay involved and active in the abundant number of organizations on campus. The city of Edwardsville, IL provides various experiences from local bike paths and trails, to restaurants and shops galore. Only 20 minutes from St. Louis, it is a great way to take a trip across the river. There is never a dull moment on SIUE's campus, whether it be eating a banana split from a canoe or attending a sporting event with the rest of campus. College is what you make it; make your experience worthwhile at SIUE!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed my time at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. I was able to make new friends and a lot of different experiences. The campus is very nice and well kept. The food at the MUC is usually on point. However, during my time at SIUE there were blatant acts of racism on campus, which can make a lot of African Americans, like myself, and other minorities feel uncomfortable, and unsafe on campus."
Alum,4,I graduated from SIUE in the summer of 2014. It was an incredible experience. I graduated from the Geography program there and I am moving on to graduate school this fall in the same field. SIUE and the professors there prepared me well for graduate school.
Senior,4,This college has a wonderful campus which is all connected with nature and there are lots of professors who always try to make you to understand the material.
Freshman,4,"When I first started looking at colleges, Southern Illinois University of Edwardsville was one on my list.  I did what most high school seniors do, took a tour of the college.  When the tour first started, I wasn't sure if I was going to pick SIUE to attend.  As the tour went on, I fell in love with the school.  When the tour was over, I knew that this was the college I wanted to attend.  After applying and being accepted, I attended Spring Board for incoming freshman.  Spring Board made me fall in love with the college even more and I couldn't wait to start classes in August.  I must admit, I struggled a little bit my first semester, but it made me realize that my first intended major was not for me.  It is now my second semester and I am taking general classes for Nursing!  The classes I am enrolled in now have me excited to see what the future holds.  I can't wait to further my education with Southern Illinois University Edwardsville."
Freshman,4,I like the class sizes and how the school isn’t too big or too small it’s just the right size. I hope the racial disturbances stop and that the staff gets better about those situations.
Sophomore,4,"This campus has the most amazing scenery during the fall season. The tuition is very reasonable for students, and is definitely worth the loans. The smaller classroom size allows for a more personal relationship with the faculty. All professors are easy to communicate with and truly care about their students' success. There is endless amounts of academic resources included in tuition costs; places like the Writing Center on campus has qualified tutors available six days a week to work with students on any kind of written assignment. Overall, SIUE is a great university and should be on the top of any student's list of colleges to consider."
Freshman,4,"Based on my experiences in Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville,I can say,I grew to love being here. The teachers here are considerable,and they also give a lot of help if needed.I feel like I'm not alone when I take upon my education.I have support from my teachers and students,who are intending the same major as me."
Sophomore,4,"I love the friendly and welcoming environment everywhere on campus and how diverse our student body is. However, I do wish that they had more choices for student clubs."
Freshman,4,"I love going to SIUE. Everyone on campus is friendly, even when they're cranky. The food could be better, but that's alright. I currently live in Bluff Residence Hall, and my experience here has been fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a better freshmen year."
Freshman,4,"SIUe is a great school. It is very diverse and welcoming. In my short time here, I've made lifelong friends and found a boyfriend. Aside from the social life, SIUe has a great academic program. All the professors really care about your education."
Junior,4,"The quality of professors is great and the campus is beautiful! Any flaws that are here are mainly student based, as in some students needing to be more accepting of others."
Senior,4,"Southern Illinois University is a great school and I have had a wonderful experience in my time here. However, I would like to see the dining services improved as well as the diversity on campus and the opportunity to be more vocal with the movements America is making as a whole."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, and it's constantly expanding! The teachers are very good, and the classes are well sized. They allow for a good learning environment that is very beneficial to students."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy attending SIUE and I have learned a great deal. Most often however, it is hard to get responses from the financial aid office if you need help with such issues and it leaves you feeling hopeless in the matter. But aside from this, I do not have any qualms with the school. The professors I have had thus far are always very fair with testing and grading, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure your success, so long as you pay attention and try. I am attending to obtain my BSN and there is no doubt that this is a very competitive program,  but it is one of the best in the nation for the price, so it's understandable.  I think having Starbucks on campus is a major plus too!"
Sophomore,4,"I love spending my time here at the ""E""! The atmosphere is great, with wildlife coming through campus, to the friendly students and facility, and working on my future career. Living here on campus makes me a better part of the campus life! Go Cougars!"
Junior,4,"southern illinois university edwardsville was the college for me, it is partnered with southwestern illinois college, a local community college. So just about all the credits transferred over. My expectation of southern illinois university edwardsville  were blown away, the teachers and facilities are amazing and I hope anyone looking into going here stop by and take a look"
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity that my school has to offer. I love the classes and the professors are amazing. The only thing I would change would be to have more on campus activities.
Alum,4,I loved the diversity at siue and also the cheap price! Campus was beautiful and the professors were always friendly! There is always some place you can go to get help with anything!
Freshman,2,"I took 3 classes online at SIUE, I do not recommend doing this unless if you are experienced enough with the subject you are going to take. Teachers take a while to respond and give general information to you."
Alum,2,"I only took hybrid classes and in class courses. Both were decent, but when I went the school did not offer many online courses."
Alum,2,"I only took one online class at SIUe: a health class. It was truly a joke. I could send any document to my professor and receive full credit. I didn't read the textbook. The material was frustratingly infantile. I was happy I got credit and it was very, very easy. It just felt like a waste of time."
Junior,2,"While I was transferring to this school I called to make an appointment with an advisor to set up classes. They said I needed to apply to the school online, so I did just that. I waited a week and called again to try and set up an appointment. They said I was classified as a ""Visiting Student"" Meaning I wasn't even a student at all. I let the lady on the phone walk me through the application process ( I did it the exact same way the first time) and waited a week again. Called and they said the same thing to me again. I had to do it again. They had also lost my transcripts. They are lucky I was not set back because of their unorganization."
Niche User,2,"At SIUE you will pay for things you don't need or can't use. Parking is ridiculous. Schedules are great, if you don't have a life outside of school. Some professors are amazing, but there is no shortage of professor God-complex on this campus. Seriously, consider all of your options prior to investing your time and finances."
College Freshman,2,"The walls are extremely, extremely thin."
College Junior,2,There is not a whole lot of school spirit or student involvement
College Junior,2,"Our school doesn't have a lot of school spirit and our basketball team isn't the best so people don't really engage in attending any of the athletic games. The games aren't really hyped up so people don't like to attend them as much, which is also due to the music that is played and the constant games being played during breaks get annoying. I think the games focus more on pleasing guest or parents than the students, which is why many students don't go. I think that if our school had a football team that would add some excitement and possibly more school spirit."
College Freshman,2,"As a student in the nursing program, things are very difficult. My professors are hit or miss, mostly miss. Some have accents that I cannot even understand. One of my professors legitimately did not know how many states were in the United States of America yet she is qualified enough to teach me statistics?? I do not think so. The workload is ridiculously hard, but that just comes with the nursing program. The study areas are great, especially the library. The library also has models I can study with for Anatomy and Physiology."
College Senior,2,I have no idea what sports we have.
College Freshman,2,this year hasn't been great
College Freshman,2,"We do not have a football team, only a soccer team. Not many people are interested in soccer, so there are no big events attended, I would have lliked more university life."
College Freshman,2,"Came here to this school because it apparently has a good nursing program. The program is ridicules and the school in general can't seem to get its act together. They do not offer enough classes considering how many students go here, which ends up inconveniencing almost everyone who attends here. None of the advising staff seems to be very helpful, and none of them really seem to know what is going on. The advising staff's main job seems to be to get you to go here longer than 4 years. The school itself is just cheap too. Wi-Fi is always going down when you're working on homework, poor teaching staff from what I've seen so far and the desks are all old and falling apart. The school is kind of a joke. It's more like a community college than an established University."
College Junior,2,It's easy to find somewhere to live off Campus. Most Of the time it's cheap.
College Freshman,2,"I have been given the run around so many times, and I am still trapped in the loop."
College Freshman,2,"Noise complaints do not do anything, and if your living situation is not up to par nothing gets done no matter how many complaints are filed."
College Student,2,There is absolutely no school spirit at SIUE. No one cares about our games.
College Student,2,"I rushed but did not get a bid. There are only 4 sororities on campus with around 150 girls in each one. Most people disaffiliate by junior year. Our greek life is a bit of a joke. We do not have greek housing, and greek life does not do much."
College Student,2,"You really have to be careful about financial aid. Despite checking with financial aid twice about my loans going through, they forgot to inform that I had to sign promissory note. Everything was sorted out, but you have to be on top of them."
College Junior,2,"It very bad, bad people working giving false informations"
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many parties directly on campus
College Freshman,2,"Campus is isolated, so you have to leave in order to go to parties. They're hard to find and usually get shut down. Party scene is non existent if not with greek life."
College Freshman,2,"People who are Greek do not treat ""geeds"" (this is what they call people not involved in Greek life) very well at all. I am friends with one person who is in a fraternity, however a lot of people who are Greek do not want to associate with anyone not involved in Greek life. I have witnessed Greek people making fun of people just because they were not in a fraternity. I was considering joining a fraternity myself, however once I saw how they treated other people here it turned me away."
College Senior,2,I didn't receive enough aid and I'm a struggling student. Even with a job I can barely afford school
College Junior,2,Start early. They mess up often and don't seem to care who it affects.
College Freshman,2,Didn't receive much of anything. Had to settle.
College Senior,2,I would appreciate more LBGT support in our community. It seems like there is a lot of homophobia at SIUE.
College Senior,2,"It could be worse, but it definitely is not excellent."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms and campus housing are horrible. Most of the time, the people living in housing are disrespectful and out of control on the weekends. The rooms are all different sizes, so it's unfair. The cost is okay and the convenience of location are great."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel this campus is strict in areas that aren't too important, such as parking while they are too lenient in others such as going to class. I know some Schools and departments say there is a 3 miss policy, but most teachers don't enforce it. I have had bad experiences with roommates who do not go to class and are not forced to go to class, so they are always at home and in my way."
College Sophomore,2,"Everywhere I go, I smell or see marijuana. This is an illegal drug and there is an abundance of it on this campus."
College Junior,2,I feel they do not offer that many scholarships to minority students.
College Junior,2,It is quite obvious and almost everyone partake in those actions.
College Junior,2,It could be a lot better.
College Junior,2,It could be more diverse on my campus.
College Senior,2,The dorms are very small unless you pay the big bucks. Your better off finding a place off campus.
College Student,2,"No football team, and the basketball team sucks!"
College Student,2,"Basically the only things close are McDonald's, Wendy's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Applebee's, Jack in the Box, Subway, and more, but that is only if you can get there. The only places that deliver are Imo's, Domino's, Jimmy Johns, Papa John's, Chinese place."
College Senior,2,"No Greek housing, Greek life is very clique-y, Greek doesn't impact the campus nearly at all."
College Senior,2,"The buses can get you where you need to go, but it will take a while. Having a car, in my opinion, is necessary. "
College Student,2,"The buildings are very bland to look at. For example, I visited a friend at Xavier University in Cincinnati and the campus was much more prestigious looking even though the schools most likely have similar academic experiences."
College Student,2,"They push Greek life a lot during rush week, but other than that you never hear about the sororities or fraternities. Also, not having houses seems like it takes away from the point of Greek life."
College Freshman,2,Humid during the summer and cold and windy in the winter.
College Freshman,2,the financial aid department is a hassle you need to keep on them otherwise they wont help you out very much
College Junior,2,There aren't enough scholarship available for students as expected
College Sophomore,2,The wifi on campus is horrible and printing is very expensive and adds up over time.
College Sophomore,2,"There are always small get togethers every weekend. There may not be huge ragers, but I prefer it that way."
College Sophomore,2,The hardest part of getting into my major was the level of difficulty of different professors teaching the same subject. I believed that it should have been more equal since we were all going into the same program.
College Sophomore,2,My parents are helping me pay for a small amount of my education.
College Sophomore,2,its kind of average because there are some people that are racist on this campus
College Senior,2,"We're NCAA Division 1, but unless you're an athlete, sports aren't some giant thing to center around on campus. But we're also a fairly young school compared to some, so that could change."
College Senior,2,"All the computers in the Art building are Macs, and I hate Macs, the library has PCs but I dont spend a lot of time anywhere but the Art building"
College Sophomore,2,"My school mostly consists of white students. However there are black, Hispanic, Asian, and international students. For the most part everyone sticks to their own race. There are a few who befriend and hang with others. Most people come from different backgrounds and areas and on one half some are   interested in learning about others while some stick to the stereotypes they have heard. One on occasion a racial slur was directed towards me, but everyone has their own opinion."
College Junior,2,"Being born and raised in the south suburbs of Chicago, I have been accustomed to the snow, but that's not the problem at SIUe.  The main issue is the thick layers of ice that are then covered by snow, making it difficult to even walk outside without falling.  The summer is just as horrible.  In early March temperatures have reached 84 and plus degrees.  Not a huge fan of extreme weather changes.  Found myself getting sick quite often."
College Sophomore,2,Parking during the week is crazy. There are almost never any parks. On the weekend most people leave and that's when more parks become available.
College Sophomore,2,I didn't receive much financial aid. As of now I'm still trying to find money to help me finish school. I wish there was more help when it came to filling out scholarships.
College Junior,2,"Very expensive areas and not college student friendly. The residents also have a huge hatred for the college students and make it known. You feel slightly like you are on display when you are simply looking for groceries. Students should consider Collinsville area, they appreciate the efforts some of us put in to help the community. They also attempt to get to know you before passing judgement."
College Sophomore,2,I don't even realize there is a Greek life. There are never any parties and I never hear of any fundraisers or mixers.  To me it seems basically non-existent besides a few posters here and there.
College Junior,2,"Its either you have a car or someone brings you, or you take the bus"
College Junior,2,There isn't a whole lot of diversity.  This is probably due to the intolerance towards diversity.
Senior,1,Terrible Place to attend for school unless you enjoy being ate alive by bed bugs and having no heat in your apartment and being constantly lied to about maintenance issues and if you are a fan of racism especially at Cougar village then this is the right University for you. They have a major infestation of roaches and they didn't pay for trash pick up for 2 months straight so the garbage began to pile up and other rodents began to take over Cougar Village they don't collect leaves in the fall so they will pile up and become a extreme hazard. The housing administration is filled with racists bigots whom believe in racial discrimination and profiling
Sophomore,1,"Rich white country kids, professors that do not care, the school only cares about sports and protects themselves putting others in danger."
Junior,1,"I have not even started classes at SIUE, but can already tell they are full of a very unorganized staff. If I had a choice on where to go this semester it would NOT be here. I applied in October for the next semester (Spring 2019).  After receiving my acceptance letter and student ID number I called to make my advising apt. They told me I was a ""visiting student"" and to reapply, I did and called again the next week I was STILL a visiting student and the student worker told me the only thing I could do was reapply. I APPLIED A TOTAL OF 4 TIMES, completing the application 4 different times because the faculty members told me that was the only thing that could be done. To this day I still HAVE NOT seen an academic advisor because I had to start the process all over again... Do NOT give your money to this school if you have the choice, very unorganized staff."
College Junior,1,I don't receive the amount of financial aid that I would need to cover a full school year.
College Student,1,If you don't know people that throw parties then you don't go.
College Student,1,"There are not too many parties, and if there is one it gets busted quick."
College Freshman,1,They treat everyone like children. Way too involved.
College Junior,1,"I commute, so I'm not sure about the housing, but the parking is terrible. Almost everyone I know has received a parking ticket at this school."
College Junior,1,"I haven't been here very long, but I've already noticed that departments do not communicate with each other. It also seems like the administration does not care about you as a student, only about you as their paycheck."
College Freshman,1,I don't party at school.
College Freshman,1,"According to them, my EFC is too much for me to receive aid. This is extreme saddening seeing how my family can't afford college. I'm telling you to save your coins and expect the unexpected."
College Junior,1,There are only about 3 bars in Edwardsville. There are no clubs. There is no convenient transportation to and from St. Louis.
College Senior,1,Parking Services literally makes millions of dollars from giving students so many tickets. They will give you a ticket 1 minute after your meter expires.. because they will be standing by your car waiting for it to expire. They suck.
College Senior,1,"Police force is doing their job.  Focus on education, instead of partying."
College Junior,1,"At the institute of technology,this is a closed campus used for academic achievement not parties. They hold a very high standard for the students"
College Senior,1,"The greeks don't do anything for the campus, yet they want on campus housing."
College Freshman,1,"This is the main problem of the school. Besides parties thrown by the school, there are NO parties on campus AT ALL. Either you have to have a car, or you need a friend with a car. I do have a friend with a car, and have been able to go to some parties, but it gets tiring having to rely on someone else to take you everywhere on weekends, especially when that person has 10 other people trying to get a ride from them. Alot of people go home on weekends too, and if you walk around campus on weekends, the campus is dead! The best you can hope for most weekends is getting some alcohol and drinking with your friends, or getting high. If you NEED a great nightlife, don't come here."
College Sophomore,1,"You literally have to pay for every place you park at. They don't offer on campus parking for students who have early classes. If you do want to park on campus, you have to buy an evening permit. There arent any close parking spot usually because they fill up quickly. You get ridiculous parking tickets if you're over the time limit by like five minutes."
College Student,1,"The parking seems way too expensive for my taste.  I have the cheapest parking pass ($64 per semester) and I have to walk for at least 15 minutes to get to my first class.  I'm not exactly sure how expensive the more expensive parking is, but I have heard it's over 100 dollars per semester."
College Senior,1,"The drug problem is rampant here. Please visit: http://weather62025.com/siue/index2.shtml  for a first-hand account of how SIU-Edwardsville deals with drug abusers on campus. I stupidly approached the office of student affairs in an effort to get help for my nephew and his friends who are proven drug abusers. I even showed the Dean of Students, James W Klenke, video evidence of the boys' drug abuse, but Klenke and his boss, Narbeth Emmanuel, have not only covered up the matter, but they are openly condoning the boys' continuing abuse of drugs on campus. I am still pursuing options to not only get the boys help (after a year of this corrupt nonsense at Student Affairs), but I am also seeking proper resolution for the university to relieve Klenke and Emmanuel of their corrupt influences on this campus. They are a cancer here, and I can only hope that some honest administrators will stand up and clean up Student Affairs and force these boys to get the long-overdue counseling they so desperately need. In the meantime, parents and other interested family members should be aware that SIUE has dropped the ball when it comes to drug safety issues on campus."

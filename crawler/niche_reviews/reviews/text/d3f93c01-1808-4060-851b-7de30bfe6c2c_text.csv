Alum,5,"I enjoyed the experience the professors were great, and the surrounding area of Columbus Circle is fantastic."
Senior,5,"I had the privilege to take online classes this semester because of COVID19.  While, for some teachers, this was a new concept of using technology to teach their class, they executed it fairly well.  I still learned a great deal of information, and still did very well on my exams."
Senior,5,"I really love NYIT. Im a Graphic Designer there and to be honest, I didn't know much about graphic design when I was in high school. NYIT opened my eyes to millions of opportunities. Not only are the teachers amazing but, the amount of help you get in NYIT is amazing. As a senior in NYIT, we have an event in our portfolio class where we present our works to professionals in the field. It's really fun!"
Graduate Student,5,"In a great area, with great professors and great courses. Everyone is nice and it is a very safe environment."
Freshman,5,NYIT has become a second home to me already and its only the first month! I enjoy all my classes and all of the professors are very approachable and helpful :)
Niche User,5,I liked how they had a major within the field that I want to go into. Since I want to be a Nutritionist. They have something similar within the field such as a Clinical Nutritionist. It'll take me 4 years to complete.
Freshman,5,"When I close my eyes the university that comes to my mind is New York Institute of Technology. Just by doing a small research, I was mesmerized by the achievements of the university and, moreover, by the success of the graduate students from this community. Its historical background, the ability of reflection upon a varied range of goals, traditions, cultures are things which can make any individual rest assured about the place they study in. Moreover, the wide range of faculties, the high-level standard of classroom facilities, creative, initiative, collaborative community and lessons are always dream of every student. I think New York Institute of Technology can make it come true."
Sophomore,5,"The classrooms are small, which allows students to connect with teachers better. Even though it is in the city, they have many events to get students involved, and they offer many job opportunities for students in the school , an internships outside of the school."
Freshman,5,"This private school has a lovely little campus with great professors who really try to help you when you have trouble. Small classes allow for individualized help and many classes have reasonable to easy difficulty. The food here is delicious, the SAC has excellent food!! Best pizza place and fresh chicken and pasta! It is fairly easy to get classes you want and administration is willing to work with you. I didn't dorm so I can't tell much about that, but as a commuter student I found it easy to make friends and didn't feel left out. The area around the school is fun and lively, many buses are around campus to take you places. On campus they have nice events like Tuesday bingo nights that give out flatscreen tv's, and fun events like 'stuff your own pokemon.' Excellent school for a good education and price!"
Junior,5,"I think NYIT Old Westbury campus is a great school. It's safe to be there, also they have great professors that are eager to help you. The diversity is great. Also, the Academics is fit for anyone that wants to do a career in that specific major. This school is great. "
College Junior,5,The school offers many career fairs for students to meet job employers from various backgrounds.
College Junior,5,Professors really care about their students.
College Junior,5,"The school is safe to go to. If you take night classes, you could always call security and they can walk or drive you to your destination."
College Junior,5,It's a great school because the professors always help and want the best for their students.
College Senior,5,No parties occur on campus
College Junior,5,admissions process was very easy.  They accepted majority of my transfer credits.
College Freshman,5,"We have two sororities and three fraternities, one of each are heavily apart of school activities and make fundraisers often for the charities they support. They don't look down upon anyone and everyone is pretty nice about everything."
College Senior,5,Awesome community and helpful staff
College Sophomore,5,This campus is extremely safe.
College Senior,5,The interior design program here it awesome. But because of the small program size the classes consist of 16-18 students that doesn't allow everyone to get time with professors.
College Senior,5,The interior design program here it awesome. But because of the small program size the classes consist of 16-18 students that doesn't allow everyone to get time with professors.
College Freshman,5,The professors have great knowledge in their field!
College Freshman,5,This scholarship pays for half the tuition and its annually! =D
College Junior,5,Housing is great depending on what dorm location you're at.
College Junior,5,Internship opportunities are great. The school offers very specific and essential ones.
College Junior,5,"Typical New York City atmosphere. Fast paced, great spots for activities and a lot of people."
College Junior,5,Nightlife is great as long as you're over 21. I haven't experienced much nightlife in college yet since I was under 21.
College Junior,5,It's a great experience. Being in the city puts in a nice spin to everything involved with school.
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel very safe at campus. Security is on duty 24/7
Recent Alumnus,5,"I met my boyfriend at school, there are a few other couples but not many."
College Freshman,5,"My school is VERY diverse. Everywhere you turn, there is someone racially, culturally, sexually, politically or economically different. It can be hard to find your clique at times, but it is great in learning about people from all around the world without it being an inconvenience."
College Freshman,5,Almost everyone in campus is international students. There are many who went to high school here but their parents live beyond the seas.
College Freshman,5,"Architecture students are really competitive therefore we all have to work even harder to be the best in our studios. 

Workload is really overwhelming but we have a really good architecture program."
College Freshman,5,I really am passionate about my major. I love it more each semester. It is a really hard major and I've had many sleepless nights but I just love the outcome. I'd not change my major at all
College Senior,5,there is no drugs or alcohol uses at my school
College Senior,5,i am a employee at the job were i did my internship
College Sophomore,5,the diversity in my school is totally acceptable
College Sophomore,5,We have no issues concerning the use of drugs and alcohol
College Junior,5,How can you not take the subway in NYC!
College Sophomore,5,"Being a part of NYIT Occupational therapy masters program is an achievement in itself. Making knew friends is always difficult, but everyone was accepting and friendly. I enjoy coming to school each day and learning whats important to my future. The large amount of work was anticipated prior to applying to this program. Earning a masters program included hard work and dedication, in which will result in the mastery of your profession. "
College Sophomore,5,"As a struggling determined student, I take school very seriously. My financial position has always limited my ability to progress to by fullest ability. The application process was extremely stressful, but the end result reassured why i actually took part in the stressful process. Being accepted to a prestige masters program relieved any insecurities i had about my future endeavors. "
College Sophomore,5,As a student who travels to school i don't personally experience the dorm rooms on an everyday basis. Other then the dorms rooms the school is always kept clean and presentable.
College Sophomore,5,The school parties i took part in were held by my the individuals in my class. Either at a bar or off campus housing. It was a great way to build friendships and socialize away from school.
College Sophomore,5,I can say with positivity that my experience at NYIT has been fascinating. Student life and resources are readily available fro all students and everyone is extremely helpful. 
College Sophomore,5,"Being on campus  for a majority of the semester, I can honestly admit that drug and alcohol are not a factor or issue on campus."
College Junior,5,"Always feel safe on campus, security is everywhere if you need help."
College Junior,5,The only bad thing about parking is sometimes is far from class but you will always find a spot and its free!
College Sophomore,5,"Located right next to Columbus Circle, NYIT has such a vibrant local atmosphere. Time Warner Mall, Lincoln Center and Central Park are some of the attractions that are minutes away from NYIT MA campus"
College Senior,5,Mostly all the trains you need and the bus stops right in front of the main building.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Crime on campus is virtually non-existent. In addition to on campus security, we are located in two different police jurisdictions, so if there ever is a problem on campus I know I can count on swift police arrival."
College Junior,5,New York Institute of Technology has no apparent drug scene.
College Senior,5,The New York Institute of Technology has an extremely ethnically diverse student population.
College Senior,5,I've never seen drugs or alcohol on campus. Everyone parties outside school.
College Senior,5,"Computers are usually always available. When they are not, they will let you into a classroom that has them if needed."
College Sophomore,5,"When It gets too cold, there is little or no interaction on campus and when it gets hot, people are always in the mood to hang out with others"
College Freshman,5,"New York City is a huge city there's a lot that the city has to offert. It has a lot of museums, there's Central Park, night life is a big thing in New York, and there's always something to do"
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are PLENTY of places to eat off-campus, you just have to be willing to drive to them; there's also a lot of variety."
College Senior,5,Readily Available – Literally every class room has computers and/or printers. Both Mac and Windows.
College Senior,5,"Center of Attention – Being in manhattan it is very easy to keep occupied in between classes. Shopping center is on the next block, starbucks on every corner, lincoln center in walking distance and of course restaurant and bar galore."
College Junior,5,many options. I didnt think i was going to be able to afford it. but they have many resources
Alum,4,"Excellent school in not quit the MIT, or Cal Tech but the school is gradually on its way to becoming a high tech college."
Senior,4,"I liked the people and staff members at the school and how amazing they are at making sure that NYIT is my home away from home. The campus is very beautiful and there's a lot to do on campus. I would like to see them listen to students more and hopefully, there's residence halls at their own campus"
Senior,4,I am in the nursing department. I do like how the teachers are readily available to discuss any conflicting issues in their offices.  I do like how most of the teachers answer their emails in a timely manner. What I wish to see is more updated equipment for our nursing labs.  Showing obsolete equipment is not as educationally engaging because those are things we wouldn't typically see in the hospitals in this century.  I find that they need to teach the skills and make sure that not everything has to be taught in clinical because oftentimes it is hard to get your clinical professor to teach you something when they have to deal with 7 other people besides yourself.  I think that they should take fewer students into the program instead of 60 people to make it a lot more engaging and easier on them to find clinical spots and lab times to accommodate everyone. I think the chair of the department is doing a great job and definitely corrects issues in a very timely manner.
Niche User,4,"It's a good school and my experience is positive. It's somewhat small, however, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for a ""big school"" experience."
Niche User,4,"New York Institute of Technology is a private research university with two main campuses in New York, one in Old Westbury and one in Manhattan. Additionally, it has a cybersecurity research center in Port Washington, New York, as well as campuses in Arkansas, United Arab Emirates, China and Canada"
Freshman,4,Academic reputation very good. Good Professors. No dorms on campus . No University community feeling.
Niche User,4,Nice building and location. Amazing technology courses available.  Very affordable. I plan on attending to learn more about the technology around us to change the world.
Junior,4,I loved the small class sizes and how helpful the professors were. The campus overall needs improvement but the community is great.
Junior,4,I like the campus. It's a really beautiful sight and it's a great environment to be in. I would like to see dorms on my own campus though and an improvement in our current dorms
Sophomore,4,"As I have finished my Freshman year of college, I am having an awesome experience. I have learned so much in all my classes and most of the professors do a great job teaching their subjects. I am a commuter so I cannot speak for people who dorm but from what I have heard, the dorms are literally falling apart. I do feel extremely safe in this beautiful Old Westbury college campus. The students at NYIT are wonderful and some students I will have life-lasting friendships with. I do enjoy the campus food but it's nothing to be excited about."
Freshman,4,I have heard it is a good college. Many people applied to it. I have great expectations for this college
Freshman,4,"I have attended New York Institute of Technology for the past 6 months. Ths campus is very presentable, cafes have delicious food choices, and the professors are great. You will get the opportunity to obtain a great education  that will be helpful in ths future. Very diverse school as well, a whole variety of races go here. Many helpful resources are around the campus to help with trouble, available to anybody.  Many sports complexes also so you can exercise or enjoy playing sports with friends. Weather is always nice besides the Winter where it may be cold, otherwise very comfortable temperatures daily."
Freshman,4,"I like the staff, very friendly people. I also enjoy having small classes. This helps me create a better relationship with my teachers. I like the campus itself. Very beautiful, however, the dorms that are on the SUNY Old Westbury Campus are horrible."
Alum,4,"Nice campus and professors are helpful.
Only downside is the price and continuing education there doesn’t give much financial help. Overall, good university and nice location."
Niche User,4,There are many majors there that are very beneficial. Architecture and Technology is very good in the college to study for
Freshman,4,"NYIT has a great campus and all the students are very welcoming. Everybody is there to help you do your best and try to put you on the right path. There is a ton of resources available, and over all it is a great tech school."
College Junior,4,Amazing school for Architecture. An experience worth living.
College Sophomore,4,"Just beginning, but the process has been great so far"
College Sophomore,4,"This is my first college experience so I really have nothing to compare.  During my first year the professors seemed knowledgeable as did the student assistants that they use.  Class size is acceptable and the courses offered are, likewise, acceptable and needed for my major."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never had an issue with any campus security or felt unsafe.  The campus police, however, is the next parking lot from my dorms making me feel very safe."
College Sophomore,4,"I have met several different fraternity and sorority members.  I have joined a fraternity whose members are a lot of other architect students and, therefore, we have the opportunity to seek help from the upper classmen/fraternity brothers, with our projects.  It appears to me, only going into my sophomore year, that the Greek life on my campus appear to be mature leaders, helpful and thoughtful individuals who are always looking for ways to pay it forward."
College Junior,4,Living there is great. It's clean and a confortable place to live at NYIT.
College Junior,4,It's great because the athletic facilities train their students to perfom better playing sports
College Senior,4,Variety of programs to choose from
College Senior,4,Career services are really engaged with students
College Senior,4,"It's great, security is active with students"
College Junior,4,No one speaks english & its hard to make firends
College Student,4,"I love my college because it has great internships connected to the school, the digital film department has great equipment and the school itself is full of amazing staff."
College Junior,4,The showing of ID system makes me feel safe
College Senior,4,NYIT is a very knowledgeable and accredited school which made it a great choice to go to.
College Senior,4,I had a really good experience with most of my professors. They really want their students to succeed.
College Senior,4,"I really love my school. The professors are knowledgeable and helpful. My only thing is the lack of financial aid that they give out, and also the price of the school for what you are getting out of it."
College Junior,4,Nobody has ever got hurt or assaulted on campus.
College Junior,4,Courses as well as professors prepare you for jobs
College Sophomore,4,The school tries their best to keep the school safe and always ask for IDs.
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at NYIT has showed me a great deal of networking and industry leading opportunities. I am earning my Bachelor's of Professional Studies in Hospitality Management and our program is definitely one of the top on Long Island. Definitely get involved around campus, you meet so many wonderful people and it really opens your eyes to just going to school to go to class and come home to get a degree. Make your time worth wile here. My grades have improved overall since I transferred here, and I would not trade going to NYIT for the world."
College Junior,4,"Security is great, but we don't have many issues."
College Freshman,4,"NYIT is very diverse. I believe more than half of our students are international students. It's very interesting but it can also cause a social barrier, causing a lot of students to sometimes not socialize because they may not know how. But there is definitely not a problem with diversity."
College Freshman,4,"Being in Manhattan, security is tight most of the time which makes me feel good. Sometimes there's a few security guards who could really care less and just sit on their phone, and I feel as though they should be spoken to, because there's a lot of freaks in NYC. anyone can walk into one of our buildings and do something bad if they wanted to. But for the most part, I feel safe and secure constantly being asked to show my school ID."
College Freshman,4,"The courses have a lot of leeway with the professors - they have a lot of freedom to adjust the course in a way they like, which can either be really good or really bad. I think the school should take student evaluations much more seriously when it comes to a professor rating, because we aren't in high school anymore. If we say a professor is bad, we probably mean it. The selection of courses is very diverse & the sizes are nice and small, I think a few professors just need to be reevaluated."
College Freshman,4,"The school pretty much forces every student to get at least one internship, and they encourage more. This is a great way for students to see what's out there and get an idea for their future, however I feel as though the school could maybe do a better job stressing the importance of doing this early. If an internship is saved for the last minute, it could hinder a students ability to get a start on their career."
College Freshman,4,"I love the school itself and my classmates. I've found a nice friend group that is very involved on campus and close with administration and I've learned a lot. However, I don't know if I can afford this schools tuition another year, and thinking I may have to come home breaks my heart because high school wasn't pleasurable in the slightest for me. NYIT is great and I love it too much for me to leave. Tuition is way too high."
College Junior,4,Class sizes were adequate.  they also had a diversity in the students which is very important.
College Junior,4,It is an accredited college.
College Freshman,4,They have people who work in those areas incase anything sexual or mentally happens to one to help you get through it.
College Freshman,4,There's a lot you can get from this school my friend studied biology but he realized that he wanted to continue studying but in another major and he will because one of the workers there were about to hook him up with the next school he'll be applying to
College Freshman,4,"I like my courses so far the teachers are really kind, although there are moments where there are some professors that are a pain to deal with."
College Freshman,4,"Since the campus I am on doesn't have the varsity sports, we don't pay attention much to sports since we are an urban campus but we do have a student membership with Sports Center. If you do want to play at a varsity level you can go to the other campus."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school, if you want to be involved with the school it's very easy to get involved. I like knowing the people around me to me this school seems very intimate. There are some mediocre students around but what school doesn't have that. I like what it offers too, the school may be expensive but I believe it's worth it because there are so many things that can be done there, you have the potential to do many things there if you put your mind to it."
College Senior,4,The school is so diverse and accepting to students
College Senior,4,"The classes are good, a lot of mind tasking work that pushes you to work harder"
College Senior,4,The services are conducive for students to open up
College Senior,4,Student affairs is really great for students. They constantly want to grow future leaders
College Senior,4,The school shows support for their teams and so do the students
College Freshman,4,NYC has a wide variety
College Freshman,4,The financial aid process went well for me.
College Junior,4,"The new york institute of technology manhattan campus is a safe campus as it situated across three skyscraper type buildings. One must display his/her identification card before entering any of these buildings. The security personnel frequently patrol the floors of the building to make sure everything is in order. During my two years since i have been there, the worse incident i have heard about was a laptop being stolen and this only happened once. So my opinion is that it is a secure campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Suburban and safe with shopping, many places to eat, and a local bar."
College Sophomore,4,A lot of variety but can be costly.
Recent Alumnus,4,they help when they can
Niche User,2,"Good school, is what I first thought my first semester here... downfall of it is the people who run it. Architecture program is very disorganized and some professors are very rude and do not accommodate for a students problems. I find that many students including myself end up transferring out. The price of this school does not match the experience. It is very hard to get a hold of someone of authority (assistant deans and deans) when in need of help or a simple question.I do not recommend going to this school or having this as your first option."
Freshman,2,"Attended the Old Westbury campus my freshman year of college; declared as an Electrical & Computer Engineering undergrad. I loved the surrounding forest-like area, 90-minute train ride from home, campus food (Nathan's!) and new-found independence around other students my age. These traits didn't justify the school's high tuition, boring campus, downright ugly dorms, and largely incompetent STEM professors. The degraded residence halls make for a terrible dorm-life experience, there was no shortage of incomprehensible/ill-tempered foreign professors, and the curriculum quality did not reflect the 30k tuition price tag.

I met some of the most interesting, down-to-earth people at this campus and still keep in touch with them but I can't, in good conscience, recommend the school itself."
Freshman,2,The teachers did not show support to their students. The teaching environment was like a pass or fail.
Works Here,2,"The combined Manhattan and Long Island campuses of the college have about 1000 faculty members; among these, about 300 are full-time whereas about 700 (about seventy percent) are part-time faculty (adjuncts). Currently, we seem to be prioritizing our ""profit centers"" in terms of allocating resources (chemicals and/or equipment and/or well-qualified and articulate full-time faculty). The ""profit centers"" are the osteopathic medical school (D.O.) and of course, the combined seven year BS/DO program. Due to the current trend, BS/DO undergraduates will likely receive an acceptable education since we prioritize all programs connected to the D.O. when we allocate our resources. What about undergraduates whose major is not BS/DO? While they might still receive a quality education, they may find themselves receiving ""leftovers"" in terms of resources due to the ""potluck"" allocation of these when those not majoring in BS/DO are involved. If you are not enrolled in BS/DO, go somewhere else."
Junior,2,"My experience has been relatively poor due to poor professors, living in dorms 20 minutes away off campus, as well as playing a sport here"
Freshman,2,"I like how flexible and accommodating the schedules are. I would like to see a change in the dorms, for it is not up to par with how high the cost is to live on campus. The professors are not top notch teachers, students are primarily teaching themselves. The cost of tuition students have to pay isn't displayed in the quality of the school at all."
Alum,2,"I graduated from NYIT with a BFA majoring in computer graphics. I have to say the school was a bit mediocre at the time. The computer labs were good but the teaching philosophy was lacking. I did not feel prepared for the world of animation. Guidance was extremely lacking and ultimately faculty didn't go out of their way to help their students succeed. 

I learned most of what I needed to from my peers. Also the labs were not always open at the times I needed it to be so I could get projects done in a timely manner."
College Senior,2,"This university has failed to help place me in an internship program within my area of study. Considering the amount of money I pay for tuition, this university should at least be helpful in preparation for my future career. I had to reach out to a development program outside of school for guidance and help. Also, the fact that there aren't enough professors at the Manhattan campus is absolutely ridiculous; the school of management is an absolute joke."
College Junior,2,I never hear anything about NYIT sports
College Sophomore,2,"I do not live on campus, but I do have friends who lives on the campus and all of them complain about how noisy and dirty the place is."
College Sophomore,2,I never hear anyone talking about the athletics at my school.
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing, no AC, and too hot in winter."
College Freshman,2,"Being located in Manhattan, the dorming situation gets complicated. The school doesn't own any form buildings, so we basically use other buildings which do not belong to us. I am currently dorming in Manhattan School of Music, and I can't stand it. The building is outdated, internet speed is a joke, rules are strict and selective depending on the student, the cafe is mediocre and the hours are awful. I pray I'm not placed there again next year."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't too many people and I play sports, the people there are extremely rude and uninviting."
College Freshman,2,Not too many good parties
College Freshman,2,Hardly any flex funds are given for the amount of money being paid
College Sophomore,2,Extremely hard to obtain. The majority of landlords in this area DO NOT like renting out to students.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Expensive if its close to school, but cheaper if its far, also the school does not help at all with off campus housing"
Recent Alumnus,2,They do not do much
Recent Alumnus,2,"With as much money as NYIT charges in tuition, the facilities are very poorly organized and built. NYIT pick you game up seriously"
College Freshman,2,Not a party school but there are parties at nearby colleges
College Freshman,2,The gym is small my high school gym was twice as big but anyone can go and play at their leisure
College Senior,2,We don't really have a Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,2,Renting an apartment in NYC is extremely expensive. One needs multiple roommates to afford a decent size apartment.
College Senior,2,It is bad especial if you are an international student
College Freshman,2,youll get away with alot in the dorms
College Sophomore,2,Tuition hikes are too high.
College Junior,2,Everyone is very clicky here. Make friends within your major and you will have a good experience here. 
College Junior,2,"Not many options and the food is all processed and over priced. They do offer vegetarian options, but very few. The best dining areas are near the medical buildings. "
College Junior,2,There are very few healthy eating options off campus.
College Senior,2,There are not many restaurants nearby and they are not great tasting or priced.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to get the best parking spot you have to arrive at 6 in the morning if not, like me whose class doesn't start till 11, be prepared to walk the distance from your parking lot which is the last lot the school has to offer."
College Senior,2,"The shuttle bus only runs once an hour if you are lucky. This school is not built for students without cars...Also, the dorms are off campus at another college about 3 miles away so you have to take the bus to class everyday."
College Senior,2,"The school is located in a busy area in Manhattan, traffic can be out of control at times making it hard to find parking. The good thing is the subway station and bus stop are just a few feet away."
College Freshman,2,I honestly don't feel like I'm studying to be a computer scientist at NYIT  all the classes giving in the first two years are mainly English classes no matter what major your in and the workload is not a lot at time it feel like I'm back in high school with the amount of work they give us. Besides all the English classes I have to take the first two years the few classes that have to do with my major are great you learn a lot from them
College Freshman,2,"NYIT  has an amazing campus. The teacher are great they are willing to help you whenever you need it, the classes are small which is excellent. But for the first two years you have to take what the school calls a core curriculum which is pointless and Makes you feel like your waiting your time mainly if your not majoring to be an English teacher or writer. Overall is a great school you have a lot of resources at your disposal the only bad thing is the Core curriculum that you have to take no matter what your major is."
College Senior,2,Should Be More Easy – The school is small so the amount of people there to help is limited in comparison to the students. No one really helps unless u go out of your way to seek it. I was very confused when i first got to this school but i learned things on my own.
College Junior,2,"Very Expensive, Not Very Good – Only 2 places to eat on campus, and they're both pathetic excuses for cafeterias. One think you'll learn about NYIT is that it's a work in progress. They haven't figured out the whole college thing yet. They're getting better slowly though."
College Junior,2,U have to buy a pass for an athletic nearby. There should be a large gym for the amount of tuition
College Student,2,"Always Classes in the Computer Rooms – At NYIT, there are a number of computer labs, all with reliable computers. However, classes that require computers are constantly in these rooms, making them ""not open to the public"" if you will. Best bet is to have your lap top with you at all times."
Sophomore,1,"Professors are incompetent and don't know the subjects they teach. Some are good, but the majority are terrible. Transferring out and recommend people stay away."
Sophomore,1,Switched to online after covid and it was a mess. Teachers were not prepped on using Zoom and the school switched us from Blackboard to Canvas halfway through. Total mess!
Niche User,1,"Undergraduate Application processing time is way too long for a response. Was referred to another 'special services' department that wanted me to give an $1,000 with an essay  before I was even admitted. Wasted time in comparing my acceptance awards from other institutions."
Sophomore,1,"DO NOT GO HERE! If You're looking for that ""college experience"" this is not the school for you. There are no dorms on campus, no campus life. Professors are mostly terrible and half the time you can not understand what they say. Most kids here are anti social and do not want to do anything. School owns a lot of land but do nothing with. Dealing with bursar is a joke. Nothing to do around campus other then going to the Broadway mall. Not a great school at all. Comp sci classes are outdated as well. Lacks new technology for a ""Tech school"". I wouldnt even bother applying if I were you. If you enjoy social interaction and parties this school also isnt for you. No one at this school has character or charisma."
Alum,1,This college has terrible professors and terrible syllabus.  They teach you everything that's not needed and skip over every important topics.  They use Google for notes and all the college cares about is money.  I Graduated with a good GPA but didn't learn a thing.   If you have to take a license exam after graduating then please don't go here as it will not prepare you for it.  And all their advertisement is fake
Works Here,1,"Will not do anything to help the student experience.  Poor library, terrible student activities center, lousy facilities."
College Senior,1,"At the Manhattan campus, athletics is essentially nonexistent. As for student involvement and school spirit, they're both lacking at NYIT."
College Sophomore,1,its very difficult and expensive to live off-campus
Recent Alumnus,1,Everything closes early and there is not much
College Senior,1,Residential buildings aren't even located on campus grounds. They are on another colleges campus which used to be their old dorms. That school declared the dorms unsuitable for living and were given to nyit for their students. Not worth wasting the money to live there. You're better off finding off campus housing
College Freshman,1,"My campus has closed countless times, just in my first year experience alone, because of horrible snow days. Worse part is, we didn't have enough days at the end of the year to make up the days we missed."
College Freshman,1,"No school spirit, no team performance and no athletic facilities at all at New York Institute of Technology's Manhattan Campus. Although I believe it is because of the location of the campus. Our other campus that is on Long Island is really good with sports."

Freshman,5,Very good staff and willing to help students.The education is good and the professors help the student succeed. You also learn life lessons in school
Freshman,5,I have not taken any class online. Taking a class here at Webber will help you free up time to study. The online classes can also help you get a good idea on your subject your studying classes
Freshman,5,Webber University offers  a variety of majors making it a well rounded school for all students. I’m will be a freshmen majoring in computer information systems also playing basketball on a athletic scholarship. I’m looking forward and excited about my next chapter in life.
Alum,5,My mom went to Webber. She would have liked to see more different groups and activities that students could get involved in. She liked meeting new friends.
Niche User,5,Webber international excels in Sports and academics is a very nice and quiet calm college place very relaxing and I recommend it for everybody In the state of Florida and More I can’t wait to experience Webber in August 2019 and be apart of the great warriors
Freshman,5,"Although I have yet to fully attend this college, I did a thorough tour of the campus and I loved it here. I am a soon to be college student in the fall of 2019."
Senior,5,My overall experience with Webber has been amazing! I met people from all over the world and that is what makes it special; learning different cultures is just awesome. It also gave me the opportunity to make my Spanish better.
Freshman,5,For my first year at Webber I believe it was an amazing year.  Once I settled in and realized I was on my own no mom no dad I took matters into my own hands and stayed more focus on school and sports and then I lived and had fun when I could but it was an experience like nothing else The Clubs the atmosphere at games it’s incredible
College Junior,5,Just about everyone at this school participates in sports. This allows students and teachers to work around sports games that require travel and leave the students missing classes. Teachers work around it and allow students to move quizes and make up for school as long as they were gone for legitatment reasons.
College Junior,5,"The campus is located on a lake so its a gorgeous view from the class rooms in the dorms. There isn't a lot going on in this small time but the excited brough from the school. There is a mall about 20 minutes away with plenty of shopping, movies, and arcade/bowling alley."
College Junior,5,When it comes to a four year school this is a wonderful school for the price. It gives you the college experience while allowing you to focus on your studies as well.
College Junior,5,The teachers for my particular major are very helpful and try to get you to hands on experiences such as local restaurants and surrounding meetings.
College Sophomore,5,its the best there is always a security guard  around
College Sophomore,5,its the best everyone is kind to each other
College Sophomore,5,"We are so diverse when it comes to cultural backgrounds. There are less Americans than anything. You learn so much from these people from all over the world However, there are way too many dudes here."
College Sophomore,5,"The weather is amazing here. All the time. Well, most of the time. It's hot, sunny, and breezy."
College Freshman,5,Webber International University is a business college therefore all the majors are business related. I think the majors here are very useful and focused. All majors require you to complete an internship before graduating; this is something very useful because the pre graduate can get a head start and is open to the world of his career.
College Freshman,5,The computer lab is open 24/7 and there are a good amount of computers available. They are not usually packed mostly necause the school population is not that big and a lot of students do have portable computers. Therefore the lab is only used by those who need to print or don't have their own computers. You can go at any time and use the computers and printers for free.
College Sophomore,5,It is very sunny and sitting on the lake makes it wonderful
College Sophomore,5,Webber is very small but it is on a lake.  The scenery is beautiful.
Sophomore,4,I liked how Webber had smaller classrooms for a better learning environment and a closer relationship with my professors. I also liked how the campus is right on a lake for a great scenary!
Freshman,4,"Awesome scenery and able to do a lot of new activities in the area, Coaches on the football are very welcoming and all around great staff."
Freshman,4,"Webber International University is a School that is all about education first. The Student life is excellent, The staff there are very nice and very helpful and understanding. The football staff is very cool they make sure all of their players are well conditioned and ready for the upcoming season . I wouldn’t want to see anything change about Webber International University, I love it how it is."
Niche User,4,I love the size of the campus.  Many of the areas are available to students and workers if needed.  The food is good.  the professors are good.  Nice beach to go to.
College Freshman,4,I play football and all my needs are met
College Freshman,4,Love the small classes and attention when needed
College Junior,4,"That athletics are okay. We could be better, with every single sport we have. The coaches need to focus on athletes more and stop trying to limit them to only one sport. The football coach is great."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are small which is good, when it comes to trying to get alittle bit of one on one time with teacher."
College Freshman,4,"Coaches, trainers, and other athletic sports personnel are very helpful and great to work with."
College Freshman,4,"Even though are school isn't that big, we still connect with each other very well. Family is the type of style we like. Where everyone can be free and safe."
College Freshman,4,"No one wants to hurt you, or will do anything bad"
College Senior,4,The school is great. But the campus needs work.
Recent Alumnus,4,Solid school with great history.
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed it much more.
College Sophomore,4,Living close to Orlando is enjoyable for dining.
College Sophomore,4,"For small school it sticks to its promises of guiding the students to success, it is very rare to slack off in a course without having a coach or adviser find out."
College Junior,4,"This school is meant for business so there are many available majors within the business industry such as marketing, sports management, and hospitality."
College Junior,4,"I don't live on campus however they are always doing something. There are bowling nights at the local alley, beach parties on the lake, and contests to win things such as movie tickets."

College Sophomore,4,there are always computers available and printing is free and also the wireless is awesome
College Sophomore,4,everyone is friendly to each other
College Sophomore,4,"it is great everyone keep to themselves, everyone is friendly"

College Sophomore,4,I received many scholarships here.
College Sophomore,4,"It's fine here, people like to drink and party but if you don't want to take part in that you don't have to. Everyone is nice and respectful. Most of us are athletes so we don't do drugs."
College Sophomore,4,There are always a few guards on duty and you know where to find them if needed. They are always nice and helpful too.
College Sophomore,4,The security here is not strict. Just don't be walking around with a beer in your hand. Keep it in the rooms and be respectful.
College Sophomore,4,"We have a computer lab that is open 24/7 for students to use. The bad thing is that if you procrastinate, you might be out of luck trying to find an available computer."
College Freshman,4,I have a learning disability and I have felt very comfortable going to my professors for assistance and getting the extra time that I need to digest the material.  It is very important that I have this rupport with my professors and that the curriculum is presented at a pace that is manageable for me.  I am enthusiastic about networking and connecting to employers in my field of Security Management and I am pleased with the way it is presented and offered at Webber.
College Freshman,4,"The facilities are very available and useful, but kinda run down."
College Sophomore,2,"Webber is a waste of money, time, and life."
College Sophomore,2,The teachers don't seem to be into their jobs. They just teach and leave.
College Sophomore,2,The boys dorm (Grace) has mold in it. The girls dorm (Camilla) is so old that the pipes leak all the time.
College Sophomore,2,"Don't waste your time or money at Webber. The campus is run down, the staff are unhelpful, and the dorms are dank and musty. And the food sucks."
College Sophomore,2,Not enough variety throughout the semester. Gets very repetitive.
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria food is terrible. They have decent food sometimes, but most of the time it is gross. The Student Union is the best option for food on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Everything is dirty except for the gym.
College Sophomore,2,"The town is really small and there are basically no places to eat except for taco bell, wendys, and... I can't think of another place."
College Freshman,2,There are 70% guys and they're not very good looking. Not very many parties and everyone is pretty lame. Everyone is already in their own cliques.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone is always drinking. Especially on tuesday and friday nights. The security gaurds dont care much or enforce the drinking on campus either. As long as you are drinking it in your dorm room and not outside. Also many people pressure you to partake, it gets out of hand sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"The school cafeteria is a buffet so that is the main benefit. However the food they provide is not so good and barely satisfying. There is a student union where food is also sold, and although it is pricey, it is good."
College Junior,2,"Its nothing to do here but read , but we do have school events form time to time"
College Junior,2,"The food can be a lot better. the quality of the food is extremely low, most of the time it's fried food. there is not much of a healthy choice."
College Junior,2,"There is not really Greek in my school. Yes, there are parties, but not wild or anything. The parties are normally controlled."
College Junior,2,"Night Life – Nightlife at Webber...you can't really call it that. Yes, every Tuesday night students throw parties because we do not have classes on Wednesday. On Friday and Saturday nights parties are also thrown, but they are not that great. The clubs are in Orlando and so far away. Many people do not have transportation to get there and have to depend on others."
College Sophomore,2,There Is Only Good Network Signals in the Lab. This college is located in a small town so if you are not close to the lab then the service will be bad. Even if you are in the lab on most days there are no computers availible.
College Freshman,2,It's Ok Here – Webber is an ok school. The best thing that I like about this school that is a sport school. That mainly the people here are here to play a sport. I would probably choose this school is their was better food and some more activities.
Alum,1,"Webber International University is a terrible choice to go to school. The living conditions were terrible, the cafe close super early so you was always hungry again around 8. The classrooms were dirty and so was the whole campus. I wouldn't recommend this school to anyone."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have Greek Life at Webber International University, but one day maybe we will."
College Sophomore,1,"Go to Orlando, which is an hour and a half away. otherwise there is nothing"
College Freshman,1,It is more about participation than it is about winning.
College Sophomore,1,Webber International University lacks a female population. The school is predominantly male. Most student tend to dress relaxed and comfortable whilst on campus. The school is not big so there are not too many things to do so most students often walk around the lake or just remain in their rooms.
College Freshman,1,"You Must Proceed With Caution – At WIU, you will be faced with a choice to do the right thing, or the wrong thing. There are drugs, and alcohol everywhere."
College Senior,1,"The facilities at Webber International University are not the best and can be greatly improved on. We have one gym which is shared by the volleyball and both girls and boys basketball. We have no home field for our football team(they play at a highschool near by), the soccer field shared with the softball field. The gym could be updated, to where it can be made a little bigger, and provide a better workout atmosphere.The student union should be remodeled to give out a better atmosphere for students to engage in. The student activities definitely need to be improve to give the students a college experience, some of the activites makes it seem as if we are in highschool."

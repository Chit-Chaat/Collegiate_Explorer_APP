Sophomore,5,Peninsula College has made it fairly easy to do my college online. It is also very accommodating to military.
Freshman,5,This school is amazing and there isn't anything I would change!! The staff here has been so great and so very helpful!!
Freshman,5,"I personally do not like online schooling as much as I like in person classes. But since this we have had to do classes online because of the quarantine, my experience has been very good so far."
Niche User,5,"If you are one of those students who is bored in the regular classroom, Peninsula College is for you. They respect you and any opinions you have; they have a wide variety of courses; and you feel accomplished with your education."
Freshman,5,"From experience so far, the staff are incredible people. The people in this town are also extremely friendly. I was late to my appointment with the transfer advisor and she was extremely kind and understanding when I arrived. She helped me with all of my questions and even helped me beyond what I was even there for. As an out of state student, the tuition is also very cheap."
Freshman,5,"There are so many things about Peninsula College that I absolutely love. First; the scenery. The scenery in this town is something amazing and the college here adds to it. Also; the fact that our college is not known for its party scene. The dorms had been torn down about 15 years ago and just been rebuilt down the road from the college. It is a nice environment without any distractions. The professors have always been so helpful. I have not had one professor that I did not enjoy my time with. The staff as wellâ€”friendly and beyond helpful and patient. 

I wouldn't need anything to change."
Sophomore,5,Loved the avaliable classes as well as the learning enviroment. The campus was beautiful and the rescources they make avalible to the students is very impressive.
Freshman,5,This was one of the best schools I have been to. The staff and students offer a lot of support no matter what the problem is. All the students are there to learn and better themselves in the process.
Freshman,5,"Peninsula College has (and will continue to be) a great experience!  They provide a variety of different professors and will take the time to help you find the right ones for you.  The campus is beautiful and, from their flowerbeds to their bathrooms, is very clean.  

Their Honors Program (in which I am enrolled) is really great.  It allows me to really focus on learning, interact with like-minded students, and be challenged by those who aren't like-minded.

There's a lot of diversity at PC, which makes it a great cultural experience!

I think I've learned a lot from attending PC so far, and I know that anyone else would say the same.  The people are great, the classes are high-quality, and the learning is happening all of the time!"
Freshman,5,"Peninsula college is a great school. The staff, workers, and professors all ensure that students have the best experience and are in a well productive learning environment.

Freshman,5,Peninsula college has been an amazing experience so far. The professors are intelligent and caring and the new medical assisting and nursing building is phenomenal!!

I like the college so much that I am working on my BAS in business management. The online college is just as rewarding while your working on your degree. This college is also very accomendating to dissabled students
Graduate Student,5,"I like the fact that this college is located in one of the most beautiful cities in the country. It's a small college but it offers so many amazing opportunities for me to reach my goals, especially to transfer to a 4-year university. All the staff and students are very friendly and kind and Peninsula College has definitely made me feel like home - while I'm a thousand miles away from home. The professors are very good in teaching the subjects and they are always available to talk to. I would definitely recommend this college."
Sophomore,5,"I attend the off site campus, in Port Townsend, and I love my classes because they are small, and I get all the one on one time with the the professors I need."
Sophomore,5,Peninsula College has been very helpful in reaching college goals and graduating.  Courses are varied both online and in person as well as extension sites.
Freshman,5,A beautiful campus set at the foot of the Olympic mountains. Very intimate with the ability to connect with the professors. Never surprising to see deer or other wildlife roaming around the grounds. There's a very diverse student body and the quality of instruction is superb. 
College Junior,5,"So great, this school is really diverse and friendly towards everyone."
College Junior,5,"Everyone is really friendly, the atmosphere is great. If you do fall behind there is free tutoring for almost every class. The student body is extremely diverse and very friendly. The athletics are very fun to watch and everyone gets behind the teams and there is a ton of school spirit."
College Junior,5,"I am very pleased on how convenient online classes have helped in my learning. Again if you need help, ask and all the help you need is readily available. Just don't procrastinate because you think it's ok I'll do tomorrow doesn't work. Don't fall behind it very difficult to keep caught up."

College Senior,5,I didn't have a choice of which community college I wanted to attend... PC was jut in my community. But coming here enriched my life for sure.
College Senior,5,"There is a big focus on accessibility for students with special needs of any sort. The gym is amazing and open every school day. The library is roomy and, along with the newest buildings, heated geothermically. Camps activites are astoundingly frequent and creative for such a small school!"
College Junior,5,The Peninsula College campus is a very beautiful campus surrounded by nature. The newer buildings look great and they are always working on updating the older buildings.
College Junior,5,Most of my pre-reqs for the nursing program were taken online and I loved them!

College Junior,5,Lots of future job opportunities! The instructors are great and so are the classmates!
College Senior,5,I have had an amazing experience at Peninsula College. Most of the courses are of high quality and all of the conflicts I have encountered have been able to be resolved smoothly.
College Senior,5,"There is a HUGE amount of diversity in my college, more than there is to be found within the city or county. Although the social groups don't usually mingle, the wide range of clubs and regular student events brings everyone together. Discrimination/segregation is virtually unheard of on campus."
College Senior,5,So many resources to draw from. I have no way of describing them all on here. Their is always someone ready to help out when it comes to resources this school offers.
College Senior,5,A wide variety of topics are available at this college. You have many options and many resources.
College Senior,5,"To me, when you get a degree in your field, you don't just get a degree. You get a vast pool of knowledge based around the career you wish. This school feels as if they adapt the knowledge they teach to the student and not the student to the knowledge."
College Sophomore,5,its amazing how much diversity is shown here at a community college! its amazing i never would of expected that so much diversity is here. not only that i also joined a club called shades of color club for native Americans where we can discuss the diversity of the students and how we can incorporate everyone to do something together.
College Sophomore,5,The tuiton was not expensive at all but the coolest thing was that the college had a grant that paid my tuition so i didn't have to worry about spending my own money on the tuition.
College Sophomore,5,Student centers are amazing as well as the libraries here they have free WiFi and offer free tutoring here to help with your classes. the athletic centers are refurbished and are amazing now. and they offer plenty of campus activities.

College Sophomore,5,My nursing degree offers a lot of respect in the community and school. i also did a nursing internship over the summer which gave me hands on experience of what i'm going to be doing and so far i loved it. the also have programs offered at Peninsula College for those going into the medical field to work at nearby hospitals or clinics.

College Senior,5,Everything listed above is excellent in my opinion.
College Sophomore,5,We recently had switched our online course set up but it wasn't a easy change. Just took some getting use to but the professors were really understanding of the students using a new site. I really liked how you got to interact with the other students on the online courses.
College Sophomore,5,"The library had plenty of computers and even free wifi for you to bring your own computers. For me it was nice because I didn't have a computer right away so they were super helpful. They even have a front desk in the library where the ladies helped you print things off, it did cost ten cents for every page but the ladies never denied you if you were money short. Also all threw out each building in the college they had free wireless access for students."
College Sophomore,5,From the student services to the library everything is super neat and study ready for you. Everyone there is willing to help you with any questions you have. I found myself in the library a few time a week studying because of how comfortable I felt there.
College Sophomore,5,"Its crazy how much the students came together outside of my biology class to study and make sure that they were all ready for the test. Once a week we all meet at the college to make it easier for everyone and we all sat together and studied, making sure everyone was fully ready for the test each week. Super helpful!"
College Sophomore,5,"The nursing program is a really hard program to get into, they make sure their students are fully ready for what they are about to get into. The workload is great its hands on and some paperwork/homework in which you are given enough time to finish."
College Sophomore,5,"Class registration is supper easy you meet with an advisor that one of the ladies in the student services will set you up with. They help you figure out what classes need to be taken so you are all ready and done by the time needed, supper helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"Classes are afforded at night and during the day to help work with your flexibly, I haven't had to transfer any credits yet but all though I know people who have and it went really smooth. I really enjoy this college!"

College Sophomore,5,"The view of the college has me hooked, the student services faculty are amazing. The instructors are supper understanding and are willing to work with you, best school I have ever attended. Don't plan on leaving."
College Junior,5,"I love that I can go to a small school and still get a challenging education. It is really nice to get to be around so many people, but not enough to be overwhelming and feel lost in the crowd by the professors. "
College Junior,5,"Athletic Center is refurbished.  Student Center is AWESOME!  Library has a ton of resources.  Student body is active, with plenty of off-campus activities.  Campus is small but comfortable."
College Junior,5,Everything needed is here.  Professors are readily available.
College Junior,5,"The campus has a phenomenal technical department and keeps everything running smoothly, except for the minor glitch here and there. There is wireless service and there seems to be a minimal lag even when there are many students logged in at the same time. There is a computer lab with about 30 computers and the library even has about 40. In the food court area there is another 12 to 15 . There is also printing and free copying centers on the campus as well."
College Junior,5,The tuition here is relative to anywhere else you may go. The financial aid office here at the college is great with all the knowledge and help in helping me get the information I needed and also letting me know in advance if there was something I was missing so that I would not miss the deadline.
College Junior,5,The campus faculty and students are top notch. They all have been very friendly and interactive with my entire curriculum. Even the security office has asked me if there was anything I needed such as directions to where ever I needed to be and even helped me get my keys out of my locked vehicle. I am far away from home and it was nice to be around such friendly people.
Alum,4,"I took several online classes at Peninsula College. They  were usually very well-structured and the lay-out was easily accessible and easy to understand, depending on the professor. PC uses Canvas, and it was always very easy for me to navigate. It was usually never buggy or problematic."
Sophomore,4,I don't go on campus so I wouldn't know about it but the online is well done for the most part. Some athletics are a little wonky with Online though.
Freshman,4,"So far so good, we will see after this quarter.  Excellent staff members that due care.  It also has a great campus in Port Townsend that is at a State Park that is remarkable.  People are supportive there and will help you go the distance you want.  Anna in Admissions and Bobby up front.  We can't forget about the lady who knows, thanks Willow!"
Freshman,4,"I like peninsula college, although there is not that much clubs there but I love how they represent all diversity."

Graduate Student,4,I did a two year automotive program while getting my AAS. Hosted fun and exciting events on campus. Has a great soccer and basketball team. Family friendly.
Freshman,4,Peninsula College is the first college I have attended. It provided amazing resources and is in a beautiful location. It's staff members are both helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend PC.
Alum,4,"Peninsula College is a great community college with it's flaws like anything else in life. I grew here more in two years than in any time in my life. If you live in PA or close to it, it is a good starting point for other colleges. The campus is beautiful, with a lot of student diversity due to PCs international program."
Freshman,4,"An excellent college with friendly staff, instructors, and colleague. Here in the college, I enjoy the aroma from the Olympic Peninsula nature: starting from the mountains, the strait of Juan De Fuca, cold, windy surrounding, and of course, deer everywhere! Despite the fact that the college does not have dorms, they provide services to search for a nearby place to live or living with awesome host parents. Clallam County busses are reachable, and it is free since I am the college student. With the surrounding around me, I feel comfortable studying in this college. In fact, my grade so far is satisfying!"
College Senior,4,Great school lots of fun.
College Senior,4,I'm learning some stuff I didn't learn in highschool. Can't wait to get my AA and graduate because of the small class list.

College Junior,4,I have had no trouble with availability and or interference of family commitments. Nor have I had any issues keeping caught up.
College Junior,4,"It is so wonderful how helpful the administration is, for an 39 year old student returning back to school to finish my education. The is so much help available for any class you enter into, with the math/writing lab and any tutors you may need! All that needs to be done is ask for help, and they are more than happy too!"
College Junior,4,Theteacuers are great and the learning atmosphere is great
College Junior,4,I took some adult education classes two years ago. This campus is pretty friendly and very nice people.Helpful and caring faculty.
College Senior,4,"The only issue that I have come by while attending Peninsula College, is the fact that alot of classes are only offered online. My Major is Accounting. These classes are only offered online, which shouldn't be the case in my opinion. Accounting is a very difficult course. By having the hands on experience with an instructor in a physical class is best."
College Junior,4,This college is awesome I love being apart of the culture they have there!
College Senior,4,"There has been a recent movement to offer many of the courses intended for the Nursing and Medical Assisting programs during the evenings for the convenience of many who are working and have children. This option for evening classes is available for anyone, of course. Additionally, there is a wide range of online classes that are an equally great experience."
College Senior,4,"This is a two year college, but it is not JUST a two year college. Many of the resources available to the students are incredibly helpful in finding a job with the new degree or transferring to a four-year university."
College Senior,4,"The customer support is always present in the financial aide office. This school is strict on deadlines, so it is best to get into a conversation with a knowledgeable person right away. They will work through with you your options before, during, and after your enrollment at PC"
College Junior,4,"The school is located at Port Angles which is really near to Victoria, Canada. The environment around school is nice and I think that also make the school unique. However, I wouldn't choose to study here again if I could do it all over again. The reason is I would like to explore new things, go different place and better weather."
College Junior,4,"I had taken public speaking class during winter quarter and my professor is very nice and kind. 

She provided many activities for students in order to get used to each other before the official speech.

She has the experience teaching in university for 7 years and she helped me a lots about my writing and essay."
College Freshman,4,My campus has excellent resources for students. We have an incredible media center/library. All of the campus buildings are newly built and in excellent condition and the grounds are very well kept. There are always student campus activities going on and the athletics center is excellent.
College Freshman,4,"There is a variety of types of students at my school. There is a wide ethnic diversity among students, and there is a well recognized international student exchange program. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other student activities. For being a small institution, my college has a very strong athletics program."

College Junior,4,A decent array of academics are offered for a community college.

College Senior,4,"As a Running Start student seeking my Associates of Arts, I have encountered a wide range of opportunities to do more within my program. The tutoring program and all the help available is amazing and easy to access."
College Senior,4,"As a community college, you'd think that not many higher level classes are offered. On the contrary, the math and science curriculums are highly developed. Recently, the college has added programs specifically for people who are working."
College Sophomore,4,Very helpful and friendly staff.
College Senior,4,Financial aid is very helpful and tuition office is happily helpful and understanding of financial situations.
College Senior,4,"My major at school is Welding and the workload they present us with can be, overwhelming at times but with determination and a straight head you can make it through better than you were before. The class also helps you obtain the knowledge you need to obtain many job opportunities."
College Senior,4,The programs here at the college go above and beyond when it comes to helping you obtain your career. They help you find all the knowledge you need for potential jobs and info on the companies you wish to work for so you may better prepare yourself for the real world.
College Senior,4,The teachers are very understanding with your work life and wish to see you accomplish your goals in the class. So they are flexible to a point when it comes to work life or family.
College Senior,4,The student body is very diverse and friendly with each other. The environment is very warm and welcoming making the student area a great place to study as you wait for your next class.
College Senior,4,"My experience with my online courses have been good for the most part. It is different to not have a teacher right there to help explain problems I am having trouble with, but I have been adapting. The work is challenging but can be done. The students have also been very helpful and happy to assist each other to the best of our abilities. The teacher has also been interacting with us in group discussions, hearing our opinions, voicing their own and debating with opposing opinions."
College Sophomore,4,my online classes are great but usually i like to have a physical person there to help me if i need help. but i can meet up with my professor if i need help.
College Senior,4,Good school and campus to go to
College Senior,4,I had an easy time transferring but it was a process
College Senior,4,Straight forward and never had a problem personally

College Senior,4,I am comfortable at this school. I would do it all over again if I could.
College Senior,4,I think I am getting my money's worth. The financial aid office is on top of everything. They are quick to respond to emails. Very informative and helpful in person and really straight forward with the information they need from you.
College Senior,4,There are some time that i do get frustrated with the work but other then that class are fun and you learn a lot.
College Senior,4,It is different fro other school because it is small and there is more one on one for the classes.
College Senior,4,The academics at Peninsula is great. Also a lot of fun.
College Senior,4,You get a lot of class that are jest about your major.
College Senior,4,All the resource in campus are easily to get to and easily to understand.
College Junior,2,I've had several professors display highly unprofessional behavior and poor judgment.
College Junior,2,They don't offer career services.
College Junior,2,This is a very small town so if you want to stay here there may not be a job available for what your degree is in. There are no job fares offered here. There are possible internships though!
College Junior,2,There are not many job or internship prospects in my campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nothing Special â€“ We don't seem to have it together. Classes do not fit together conveniently for scheduling. There are limited degrees classes, and classes fill up quickly. The campus seems too big for what it accomplishes."
College Senior,2,"Buggy System, Low Standards for the Students â€“ I am displeased with the online classes at Peninsula, but I chose to take them out of convenience when I could so I could have a more flexible work schedule. Almost all of the classes, and most notoriously the online English classes are considered extremely easy by the students at Peninsula College. Most of the ones with mediocre content do not even help us to learn self-discipline because the the work-load is so light. Not to mention, half of the time the school's server is down and we cannot access our classes!"
College Student,2,"Beautiful Library â€“ The library is fantastic, the student center is okay, but the computers are frequently broken and unusable. There are many activities for international students, but very few for the national students.  The campus is very pretty, but there is simply not enough parking for the students!"
College Student,2,"I really love the way financial aid is so well directed and questions are answered quickly, but for a junior college prices are very high.  I am working nearly full time and have high financial aid rewards, but I am still barely making ends meet.  I live very simply and rarely eat out, but school truly drains the budget."

Sophomore,5,I like that the school is small enough that I don't feel lost on campus or that the staff actually does care about each student. You don't feel like a number. I also run track for the school and I like the relationship that I have with my coaches and the team. It really does feel like family.
Graduate Student,5,"The people at the University of Lynchburg is what makes it so special. The small campus atmosphere lets students build genuine relationships with professors, staff, and peers. It is such a great school that I couldn't imagine going anywhere else to get my Masters."
Sophomore,5,The smooth transition to online learning due to the pandemic could not be done without the hard work and efforts of the professors and others involved. The professors were lenient with the amount of coursework and maintained a good speed of teaching materials so that students would not be overwhelmed. They were also available for online meetings and open to assist in many ways.
Alum,5,This is a great school. This is a great school This is a great school. This is a great school. This is a great school.
Alum,5,I did not take any online courses at LU. I did not take any online courses at Lu I did not take any online courses at LU
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of Lynchburg has been great!  I have made many new friends from all across the country, and have experienced diverse situations.  I am a student athlete, and all of the equipment we use for lifting is great and new.  The classrooms are also very modern.  Last semester, I had a class in one of the newer classrooms.  The walls in the classroom were all whiteboard, so we could all collaborate during lecture."
Freshman,5,University of Lynchburg is a college where you can grow as an individual and become very successful. I love the community and everyone is so positive.
Junior,5,"I love the University of Lynchburg. The community here is encouraging, welcoming, and inclusive. I have had the best experience here and have met my best friends and future bridesmaids."
Freshman,5,"I love how inclusive it is, and if I could change one thing, it would probably be how expensive housing and meals are."
Sophomore,5,"very good school. Teachers are very helpful and are willing to help you with any problems during office hours. This University is very diverse, with a lot of athletic teams. Dorms and housing are very nice as well its a safe place to be. Then the campus is always being taken care of. then finally campus food is amazing!"
Niche User,5,They are fantastic!!  Every experience I have had on campus has been personalized.  I even receive follow up mail.
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior accepted into University of Lynchburg.  I have had a tremendous experience while visiting the school for the tour, an overnight visit and scholarship day.  During my visits, I got to experience the dorm life, attend a swim meet with the team and meet some of the professors within my field of study.  I also got to go to a pep rally and hang out with students and talk about the campus life, student population and professors and academics.  Each experience has confirmed my decision to attend the University of Lynchburg."
Freshman,5,It has been an awesome experience here at this university. It is so diverse and much smaller than other universities. Absolutely love it.
Freshman,5,It’s a beautiful campus and the Westover honors college is worth it. The only issue is that there is no shops or food near the campus and the dorms are a bit outdated.
Freshman,5,"The University of Lynchburg is one of the best liberal arts colleges. They are a diverse and inclusive community. Student involvement is a top priority and you never feel alone. The school has amazing academics and phenomenal clubs and associations. The highlight of the school is the music department, such an amazing program."
Junior,5,"The teachers and other staff are always there to help you, if you need it. They have the PASS program and other resources that help you in your studies."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the University of Lynchburg a lot. All of the professors I have had are great at teaching. They are also very kind and passionate about what they do, and obviously care a lot about the success of their students. The campus is also very nice, and there are always all kinds of activities going on."
Alum,5,I loved going to Lynchburg College. I had wonderful professors who truly cared about their students and wanted them to succeed. In addition my classmates were from very diverse backgrounds and cultures and inspired me everyday.
Freshman,5,The University of Lynchburg was a great experience for me because that was my first visit to a college. I loved how old students welcome the new students and how nice the tours are. I don't feel that I will change something about the school right now but I really love my experience there and I look forward to starting on the fall.
Sophomore,5,"I have found my home at the University of Lynchburg. Moving from MA to VA was a terrifying pursuit, but exceptionally worth it. I have made the best friends of my life. I have joined a sorority, became a member of the Westover Honors College, and became Vice President of Recruitment for my Panhellenic Council. The education I receive at this institution is like no other. I have created both professional and personal relationships with my professors, and I couldn't ask for better!"
Senior,5,I love the small classroom sizes of this school. I am not just another face in the crowd or another number on the roster. I know all of my professors on a personal level. I would like to see more food options on campus and more parking for the students.
Niche User,5,I like everything about the University of Lynchburg from the campus and dorms to the food and classes.
Alum,5,"I loved the sense of togetherness and familiarity the faculty, staff, and students had for each other. My professors were amazing and only wanted me to succeed in what I wanted to do."
Graduate Student,5,It has a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion! The faculty and staff are friendly and willing to help. There is always something going on so it is impossible to be bored.
Graduate Student,5,"Lynchburg College is a school that feels like home. Professors and administrators care deeply about students and work with them to help them succeed. Students have the opportunity to travel, lead, and complete research with professors. There is always an opportunity to grow in one's field. Attending Lynchburg was the best choice I ever made."
Freshman,5,"I love how involved the community of students are at Lynchburg College. Everyone is willing to give a helping hand when needed, especially concerning academics. The professors are fair and trustworthy."
Niche User,5,"Currently enrolled for the 2018-2019 year starting as a freshman and I am in love with the small size of the campus and classes and how teachers are more concerned about the connection with students than about their own social lives.  Teachers are willing to meet at any hour of the day, including 10 at night."
Freshman,5,I loved everything about Lynchburg College when I attended the Open House and that's the reason I accepted the offer.
Freshman,5,"I love the community and diversity here at Lynchburg College. We are like a big family, also the professors are really helpful to we the students. There’s always someone to help you out, so no one is left out."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love how close all the buildings are to each other. It makes getting to each class a lot easier because you don't have to wonder around in confusion. All of the professors are really nice too. They always encourage coming to visit them during their office hours just in case you have any questions or simply want to hang out.
Sophomore,5,I like the close community feel of the campus. The teachers have small class sizes allowing the lessons to be more individualized to the needs of the students in that class. The food is great. The area is beautiful.
Junior,5,I feel Lynchburg College is an amazing higher education institution that provides students and families with peace of mind and acceptance. I love being able to walk around campus and feel wanted and accepted. It is a campus that makes feel proud to be apart of something bigger.
Sophomore,5,Lynchburg College is an excellent college for your education. The environment is very inviting and feels like you have a new family.  Faculty and staff are kind and are always willing to help you.
Sophomore,5,"Lynchburg College is the right fit for me.  I like the academic program as well as the small campus environment.  People here are friendly, helpful, and easy to work with, including instructors.  

Our athletic program is great and various sports have won ODAC division and NCAA tournaments.

A fully accredited school, Lynchburg College decided in 2017 that they will change their name to the University of Lynchburg in 2018."
Freshman,5,"My first year of being a Hornet is almost up. My first comment about this school is that everyone is so friendly and kind, regarding both faculty and students. Everyone helps you when you are down, and that is what you need when you're transitioning to High school to college. I'm terrible at math, in fact,  my first test grade was a 65. Ouch. They have study sessions here called ""PASS"". I started going to every PASS session I could to try and get some sort of help. Because of Lynchburg offering study sessions, my previous test grade was an 86 and I am incredibly proud of my grade rising. The campus is beautiful, my Instagram is amazing now thanks to the sun setting pictures here. I can leave for class 5 minutes before it starts and still gets there on time. Walking to other dorms or the cafe to get food is so easy to get too and quick to walk too. Overall, I wouldn't change being here at Lynchburg College. It's everything I could ask for in a school."
Alum,5,I loved it at Lynchburg College. The faculty and staff were the best. If you did not understand something they tried there best to help you to the point were you can understand it. The sports were awesome and they honored the LC on their chest. The student body was even better and they were very nice and I couldn't of asked for a better undergraduate degree program to be apart of.
College Sophomore,5,There are so many jobs a students can hold on campus. I am a residential assistant.
College Sophomore,5,"You will always see campus security around campus. Also, the counselors make a note to meet upperclassmen and freshmen in regards to sex crimes and how to help someone who is a victim."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the close proximity the dorms is are to the classrooms. Also, it is nice to have several lounges where I can interact with the residents in the building."
College Sophomore,5,I got the opportunity to be a Residential Assistant and receive great educational advice.
College Freshman,5,The health center is great and allows for students to be treated on campus.
College Freshman,5,I love my college and would not rather go anywhere else in the country!
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't rather have a degree from anywhere else!
College Freshman,5,Housing is great it provides a wonderful party atmosphere!
College Freshman,5,I am part of the Phi Kappa Tau chapter at Lynchburg college and it is absolutely amazing.
College Freshman,5,Athletics are something that Lynchburg College really prides itself on.
College Freshman,5,Great overall college atmosphere. Though it is only a Division III school it feels like a Division I atmosphere.
College Junior,5,There are no noticeable or overwhelming problems on campus
College Freshman,5,"The campus is relatively small and everything is within 10 minutes walking distance. There is an extremely low rate of crime both on campus and the area surrounding campus. Campus security is constantly patrolling campus grounds as well as making a great effort to get to know the students. They make it obvious that their goal is to keep the students safe, not to get them us trouble. The students feel comfortable contacting campus security in the case of emergency. We also have access to the ""Live Safe"" app which allows us as well as campus security to track an find our location should we need them to in the event of an emergency. I feel completely safe walking around campus, whether it is from the library or any building late hours of the night."
College Freshman,5,"Being a varsity student athlete, it is very helpful having small class sizes (20-25) with professors who help to work around my schedule. The professors here are all very passionate and knowledgeable about what they teach and love teaching. There is a wide variety of classes offered and every year more majors are being added to a masters program."
College Freshman,5,"65% of the student body are athletes both varsity, intramural, and club. There are 3 available gyms which are all in great condition, the equipment is often refurbished. The professors help to make balancing athletics and academics easier for the student."
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are small so there is a lot of one-on-one time and assistance from professors. The student body contains a wide variety of students from many different places, including international students which provides great opportunities to experience new things and people. The campus is beautifully physically and there are numerous different resources to help guarantee student's academic success. The professors also work alongside athletes' schedules which is extremely helpful. I would not have chosen another school."
College Junior,5,"HUGE anti-hazing policy, zero tolerance for it."
College Freshman,5,"A few professors didn't connect as much with me, but were still very good. However, the ones that did made the classroom feel a little more like high school. In high school a lot of people didn't like the teacher-student relationship because they were still seen as children, however, I was respected because I was a good and obedient student. That is how the professors treat me. I was pretty close with my French professor who was originally from Paris and my English professor. The two of them did not just talk to me about my grades or assignments, but about my future and passions. It was weird and nice because I was an equal to them. Not nearly education-wise, but I am an adult and they saw me as such."
College Freshman,5,We have the livesafe app it's great
College Freshman,5,Bill is the best security officer
College Freshman,5,Small school so you make new friends very easily. Everyone is friendly.
College Freshman,5,Everything about LC is great.
College Freshman,5,"LC is home for me, and the people are family."
College Freshman,5,"Lynchburg just has wonderful people always willing to help one another, I couldn't ask for better teachers or friends here, here I have found a new home I wouldn't want to be at any other college."
Junior,4,"The University of Lynchburg is a great place to be. The faculty and staff are very friendly and helpful. The facilities are mostly really nice, and the quality of education is great. The parking is not the greatest and a few of the residence halls are sub-par, but the overall experience is a good one."
Senior,4,There are professors that are specifically trained for online instructions . This makes online instruction effective so that you actually learn something and feel less strained. Some classes that are taught online can be stressful but professors are very understanding.
Senior,4,"This University can offer you a lot, with such a small campus community you are sure to find a place that lets you feel like your authentic self. You may not find a hugely diverse student population but the community that is there is tight knit. Student culture is built around athletics (at least 50% of students participate in athletics) and activities like crab fest that is sponsored by the student activities board."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Lynchburg is a welcoming community of faculty, staff, and students who are closely working together towards improving the quality of education at this institution and encouraging all to engage with the wider community in activities and service opportunities."
Senior,4,"My reason for going here was because of how beautiful the campus looked. It is also easy to navigate since all of the academic buildings are close together. The school continues to improve on services that could be lacking, so there is proof that they listen to their student's voices."
Freshman,4,"University of Lynchburg is a nationally recognized private university where students gain a greater heart for humanity and a mindset of individual growth, emphasizing the students."
Senior,4,"As a raising senior at the University of Lynchburg, I am satisfied with the advancing curriculum and infrastructure of the university. I came to Lynchburg with the intentions of majoring in Psychology and Studio Art with an Emphasis in Art Therapy and I will be graduating this coming school year with exactly that."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Lynchburg is a small liberal arts campus that tailors to the needs of every student. There are a lot more resources on campus for students to achieve in the setting they best feel comfortable with because the campus has transitioned officially to a University. The students, staff, and professors are there to guide you and help you grow and prosper in a new environment. There is always a friendly face and someone who is willing to open doors for you, both figuratively and literally. If I had to change something about the University of Lynchburg it would be the availability of food on the campus. There are not many food options on campus and the various times that the cafeteria and other places are open make it hard to know what is available. Although the availability of food is one thing I would change, the overall atmosphere of the campus is warm and welcoming and ready for anyone willing to contribute to keeping the vibe on campus lively."
Freshman,4,"I like the fact that UL has a very open, affirming, and diverse climate. If anything had to change, I'd say that there needed to be more gender-inclusive bathrooms in the class buildings, as well as in the dorms."
Junior,4,Very welcoming and friendly school. Needs to work on listening to students and improve security especially dealing with cameras and watching over the campus.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman here but I absolutely love it. The classes are great (except Spanish), the teachers are awesome, and the campus is beautiful. Admittedly, washing and drying clothes is expensive, so I would rather go home and do it instead of here. Especially since there are only two washers and dryers on each floor of one of the freshman residencies, and there's a lot of people on a floor. The food in the dining hall is decent, and there are other options like a grill and a nachos place, as well as Dominios. The Starbucks here sucks, but we do have a great coffee shop that is better in another building (and it's way better)."
Alum,4,"Professors want their students succeed and will help them in any way that they can. Financial aid could be better, especially with their second degree students. Social climate is not the best for minority students."
Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the University of Lynchburg.  I have made many amazing friends and worked with amazing faculty.  I have had opportunities for leadership positions.  However, I would like to see the physics department revamped as the faculty there do not have much concern for their students."
Freshman,4,"I am in the Westover Honors Program, which means I take different general ed. classes, such as Humanities and colloquiums. I cannot complain about the academics here. I am challenged in my classes, but not to the point where my GPA or confidence in my abilities suffer. All of my professors thus far have been good and they take the time to get to know their students. My dorm is also good, although I am looking forward to the new one being built for next year. My current dorm has AC/heat and new bathrooms, but it could still use some upgrades. The dorm is conveniently located near the student center gym and the dining hall, as well as my classes. The dining hall food is good and there are usually decent options for meals. Overall, I am happy to be at UL."
Alum,4,"My time at Lynchburg College will always be cherished and a memorable four years. However, the school has recently made some changes that I'm not on board with, including becoming the University of Lynchburg on July 1st. This, and other changes, has driven the tuition up for the college. Some of the facilities and resources don't match this new price tag. However, the teachers are what make this place amazing; they truly care for the students and our education, and us as people overall. They push us to grow and learn and take the time to help us when we need it."
Sophomore,4,"Lynchburg College is a small private school that is very homey. I like the closeness I feel to students and staff members. The professors know you very well because there are small classes, and they are very dedicated and caring in helping students succeed. It is a very comfortable school and there is often a lot of familiar faces. I liked that once I stepped on campus I didn't feel intimidated at all, and rather fell right in with everyone else. The campus is small, and it is impossible to get lost. Classes take about 5 minutes to walk to, and many activities are usually taking place constantly around campus. Lynchburg College also resides in the city of Lynchburg, which offers a lot to do also. There are great shops, and restaurants, and many hikes and trails to do also."
Freshman,4,"I love that even though I’m a freshman I was able to study abroad for a semester, unlike most larger schools. I also enjoy the small class sizes and relationships with faculty and staff. The seasons that surround the school year also make it easily a perfect place for pictures and reading on the Dell."
Sophomore,4,"It has a nice community feeling and provides ample entertainment for all, along with great seminars. Students get yo feel so very connected to one another. The professors really care about your ability to succeed."
Freshman,4,I have been in love with Lynchburg College since the second I toured. Lynchburg does a great job at providing a great experience for each an every student. Lynchburg could use improvements in the greek life segment. Overall I would highly recommend Lynchburg.
Freshman,4,Lynchburg College does a good job making sure students feel like more than just a number on campus and that they are thoroughly supported throughout their academic process.
Sophomore,4,"I like everything about LC. Its a lot of fun if you pay attention and do your work. If you don't, you'll still have a good time."
Senior,4,"I absolutely love my college! I'm a senior now and I'm graduating in the Spring of 2018! I love the close relationship I have made with my professors and I'm looking forward to continuing my graduate study here. What I love most about my campus is the many opportunities present, the small classroom size, and the great organizations and greek life here. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great campus to study at!"
Sophomore,4,"At first, I was apprehensive about attending Lynchburg College, and I don't regret my decision at all! Everyone is friendly towards each other and there is a sense of community and unity among the body of students. I will admit that there are certain professors that don't care about you/ course material isn't explained well, but that's only the minority."
Freshman,4,"I was an athlete at lynchburg college. They have many housing options to choose from and areas to eat. They are also connected with a few food trucks. they have great academics and many education opportunities. The campus is very lively, great diversity, and many activities for you to get involved with."
Alum,4,LC is an amazing school with tons of academic programs. It has a beautiful campus with several activities always going on. You feel like part of a family here. The professors and advisers are extremely helpful and push you to be all that you can be. Lynchburg College is the best way to get an education in a small environment without the big hassle of a university standard.
Junior,4,It's very inviting and the staff and faculty are amazing people! Love the atmosphere and the courses I get to take. But some thing's could be better.
Niche User,4,"It was an overall wonderful experience, I enjoyed seeing the beautiful campus, meeting amazing and influential individuals."
Sophomore,4,I love Lynchburg College. They need to work on their diversity a lot. The party scene is definitely lacking. Campus security does not seem to let the students know when there is real danger on campus until after the situation has dissipated. The classes are challenging but not too hard. The class sizes are no greater than 25 students.
College Freshman,4,Athletic director is there to help you
College Freshman,4,The school is challenging but it is worth it. Teachers do want you to succeed. There are opportunities to network.
College Sophomore,4,Most of my classes were engaging and the professors gladly answered questions.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not too interested in being apart of Greek life. However, my friends that are apart of Greek life do enjoy the atmosphere. Some fraternities and sororities were more difficult to get inducted into than others."
College Sophomore,4,I do not really follow athletics at my school.
College Junior,4,The professor are amazing people. They are also so helpful in and outside of class.
College Junior,4,Campus is mostly safe. They inform us when anything happens around the city that we are in other than that I am comfortable and feel safe walking around campus at any hour
College Junior,4,The whole school likes to be involved in athletics. We have a lot of school spirit and everyone comes out to support the sports teams
College Junior,4,It is a smaller school so you can make close relationships with not only friends but teacher and faculty as well. They are also always fun and adventurous things to do on and off campus as well
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of diversity within the campus, both the students and professors."
College Junior,4,When a student earns a degree from lynchburg it tells more about them as a person and academic.  They grow and become much better people while at lynchburg and character overall is very good.
College Junior,4,"Some professors are almost too smart to make things lament to teach.  But majority of professors use great teaching methods and work individually with students when they see someone in need.  They are always open for office hours and they really get to know you as a person.  The courses are hard depending on your major, while popular majors are in business and economics."
College Junior,4,"Sports whether it be the varsity or club lacrosse teams and many more, are always competitive.  Specifically men's lacrosse, women's soccer, and men's and women's basketball are perennial powerhouses in their conferences and nationally."
College Junior,4,"If you're looking for a small school feel Lynchburg is it.  The feeling of being home is very strong while at school. And when everyone knows everyone, it gives a feeling of family."
College Freshman,4,Alumni are very involved in the school in reference to donations and internship opportunities. There are many job opportunities for students both on campus and easy access to information for jobs off campus.
College Freshman,4,Club sports are fun to get involved in and provide less workload as a varsity sport
College Freshman,4,Very nice community of faculty and staff that make you feel at home and welcome.
College Junior,4,There are so many job opportunities on campus.
College Junior,4,"Overall decent, finances are a pain."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is great, live with friends."
College Junior,4,Do not have a varirty of varsity sports to look at.
College Junior,4,Some things are more challenging than others.
College Junior,4,"I would not change my college choice if I had the chance to go back. I have met some of the most amazing people and it was a fantastic experience going out of state. I expected more from a college in terms of facilities, class difficulty, class options, and class size but then again those are the things that make Lynchburg different and unique from other schools."
College Junior,4,The housing options on the southside campus are great! Its just the dorms that need work. AND THE HOUSING PROCESS IS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE… they need to change that immediately. extremely unlucky for the people that put all their marbles in one basket and then don't make the cut for the room they wanted
College Junior,4,"I enjoy the sense of community and closeness. The athletic department is slowly making changes that are benefitting the school and its image. But we are just out of date in technologies within the science department, our student housing facilities are old and need remodeling, the school's gyms/athletic facilities need to be expanded, also the food options on campus are limited and student's are not able to walk anywhere close for off famous food options."
College Freshman,4,"I like all the things the Greeks do for LC and the community. I considered joining for both the friendships and title, but the price is what deterred me. I just think college tuition is a lot of money on its own. But I have met some great people in all of the sororities and its not cliquey."
College Freshman,4,I haven't really reached this process yet
College Freshman,4,I wish that the professors were a little bit more interactive
College Sophomore,4,professors are very passionate about what they teach and provide ways for students to excel
College Sophomore,4,campus security plays an active role in maintaining safety on campus for all
College Sophomore,4,i don't leave on campus
College Sophomore,4,very friendly and professional and understanding tutors who care about you as a student. In a Christian community which relates closely to my background. Everyone is so helpful.
Senior,2,"My experience at the University of Lynchburg has been deeply disappointing. For the most part, the academics are subpar.  Instead of pushing students to grow and learn, they water down the content so everyone can pass. There are seniors who are graduating that still can't do basic algebra or write a concise coherent sentence. Don't waste your money here. You can get a much better education and college experience at almost anywhere else."
College Sophomore,2,The academics are not challenging at all. Not a lot of variety either.
College Junior,2,"The sororities are much stronger than the fraternities.  The frats are not a big scene on campus, and are generally seen as a way to make friends for someone who isn't playing a sport."
College Freshman,2,The school is very small with non challenging courses.
College Junior,2,The healthcare nurses on school grounds are not helpful nor are they willing to work with other Doctors.. everyone goes to MedExpress
College Freshman,2,being a small lynchburg fosters clinques making it really hard to have meaningful relationships with people
College Freshman,2,It's basic. Greek life really isn't that popular
College Freshman,2,Never felt like I fit into a category on campus. It did not feel like a second home to me. It is not a great school and seems over priced.
College Freshman,2,"For freshman, it is really bad. It only gets worse for sophomores. It is not a good thing at all. It brings peoples moral down and it makes people feel like it is jail."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are pretty depressing. Some students are depressing. The atmosphere s generally okay. In an area that has crack houses everywhere, drugs are very popular. On campus it is so different that you just want to kick your self and ask ""why did I go here?"""
College Senior,2,"Okay let's continue...

FOOD: Here are your options... Dining Hall, Westover, Brewed Awakenings (Cafe), Dominos, El Sie. I don't even like talking about the food here because it ruffles my feathers so much, but here we go... In layman's terms...Dining Hall = left overs = diarrhea. Westover has O.K. food but it's WAY over-priced. Brewed Awakenings is definitely your best bet for food - healthiest and least expensive. Dominos is Dominos...just greasy junk besides their pre-made salads that sit out all day. And El Sie is kind of like Chipotle but also not like Chipotle at all...really what we're lookin' at here is just a more expensive and explosive version of diarrhea. So yeah...food sucks. Your off-campus options..fast food is all over, there's Cookout, Panera, Olive Garden, Panda Express :), etc. I personally eat clean so I go to Walmart or Kroger for groceries and cook my own food. Parking is also horrible at LC, every student would attest to that. Simply isn't enough supply for the demand and the security KNOWS this but still writes $50 tickets for people who desperately park wherever they see a spot. Lastly I'll mention that the faculty and staff (the teachers) really hold your hand here..It's a small school and there's more 1on1 with your professors but BOY do they baby you through this thing...most kids are NOT ready for life after school upon graduating from LC.

I think I've touched base on enough. There's more...and if you attend this school you'll figure it out. Overall, I think the idea of LC is nice...a small, somewhat secluded and good-looking school with impressive amenities. But all it has going for it in that equation is its size. Trust me, you really don't want to look back and say to yourself ""Man, college could have been SO much different..."" Advice to you? Would be to step outside of yourself and think about what college and the experiences it brings should look like for you in the future. My guess is that you won't find it here. Good luck!"
College Senior,2,"It's not the worst...because it COULD be worse. But even then, LC is absolutely horrible. Like..coming from a senior, been here for 4 years, I'm trying to help you here, so listen. Let's kick it off what's ultimately most important - academics. Technically, LC is a university with how many majors we offer to our students so in that aspect, LC is killin' it. But the thing is...like why would someone pay 40k a year to go here for a psychology major..? That literally makes me LOL..get your life together, kid who does that. IDK all of the best majors here but I know nursing is #1, our Athletic Training program is rigorous but super intensive and the best around, and Ex Phys is growing as well. In summary of the academics, we have a lot of options, but why would you go to such an expensive and unimpressive school for a meaningless major? Anyways, moving on...the living conditions here are absolutely horrendous. Dorms will be dorms, there was no surprise there and unless you're on a sports team or you're a genius with a super high GPA, you'll be stuck in there for Freshman AND Sophomore year. That's right, use your fingers...that's 4 semesters in a sweaty, smelly, AC and Heat deprived 4 to 5 floor building filled up with a bunch of drunk and horny teens...don't bring your black-lights. For upper-classmen, your best bet is the apartments or ""town-houses"". The ACTUAL houses are so gross..I live in one currently with 4 housemates and it's brought me to my breaking point a few times. Just a really really bad environment for learning and bad investment. Every single house is quite literally falling apart, I don't think the houses have ever been rebuilt since 1903 when the college was founded. Every single house has a locked door leading to a whole other bottom floor where the college stores random things. There's mold and cobwebs everywhere down there and even a half-bath. The houses desperately need to be restored from top to bottom. Continuing this review somewhere above ^"
College Freshman,2,"Lynchburg like to say they are super welcoming, but Ihave not felt very welcome"
College Freshman,2,The food is worse than I had anticipated
College Freshman,2,"Dorms are pretty crappy, but that applies to lots of schools. You have to live on campus all 4 years which sucks."
College Freshman,2,It is way too rural for my liking. I'm more of a city type of girl.
College Senior,2,The lacrosse team runs everything and they're a team full of immature assholes.
College Senior,2,It has not helped me much with my schooling
College Freshman,2,"Of campus party's in college houses are bad. A lot of sex, drugs and alcohol. Many first timers go ""to hard"" and end up sick."
College Junior,2,There are no places at or around Lynchburg College for a nightlife.
College Freshman,2,There were a lot of issues on campus this year and way too many break-ins
College Freshman,2,It's difficult applying for scholarships.
College Freshman,2,We are in the state of Virginia where you will experience all four season within three days.
College Sophomore,2,Public transportation around here sucks. It really needs work.
College Sophomore,2,"Personally I think Lynchburg is boring for young people, especially for young adults once they graduate.  There's not much going on off campus, but there is a lot of hiking which I still have yet to enjoy as much as I should. "
College Sophomore,2,"Parties are house parties, there's really no bars in Lynchburg they're all restaurants that turn into bars on the weekends.  You do have to drive everywhere here, the taxis are terrible too. "
College Sophomore,2,I don't know what kids do here for fun LC is boring
College Sophomore,2,"I think the school is small and quaint, everyone knows everyone its a warm welcoming atmosphere."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty much the same every weekend, go to a bigger school and experience a real party. Pretty cliquey party scene, most sports teams throw parties. Most frats and teams let you in, except girls soccer and guys lacrosse.  "
College Sophomore,2,"The food is the same everyday of the week. It is so unhealthy, be prepared to weigh a lot because you have slim choices. "
College Freshman,2,"There are public busses that students can take for free, but they're a bit of a hassle to figure out. "
College Freshman,2,"Very limited healthy options, dining hall closes at 7. "
College Freshman,2,"Security is always around, health services are below par."
College Senior,2,"Greek life at Lynchburg College is really only there for parties. They are very rude to people who are not in that sorority or fraternity. If you turn down a bid from either one, you are shunned from those people but it is not a big deal at Lynchburg College because there is so many other things to do on campus that most people don't want to join anyways."
College Junior,2,"Our fitness center blows, there's no pool, the field is always taken, and any kind of fitness classes are basically non-existent and cost a fee. 
Turkey Bowl is legit though."
College Sophomore,2,"As a commuter student, I find it really hard to find a good parking space. I usually have to walk quite a ways to get to the buildings where my classes are. Simply put, there just isn't enough parking."
College Sophomore,2,"I attend Lynchburg College which is a predominantly White college. There are a handful of students that have different backgrounds which makes them even more interesting. Although I am one of the few students of Black and Latino heritage at Lynchburg College, I feel more motivated to study the hardest because of how much my cultures are judged based on skin color."
College Senior,2,"There isn't much diversity on the campus. Most of the students come from Northern states like conneticut, massachusetts, and new jersey. They are preppy but all of the guys are really hot and in-shape. The girls are only somewhat pretty. There are singles here; not many people get into couples here and if they do, they don't stay long."
College Senior,2,They do a lot of activities for recruitment but they aren't involved in a lot of college activities. Most of the activites that they sponsor are only for Greek Life and when they aren't recruiting you don't hear anything from them.
College Freshman,2,My school is in a small town and has limited options
Senior,1,What I would like to see change is the concept on inclusiveness. The student's need to learn how to treat one another better as we are all struggling in college.
College Sophomore,1,I think that the party scene has a negative impact on the students experience
College Freshman,1,It is non existent. Kids will be victimized and then become too scared to talk to anyone that is part of the school about it.
College Freshman,1,no school spirit so games are boring here
College Freshman,1,some crappy fast food. hard to if you don't drive
College Senior,1,"Because it's a small school, they are small groups which means more expensive dues. I'm sorry but I can't afford $600 a year ON TOP of my tuition to wear greek letters and have 25 ""close"" girlfriends."
College Freshman,1,Parking is always really hard to find and tickets are given often
College Sophomore,1,"Two near-by schools you hardly know they are there. Nobody really interacts. Lynchburg is super sketch, not much to do off campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone does it, you probably won't get in trouble even if you don't know how to handle it. You can carry drinks, just hide them when security comes by. Marijuana is pretty strict, everyone does it though just keep it hidden and don't do it in the dorms. "
College Sophomore,1,"If you're looking to be alone forever and just hook up randomly with D3 douche bags who think they're the shit, come here. 
If your boyfriend or girlfriend goes here they're probably cheating on you.
If you're into sharing sexual partners come here, everyone sleeps with everyone. 
"
College Sophomore,1,"It's a pretty campus that lures you in, then you find out that there is nothing to do besides party on the weekend, which gets old because you're always with the same people. Then winter comes and the campus is ugly and there is still nothing to do. The campus stays the same, boring. "
College Junior,1,Not Many Places Available – There aren't many options that are close to campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,Transportation is limited. Transit bus or tai if you don't have a vehicle
Recent Alumnus,1,Off the Chains – There are no clubs in the area whick sucks for students that are looking for fun and entertainment.
College Junior,1,"Very Limited – Parking on campus is almost impossible. Students drive to classes that live two minutes away from the building and take all the spots for people who need them. There is not a need for driving around campus when you can walk, but facilty does not have much parking. Freshman can not have cars but for the most part I say no one really needs a car until junior or senior year with internships and clinicals. The school is suppose to be redoing parking over the summer to make more spots."

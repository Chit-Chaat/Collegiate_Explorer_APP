Graduate Student,5,The online experience was fairly easy with professors flexible and helping towards students. Everything was easy to understand and the campus has a library with computers for students that do not possess such materials as me.
Freshman,5,I’ve seen the school and so excited to start In The fall ! And as well from what friends have told me and there experience
Junior,5,The ambience is so nice and they encourage you in the spiritual aspect which is very good for the youth.
Senior,5,"The faculty and the teachers care about the student's personal, academic and spiritual life.  They are in constantly working to improve its services and facility for their students and employees."
Freshman,5,"The staff is amazing replying to all emails which is really important, they are very supportive and informative. The staff helped me and my mom through the whole process of applying for the university, different awards, and aid. I love how everyone is very united and very willing to just make life in college easier."
Junior,5,Is a great place to study. The diversity of cultures are amazing and is a great experience to interract with others countries. The profesors make a better place to challenge yourself to be the best student and profesional around the world.
College Junior,5,The school has a gate which is guarded at all times and there are security officers everywhere
College Junior,5,The staff does everything possible to meet the needs of each student
College Junior,5,They have dorms and houses
College Junior,5,Not only is it set on a spiritual setting but all the students and staff are all humble. They integrate our Lord into the teaching curriculum.
College Senior,5,"you don't get to see any drug scene neither any people drinking. drugs, alcohol are not allowed at school"
College Senior,5,"the courses are hard, that is relative depending on what you are majoring on. but the professors are great, they are very prepared and helpful. The quality of the courses are amazing, you learn a lot, and the class sizes it all depends."
College Senior,5,"Even though this is a school located in Puerto Rico is considered an accredited school by the States, so thanks to this, getting a nursing degree here it's the same as i would go to any school in the states. therefore getting my nursing degree at this school will help me to have a lot of job opportunities ."
College Senior,5,"The Greek life at my school is very good. I don't think Greek affects the social atmosphere of campus at all, but it brings joy and fun to the school. and Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks as fun and outgoing people."
College Senior,5,"Since I transferred from the States to my current school ( Universidad Adventista de las Antillas ) I have had the best experience in my whole entire career ! One of my favorite experiences at this school is to have the opportunity of participating in every school activity. This is one of my favorites because every week the school brings fun activities for the students. I believe that's not only what makes my school unique, but also to have the opportunity of meeting new people from all over the world. I would choose my school again, because despite the financial issues, I get to enjoy this beautiful Island of Puerto Rico while I am getting a degree in Nursing. And what makes it so special is that is FREE."
College Sophomore,5,They are really careful to ensure our health and safety.
College Sophomore,5,The courses have been knowledgeable and the professors excellent.  They have been very flexible and understanding and most of all they teach in a way that you actually learn.
College Sophomore,5,A lot of the students have been offered jobs as lab instructors.  Which is great because you help other students achieve their learning goals.  They also have a tutoring/ mentoring program in which students work as tutors or mentors for those who have trouble with certain subjects or assignments.
College Sophomore,5,"There are security guards at the gate and they are constantly roaming the campus 24 hrs. Even on weekends and Holidays.  There has never been any sexual assault report or incidents. It is extremely safe , every student has to have a background check every 6 months."
College Sophomore,5,"Housing is pretty economical. The advantage of living on campus is not having to look for parking.  Classes are pretty close by 5 minute walk for some.  the residents are very respectful and considerate, with keeping noise level down."
Graduate Student,4,"Being a native of the island I found my experience at Universidad Adventists de las Antillas to be quite exciting. The campus is hidden away in the mountains of Mayaguez, with a unique variety of students from all over the world. The dorm campus is safe and responsible and every night check-in is done. If you are a native English speaker, don't worry because most professors and students speak English. I would say it is if not the second on-campus official language. Though I enjoyed my years at Antillean and made life long friends I do wish the campus life would have been more lively. There should be more activities for both off-campus and on-campus students. I would have enjoyed more sports being practiced other than basketball and soccer. Also, more food options for students like myself whom have allergies. But most importantly a more devoted on-campus involvement because being in the dorms 24/7 can truly take a toll on students causing anxiety, boredom, and disinterest."
Junior,4,"La universidad es muy buena, tiene buenos profesores y personal administrativo. Es mas cara que las demás universidades pero tiene un ambiente bueno y amigable."
Freshman,4,"No College or University will ever be perfect or go according to our expectations.  But each has an area that they specialize in. Universidad Adventista de las Antillas has one of the best nursing programs in Puerto Rico. Also, the professors actually care whether you pass their class or not."
Senior,4,"It is a diverse school, however it lacks on academics. You can easily get a good grade in some classes. The science department is one of the bests. In the other hand if you are seeking to grow spiritually this is the perfect place. Its nature makes you have mental peace."
Senior,4,I like that Antillean is diverse and you can connect with different people about cultural backgrounds. I would like to see Antillean create more opportunities for students in athletics.
Graduate Student,4,"This was probably the best 4 years of my life where I grew academically, emotionally and spiritually to a level that I never would thought. At this university is where I came to truly know my passion with coaching and communication. Also this is the place where I bonded with God and made friends for life.
More than anything, it's not the regular university where you have no connection with the professors or staff members beyond the classrooms. This is the place where you feel like you are family with the professors, security guard, cleaning lady, staff members, class mates, room mates and ever the President of the university. Note to self that 'Universidad Adventista de las Antillas' is the most cultural diverse University in Puerto Rico. I made friends with people from countries that I've never heard before in my life.
I would recommend this university to everyone without thinking twice."
Senior,4,"My experience in Universidad Adventista de las Antillas is the best university with excellence in Nursing Programs with great professors that cares for the academic and spiritual benefits of the students. In administration they are trying to do the best they can so that any student could study with no problem.  I stopped my nursing degree for a few years but that didn't stop me and I finally got back, studying what I love best in the same university like a senior student of Nursing.  The university is different from others because they have lots of cultural diversity on campus with huge respect. I am blessed to be in Universidad Adventista de las Antillas in Mayaguez, PR."
Junior,4,"Antillean Adventist University is a place that not only prepares your mind, but also your hands and your heart. What I would like to change is the few opportunities for international students."
College Junior,4,I haven't t really explored that area.
College Senior,4,"i truly believe that safety and security is number one at my school . Since I have been here i have never heard of any crime or something bad that has happened on campus. Even though it is a small school, security is always on top of everything. even for parking, if you park where you are not supposed to be parked they will give you a ticket. For all these reasons i feel very safe at school."
College Sophomore,4,I am in nursing and i really appreciate how they have internships set up for us and regular clinicals too. I think they do a great job for setting up internships for every department.
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are not easy especially if your an english student, but they have a program called trio that assists students luke me with translation and tutoring. Proffesors are great but i find the older ones to be impatient at times. If ever experiencing a rude teacher make sure to go visit their office. I find that to be helpful in clearing the situation."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy living on campus. My dorm is home like
College Sophomore,4,It has been very character building.would so it again.
College Sophomore,4,"They have a huge pool.. which is used for swimming classes. and can be used after class hours and weekends for recreation, completely free for students and their families."
College Senior,4,"You come to this school and you cannot leave the same, the spirituality is contagious! I love it here. People are friendly and kind. Administration offices try to help you as much as possible. It's a community and professors and instructors know you and try to guide you to succeed as much as possible."
College Sophomore,4,"Some people can say it's not a big university , and that is true. But what i can say is that my university is an spiritual-based university that wants the students to live and study based on what God says. Another thing that makes my university unique is , that i can feel that i have very friendly environment, and i feel like i'm in family most of times."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience was great.  Had good teachers and great friends. The school wasn't small nor big, but it was perfect, because you knew everybody and you had like a second family."
College Sophomore,4,"Ok tenis courts, pool, basketball indoor and outdoor"
College Sophomore,4,Some days the food is excellent. Some days ok. Never bad food.
College Junior,4,they are Adventist so they have a lot of rules
College Junior,4,the facilities are in good conditions and they can be used by everyone
College Junior,4,i like it a lot
College Junior,4,the campus is located almost isolated and the fact that is a christian institution influences a lot on behavior so i consider is safe
College Freshman,4,"It is great to live in the dorm. People are very friendly, you  make friends almost everyday."
College Freshman,4,"Even though I don't have first hand knowledge about the off-campus housing, I have many friends that have recommended it. They haven't ever complained about anything, they have only said positive things about it."
College Freshman,4,"My experience has been very good. The university has planned a variety of activities on campus as well as off campus. I've been to the island's beaches, caves, rainforest, popular sightings, and malls. The island is really beautiful and the weather is always great. There are many things to do but again I don't have a car so I don't get to go many places. "
College Freshman,4,"The cafeteria food is excellent. I believe is 100% vegetarian, if not vegan. There isn't a variety of food to choose from but its good and healthy. The prices are pretty high. I don't buy much from the cafeteria, but I think its excellent."
College Freshman,4,"I believe parking at the university isn't a big issue. As far as costs go, I'm not sure due to the fact that I don't have a car. I do know that you are fined if you do not have a parking permit."
College Freshman,4,"The atmosphere here is very accepting and warm. The majority of people are very polite and kind. I've gotten rides from random strangers because they see me walking in such a road where there are no sidewalks, which could be potentially dangerous with the traffic. Since we're surrounded by water, the beaches are one of the main activities to do here, as well as the island's rainforest, caves, malls. There is a bit of danger but I haven't experienced anything that would make me not come back."
College Freshman,4,"The Antillean Adventist University is a campus of diverse people. They are very accepting on all type of people despite race, age, sexual orientation, religion, and beliefs. We have many people around the globe but predominantly from Northern and Southern America."
College Junior,4,"The weather is wonderful here. Sometimes it is hot, but usually it feels great."
College Sophomore,4,Many people come out successful.
College Sophomore,4,I love this place! It's Puerto Rico!
College Sophomore,4,It has gotten so much better.
College Sophomore,4,Easy to get a spot. 
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is extremely nice and loving. Great place to find God.
College Sophomore,4,there's good places on the campus but some parts are old and needs repairs
College Senior,4,They are very strict with restricted areas of parking and in the going in and out of the university for on campus students.
College Sophomore,4,Theres a lot of options for students that need financial aid. And theres even scholarships that you can apply to receive. The service to apply to financial aid is quickly and easy. And the faculty that work with that are really nice.
Junior,2,"Speaking as a honest student, antillean is full of teachers that read off of powerpoints, give random exams without warning. Cafeteria food is nasty and overly priced, the dorms are expensive and rat infested (old girls dorm) The people who work in the office are irresponsible, never show up on time or take super long lunch breaks. Absolutely no parking!!! over populated with students, the sports life suck !!! no teams just intramurals, the campus is full of construction instead of fixing necessary things there building things all over the place super disorganized ! but hey you get what you pay for... oh and student life sucks if you do not have a car."
College Senior,2,"they don't have much parking, and they just recently closed a lot."
College Senior,2,"I have had the worse college experience here, and I've been to 5 colleges before. This one is the worse.  If you're wanting to come here for nursing because there is no wait list or because of the cheap price, then this is your school.  But other than that anything else, any other school would be better.  I would never recommend this school to anyone, not even my worse enemy."
College Senior,2,It's a Seventh Day school so the drug and alcohol scene is really quiet but big.  Most students who live on campus have to go off campus and lie about where they are going.
College Senior,2,They have only a few vans that maybe fit 20 students legally.
College Senior,2,"Life on the campus is hard, you have to go off campus to have a really good time.  The school mostly is obsessed with church activities, they put the most emphasis on church activities."
College Freshman,2,"The computers are sometimes limited due to class, the WiFi connection isn't that great, printers get jammed, computers fail sometimes. I chose then to just bring my own laptop."
College Freshman,2,"The university transportation is usually for dorming students only. And they only give them a trip to the grocery store, the mall, and the airport I believe. Because I don't live on campus I have to find my own way around. The small town is down the hill but its not so close or safe to walk. "
College Junior,2,"The internet service is terribly slow, but there are enough computers for most students to use in the library for printing, etc. Each printed paper costs 10 cents."
College Junior,2,There are no transportation options except for a van that takes students to the mall occasionally. There is one van that goes to the airport. It costs $35-$40 and they fit in as many people as physically possible.
College Junior,2,"The housing process, cost, convenience, and social atmosphere are all great. Everyone is kind, and the dorm is super convenient as far as cost and affordability (like most everything at this university). However, there are NO amenities in these dorms, or on campus. We don't even have a student center here. The dorms don't provide toilet paper, or paper towel to dry your hands. There is one microwave that sometimes isn't functional...it is much better to live off campus at this university. Curfew is pretty early and strict as well."
College Junior,2,The food provided at Mi Casa the on campus caf isn't the best. They have high prices and the food is often salty.
College Freshman,2,"Small Space to Park Cars – Parking on campus can be a nightmare. Be sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class to ensure you'll get a space and make it to class on time. As a freshman, you get the worst parking."
College Junior,2,It is somewhat hard to find housing off-campus that is near the school because of price or availability. The pros are that you do not have to adhere to some of the absurd rules they have here which i have never heard of anywhere else. The landlords are okay once they are not living above you because they have no consideration. There are only few who are easy going or it is because they do not live near you so you have your privacy. There are sometimes ads for housing that are put up in the university by people outside or people who know where they are located. It is sometimes better to ask the people who you know that live off the campus or because they are quicker to help you by asking around to friends outside the university. Being off campus is worth the freedom and free of headaches.
College Senior,1,It's the same small choices of food everyday.
College Senior,1,"-The preceptor for the boys dorm is an accused rapist, he has a bad history of sexual harassment to female students.  His name is Lenny or Leonard. He has been fired before, but was recently rehired.

-The dorms are dirty.

-The dorms are small.

-The girls old dorm does not meet building inspection code.

-They are really strict about not going out at night.

-The dorms require permission slips to leave campus no matter how old you are.

-The preceptors are really lazy at their jobs."
College Senior,1,"It's overall a very lousy education system. I have been to 5 colleges in my life and this is by far the worst school I have ever walked into, I came here because I wanted to do nursing, and I didn't want to wait on a list for years, and the price was cheap....but that's exactly what my money got me...cheap"
College Senior,1,"They have a few guards that sit on their butts all day at look at cars come in and out, sometimes when they feel like doing something they will ride around in their little golf carts.  They are not armed, not even with pepper spray."
College Senior,1,The campus is very strict.
College Senior,1,"The nursing program is awful. The school is very unorganized with student documents.  They are terrible at efficiency. The lab classes at the hospitals are extremely lazy.  You have to practically teach yourself everything, thank God for Google and Youtube.  God knows how this school is still credited."
College Senior,1,I don't know much about it....
College Senior,1,"Everyone living at the dorms, have a curfew.  After 10:30pm you're not allowed to leave the campus."
College Senior,1,"He Cafeteria has been monopolized by one Dominican restaurant called ""Mi Casa"".  They are in contract with the school so that no other food vender may compete with them.  They are expensive, lazy done food, with inconvenient closing hours."
College Junior,1,Nothing exists. Not even real intramurals.
College Junior,1,I haven't seen anything worse. 
College Junior,1,"Once you are not of Spanish descent, they tend to cause more problems with you and the rules they as a university do not follow. I am talking from experience and the experiences others have had and experiences we have put to test by having our Spanish friends do the same things that we would get called out on and it never failed. They would never get in trouble but we would and when we asked what was their reason? They would stumble over their words, stay quiet, feel ashamed because we had them cornered or just walk away like they had all the right to do so."
College Junior,1,"I came to this university with an open mind, but that has made me change my mind. The professors do not accommodate for English speaks as the school has claimed that it does. The curriculum for my major is ridiculous because I have taken classes in a former university and what i have taken as a chapter in that university is a class at this university. Registration is a headache because they have lost important documents like my immunization records and had a hold on my account because they are getting audited and I had to get a copy of my immunization records again because all of a sudden after 4 years of going to the university they tell me they never had my records. The work load is reasonable, but now i am in my last year and because a teacher in my major left the university her classes have been scattered among the other professors and because of that I have to wait a whole year again to graduate because of their inconsideration."
College Freshman,1,"The computers are always occupied, that's if they're working at all. The printing is ridiculous, there so many rules and its a real hassle to print a simple paper, on top of that you have to pay to print. This semester the dorm computers were out for almost a whole 2 months. More than half the semester"
College Senior,1,"Why Live on Campus When Rent Is Cheap? There is a new girls dorm being built, but until it's done, the existing dorms are the only option, which I do not recommend. The dorm is alright if there are no other options, but there is a curfew at 10:30pm Sunday-Friday and Saturday until 11pm. There are extensions for the upper class females, which is a house 0.7miles away from the main campus that includes a full kitchen, living room, 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, laundry room, and yard. Despite the age of the student, permission slips are required to leave the campus at any time of the day/night. Over night permission slips are used a lot if students want to just ""get a way."" The cost of the dorms is a great price and the convenience of being on campus is nice with no traffic or  if there is no transporation available to get to the school. The social atmosphere is nice, because the people is what makes the school."

Sophomore,5,It is my first year at Arizona State University and I am business major. The experience has been great. I never got the chance to go into the campus. I was able to learn about different programs they offer to help students. Such as tutoring center.
Sophomore,5,The online experience is great. The professors are extremely helpful. The were able to educate students and also provide resources to students.
Senior,5,"I like ASU west campus because it is small enough to feel very comfortable. I don't have to panic about trying to find things or be able to walk to them in time as everything is in a central location. A small campus like that just feels safer too. Also, they have a Starbucks in the library which is conveniently located which I appreciate."
Senior,5,"Since Covid, all my classes are online. I feel like the professors have turned lemons into lemon-aid and are doing the best they can. It has not been seamless, but it is a solution to a unique problem."
Alum,5,Campus is beautiful and everyone on campus is super nice and helpful! Lots of great study spots outside when the weather isn’t too hot. Campus is a little secluded but still close to stores and restaurants.
Alum,5,"Online classes are all laid out and organized nicely. If you like to plan, then the online classes at ASU are for you. If you have questions on assignments or coursework, either the professor or TA will get back to you quickly!"
Junior,5,"I love how friendly everyone on the West campus is. The professors are wonderful and always willing to help. The campus is quiet, making it easy to focus on studying. If you live close to the West campus (and if schools open again) I would highly recommend this campus over the others. It is a lot less stressful and gives off that small college vibe."
Junior,5,"I took classes online obviously because of the pandemic. All my classes were in person before. However, the professors and other faculty were well equipped to handle the change to online learning. I have heard good things about the online experience from kids who actually take classes online. The professors didn't bombard me with emails and remained reasonable (mostly) about the work load."
Junior,5,"Let me preface by saying I like online classes. If you do not learn well online my opinion may not matter that much. I will say though, that there is usually not much change to the online syllabus other than extensions, which i think makes things easier. You can work at your own pace, on your own schedule, and even work ahead. The teachers are also pretty responsive."
Junior,5,The campus is very nice and easy to get around. The professors are really nice and helpful. It is very easy to be able to park on campus with no troubles.
Freshman,5,My experience has been really good at West. Everyone there is routing for your success and everyone is super friendly there. The staff that work at financial aid or advisors/ peer mentors are super helpful. The professors go out of their way to help us succeed. There are so many resources available and activities to do there. Something I would like to see change is to have a more lively atmosphere. It's very peaceful and anyone can concentrate anywhere on campus but it sometimes would be nice to have a bustling campus at times.
Alum,5,"I am very proud to have completed my BA degree through ASU-West. The campus is much smaller than their main Tempe location and that is what initially drew me in. Along with this beautiful campus, my all of my professors were extremely knowledgable, compassionate, and always willing to assist a student in need or took time out of their day to make sure we (the students) were succeeding.I would have personally liked to see more majors be offered at this specific campus, but the academics certainly challenge the students to think outside the box. Overall, from the campus to the academics and student life, I felt thoroughly prepared and confident to enter the world and make something of myself."
Freshman,5,West campus is a relaxed campus compared to Tempe. It is small and close-knit. Classes are a 5-minute walk and almost always in the same building. They are also smaller in size so it is easier to get to know your professor personally. I would really recommend ASU West to students who like to relax and make real friendships.
Junior,5,Arizona State University West is the nearest to my house. They have great professors and majors. They also have great dorms and foods on campus as well.
Senior,5,"This has been a wonderful experience attending  this university.  I have learned so much information about my major, psychology, by going to this school. I only have two courses left to take before I complete my  degree, and I feel ready to pursue my graduate degree.   While I’m still conflicted about whether to choose social work, or counseling, I know I will be ready for the next step in my education."
Niche User,5,"It was big, absolutley great in every way. People were kind and I felt accepted by all. Not to mention, professors were always eager to teach the subjects and were captivating in ways that aren't usually expected."
Freshman,5,"The West campus is small, intimate campus which allows students to form relationships more easily. You see familiar faces everyday and events are always happening campus. Although it is not as big at Tempe, the community at West is inclusive to everyone!!"
Freshman,5,"I am currently the West Campus of Arizona State University as a freshman. It has been great so far. There is such a great diversity of students in my class that I have became friends with. I am unfortunately not living on campus, but I have seen the dorms and it is nice how the school provides a refrigerator and a microwave for the students. There are such great events to attend on our campus and the football games are also fun to attend."
Sophomore,5,"So far my experience is amazing! The campus is pretty small compared to the Tempe campus but it is definitely equipped with amazing resources for the students. This campus provides so many majors and classes to take. As well as, making your schedule very flexible."
Freshman,5,"Arizona State is basically run by it’s students which is great. Not only that, but the scenery is amazing and they have so many events to choose from. You can easily keep yourself busy every single day. To top it all off, the students there are super nice as well. The school also has its own apps for safety. Through the app, you can report anything that makes you feel unsafe. Once reported, every student that goes to ASU will get that email, which is another layer of safety ."
Sophomore,5,The West campus at Arizona State University is a relaxing and quiet campus where anyone can study without distractions. I think it is a perfect place where there's not many people compared to other campuses which provides the opportunity for more benefits.
Senior,5,"ASU West Campus is the smallest of all the campuses. Because of this, it built a better sense of community than what I saw at the Tempe or Downtown Campuses. Professors were very involved with students and student activities around campus because of the smaller classroom sizes. You were given the opportunity to form a relationship with the professor rather than being lost in the sea of 400+ other students which proved to be extremely beneficial when I needed help or tutoring in certain classes. It was a quiet campus which is what I loved the most about it. I could relax, study or hang out with friends without all the rush of a major campus."
Junior,5,"Spring 2019 was my first semester at Arizona State University. I was a bit nervous but then realized it was more of a community college setting. I warmed up to the university fairly quick. My professors were great and helped me when I needed it. My classmates were friendly as well. I enjoyed how classes are in different sections, such as: A, B, C. This was new for me, at a community college every class is for a full semester."
Sophomore,5,Well I'm taking online classes at the school at its great because I work and online education really helps me manage time and energy better.
Sophomore,5,I love the ASU environment. It's the perfect school for anyone that likes to live a lowkey lifestyle and focus on academics. I couldn't have picked a better school.
Junior,5,It is a small campus perfect for an academically driven student. The teachers are incredibly nice and willing to work with students. There are a lot of research opportunities for science students that require no prior experience to join the lab team.
Freshman,5,"I like going to a big institution but on one of their small campuses. Arizona State University has a variety of campuses all varying in size, majors, enrollment, etc... Having access to so many majors and campuses makes college a great experience and gives me so many opportunities to meet new people."
Junior,5,"I have sincerely enjoyed my time on the West campus. The classes were easily accessible, the professors were caring, and the student life was phenomenal!"
Freshman,5,"Arizona State University is great for someone looking for a fun and affordable college. There are plenty of resources and help if you know where to look. The school provides transportation options so you can get from one campus to another if need be. The West campus is small but it is a nice one and it is not overwhelming when looking for classes and buildings. There are a lot of events that occur on campus so it is easy to get involved and there is a library and gym so that you can study and use the school computers and you can exercise throughout the week. The good thing is: most of the things I have said are free like the gym, library, and shuttles.  Overall, a great university!"
Freshman,5,"It is such a great campus. Love the school! Great faculty and students. I love the culture of the school, it is very diverse"
Senior,5,"Great school, location and have enjoyed all of my classes because of the great professors - Love it! Fellow students have been welcoming to me, a transfer student...no complaints at all!"
Junior,5,"Rated as #1 in innovation, ASU is a forward thinking, research university that supports every aspect of students success, included career success."
Senior,5,This campus is gorgeous. You can feel the atmosphere of success. All the students and just anyone you would see were so friendly. The dorms were so spacious and made you fell at home.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone that I have worked with and learned with has made my graduate experience at Arizona State University unique and memorable. I am so thankful for it.
Junior,5,It's a smaller part of Arizona State University. Not as many students as there are at the Tempe campus. It's nice to not be so crowded while walking around the campus.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at ASU has been great,fun, and different. I was always so excited to learn new things and meet new people."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my college campus. ASU, in general, is very well established whether it be higher learning, reasonable prices, or student life. While all the different campuses have their pros and cons, mine, in particular, is very unique as well. The west campus is small but reasonable. Students at the west campus have everything we need."
Sophomore,5,"I love ASU west because of how small, yet alive the campus is. It’s not overwhelming like Tempe, but you don’t feel alone either. Great classes, professors and activities. I participated in a great amount of events this past academic year and had tons of fun. I also enjoy the student job aspect of campus
as I’ve just completed my first summer working in the gym. I would like to see the campus expand some with the extra land we have. New food options would also be nice. Overall, very nice campus and I’m glad I chose West over Tempe."
Niche User,5,My experience with ASU has been stellar! Their processes are quick and efficient. The faculty and staff have been knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely recommend this school to other students.
Alum,5,"The West campus is absolutely beautiful. It is small and quiet compared to the other campuses, but full of diversity. However, it always feels like home. Everyone is so nice and it feels like a family."
Sophomore,5,"Arizona State University provides a college experience that I certainly didn't expect. The most important thing to understand about ASU is that it genuinely cares about the well-being of its students and goes the extra mile to make sure we have everything we need to succeed. ASU is constantly coming up with new ways to get students involved in campus activities, whether they be recreational or educational - there are hundreds of clubs and organizations ready to welcome you into their ranks. ASU also strongly promotes and encourages mental and physical wellness. By offering state of the art gym technology, experienced therapists and counselors, and student disability clubs and networks, ASU works to ensure that everybody takes a break from their studies to develop themselves as people as well as future innovators. For these reasons, ASU has always been the best choice for myself and other students who strive to make the world a better place."
Sophomore,5,"Helpful advisors, beautiful campus. Smaller than Tempe but still a nice campus. The drawback is the neighborhood surrounding, and the campus is a little empty in the summer. Great variety of class times for those who are taking classes part time while working full time."
Freshman,5,"I really love Arizona State University's West campus. It is on the smaller side which enhances friendships and learning experience in the classroom. It is well kept up with and has very beautiful scenery.  They offer a numerous amount of resources that you can look to if you are in need of assistance. This campus ensures you are safe at all times and strives for the ultimate best! I truly can't think of something they could do differently they pretty much have mastered everything in my eyes. However, if I really had to say one thing that could change it would be something as small as providing more cheap and healthy food choices around campus."
Freshman,5,"I liked how it's a very diverse school, the professors are very helpful, they make sure you're able to attend the events . They have a variety of clubs and classes."
Sophomore,5,I love living at Arizona State Univerity- West Campus. There is a sense of unity where you are able to create meaning and strong professional relationships.
Junior,5,I love the campus and the atmosphere of it. The teachers are knowledgeable on the courses they teach and are always wanting their students to learn more.
Freshman,5,I love this campus! It's a smaller crowd but still maintains that big university feeling. The faculty are top of their game and I feel extremely lucky to have such great mentors around me all the time
Freshman,5,"Nice outdoor campus, with lots of friendly people and staff
One of the best asu campuses, close classes and smaller classes
You get the small college feel with all the big university resources and support
Defiantly the place if you want to focus a bit more on education the the party scene at the main tempe campus"
Senior,5,"I'm 2011 I began my ASU West career. At the age of 17 I was starting my own life and responsibile for my own actions. West was one of the best things that ever happened to me, I experienced individual growth that shaped me into who I am today. Along with the relationships I've built which made the experience that much better. I'd do it all over if I had the opportunity."
Freshman,5,I am from Wisconsin. From the moment I stepped on campus it gives you the feel of a safe homey community. But still big enough to get lost a little bit and people watch. Everyone is so helpful and they really want you to be more than a number they expect you to take advantage of every opportunity that you can.
Sophomore,5,"The school is amazing! all of the staff are very cooperative and very supportive to the students. one good point about this school and this campus is that the class size for each lecture is relatively small so there is more interacting with the staff. One thing I would change is the lack of athletic activities on this campus, and that there are no opportunities to pay sports as a competition."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the small, manageable class sizes, easy to navigate campus, and personable teachers. This college is perfect for someone who is not into the party scene and would prefer to just attend classes and finish their education."
Freshman,5,"I love Arizona State University West campus so much. It's a small campus, but everyone there knows each other which makes it a whole lot better and more comfortable. The class sizes are a lot smaller, the most people I had in my class before was probably 50 people. Since it is a smaller campus you have such a easier time finding your classes and getting to them on time. The campus itself is beautiful. They always keep it clean for us and we have a few art here and there around the campus. The dorms are also really nice. Casa De Oro dorms are for freshmen, was recently made so it's pretty new. Las Casas dorms for upperclassmen, on the other hand is a bit older, but also very nice. The whole campus gives you that home type of feeling. The people there are so friendly and easy going. I don't think I'd want anything to change. Highly recommend it! "
College Sophomore,5,ASU does everything it can to make sure that its students are safe.
College Senior,5,"Arizona State University West's demographics are primarily students who are adults and are returning to school. That is the best part of the environment for someone like me who takes their studies seriously. When the majority within a class shares similar desires to gain as much knowledge as possible, it makes for a great environment for those who value their education."
College Sophomore,5,"I love ASU West!  It wasn't my top choice, but now that I'm here I realize it's the perfect fit for me!  The community on campus is really close-knit, but if I want a big college feel I can take a shuttle to Tempe, or go to the city by way of Downtown campus."
College Sophomore,5,I love the school I chose.
College Sophomore,5,My favorite attribute for Arizona State University West Campus is that West campus is a small campus while ASU as a whole is the largest University in the country. I get the feel and experience as a community college while simultaneously I have the resources of a large university.
College Sophomore,5,"The football games are amazing and a lot of school spirit. Also, the school offers many resources for the students like tutoring , scholarships opportunities and doing researches with the professors and getting first hand experience in whatever you guys decide to do research in."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm not a huge ""party"" girl but I love all of the fun events on campus and there are plenty of places to hang out with friends."
Senior,4,"I chose to do mostly online starting my junior year, and since ASU was usually school and nothing else to me, I did enjoy it. Online school is different for everyone, and I would never recommend it to someone with ADHD or trouble paying attention. However, personally, I tend to excel in online courses that allow me to do things on my own time, because that is when I am more likely to pay attention. The quality of professors seems to be random, I have had a couple of amazing ones, a couple of horrible ones, and mostly indifferent ones when it comes to online."
Niche User,4,"The thing I liked the most about the West Campus was the open, yet private environment. Everyone was friendly and everything was easy to find. These two factors really set my decision in stone. I was uncertain about ASU and which campus I wanted to attend in the Fall of 2020. However, after visiting, I fell in love with the West Campus and the area. It is the perfect fit for me."
Junior,4,"ASU's West Campus is small, quiet, yet it still gives you the college experience. It is ideal for the more introverted individual, yet an extrovert could also thrive here. It's easy to navigate and offers many different resources that make life on campus easy and fun."
Sophomore,4,Arizona State allows students to study and and work in a fun and safe environment. The professors are heavily involved in the academic well being of each student and provide a welcoming environment.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the small campus, because it helps give me a better ability to learn. There are some major faults to the West campus of ASU in comparison to the Tempe campus like the party scene and food. Because the Tempe campus is so large and the West campus is so small, less money goes towards the West campus and therefore hurts some social aspects, however academically I believe the West campus has an advantage because of our smaller class size and the intimacy with the staff."
Junior,4,The campus is very quiet and peaceful. I have enjoyed almost all of my professors and they are very committed to teaching and their own research. I would prefer the campus to have better scheduling when it comes to classes in the same major path.
Junior,4,ASU offers a competitive education and really does an amazing job of making you feel engaged from an online perspective.
Senior,4,"Note how subjective this feedback will be. As quiet yet outgoing person, I did enjoy the community college feeling that this far away location had. You will know everyone in your major and anyone in similar classes, clubs, residential location (dorms). Most of the faculty are sweet people, although there is quite a limit on space available for required classes as there are not many professors. So it can be difficult not to stay on track with your program. I am a Forensics major so it just happened more often. My experience was better because of my closeness to peers and the general atmosphere. Classes wise, I learned so much culturally however many science classes I felt were mostly self taught. These professors were intelligent however lack good methods to teach these daunting subjects."
Sophomore,4,"Arizona State University is a wonderful campus, with a very diverse group of students, and a wonderful curriculum. They offer many clubs for the students, and the student life is active and amazing. The dormitories are clean, the libraries are large and well-stocked, and the professors are kind."
Junior,4,I love going to Arizona State University. It is a very good school where the teachers actually do care about you and your success.
Alum,4,My experience at the West campus was very good. It is a smaller campus and not very crowded like those in Tempe and Downtown. It is a lot easier to meet with your professors as the class sizes are so much smaller. It feels more individualized and you can tell the professors actually care about their students success. I would highly recommend attending this campus because it made my four-year experience a lot easier.
Sophomore,4,The campus is really beautiful and the classes are small. You get to see a lot of different types of people. Arizona State University is a very divers place.
Junior,4,It is a very pretty and calm campus. The campus has nice facilities available to students. The small student body which can be seen as a positive and a negative helps to keep class sizes small. There is more opportunity to meet with professors one on one and get hands-on help than on other larger campuses.
Senior,4,"ASU West Campus is a great school. Professors are very helpful. Classes are smaller compare to ASU Tempe campus, which is a plus as students have a better opportunity to speak with professors about the courses. The campus is calm and clean. As a current student I love going to this campus and feel very safe there."
Sophomore,4,"Dorms and on-campus dining is terrible but classes are fine for the most part. Find housing nearby and don't use the dorms. Professors are hit or miss, but the bad ones are exceptionally bad. The campus is small making schedules and getting between classes simple. Both the Gym and Library facilities and resources are incredible, and despite being a smaller campus with a tight community there are always events happening and things to do. You will be amazed at how quickly you start to recognize people in passing, its not impossible to meet everyone on campus. The honors college on this campus is much less elitist and has a tight knit community of dedicated scholars and helpful staff and resources."
Sophomore,4,"West is adorable and perfect for commuter students or kids who enjoy a smaller high school type of environment. Nothing like the Tempe campus. Everyone leaves over the weekend so the kids from out of state (like me) have to come together to find something to keep busy. There's barely any food options and the area surrounding the campus does not have much in the entertainment or food department. Also, the Herberger Young Scholars Academy middle school (?) on campus is awkward. The dining hall would constantly run out of food because the Herberger students would eat there which caused the dining hall to limit how much food the college students could have. It was weird and uncomfortable eating next to 10 year olds. Not at all the ASU experience I expected. The West campus has incredible professors and Deans, don't get me wrong. The academic part of the school is great. However, if you want to have a real college experience and enjoy where you live, get a dorm in Tempe."
Junior,4,Arizona State University- West Campus has excellent professors and is a decent sized college. The campus is large enough to have plenty of options but also small enough to be able to associate with classmates and professors easily. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants a good education with an affordable tuition.
Freshman,4,My experience here is limited but the professors are great and there seem to be plentiful resources to help students succeed and feel like the campus is a second home.
Alum,4,"Since the campus was so small, you got to see that close nit community. Everyone was practically family."
Junior,4,"The west campus at Arizona State University allows students to receive one on one instruction with a multitude of ways to get involved. Due to smaller class sizes, instruction can easily be specialized. The staff is friendly and always willing to help. On the west campus, there is at least one club for you!"
Freshman,4,So far they have treated me with respect and have answered every question I have had. That they try to answer you and get back to you as soon as possible.
Niche User,4,"The campus is a beautiful place. Located in a very safe part of Phoenix, close to malls, the freeway and a YMCA."
Freshman,4,"I am very pleased when I saw and stay in the Casa de Oro dome for 5 months, it is very clean and comfortable to stay. However, I hope the University would stop charging me to clean things that are not mine. Thank you."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small campus feel, but the ASU comradery is still strong. There are plenty of resources and the library is the perfect place to get work done."
Sophomore,4,I loved the campus and the sports facilities. I wouldn't like to see anything change. I love the small campus and I love the fact that you don't have to walk 15-20 minutes just to get to your next class.
Freshman,4,"The initial response to such a vast intersystem of resources, and facilities is quite overwhelming, I suggest coming to check out the campus at least twice before making your decision. Only because there is so much to navigate, and learn to utilize you may need to write a list of places to go, before attending orientations; you may get swept up in the enormity of the campuses, and forget what you really would like to seek out. The college overall is a friendlier place than most. They even offer some cleaning and laundry services for on-campus students, and a wide array of activities (over 1,000 orgs/clubs) just in the end of 2016. A great place of fostering innovative ideas, and utilizing resources to make those ideas a reality."
Sophomore,4,"Gorgeous campus. Peaceful and quiet, unlike Tempe. Very clean and beautifully landscaped campus. The only downside is there isn't much around the campus that you could do on your free time. "
Freshman,4,The campus is really small and almost impossible to get lost on. Stores and fast food are conveniently close by. The freshman dorms are still new. The school is still expanding and keeps getting better.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a large variety of courses to take, great staff, good staff:student ratio, very helpful to students"
College Sophomore,4,Arizona takes finding suitable careers for its students very seriously and will help however they can
College Sophomore,4,"If you love a sport or want a high quality experience at the gym, ASU has you covered."
College Sophomore,4,"Arizona State University- West Campus is a nice smaller campus which has a strong focus on studies and its students. It has all of the benefits and opportunities of ASU, but with less distractions."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experience is when I was an incoming freshman and they had ""Camp Solera"" for incoming freshmans. It was a camp to get to know other people and do a lot of activities with each other. My all time favorite event was the paint party. It was a blast and I wish they would do it again."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a relatively safe campus, I don't really feel any danger when I walk around in the campus itself..."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are small so, you really do get to know your professors and fellow classmates a lot more."
College Sophomore,4,It's actually a great school for undergrad research in biological sciences.
College Sophomore,4,"You'll see it around campus, especially the intramural soccer players every Thursday night... Also when big football games come around... Signs... Signs everywhere."
College Sophomore,4,"Small campus so you're able to really get to know the professors there, but it isn't for everyone, as there isn't as much going on compared to Tempe. Overall though, great school, cool professors, and a quiet campus to help you focus on school work."
College Freshman,4,I feel very secure on campus. I like how secure I feel
College Freshman,4,The professors and courses are so much better than I thought. I really enjoyed the structure the courses were in.
College Freshman,4,"I really like ASU- West. It is small, quiet, but very helpful. The professors love to get us involved in school activities and keep us up to date with ASU announcements. Advisors help to ensure student success by introducing them to all opportunities that fit them well. Help is always available and there are plenty of resources we could go to about any questions or concerns."
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed ASU West. It is a smaller campus, so the education is more individualized."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy how there is always someone who I can refer to when I need help with anything at all times.
College Senior,4,"The teachers, so far, have been great. The classes are fun and knowledgeable. I love the people and the area. I enjoy going to school here."
College Freshman,4,"I choose Arizona State University because it looked like the right fit for me. I was looking to go to college out of state, but where was the issue. My heart was dead set on attending either San Fransisco University or Berkley. Moving to California was always my plan since I was 7 years old. Over the years I started thinking and finding myself and who I was becoming. After months of research and college visits, ASU was perfect. When I was visiting ASU for the first time after being accepted I fell in love. I fell in love with the Campus, the staff, the environment, and the student life. If I still had the opportunity to transfer schools I wouldn't. I am very excited for my first year at ASU. Go Sun Devils!"
College Sophomore,4,I don't think any of the rules are unreasonable and come down to basic courtesy in many cases. Campus issues are dealt with fairly and quickly.
College Sophomore,4,The food quality is great. There isn't too much variety in some of the different sections but I don't mind.
College Sophomore,4,"They make sure to monitor for drinking on campus, it is a dry campus. They monitor parking and you will get a ticket if your car is not where it is authorized to be. There are blue emergency boxes within a 15 foot range of each other for safety and contact the police immediately."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe at school.
College Sophomore,4,It usually goes smoothly they tend to need extra.
College Sophomore,4,Absoutely love the food especially at Cafe West!
College Sophomore,4,The living situations are very comfortable and are helpful to be close to school.
College Freshman,4,I dont party but our school is rated a top partying school and is known for some bomb kickbacks
College Sophomore,4,I love the interdisciplinary major options
College Sophomore,4,I think they do a good job preventing it
Recent Alumnus,4,The in person classes are great and the teachers are fantastic if you're lucky enough to be able to find a class that fits into a normal work schedule
Recent Alumnus,4,There's plenty to eat if you don't mind fast food. There is one Asian food place close by
College Student,4,lots of different food places
College Student,4,"greatselection of classes, even online"
College Student,4,"It really doesn't matter here, be who and what you want to be"
Senior,2,"My experience with this campus has been minimal, and I have taken most classes at Tempe due to commute. The university itself was very difficult for me to feel apart of, as I could not afford to live on campus. I pay a multitude for parking every week, and have gotten two tickets being 2 minutes past the meter time when not making it back to my car due to a long lecture. There is little to no parking for commuters, and I have an extremely hard time navigating it. I haven't made many friends or often feel as if the professors care for their students personally, I would say that I have loved maybe one of my professors each semester.  I think that the best part about ASU is the way the campus looks and the administration. I admire Michael Crow and how he handled the pandemic and continuously releases updates, making it clear that he cares for his students. The second star is to recognize the very few good professors I have had who have reached out to me, a shy quiet student, personally."
Junior,2,"I like that the campus it smaller and has a closer more intimate feel for my academic journey. I would like the availability and promotion for resources to be more readily accessible as an international student I do feel, that there should be more improvement in helping student success."
College Sophomore,2,"Very expensive and ASU keeps driving the prices up. Would say it's good, but the prices are just too much and it's ridiculous that they keep making us charge more."
College Freshman,2,We really do not have a Greek life atmosphere on the west campus because it all takes place in Tempe. Not many people talked about it because we do not have sororities on the West campus
College Sophomore,2,"I've had a bad experience, I needed help with paying for college. I went to my advisor for help and he suggested using a credit card to pay the money I owed to my school. Which is possibly the worst advice I had received."
College Freshman,2,"Arizona State University West Campus is not in the best area, but I wouldn't say it is in the worst either. Just low income homes and apartments and crappy food options. Nothing good with-in 1-2 miles walk."
College Freshman,2,"Here specifically at ASU's West Campus there is no Greek Life. However, on the main campus in Tempe, Arizona there is. Unfortunately, ASU gets it party school reputation from solely that campus and its crazy party scene and negative publicity of the Fraternities."
College Sophomore,2,No matter what they say students still participate.
College Senior,2,"There are plenty of computers to go around, but the network is very slow"
College Junior,2,None That I've Noticed – For the most part I do not feel that the West campus is all the strict. I have yet to see any real reason to be.
Junior,1,"Very unethical school. r I received a refund from the school after all the charges on my account were paid in full. After about of week into the school session my account balance showed that I owed about $900 dollars. THe charge later disappeared on my account, then it reappeared. They have no respect for people's privacy. they surveillance your devices. THe professor's a very unresponsive considering it is an online education. Terrible school to attend. I would stay away at all cost. Do not invest money in getting an degree from this institution."
College Freshman,1,ASU West Campus has absolutely no nightlife...it is dead here.
College Junior,1,"Plain for the Most Part – Campus life at the West campus is rather dull. Most of the students that go to West are looking to concentrate on their studies, those whop want more of a party life tend to go to the Tempe campus. If there isn't a class being held the campus becomes a dead. Also many of the attendees of this location are older and also have full time jobs and families."

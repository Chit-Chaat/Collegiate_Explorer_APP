Niche User,5,"Chapman was such a welcoming campus which was one of my favorite things about the school. From the moment I walked on campus, I felt as if I was apart of something special. Another thing that I loved about the school was the town around it and how it was so cute."
Niche User,5,Chapman is very informative and responds to emails very quickly. They are super friendly and make sure that they answer all your questions!
Senior,5,"Chapman has been exceptional for first-generation and transfer students, they have several support groups for said students. Chapmans offers an inclusive community for four year, transfer, and graduate students."
Senior,5,"Despite the suddenness of our online change, our professors quickly adapted to Zoom meetings and a full inclusion of Canvas into the curriculum. I felt that I received the best online experience that was possible."
Sophomore,5,"Online learning varies professor to professor and I was on campus full time until COVID hit, so online was new for everyone. Some professors navigated it extremely well while others made it difficult for the students. If online learning continues, I'm confident most professors will figure it out to make it the best learning environment possible."
Junior,5,"The instructors doing a good job of making all the assignments due dates clear, and how we are supposed to access all the necessary files."
Junior,5,"I like the fact that the class sizes are small so you develop a professor student relationship.  I also like how at Chapman the staff really cares about you and your goals, and how you're not considered a number like at some schools."
Sophomore,5,The professors were very understanding during COVID and excepted late work due to the circumstance. They made the material easier as well.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the campus and social life. It's a perfect size and the classes are wonderful. The professors are great and you will have a great time.
Sophomore,5,I'm going to take online courses this Fall 2020 semester due to COVID-19 precautions. The professors are prepared to engage with students!
Freshman,5,Chapman is a great University that strives of community and inclusion. I have joined several clubs on campus and have always felt at home. Most of my professors have been women of color which has been very great to hear a different perspective.
Senior,5,"I did not take any classes online as I was a study abroad student in Europe this semester. In my transition to online classes with my host university in Europe, there were many challenges and my host university was not as supportive as I had hoped. Chapman was able to provide me with the support and access to resources that I needed to succeed, despite the fact that I wasn't taking any classes directly from Chapman this semester."
Senior,5,"I have loved my time at Chapman so far. The faculty are incredibly dedicated to their students and are often willing to spend extra time out of the classroom helping students with coursework. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, whether it be through Greek life, sports, or the tons of other clubs that are open to all students. The location is great as well, being so close to the beach, Disneyland, and Los Angeles. I have never run out of things to do or been bored in Orange."
Alum,5,I wasn't online. I was in person at the time I went and it was great to be able to meet and talk to the professors. I usually needed help on something and was able to ask questions right away as opposed to waiting for an email back.
Alum,5,I was not online at Chapman University. I was going to classes in person and was on campus. The campus was very nice and the professors were really well versed in what they taught. The campus is located in a safe area.
Freshman,5,My professors have been super patient and made a really good effort to try to continue with classes as we moved to online-learning. Actually found it very helpful as some lectures were pre-recorded and so could be referred back to before an exam. Also most professors were readily available for online tutoring.
Freshman,5,Very helpful Staff. I made a lot of friends already and I am very excited about their plan to reopen the campus after COVID-19
Senior,5,"we all met on zoom for classes which isn't the ideal situation. however, the professors were very considerate about the online learning system and did what ever they could too help us succeed."
Senior,5,my experience as a transfer student was made so much easier because of the environment that Chapman creates. The professors were very nice and the students were very helpful to new students such as myself. So far my experience at Chapman has been the best. I hope that I can help and welcome other transfers like I was welcomed.
Alum,5,Chapman University has one of the most beautiful campuses I have seen and provide an experience for their students that is unique and top tier. They prepare you for your future career and support all  students in their endeavors.
Alum,5,Chapman is adaptable and truly demonstrates a care for their students. They ensure their students are safe and are acquiring a proper education even online.
Niche User,5,Chapman is a great school that has a lot of great opportunities. It forces you to be involved and all the people are super friendly. The small class sizes are super helpful and it is easy to have a good relationship with all of your professors.
Junior,5,Chapman University has a beautiful campus and teachers that genuinely care about the student's education.
Alum,5,"I attended Chapman's Dodge College and majored in Film Production with a directing emphasis. I loved my time here. Professors were incredible, they provided individualized instruction and all the help and advice I needed. I met some of my best friends during my time here and was able to work on multiple films with all of them, creating lasting memories both in and outside of class. The campus is beautiful and the facilities are top notch giving you every opportunity and piece of equipment you'd need to create your best work. The town of Orange is a beautiful setting as well, close to the beach, mountains and other major attractions, especially Hollywood. Chapman was incredible and I'm proud to be an Alum. With alumni such as the Duffer brothers who created Stranger Things and Justin Simien who created Dear White People, the school turns out real talent."
Graduate Student,5,"Very good mentoring system, I felt heard and seen there. The classes were well-structured and I felt lucky to study in a very respectful, friendly environment."
Alum,5,"I loved the small class size and attentiveness and support of faculty/professors. The environment at Chapman is very friendly and the surrounding city is quiet, but packed with things to do like Disneyland and Angels Stadium. Overall, a wonderful place to get an education."
Niche User,5,"What caught my attention was Chapman's beautiful architecture. From the moment I first stepped foot on campus, back in 7th grade, I was left in awe by its early modern architectural style. Its polished brick buildings and luscious walkways makes the college experience even better, making one proud to be a panther. Another aspect that stood out to me was Chapman's vast availability of internships. At the end of the day, jobs aren't looking for merely good grades, they are looking for someone who has had experience in the field. Chapman will allow me to stand out from others who seek my career by exposing me to my major at work in the real world. This will not only leave me with valuable exposure, but it will facilitate the transition between college and career."
Niche User,5,"Everyone I have met that goes there is overwhelmingly friendly and genuinely loves the school. The students are dedicated and passionate and I have been impressed by each person I have encountered. Even though it is a smaller, less ""name brand"" school, they hold there own when compared to others. I can not recommend Chapman more."
Alum,5,"Chapman University is an excellent school, because of the supportive faculty, small class size, and variety of classes catered to each individual major. It is also a beautiful and convenient campus."
Senior,5,I have loved being a student at Chapman. The faculty are welcoming and helpful and the smaller classes allow for more peer interaction and individual attention from professors.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Chapman and so far my experience has been amazing! It is obvious the school puts a lot of effort into creating a welcoming environment for new students, the activities organized by UPB during orientation week and my orientation leaders made the adjustment period much smoother! The community here is great and there are lots of opportunities for on-campus involvement. The location is amazing, Old Town Orange is really cute and walkable from campus, the beaches are about a 25 min drive away, and LA is a little over an hour away! So far my time at Chapman has been great!"
Junior,5,"Chapman University is an amazing school. The admission staff are extremely helpful and excellent at communicating with students in a timely manner. The financial aid office has gone above and beyond to make sure that I am receiving as much money as possible. My major (theater) department has made my transition from community college to their university seamless. They were prompt to make sure I was able to register for the classes i wanted, and that all my classes transferred in were accepted. I am so excited to officially start school again next month!"
Niche User,5,"I have not been accepted yet, but In my short time of visiting the school as a prospective freshman, I have absolutely loved how welcoming and the staff and students are. There is a clear community between both students and faculty, and they are nothing but friendly. The campus is beautiful and not too overwhelming because of its size. I absolutely love it. My only con is the price, which is common for private schools."
Freshman,5,"Chapman is a very welcoming school. Everyone is very kind and willing to listen to you. In all of my classes, I feel that I am recognized and not thought of as 'just another student'. I am heard."
Freshman,5,"Students here are amazing. I have never met a larger demographic of people who are truly the kindest, most accepting people I know."
Junior,5,"Medium sized campus: Not too big to be a super overwhelming college experience, yet not too small for it to feel like a small, repetitive town. Classes are small, so you won't be just a face or an ID number in class. Your peers k now you, the professors know you, that lunch lady loves talking to you. Campus community is tight knit, so students and faculty are all kind and compassionate, talented and creative, hardworking and goal-oriented. The expansion of the school's programs and state of the art facilities shows that Chapman is committed to making its students thrive and better experience their future career interests.

In the future, I would love to see Chapman be more considerate of its students' family income. Costs continues to rise every year, and more students and their families are at higher risks of not successfully putting their kids in college for the full four years. I hope that Chapman seriously reconsiders and caps the growth in its housing, tuition, room and board."
Senior,5,"Professors are all really friendly and always willing to offer extra help if you need it. They really want you to succeed and will do whatever they can to help. Also, the connections you can make just by being an alum of chapman are incredible."
Freshman,5,I first went there because I won an essay contest. It was so much fun and made me love the campus for hosting such a meaningful event for students all around. I later took a tour and loved every bit of the school. I hope one day be a Panther and continue my academic career at such an amazing college that offers me the perfect education for the job I am looking for in the future. As well as a beautiful all around campus with great eating spots.
Freshman,5,"Chapman University is the perfect size of school for me - not extremely tiny where I see the same faces every single day but not so large that I recognize now. Not only is this true within my social circle, but also with professors! I am able to have a personal relationship with my professors, and that is of tremendous benefit beyond the classroom for networking."
Junior,5,"The college is staffed with faculty who truly care about helping you succeed and who are so accommodating with any life difficulties. Being someone with a registered disability, everyone does everything they can to make sure I can succeed. The atmosphere with professors is welcoming."
Freshman,5,"Chapman is definitely a school for the driven. While the overall area and off-campus scene may be a bit lacking, the professors and supportive community more than make up for it. Freshmen are able to do so much it's unreal. I can't imagine having the opportunities and relationships that I was able to make here anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,Chapman University is a well respected college that will open a path in order to be successful. The academic levels will challenge you and prepare you for the real world. The location is beautiful and safe and full of diversity.
Alum,5,chapman has great teachers that really care about their students and want to see them succeed. There are many different clubs to join that make it easy to make friends.
Alum,5,"All of the professors at Chapman are incredible. They always make time for you at their office hours and do their best to make sure you succeed in their classes. The campus is beautiful and always well-maintained. I felt very prepared for grad school and the application process, and I felt that my education at Chapman made me a competitive applicant. The only complaint I would have is that Greek life is huge in the Chapman social scene, and it can be difficult to find a non-Greek community. However, between the people I met in classes and the clubs and organizations I joined, I still made a lot of friends and felt that I had a great community overall."
Junior,5,I love attending Chapman! It is such a kind community between the students and the professors. It provides so many resources and really prepares students for graduating!
Freshman,5,"My short time at Chapman has provided me with a plethora of opportunities and incited a drive within me that I truly believe could not have happened elsewhere. I'll add that any school is what you make of it, and that every person has a different ""fit"" school.

For me, that fit was here. As a science major, I have been engaged in small classes with professors truly invested in my learning, as opposed to solely their research like in larger universities. I've been able to conduct research from the beginning. I've had guidance and mentorship that is truly unparalleled. But the best part has been how the size of the school allows students to truly form bonds. As just a freshman, I found myself walking to class stopping to say hi to so many people. I'm not a social butterfly, I'll note, but the environment is just conducive to this! Can't recommend enough if you're looking for an environment to grow and thrive, but without being the number you might be at a larger school."
Senior,5,"Chapman University is very dedicated to the success of all of its students. One time, I was sick with bronchitis and missed some classes. My professors asked the Dean of Students to check in on me because they were worried and they helped me make up all of the work that I had missed so I could succeed."
Senior,5,"I enjoy attending this university because I learn more about the craft of screenwriting and how to build a portfolio from professors who are working professionals in the entertainment industry. There are lots of opportunities to pursue other paths as well outside of one's major with general education classes. However, Chapman needs to improve on which general classes certain students need to take, both within and outside of the major's specific school."
Freshman,5,Everyone at Chapman has been wonderful!  I feel welcomed and can't wait to start in the fall!  The Admissions and Financial Aid processes have been easy to navigate and everyone responds quickly to questions.  Looking forward to becoming a Panther in August!!
Freshman,5,"The college has a beautiful campus and very engaging faculty. The campus itself is nice and compact, so it's easy to become familiar with most of the grounds, but at the same time still have so many rooms that have never been explored. The new Keck Center especially is amazing."
Niche User,5,I was there for a campus tour and everyone there is very kind and you just feel like you can attend this school just by stepping into their campus.
Freshman,5,"Chapman University has a very welcoming community. The academics are strong and the student population is small. In this way, students develop a personal relationship with professors and the professors are invested in the class and each student."
Niche User,5,"Great campus and atmosphere.  Away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles.  Athletic facilities are amazing and the art school, just a few blocks away is like it's own little town"
Alum,5,"Chapman University has incredible professors and a huge range of clubs and activities. There is a big emphasis on Greek life, but I was not involved and still had a great experience doing things like Chapman Radio, on campus yoga classes, and intramural volleyball."
Freshman,5,"Chapman University has a very diverse and inclusive campus. It is very easy to acclimate into your surroundings no matter where you are coming from, in-state or out-of-state. The professors truly do care about each student individually and are always there to help. Not only do they take the time to personally help a student, but they also make it an emphasis at the beginning of every semester to let students know that they are there to help in and out of the class. It is very difficult to find professors who are willing to go above and beyond for their students, however, Chapman has defied those means by hiring quality professors. I could not imagine my college education anywhere else but Chapman University!"
Freshman,5,Chapman is very unique. Depending on the type of person you are this university adjusts to you. everyone is friendly and so helpful
Niche User,5,Chapman is a great school in a great area. Not only are you receiving a phenomenal education you are also receiving a great experience. The experience not only prepares you for your future career but for life in general. I wouldn’t choose any other college to earn my degree.
Graduate Student,5,"Chapman University is an institution that strives to be above the rest. It is continually growing. As the world changes, and opportunities rise up, Chapman changes too. It is on the leading edge of new career opportunities. The professors prepare students to enter the work force through the use of engaging material. At Chapman, you are not just a student. You become part of a community of driven individuals, where college becomes more like a home."
Sophomore,5,"So far I have really enjoyed Chapman University. Their class sizes are small but not too small, the teachers are usually very nice and easily accessible for extra help, and there are many clubs and organizations to join."
Freshman,5,"I am a film conservatory student at the Orange County School of the Arts. Our conservatory is fortunate to have Chapman University as a resource for us. We are able to use their Dodge School of Film theatre to present our conservatory films in the Winter and at the end of the school year. It’s a beautiful theatre.
I also have taken 2 tours of the Chapman campus as well as a tour of their film department. I applied to Chapman for admission for Fall 2019, and hope I will be accepted to their film school."
Freshman,4,They are working to provide a great education and experience through this tough and new virtual time.
Freshman,4,So far it is engaging as possible.  The professors  are making sure to communicate on canvas before classes and give clear expectations.
Sophomore,4,"I have loved Chapman University so far. Most of the teachers are very invested in the well-being of their students, and are understanding. I would like the Morlan Hall dorms to be better well kept, as my roommate and suite mates experienced many bathroom malfunctions through the course of one year. The chemistry department also needs to reevaluate one of the professors there for certain remarks made and his inability to teach properly. Said professor also did not provide adequate help and failed to stay on course and we fell behind the other classes which made exams difficult-especially because everyone took chem exams on the same day."
Sophomore,4,Many of my professors were very understanding of the transition and made accommodations to help students continue to do their best given the circumstances.
Sophomore,4,"Chapman is a great school! There are so many amazing things about it like the professors, the people, the greek life, the campus as a whole, the president. Overall, Chapman is amazing. Though I do not give it 5 stars because they do lack diversity and they really market themselves as a small school so you'll be able to get into all your classes which definitely is not the case. There are so many different opportunities Chapman gives you from the variety of majors and minors to the connections you will make, Chapman is the place to go if you want an amazing career in the future. The professors push and challenge you while also making learning fun. And how can you beat living 20 mins from the beach!"
Sophomore,4,The faculty at Chapman University is extremely helpful and encouraging. Everyone who has guided me thus far has given me the energy to strive towards success.
Freshman,4,"Chapman classes online versus in-person aren't comparable. In-person classes at Chapman are amazing as the professors genuinely care about their students success. However, when classes are online its easy to become unmotivated and lost in coursework."
Sophomore,4,Chapman is very homey and small so it is easy to access resources. The professors are very kind and know your name and give you personalized help so you don't feel like just another face. The campus itself is beautiful and the people are kind.
Sophomore,4,"With the COVID pandemic, Chapman had to turn to remote learning starting March 2020. The transition was rough but the professors did everything they can to help students and give them the resources they need. There are a lot of extra help that you can use."
Sophomore,4,"So far, Chapman University has been amazing with academics and the campus life! I have loved all of my teachers and the other students I have met! My first year at Chapman was amazing despite some of it being online! I also love the campus and the local area, it is gorgeous."
Sophomore,4,"I did take some classes online once COVID hit, but, Chapman did a great job implementing this online learning system. The zoom classes compared to big blue button were a lot more organized and easier to communicate. The teachers handled everything well and let us acclimate to the online learning environment."
Junior,4,Professors are engaged and love the topics they teach. Community is inclusive and all the students were friendly. There are also a lot of dogs.
Works Here,4,"I attended Chapman my entire college years and I really enjoyed the small classroom sizes, the campus size, and the awesome Argyros School of Business. My professors were great and I was able to attend the Walk Down Wall Street course my senior year in New York City right before COVID19.   We learned so much about stocks and economic factors that play into the stock market.  I have had two great internships, and now I’m applying for finance positions in NYC. The best part was getting to know my professors by name as oftentimes it’s 25-30 students per class.  The thing to improve on is to encourage women’s soccer (sports in general ) on campus. Overall it was a fantastic experience I will remember always! Because I took all Interterm courses I was able to graduate 1 semester early so I did not experience any online courses at Chapman but my roommates said it is not too bad, just different! I played Club Soccer & made great friends which made the college experience even better!"
Niche User,4,Chapman is located in an excellent area with a very lively and welcoming campus.  Their living spaces are some of the best and feel very homey.
Niche User,4,"Chapman University was very clean and beautiful, and the staff members were very kind and easy to work with. Students respected everyone."
Junior,4,"Chapman is definitely a school with lots of money. The campus is small and beautiful, nestled the quaint small town of Orange. There are plenty of surrounding areas to travel to for fun activities like the beach or a mall. Since it is in a very white, rich part of Southern California, the campus reflects that. However, there are great groups on campus focused on celebrating diversity and making minority students feel like they have a safe space."
Sophomore,4,"Chapman is an absolutely beautiful school. Professors have all been great so far, and my classes are in beautiful new buildings with great views of campus. The surrounding neighborhood and restaurants are amazing, and it's so fun to walk around and just enjoy the slowness of the neighborhood. I also have to commend how safe I feel here, even when I'm coming in at night."
Junior,4,"Although entering the college scene is scary at first, it can be the best opportunity of your life. I embraced this university with open arms and let it show me just how great it can be, and I was not disappointed. Chapman's unlimited academic opportunities and student life allowed me to try many new activities and narrow down which were closest to my heart. The school itself is the perfect size where you can meet new individuals every day, yet still run into plenty of friends just casually walking through campus. Those who help run the school put an extreme amount of effort into family/parent weekends, new celebrations, and more just to make each student feel like the are home, not just at some basic college. I found my home here at Chapman University and everyone that works, attends, or even stops by campus can feel that energy as well."
Sophomore,4,"Professors are hit or miss and the school is too expensive. You find a lot of the same demographic of wealthy Caucasian kids who all came from private schools and privileged backgrounds. Greek life is essential to meeting new people, as it’s the largest way for students to meet each other and interact, but hate keeps the middle to lower class students through extremely high dues and fees."
Sophomore,4,"Classes sizes are small and nice. Beautiful campus. Fun clubs and lots of chances to meet new people. Classes are difficult, but there is a lot of help offered."
Graduate Student,4,"As a Graduate Student attending Chapman University, I feel I have had a beneficial experience thus far. I love how small the community is and the cleanliness of the campus. Because the student population is much smaller, I have been able to make stronger friendships and relationships. I love the shops and restaurants surrounding the area! They welcome the college community and support college students."
Freshman,4,"I like the location and the overall campus of Chapman University.  The professors seem to be interested and engaged with each of the students. I have a hard time focusing but they have small class sizes which really benefits me and my learning. The location of Chapman is very convenient for me. Just 10 minutes away is Disneyland, the beaches are so close, and the city of Orange is beautiful."
Sophomore,4,"The Chapman University campus is beautiful! The classes in the Science department are difficult, but they are worth it. I like Chapman University!"
Niche User,4,"i like the massive variety of majors and minors that chapman has to offer. the staff and students are wonderful and very inviting, i have no personal qualms or changes for this school."
Sophomore,4,"Chapman University holds the title for one of the most beautiful campuses on the west coast and it lives up to that title in every aspect. The roughly 7,000 students that comprize the undergraduate population create a welcome but not overwhelming environment. In my time at this university, I have found the close-knit campus, prominent greek life, and progressive learning environment allows students to feel like more of a community and brings the true ""college experience"" to life."
Alum,4,I felt that it was overpriced education for fair-good physical therapy program. The campus environment was comfortable and safe. The library was average.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful! Because it is a private school, the class sizes are smaller and it gives you a chance to get more help from the professors. Everyone there is really kind as well!"
Senior,4,"Great experience so far. The school may be a little small, but the fraternity has definitely made up for the fun experiences. I like most of my professors and I the business program is strong."
Sophomore,4,"I am a transfer student to Chapman University I came in the spring of 2019. I fell in love with every aspect of this university and my transition was extremely easy and I felt at home right away. Although this may be a school on the smaller side, this makes it easy to connect with students and professors on a personal level all while being able to happily walk across campus seeing a new face everyday. The party scene although there is a greek life presence on campus, each member is extremely supportive of the balance of academics and a good time. Talking about support whether it be clubs or sports you can catch panthers all over cheering on one another at games or events even philanthropy fundraisers!I love Chapman University and it should be the future home to MANY!"
Sophomore,4,Really love this school and its atmosphere. It allows undergraduates much more opportunities then a bigger school would.
Sophomore,4,"Chapman is a very small school, which allows for optimal opportunities to meet everyone around you whether it may be students or faculty."
Niche User,4,"I have visited Chapman university and it is an amazing school. When you enter the campus my view on life changed drastically. I realized what college life was like and how it would be a very interesting journey for me when I apply to college. The academics at this school surprised me. They have excellent programs with good staff to student ratios. Even though their athletics may not be top of the line they are still fun to watch. All in all, Chapman gave me a new view on college which definitely was  a positive one."
Junior,4,"Provide many resources, beautiful campus but not as diverse as they claim. They help you get jobs while in college and after, help with your resume/ cover letter and take professional linked in picture. Greek life is really prominent on campus, but there's no hazing and everyone gets along."
Freshman,4,"Overall, a comfortable environment with a plethora of resources. The film school especially has an emphasis on niche subjects and areas of study. Despite the campus being relatively small, there are always things to do, and the small college-town vibes are sure to help new students feel safe and at home. 

There are many guest speakers and special events on the weekly, and the newer installments on campus have greatly increased the amount of tools students can get their hands on. The staff I have encountered - ranging from professors to cafeteria employees - have all been very helpful and encouraging.

On the downside, while many classes and clubs encourage and discuss diversity and culture, those topics seem to be of a lesser priority to the administration as a whole. The previous Dean had shot down numerous requests for a small cross-cultural center, and even though there have been improvements since then, many diversity-focused resources remain relatively unknown to students."
Freshman,4,"Chapman definitely has its ups and downs, but overall the education and connections that will help me in the future are extraordinary."
Junior,4,"I've really enjoyed going to Chapman University, and I believe it's one of the most beautiful campuses around. Not only are the facilities great, but the attention to detail Chapman puts in to making students' college experiences great is impressive. While the growing size is putting a lot of stress on class availability and housing, I'm grateful to attend an up-and-coming university. I've had a handful of thoughtful, caring professors, made like-minded friends, and made plenty of memories at Chapman."
Junior,4,"The academics are really great! The professors are masters in their subjects and really push you to learn as much as possible while gaining real life skills. The campus is very small. I can get to my class across campus from the parking lot in 5 minutes. The food is okay, but I’m also a picky eater so my opinion may not be super relevant to most people. Overall, the school is great!"
Junior,4,"I just transferred to Chapman, but I've found the students and staff welcoming and supportive.  Campus is clean and organized.  Professors are always around to answer questions and help students."
Freshman,4,I absolutely love the vibe at Chapman University everyone is always saying hello to people they know or meeting people they don’t know. I would like to see more involvement options earlier in the day for students rather than clubs or sports only meeting in the morning or at night.
Sophomore,4,"I immediately was impressed by how small classes were and professor's efforts to form bonds with students and be invested in their success. The only complaint I have is that two out of four of my professors my first semester were graduate students, one was a basic level calculus class and the other a computer science class. It was evident that the graduate student professors did not have as much teaching experience or skill as my other professors, and that was reflected in my academic performance as well as that of my classmates."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year at Chapman University, and I love it. It was my top choice and I love being here. The classes are interesting, the campus is beautiful, and surrounding town is super cute and fun. I made some good friends almost immediately and we hang out all the time, eating together or having movie nights or board game nights and other fun activities. There are lots of things to do around campus or nearby, but at the same time it’s very easy to just stay in the dorms and relax. The cafeteria food for lunch and dinner is very good, although the breakfast selection does get old fairly quick."
Alum,4,I would have preferred more diversity of student body overall and per department; however very good flexibility for personal interdisciplinary endeavors and supportive faculty.
Sophomore,4,"Coming from a female sophomore, the party scene is somewhere between 3 stars-- average and 4 stars--good.  It's not USC or UCSB, so incoming students shouldn't expect extremely crazy parties. The fraternities host a lot of parties on Fridays and Saturdays, which have different vibes/sizes depending on where you go. The ones that are bigger tend to be a lot of fun but sometimes whether a night will have good parties or not can be unpredictable which is annoying. I do wish there were more house parties for older students that don't have to do with fraternities. There are bars near campus that the older students tend to go to."
Junior,4,"Obviously, there are things that could be better, but so much of the school is amazing! There is a great community of students that are supporting and friendly, especially if you join clubs. For me, that club was Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. I loved getting to know everyone and sharing life with them!"
Senior,4,Chapman was like my saving grace school. I tried transferring to other places and would have spent more time for the same degree. Chapman made it easy to  transfer and get my coursework finished in a timely manner. The professors were so welcoming and understanding of my unique situation and helped me get acclimated to campus life and took an interest in my personal life as well to ensure I would succeed in all aspects.
Senior,4,"Chapman has a beautiful campus and is encompassed by the cute, quiet historic town of Orange. The buildings and facilities are unbelievable and expanding everyday. Faculty to student ratio is good with small class sizes. Campus and cafeteria food is really good."
Junior,4,I’ve been a Chapman Business major and Spanish minor and I love it.  The classes are small sized and about 25 to a class and the professors always know your name-  several teach at Chapman & USC.  I love the small campus size and the intramural soccer I play on!  It’s easy to see other students you know on campus and the downtown Orange area is so fun.  The Greek life at Chapman is really strong even though I chose not to go that path.  I am so busy between finance classes and soccer travel that It’s a great balance for me.  In my Freshman year I was in the dorm and they are the nicest dorms around!! Super clean.  In Fall 2019 it is required that all new students must commit to 2 years of living on campus- you’ll like it and it REALLY helps you to connect with another students in your major!
Alum,4,"Overall had a great experience at Chapman.  Challenging academics with supportive professors, and there are so many opportunities for leadership and involvement.  This really helped me to grow as a student and person, and to improve my resume. ;)  
Chapman is constantly growing and striving to better its reputation worldwide, though it still retains the benefits of a smaller school.  
As for what needs to change?  Well, there's obviously room for more diversity in the student population."
Alum,4,"As a transfer student, it was a little hard to make friends, as people have settled in their groups by their junior year. However, overall, I really liked Chapman! Join as many groups/clubs as you can, and buy a Disneyland annual pass."
Sophomore,4,"Chapman has amazing faculty and the student life here is very vibrant. The small community allows you to make friends very easily and I definitely recommend joining clubs, sports, or greek life! It's an amazing way to meet new people. The academics are pretty good; the only down side I have is the small campus and student population."
Junior,4,Chapman is a great school. Professors are very helpful and willing to help you outside of class as well. Campus is beautiful and always clean.
Freshman,4,I love the small campus and school population. People are very nice and caring. Great academic programs.
Junior,4,"Chapman University is an amazing school. And while I love it here, there are a few things that I wish I had known prior to committing to the school:

1. The business school has the ability to curve your grade down. Each class must have an average GPA (in the class) of 2.8. So if the grades are too high, the professor reserves the right to (and in most cases will) curve your grade down. It's done to make the school seem more competitive but it really screws over some of the students. 

2. The financial aid department is not as helpful as you want. Every time I've gone into the office everyone was super rude. There are only a few kind people in there.

3. It's super hard to get a job, even with work study. The surrounding area of Orange has tons of restaurants and shops so if you are looking for a way to help pay for school, that's your best bet. If you are granted work study, good luck finding a job because almost all of them are already taken."
Freshman,4,"Chapman is a great school. It is located 10 minutes from Disneyland, and is also a relatively short drive away from both San Diego and Los Angeles. Academics are great, people are friendly, and there is little to complain about."
Sophomore,4,"Chapman is a great school for anyone looking for a smaller, more intimate learning experience. Small class sizes allow students and professors to have a close relationship and the school makes an effort to be inclusive and safe for all."
Sophomore,4,"Chapman has fantastic facilities, clubs, programs, and engagement. The only thing lacking is diversity."
Senior,4,"The classes and teachers are good, if you do your research.  Orange County is very Republican, as are a lot of the students.  If you're a liberal, prepare to debate!"
Niche User,4,"Chapman is a beautiful campus, however very pricey. They are slightly stingy with their scholarships so be prepared to drop serious cash if you are planning to attend. Other than that, great school, good-looking people and a vibrant student community."
Freshman,4,"My time at Chapman has definitely been rewarding so far. Every person you pass by on campus always has a smile and is very friendly. As for classes, yes some courses are challenging. But each professor goes out of their way to make sure every student has resources available to them in order to improve their grade in class. There are multiple tutors, SI sessions, office hours, and even outside meetings if needed. Overall, Chapman is a warm and loving place to attend and I am looking forward to the rest of my time here."
Junior,4,"What I love about Chapman is the welcoming feeling I get every time I step on campus. I have been able to develop some wonderful relationships with not only friends, but staff and faculty as well. Due to the smaller class sizes at Chapman, it's very easy to get to know the professors well and find time to meet with them outside of class for extra help. What I do not care for at Chapman is the high priced tuition. Since it is a private university, the cost of attendance is much higher than that of other schools on the west coast. However, they do offer financial aid which does help many students."
Niche User,2,"I transferred out of Chapman after 1 semester, so my experience there was limited but enough to make me want to leave immediately. To me, Chapman felt exclusionary to anyone who wasn't incredibly ""mainstream."" It felt like the museum of icecream in sf: designed purely for appearances and popular for those who were part of a particular crowd, but otherwise just not a spectacular place. My peers seemed uninterested in the actual learning part of college, wanting more to make connections. A valid approach to college, but not one that resonated with me in any way. This is an amazing college for some, but if I had read a review that summed up my experience in this way, i definitely would have thought twice about attending. Pretty good financial aid, very mediocre housing (three people in a room designed for two) and ok everything else."
Senior,2,"Honestly only very negative things to say. I have had a handful of great teachers mixed with several years of very poor teachers, andthe worst ran Spanish department I have ever seen. I have had a teacher tell me my career is ""embarrassing and a shame"". Classroom sizes are small but I found myself surrounded by other people who were all there ""because college is what you do after high school"". Advising is horrible and hard to work with and you just meet with a random administrator not a personal advisor. If you're interested in social aspects like Greek Life you will have a fun time but as someone who went to college for personalized education and connections I am very disappointed. I have been in community college classes ten times for personalized than the years of rigid education provided. I had a teacher tell me he was told by his department head he could only give 5 As out that semester because they're trying to raise the rankings of their business school.  Just not a great place"
Freshman,2,"I left and so did others. Administration only cares about growing. Dining hall has mediocre food, is like a fishbowl. Not much downtown and no one goes. If you are a Caucasian, Greek type, you will enjoy the school. Students party in the middle of the week. The dorms are okay, but after freshman year, the options are limited to poor choices: 20-minutes away or Motel 6 apts on campus, it's atrocious. Orange is dicey, the grocery stores are awful and dirty. The campus is lonely on weekends because most go home, as there are a lot of SoCal students. The admissions recruiters are nice but the rest of admin is awful. I had spoken to so many people who LOVED Chapman but in retrospect, they were WASPS who went Greek with SoCal people who only hang with people like themselves."
Freshman,2,"for $70k a year it's not worth it. all of my teachers are brand new at the school and seem very confused. lack of communication between the school and teachers and students makes it very difficult to attend. most of the kids who go there all try to look and act the same, kinda sad. overall extremely disappointed. all they care about is their film school and you can't get classes, im not on track to graduate in 4 years now, something they promised i could do. pretty dorms but i dont know anyone happy with their roommate.  they definitely did not do a good job matching people.food sucks unless you only eat chicken and pasta. campus is gorgeous but extremely small."
Freshman,2,"Honestly, my first year experience at Chapman was not so great. Everything here is average- the academics, the campus, and the people. 
In fact, I'd say my social experience here was far below average. Coming from a place of diversity, I experienced a culture shock when I came to Chapman. It's not the fact that the school is predominantly white, it's the fact that many of the people here are pretentious, close-minded, and have never seen the ""world"" before. 
But to end things on a positive note if you're looking for a good film program, a small campus, and a ""bubble"" of similar-looking and acting people then come to Chapman. But if you really want to challenge your world-view, step outside of your comfort zone, and truly experience what college should be like, then I believe there should be numerous other colleges that would excel at that."
College Sophomore,2,"The freshman dorms leave much to be desired- cramming three students each into a glorified broom closet. There is absolutely no privacy, and the roommate selection system simply doesn't work. It seems that at least 1/4 of my hall, myself included, were very unhappy with their roommates. The only saving grace is that each room has a private bathroom, otherwise this would be a complete disaster."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Life is everywhere at Chapman, and something like 30-40% of students pledge. The professional fraternities and honor societies have amazing reputations and are generally considered to be a good option. The social fraternities, however, are a nightmare. They are mostly comprised of the entitled douchebags who are just there on their parent's dime to party. They have almost highhandedly made Orange residents hate Chapman for their reckless behavior."
College Senior,2,"Campus sexual assault is a huge problem that is rarely addressed by administrations and when it is, it's insufficient, inadequate, and not enough. There needs to be radical changes in this issue."
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive. If you have the time and patience go ahead.
College Freshman,2,We're a predominantly white school.
College Freshman,2,This school is very cliquey and pretentious. The teachers are great if you want a one-on-one teaching method but it is difficult to gain friends or a social life without being a part of the Greek life. The students care about image and it is easy to feel left out.
College Freshman,2,Party scene is quite terrible and the top frats think their parties are so sick but they're actually so boring
College Freshman,2,It's just like at any school. It's not a Chapman problem it's a people problem.
College Freshman,2,"I don't think Chapman students even know what sports are, really disappointing. School spirit doesn't exist when it comes to athletics. More people will show up to improve shows than to a football game."
College Freshman,2,"Chapman does not promote greek life as other universities do. Although there are community activities hosted by the Greek life, their impact on the surrounding community seems minimal. I know that there are other groups that students are involved in that are separate from the social scene that do a lot more for the surrounding town."
Recent Alumnus,2,Graduate school does not have school dorm or housing
College Junior,2,"I didn't like my time at Chapman (two years) very much, but thats not to say that it isn't a great school for some people.  I think that it just wasn't the right school for me.  I am an outdoors-oriented person, and Chapman offers little to nothing in that realm.  A lot of it has to do with the location.  

Orange is a nice area of Southern California, but it is basically a residential neighborhood surrounded on three sides by major highways. The ""downtown"" area of Orange, known as the Circle, consists of a ridiculous amount of antique stores and restaurants that are too expensive for anyone on a student budget.  There's plenty to do in the area around Orange, but it takes serious effort to find most of it.  The beach is fairly close (30 min away) but real (ones that aren't dusty foothills) will be at least an hour drive away. Orange just doesn't have a very strong college town vibe, if at all.

Chapman has a beautiful, modern campus, but the entirety of it takes up about two city blocks.  Though its fairly large in population (5,000ish students) for a private liberal arts institution, the college just feels extremely small due to the physical size. You can't go onto campus without seeing at least 5-10 people that you know.

On top of that, Orange is a town which has a population of two distinct demographics: the Orange locals, who are mainly senior citizens, and Chapman students that live off campus.  Since the Chapman social scene largely consists of house parties, and the locals don't much like Chapman students, you can expect most parties to be broken up by the police by about 11:30.  

Academics wise, however, I loved Chapman. In fact, it was the classes that kept me there for two years.  The teachers are extremely knowledgeable, the class sizes are tiny, and the material is interesting.  I would regularly go to my professor's office hours and they were always easy to talk to, helpful, and made plenty of time for me."
College Senior,2,There are not many organizations that effectively promote diversity. Even the school's QSA was unfriendly to people who feel outside the L and the G.
College Junior,2,"Honestly, very lame and the party scene gets old very quickly. Just small houses, crammed with the same people, and the cops come and role the party before midnight. After Freshman year, people stop going to random parties and usually settle into a group of friends to chill with. In general, not worth the time and energy to be apart of. If you're looking for ragers, go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,Party's get shut down really quickly and most parties are a hit or miss kind of deal... Mostly misses.
College Junior,2,I think its annoying and distracts from school spirit.
College Sophomore,2,"Sports? The school can do a better job of creating school spirit. It doesn't help that the school is a Division III school in sports, so it's not exactly a talented athlete's first choice. It's actually really sad. An average typical high school has more school spirit than Chapman."
College Junior,2,Don't give you what you need half the time
College Senior,2,"Only frat events, and you'll only know about them if you know someone. All byob or trust in the mystery beverage."
College Senior,2,"They have no sympathy if you are poor. I came to Chapman to get a very specific degree, and I'm leaving with more debt than my first year job salary. They like to pretend they will swoop in and make education possible for everyone, but it's a sick joke."
College Freshman,2,"As soon as Sororoity Recruitment and Fraternity Rush had occurred, I saw cliques beginning to form all over campus. Girls who used to walk together began walking only with ""sisters"" from their sorority. Non-Greeks, for the most part, look down on Greek life, considering it to be very catty (for sororities) and womanizing (for fraternities)."
College Freshman,2,"There is no school spirit, and the sports aren't that great"
College Sophomore,2,There is no variety and very awful hours.
College Sophomore,2,There really just isnt anything other than homes and a few schools. Thats pretty much it.
College Junior,2,"While less than half of students most likely partake in drugs, when I dormed on campus, the hall would smell of marijuana about once a week."
College Junior,2,Chapman's parking situation is a pain. They just added another parking structure but it's a good ten minute walk to campus or you can put your faith into the shuttle system they're trying to get the kinks out of. The structures closer to campus fill up very quickly and as the day goes on it can become rather difficult to find a spot.
College Junior,2,Most students are upper to middle class whites. It's a small campus so the lack of diversity is more noticable. Clubs geared towards ethnic groups and sexualities do make minority presences known.
College Freshman,2,I've never been to a game of anything ever here.
College Freshman,2,The diversity that is here on campus is a extremely diverse mix itself. The problem is that diverse group doesn't make up even a fifth of the campus.
College Freshman,2,The hours aren't not very convenient and the services are subpar.
College Freshman,2,Some professors just do not give a shit and it is difficult to take classes not in your major.
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do here. There is nowhere for students to hang out.
College Freshman,2,They are all white and only hang out with people who are stuck up and preppy.
College Freshman,2,lame. the RA's are nosy and they have a no tolerance policy for drinking.
College Freshman,2,"I have been wanting to change my major and the staff and advisors are really unable to help. They do not do much to help you, despite making meetings with them and trying to get help. Changing your major to an arts major is so difficult if you did not apply to the school as an arts major."
College Freshman,2,Our football team is lame and nobody really gives a shit about it.
College Freshman,2,"Orange County has a bunch of old, rich white people who don't like noise or young kids. They always call the police on parties and the area is stifling. It's okay if you like shopping and eating at pricey restaurants, but definitely not a college town because it is mostly boring. You have to go all the way to LA to have a good night out or do anything interesting. Orange is possibly one of the most boring cities in the universe."
College Freshman,2,Changing your major to theatre or film is impossible
College Freshman,2,Most parties get shut down in an hour by PSafe
College Student,2,"In hs we had parties a lot. coming to college i expected too much from chapmans social scene but it also gave me very little back. there is one bar near campus that everyone goes to. you can't get in with a fake but if u know people you can get snuck in. there are awful crowded parties that get rolled by or before 12am. you have to walk to most house parties near campus if youre lucky youll have a friend who will dd. there aren't any clubs, and it honestly basically sucks lol."
College Student,2,"Personally, I think the athletics here are kinda bad. The gym is way too small, amazing equipment. Just not nearly enough of it. ex. there is only one 20lb bar to use. The team performance idk if any of our teams are good because very few people actually attend the sporting events here, not even the football games. The only time a football stand is packed is homecoming. The school spirit really sucks, as well as the fan support. If you're a big college football fan and you want that experience of tailgating and football games with your friends, it won't happen here."
College Sophomore,2,I never park at campus.  my mom drops me off on one of the side streets and i walk in.
College Freshman,2,I do not like it. The social atmosphere seems so fake and people do not seem personable
College Sophomore,2,"Definitely, there are drug problems among the students, some people would say it is lower than most schools, but I believe it should be nonexistent."
College Junior,2,"I have not been able to receive enough aid to get through school, my mom supports 5 kids, and 3 of us are in College yet I received a very small amount."
College Sophomore,2,Chapman is a division 3 school so most people don't go to the games or know about them. 
College Junior,2,"I didn't know Chapman was huge on Greek Life, but they are.  About 60% of the population is in one.  It really takes away from the social aspects of everyday student life.  "
College Junior,2,"I think the food served at Chapman is very unhealthy for the amount they charge.  The only place I go to most of the time is Jamba Juice for fresh squeezed orange juice - but again, this isn't a healthy ""meal."""
College Junior,2,It is impossible to use Public Transportation in Orange County or Los Angeles as a whole.
College Junior,2,Nowhere to go - especially again without a car for transportation.
College Freshman,2,"If you do not have a car or friends with a car, you will be on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Could be a lot better, but it has its days of course."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much public transportation at Chapman.
College Sophomore,2,I got a scholarship but no financial aid because I don't qualify for it. 
College Sophomore,2,It can be because I don't know where the parties are but I've been to a few and they were boring.
Sophomore,1,"This school only cares about money. The classes and teachers are ordinary especially for the business school. Teachers are unwilling to help and meet students with busy schedules and often don't care enough to help the students actually learn. Nobody is willing to help or guide you and will often lead you down a never ending rabbit hole in search of some type of help or guidance. Trust me on this one, don't waste your time with this school."
College Freshman,1,Nobody cares about the athletics at all. Nobody goes to football games. The only time I went to any sport was when I accidentally walked by the stadium and there was a game. The stands were quite empty.
College Freshman,1,It's honestly so bad I had more fun at my highschool house parties than at the house parties at Chapman. And if you don't like small house parties this is absolutely not the school for you. If you want a bar/club/nightlife scene at all this is not the school for you.
College Freshman,1,"Chapman greek life is not like greek life at any other school. It's kind of pointless to be in a sorority because your life will be the same if you're not in one except you'll have a few thousand dollars in your pocket. if you're a boy however, don't think that you're getting into any frat parties unless you're in a fraternity."
College Junior,1,"Sports are a joke on this campus. I've never been to an athletic event. However, the track and gym are always open, and it's easy to stay fit."
College Sophomore,1,"The school is in the worst location for a college. Surrounded by many homes, if any one throws a party, it's most likely that the cops will show up before you even get there. Greek life throws some events, so those are worth going to if you want to have a good time, and you don't even need to be in a frat or sorority to go to them."
College Freshman,1,Did not receive any scholarships even though I came in with a 3.9 gap. This school is so stingy.
College Junior,1,"Even though my dad is an alumni and received a grant for $30,000 for his education, I have not had good experience with the financial aid office. After sending multiple emails with no response, I finally went in to the office. There, she informed me that they do not give out any grants to graduate students and that I would just have to wait for my financial aid packet to come in the mail if I had any questions. I was extremely disappointed."
College Freshman,1,the parking officers are so strict and they are awful
College Freshman,1,I would not choose my major or school again if i could do it all over again.
College Freshman,1,"Though some others may like Chapman, and I respect that, it is not for me. Orange is too small and most people here are very closed-minded. The environment is not good for anyone who is an individual or free thinker because most people here pretend to be friendly, but they're all just phony poseurs. Most people are kind of friendly, but they all stick to their own groups. The school has been so incredibly unhelpful in my switching of my major and the school is just too small for me. It is not diverse and everyone here is obsessed with being hot and in shape and there is a bro/douche vibe. If you're shallow and only care about being attractive and stupid, then come here. But most people here are not very intelligent, so it is difficult being in an environment with people who just want to party and go to the gym."
College Student,1,"Race: predominantly white and by that i mean besides asians there are VERY few minorities. Coming in I thought it'd be easy because that's how i grew up however it isn't the same for some reason.

Economic background: you're either super rich and stuck up, or here on scholarship

religion: isn't a big thing here

sexual orientation: a lot of gays go here. they're never treated differently."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do
College Freshman,1,"The only part about Chapman that really bugged me was the Financial Aid stuff. Yeah, they give scholarships (which can be easily taken away if you don't make grades). But there aren't enough for everyone. They also give too many people work-study money...but jobs are extremely limited. I applied to over 30 before even getting an interview. It sucked. So yeah...I'm pretty bitter about the financial situation. I won't be able to afford Chapman all 4 years without proper aid. "
College Junior,1,"The Orange Circle is not very college party scene friendly, so people usually go to LA or elsewhere, so directly around Chapman there is really nothing."
College Student,1,Everything is pretty expensive in the area
College Freshman,1,"The impressions I've gotten from majority of the boys here is that they make look great on the outside, but not so much once you get to know them. They are all sports guys or skater boys. "
College Freshman,1,"I don't know of any nightlife options available near Chapman. If you want to go to a club you need to commit a trip to downtown LA. Other than that, there's really just house parties and Disneyland. "
College Freshman,1,Everyone fits the same stereotype. Majority of people here are white with the exception of a small percentage of students with ethnic backgrounds. 
College Freshman,1,"It has been extremely hard for me to find my niche here. The academic aspect of the school is fine (not amazing but fine), but the social life is unbearable. Everyone seems to fall into the category of SoCal beach girl/guy with tan skin and blonde hair, a member or Greek Life, and goes to parties Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I struggled to find a friend group and the weekends are miserable. The town is so small and there is nothing to do besides party -- which would be great if the parties didn't get rolled every weekend. I am looking into transferring to a school with a better night life and social life with variety and easier availability. "
College Freshman,1,"If you want to be able to go out and do things, you can't just walk there. You need to have a car. And parking is impossible. If you're not there at the right time or you're just not lucky, all the good spots will be gone and you'll be forced to park in a lot inconvenient to you. "
College Sophomore,1,"There's never enough space for anybody to park. Also, permits are really expensive. "
College Sophomore,1,I am a strategic and corporate com major. The program is brand new and EXTREMELY unstructured/unprepared. I'm very disappointed in it. 
College Sophomore,1,"I seriously cannot say anything nice about the food here. The system is ridiculous - if you live in a residence hall, you are REQUIRED to have a meal plan (which is $2,000 a semester alone). The caf is only open very specific limited hours and the food is not very healthy. Little to no vegan options. I seriously HATE Chapman's meal plan system. It's absurd. The other food places on campus besides the caf are fairly good but the people that work there are under-trained, slow, and the service is terrible. "
College Junior,1,The financial aid office (which employs students) is abhorrent and full of incompetent girls that could not find their way out of a paper bag. They are guilty of losing my paperwork countless times and making me suffer and struggle to get classes which is absolutely unfair. It seems as though they target those that require financial aid and push them aside for the students that can have DADDY pay for their full priced tuition with the grab of his wallet.
College Junior,1,"There isn't very much school spirit, nobody goes to games unless they personally know somebody, and the cheer/band teams are really small. Homecoming football game is attended by many more (usually alumni). Lacrosse is the most supported, and there are also intramurals just for fun."
College Junior,1,"There are not many fellow African-Americans at Chapman University. Although, the select few that there are come together in a club named BSU (Black Student Union). It a community open to ALL races. If we don't feel accepted from the larger student body of Chapman from them to us, we flip the switch and open our hearts--from us to them. It is a growing success. Many Caucasians enjoy being part of events and meetings."
College Freshman,1,"If you aren't a part of greek life then you can't really join the party scene of Chapman unless you know people in the party. Greek life has no greek housing (greek row) because of some stupid Orange county law. Without a greek row, the school never gets the traditional greek feel to it, which I'm sure we all want instead of having 4 different houses for 5 or 6 different guys in the fraternity that the party can hop to if they get rolled (which happens VERY often)."
College Sophomore,1,"Good Luck! It's been particularly difficult to find housing this year. Due to the renovations and demolition of many of the houses/apartments Chapman owns, a lot of students were left to scramble to find housing. It's taken me three months to find a place. Unless you can afford luxury housing or find a place in April/May, you could have a huge problem. 

Stay away from Santa Ana, Buena Park, and certain parts of Anaheim at all costs. Really research the area you're going to live in. 

Also, if you rent a room from a family, don't pay more than $600/month with utilities included. Most of these families rent their rooms in order to bring in excess income, not because they need the money. Try to find a place that allows access to their laundry room. You'll be happy you did!"
College Junior,1,Classes Are Always Full – They offer a lot of classes but when you go to register they are full and most rent even being offered when compared to their full catalog
College Freshman,1,"If you aren't white and rich, you are obviously a visitor.. The only people here are white people with a lot of money. Very pretentious and stuck up."
College Freshman,1,"This Place Is Drab. When I first heard that chapman was in the middle of Orange County, I was so sure that I will never run out of places to eat at night! the only place that is 24/7 in here is that rat infested taqueria de anda that serves mediocre mexican food with rat meat as their main ingredient."
College Senior,1,"I Hope You Have Money. I come from a family that does not have that much money, and yet during my sophomore year after my father sold his business right before the economy completely crashed, all of my financial aid was taken away.  It didn't matter that my mom makes a very, very small amount per year working in a rural public school or that my parents have to live off that money, supporting themselves and the rest of the family with it for the rest of their lives.  Instead, when I explained this as well as the fact that I and multiple other members of my family have documented medical problems that also consume lots of funds per year, I received a shrug and a ""sorry!""  Chapman raises tuition every year--yet spends so much of it on frivolous things like pressure washing the sidewalks or getting ugly statues rather than giving students financial aid--and raises their salaries each year, as well."
College Senior,1,"Southern California, in general, has horrible public transportation, but Chapman and Orange are particularly bad.  Public Safety officers will pick you up and drive you back to your dorms if you need help at night--I've ever had a few drive me all the way home (which, at the time, was 2 blocks from the dorms), but there really should be shuttles throughout the day and night.  Additionally, there are few bus routes.  If you don't have a car, you're in trouble, and it's ridiculous that Chapman doesn't take their less-wealthy students, who can't afford cars AND school, into consideration."
College Senior,1,"Pick-And-Choose Policies = Unsuccessful – There's not a huge focus on keeping people safe from violent crimes or sex crimes, it seems, as the campus is poorly lit, not particularly patrolled, and there are very few safe phones to help people quickly call for help if necessary.  Instead, there's a huge focus on ensuring that people do not drink or smoke marijuana (regardless of whether those who partake are of age or have a medicinal marijuana card), which is bizarre.  Additionally, parties get shut down incredibly quickly because the residents of Orange get upset, which is ridiculous considering they chose to live next to a college.  Generally speaking, college towns have considerably louder, younger populations that often are looking to partake in drinking and partying on the weekends, so choosing to live next to a school of 4,000+ students--most of whom are around the age of 21--and whining that they're ruining your sleep sounds sort of absurd.  It's like living next to a dog shelter and complaining about the barking; what did you think was going to happen?"
College Junior,1,"Public Safety Rules With an Iron Fist – It's a sad cliche but the campus safety staff targets ethic minorities, does not defend students in the LGBT community and overall destroys every party it touches."
College Sophomore,1,"Find Somewhere Else – The nightlife in Orange is pretty much non existent. There are a few bars but they're a little sketch and obviously you need to be 21 or older to get into them. There are parties on the weekends, but the general population of Orange is 90 years old and they complain about the noise so parties get shut down pretty fast. You can always find something to do with friends, but if you want clubs or real ""nightlife"" you need to make the 45 minute drive to LA because Orange is dead by 8:00pm."
College Sophomore,1,"Fix This NOW – Chapman needs a drastic fixer-upper.  There are too many people drunk on campus after 7 pm all days of the week and I can constantly smell people smoking weed through the vents of my dorm.  It is unacceptable how easy it is for people to smoke, drink, and do drugs on campus.  My freshman year there was even a drug bust in the room across the hall from me and they confiscated pot, knives, and other weapons."
College Sophomore,1,"Low Quality for Big Bucks – Most of the restaurants closest to campus are in Old Towne Orange, which is full of antique shops and over-priced restaurants. All the restaurants close by 7 p.m., and for what you pay, you hardly get any quality. The only places that hold their own in the Circle are Bagel Me, a delicious bagel shop that is good for breakfast, and Cherry on Top, which is a self-serve fro-yo place. If you bike half a mile to Tustin Street, you can get a wide variety of fast food, but still, no restaurants that are worth the price they charge for mediocre food that leaves much to be desired. I still have yet to find a restaurant on Tustin Street that I would be wiling to go to more than once."
College Freshman,1,"No Freedom – If you like going to parties where the house gets ""rolled"", go ahead and apply to Chapman. In regards to parking, public safety is anal and gives tickets left and right."

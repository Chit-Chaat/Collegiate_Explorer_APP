Freshman,5,Meredith College is more than college. When walking onto campus they knew my name and treated me like family. Each visit I had with the college was welcoming and I was provided new information each time. They constantly update me with anything as small as a repair on the sidewalk to anything as large as a meeting happening. Those connected to Meredith College stay will Meredith College. They hold uplifting support and cherish old traditions. I will continue to be amazed with the experiences I have at Meredith College.
Alum,5,I took a hybrid online anatomy class through Meredith. The lectures were online and the labs were in person. My online experience went very well. The professor was creative with assignments in order to hold us accountable to watching the lectures. I enjoyed the flexibility the online class provides while still feeling like I am getting a firm education and experience.
Alum,5,"Meredith College is an experience like no other. From the unique traditions to the best professors and small class size, you are guaranteed to have an all around, positive experience that you cannot find anywhere else."
Junior,5,Learning with Meredith is a great experience to have. The professors will contact you to make sure that you are up to date with the work that is being posted. If you get behind because learning can be hard then they are most definitely understanding.
Graduate Student,5,"Meredith is an amazing institution. They have some incredible professors who are really on the ball at all times and very responsive in this time of chaos. They really make class interesting and provide content that is easy to understand and learn. Projects are really enjoyable too - relevant to class but also a great way to apply what we are being taught in a more ""real life"" opportunity."
Graduate Student,5,I love Meredith! They provide great opportunities for everyone in so many different fields. The are a highly accredited institution and they live up to every piece of that. Teachers are amazing and really helpful when you are struggling which is incredible.
Senior,5,"I transferred to Meredith after not fitting in at another school and am so happy that I transferred. By coming to Meredith, I have been able to meet professors and students that I connect with and am truly grateful for. I am learning so much more in Meredith's small classes than I did at my former university, and am given individualized guidance for my education and career."
Senior,5,"The online course I took for my major over a summer was simple due to the professor carefully laying out instructions and requirements. During the pandemic, my online learning experience at Meredith College was a smooth transition and did not cause any difficulty for me. My professors were prepared and kept their students up to date, and classes over Zoom were not much different from classes on campus. Turning in assignments and tests via email and Brightspace was simple and quick."
Niche User,5,Meredith looks like a fun college to go to in the future. I will keep this school in mind when it comes to picking my school.
Sophomore,5,"Meredith College is an inspirational school that has helped me discover who I really am! I would recommend Meredith to anyone because no matter what your interests are, they will help you reach your goals!"

Sophomore,5,"I love all of the traditions here and Meredith and how welcomed i felt when i first became an angel. The entire campus, staff, other students and so nice. It feels like a big family just wanting to help each other succeed."

Sophomore,5,Meredith is a great college and does everything to support its students! :) I have loved being part of the meredith community and look forward to the future years I have at Meredith!
Sophomore,5,My classes were all in person for the exception of the classes moved online due to quarantine. Meredith has supported their students through the online schoolwork.
Junior,5,"After a few years of switching colleges I finally found one that clicked. At Meredith college, they make it their mission to create the best experience for their students. With loads of ways to get involved with the school, fun extracuriculars, caring faculty, and A LOT of really amazing programs it is no wonder I love it so much here."
Freshman,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my first semester at Meredith!  I am a commuter student--and I was told before I attended that I would struggle to make friends because of this.  I have proven that statement false!  I have many wonderful friends.  Not just that, but I have been given the opportunity to befriend my professors!  The small classes have been very influential in my academic success.  My greatest complaints about the college are the excessive cost and the religious coldness of this formerly Southern Baptist college.  As a side note, my rating on the campus food and the dorms are what I've garnered from my on-campus friends."
Sophomore,5,"When I first came to Meredith college, I was blown away. Not that it is just a all women's school but that they have many connections and many opportunities for scholarships and internships for whatever major that the student applied for."
Alum,5,I absolutely loved attending Meredith. It was such a great experience. I learned so much and it helped me become the strong woman that I am today.
Senior,5,An amazing place to be where class sizes are small and professors genuinely care about you! Far from the typical college where professors don't know your name or have time for office hours. Professors and advisors are always willing to help in any way they can.
Junior,5,"Meredith College is a great school with wonderful and caring professors.  The classes are small enough to allow you to get to know your professors and your fellow students. Meredith has a small college atmosphere but also has lots of activities and many things to do nearby.  Many different majors are offered in the undergraduate program. A new major that was added recently is Hospitality.  They have also created a 5 year MBA program.  Meredith College is located in Raleigh, North Carolina-near North Carolina State University.  Meredith is an all-women's college for undergrad and has coed graduate programs. On-campus housing apartments are available in addition to the dorms."
Junior,5,"Meredith College, is a place that is all about unity, sisterhood, and finding your strength. I have found my inner strength and starting to become the women I want to be. The professors go above and beyond for their students. I would not want to be anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely adore Meredith! It is worth every penny to attend this amazing institution. The traditions are deeply rooted in the school and enhance the learning done there every day. The professors care about their students so much and go out of their way to help students constantly. Overall a fabulous institution!
Freshman,5,"Very wonderful school, professors and staff are very involved in student's education and genuinely wants to see them succeed. The traditions are great, the community is tightly knit and there are many friendly people here. The academics are nice as well, some classes are more challenging than others but it is like that at any university. My advice is: if you're thinking of coming to Meredith, do it! You will not regret it."
Niche User,5,"All the girls at Meredith are super nice and it truly is a sisterhood amongst the community there. All the faculty is very informative and knowledgeable, they truly care about you as a person and your education straight off the bat. The campus is so beautiful.

Freshman,5,Meredith College is a Wonderland. That's actually what we call it. Meredith College engulfs you in an amazing community as soon as you enter its gates.
Freshman,5,Meredith College is the perfect college for people who want to go far in life. You get a wonderful education and wonderful resources to assist you in getting into graduate school or getting your dream job.
Senior,5,I love Meredith!! I never imagined myself attending this school but it was honestly one of the best decisions I have made. This school has helped me grow in every way possible and I know that once I leave I will always carry a piece of it with me. The networking the class onyx ring has is a big and helpful asset to the experience here.
Alum,5,"The Meredith College professors, administration, residence life, etc. are always willing to help. The classroom size is perfect for  one-on-one time with the professors. There are many resources available, such as the learning center. Thanks to the international programs you get to meet people from all over the world. My best friend was from South Africa."
Freshman,5,"Meredith has a wonderful community, helpful professors who are willing to help see their students succeed. Meredith College has a small nit community which is wonderful but also has the aspect of being located in downtown Raleigh which is great."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved the small and close knit community experience I had while at Meredith College. The many traditions we had were extremely fun and allowed me to get to know my classmates and administration staff on a personal level. The relationships I made with the administration staff made way for me to have awesome recommendation letters for graduate school and even helped me to gain jobs post college. Also, I was given the opportunity to study abroad in Spain through Meredith College. At Meredith I was exposed to various opportunities such as meeting renown individuals such as Alexa Von Tobel  and Gwendolyn Oxenham, I was placed into an internship that looks amazing on my resume - The Meredith Austim Program, and I even gained research experience. Going to Meredith not only gave me a chance to enjoy my time while I was there, but also prepared me for my future goals."
Senior,5,Amazing school all around!  Focuses on strengths and how to use those strengths in your classes and future career.  Empowering!  They try to get everyone involved in everything.  Great friendships developed through school events.  Faculty and staff are genuinely concerned about everyone and will do whatever it takes to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,Meredith College is a beautiful environment with welcoming students and faculty and great academics. I value the education Meredith has so far given me as a rising sophomore student here. The education is far above what I initially expected it to be and the professors really do care about you and your grades and how your grades affect you in the long run on your transcript so some professors try and help you out in any way that they can if you go talk to them. There are so many different cultures and personalities throughout the Meredith College student body which makes it super easy to collaborate and make friends.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so helpful, they are willing to work with you on payments for the tuition. The food could be better but Meredith is located off of a street that has many good places to eat, your also 20 minutes away from a major mall. We are right down the street from NC State and the fairgrounds. The school really wants to help you succeed."
Alum,5,"Meredith College is a great college that is  focused on educating young women and promoting leadership in a community setting. That said, it is a bit sorority-like, but that is easy to get past. The professors are excellent and really care about their students and make time to help them."
Sophomore,5,"I recently finished my first year at Meredith, and I am pretty glad that I chose to attend there. It's not a very big college, and you can get to classes without having to drive all over the place to get to another building. The professors are very helpful and so are the other staff and faculty members. I'm always told to make relationships with the people I meet at college because it may benefit me. It's not just the people that work at the school, but the people I go to class with and share a room with. The students are really friendly and are treated like family--a sisterhood. There is something for everyone at the college whether it's for religion, race, sexual orientation, or just something that just plain interests you. I would definitely want to come back even after I graduate in four years. Just for the experience."
Freshman,5,"Meredith College is great! It makes students feel like home. Every person is treated with respect and is well known by professors, advisers, and other students. It would be nice if the dining hall was shown a little more attention because sometimes the food is disappointing."
Niche User,5,I love the sisterhood at Meredith College and the bond you share between the people around you. I love being able to feel like you are in a small campus with a small student to staff ratio but also being able to walk down the road to a larger campus at NC State or downtown Raleigh and being in a bigger crowd.
Niche User,5,"Meredith is a great place to learn and make friends.  It is a private, all girls school and has a great community."
Niche User,5,"I will attend Meredith College in the fall as a transfer student. I have visited many times and love everything about this school. I did not go as soon as I graduated high school because of the price. It offers many programs that I am interested in, Social Work being my favorite."
Freshman,5,"Their welcoming environment and supportive community is perfect for helping me grow and flourish as an artist, honing and perfecting my skills to the highest possible quality. The campus life is very fun and exciting, plus they have an excellent cafeteria and gym- it's especially awesome that they have a driving range for golf! The teachers I've met are kind and welcoming, and based on the classroom size they make sure you're not a face lost in the crowd; they want to have a personal relationship with you and make sure that you succeed in the career you want to aspire for. Overall, Meredith proves to be an excellent environment for obtaining your degree!"
Junior,5,"I LOVE everything about Meredith. The people, the place and my classes are great. Those classes defintely challenges you. Food is ok. I love the student center and I will go there anyday!"
Niche User,5,I went to Meredith earlier this year in February for a leadership conference and I fell in love with this school. It is a beautiful campus with very friendly students. They have the major and minor that I wish to complete. I would recommend this school to anyone.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Meredith and I love it here. The community is great. There are always events that are happening and most of them are free. This school is very unique. The professors here care about the students and provide a quality education.
Alum,5,"My experience as a Meredith student was the perfect college experience.  While academically Meredith pushed me with a stringent course load and work, I left extremely prepared for both my profession and life.  Meredith empowered me to be a strong, independent, intelligent female who was equipped to handle whatever I might face in my career and life.  Having a daughter, I would be thrilled for her to have the opportunity to grow and become the best woman she can be."
Sophomore,5,"As a rising sophomore at Meredith College, I can honestly say that my freshman year was a huge success! Not only did I succeed academically, but I also was able to create strong connections with my teachers and fellow classmates."
Freshman,5,"I loved my first year at Meredith, the people were so nice, the teachers are pretty cool, and I liked my dorm. All the staff are super personal they really want to get to know you and care if you come to class or not. Because the campus is so small everyone pretty much knows each other which is nice because you'll see at least 2 people you know on the way to class. There are a lot of clubs on campus to get involved in so there are many ways to get involved. People on campus are usually nice there are some condescending snobs but not enough that it will hinder your experience. Overall, I had a great first year with few problems and I definitely recommend coming here."
Freshman,5,"It's an amazing school, I cant wait to experience life there as a freshman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)"
Sophomore,5,"The traditions are incredible and it makes the experience. At Meredith I am known. Professors care about me and take the time to ensure I am learning. I came to college to be a teacher but after discovering a lot about myself and the help of the faculty and career offices here,  I discovered what I actually love and the perfect major for me."
Freshman,5,I like the smallness of Meredith. I like the atmosphere and the people there are willing to help in every way possible. I feel at home when I visited Meredith and knew thats the place for me.
Freshman,5,"As a freshmen it has been a great experience so far! They push you to get involved , and it goes way out of your comfort zone."
Sophomore,5,Meredith College is a great place for young women to attend college. Meredith provides many different resources for the students and has an amazing support system. The friendships you make here last a lifetime.
Freshman,5,"Meredith is such a safe and encouraging environment. Meredith college gives you so many amazing opportunities, such as internships and scholarships for studying abroad. The staff is very kind and is always available to help. Meredith really care about their students and encourages use our strengths to achieve thing beyond what we thought we could do."
College Junior,5,My experience at Meredith has been amazing.
College Junior,5,I love the variety of majors and classes at my school. Classes aren't typically too large so students are able to connect with professors on a more one-on-one level. The professors really care about our success and want us to get the most our of each class. I am really happy about choosing Meredith.
College Junior,5,Most majors at my school require an internship to graduate and I think that is great. We get experience in our field and the professors are great with helping us find internships
College Junior,5,We have great resources on our campus and I know that we can go to campus police for any little or big problem
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Meredith College, I didn't know what to expect with online classes. I was nervous and clueless. My professor took the time to show me the ropes of the website we used called BrightSpace. I quickly learned how to navigate through my assignments and I was even able to quickly pay my tuition easily online. I enjoy having easy communication between me and my peers online. Each assignment is easy to turn in and navigate through with just the click of a button."
Junior,4,"Meredith is a great college if you are looking for something very lowkey and a campus that has a small population. This school is definitely not a party school if you want to find fun things to do in regards to student life you are going to have to find it off-campus. The campus is very safe, most of the professors you run into have your best interest at heart. The food is terrible but the Campus Restaurants (Beehive) is acceptable and better than the Dining Hall. Overall the sense of community will make up for what the college lacks."
Niche User,4,The Campus is huge and the people and super nice to anyone they meet and the staff are always looking to help you with anything.
Junior,4,My favorite thing about Meredith College is the professors in the Business School. They are really there to see us grow and learn.
Freshman,4,"The support system is beyond anything I could have imagined.  I came here with many problems that occurred during the beginning of my semester. However, thanks to the small community that Meredith is, I was able to get help. The financial aid office has been more than willing to help me as my mom recovers from Cancer and me with a car accident. Even though my academics started out poor, I'm able to now get help and encouragement from others. The social events are also amazing. There's a street festival that allowed me to eat really good bbq and hang out with my friends. There are multiple opportunities to find internships and jobs. In the end, I am enjoying Meredith more than I expected to and I am hoping I can continue to be enrolled in it and graduate."
Freshman,4,"I like about Meredith is that it is a small school where you can work with the professors on a one to one level. Also, the traditions they have are fun to do."
Freshman,4,"Meredith College is a wonderful school. I've had a great experience here and it's great to have a smaller school. This way you get more one on one experience with your teachers and you know that if you need help, you'll get it."
Graduate Student,4,"I'm definitely loving it.  Classes are small and I can contact my lecturers at any time.  The school itself is not quite updated, not too many healthy food choices for persons doing evening classes."
Graduate Student,4,"Knowledgeable a helpful faculty. Getting what I would evaluate as a quality education, and the relatively small body of students allows for genuine, personalized interaction with the professors. An affordable school. Campus is beautiful but lacks the energy and dynamics of the surrounding schools (NC State, UNC...). A VERY safe campus."
Freshman,4,"What I have enjoyed about attending Meredith College are the opportunities they offer to pursue our passions for our future career. This College makes you love your major even more, by applying to internships, volunteering and so much more."
Sophomore,4,Excellent teachers and fun student community! Teachers are great with helping one on one and being super supportive in and outside the classroom.
Junior,4,It is worth the price one pays for a private education. The Professors focus on building strong women and look out for the wellbeing of others.
Freshman,4,"Meredith is a small school; however, this is good and bad.  There are not many chances to get to know lots of new people. The small school can be suffocating sometimes. The small class sizes are wonderful for classes that are interesting."
Freshman,4,"Meredith is an all-womens college located in Raleigh, North Carolina near North Carolina State University. The classes are small and the academic life is great. Being a small private school, it's a little difficult to get involved, and not much happens on campus over the weekend. However, the traditions are strong and so is the ""sisterhood"". It's a very empowering place with people who want to lift you up."
Freshman,4,"Meredith College is very team oriented, believes sincerely in forming bonds between students.  Beautiful campus, very good class sizes but this translates into high costs so be prepared for sticker shock."
Freshman,4,Meredith College is a wonderful school with lots of opportunities to participate in extracurriculars and other local opportunities. The academics taught are exceptional and the small class sizes make it easy for teachers and students to connect. Being located in the middle of Raleigh near multiple other college campuses give an opportunity to connect and network with multiple other college students. While Meredith is somewhat secluded and safe from the dangers of Raleigh by its gates and setup the school can sometimes feel small and somewhat boring.
Senior,4,"Meredith College has a wonderful support system with all of its teachers and alumni there ready to help you succeed. I love that Meredith is such a small campus because it allows for the students and the teachers to become close and get to know each other. At Meredith you don't feel like a number, the staff go out of their way to make you feel like a person and they are always available to help you when you have an issue. The campus is beautiful, it becomes very easy to lose yourself in the scenery.  I love Meredith and would reccomend it to everyone."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Meredith College has been wonderful. The professors are great and are always more than willing to help you. We have a learning center where you can make appointments and have a one on one experience with a tutor of any subject. Also we have faculty and student advisers that go above and beyond to make sure your are taking the right path during your college journey.  
College Junior,4,"Meredith College is a small, all girls school with a decent sized adult education program. I'm an adult education student and I appreciate my the small class sizes (15-20 students) and how helpful  and approachable my advisers and professors are."
College Junior,4,I have always felt safe at while on campus whether it was day or night time.
College Junior,4,Living on campus was a great experience. I met my best friend while living in the dorms.
College Junior,4,Greek life is great way to meet friends who have the same interest in you.
College Junior,4,I have been to sporting events and they're great but the college focuses more on arts and business.
College Sophomore,4,Depending on your major and the connections you make at Meredith you can really go far.
College Sophomore,4,Meredith is a great place. The teachers are very approachable and the staff is really nice.
College Sophomore,4,"As a women's private college with boy hours, sexual assault doesn't happen on campus and if it did the campus is a safe place that openly discusses the importance of our safety."
College Sophomore,4,"While Meredith wasn't my first choice, I felt as though I became apart of a family during my first few weeks on campus. Some of the traditions I was a bit skeptical of but overall I enjoyed my experience."
College Junior,4,I actually work for the athletic department and I have been happy with the amount of support from fellow students and parents. Our school spirit is typically high and our students show up to support the fellow classmates. We maintain clean and safe facilities.
College Sophomore,4,They offer several PE classes that are suitable for anyone attending the college.  There is also an on-campus pool that everyone can use during their off-hours from classes and work.
College Junior,4,Campus Security is great but give an excessive amount of tickets for minor things.
College Junior,4,Class Sizes are small. you make friends quicker. everyone is open minded. professors for the most part are nice.
College Junior,4,Always clean and the RAs are always there to help and the RDs too
College Junior,4,Meredith is one of the safest places and very welcoming places in Raleigh. It forms its own little bubble of welcoming energy.
College Sophomore,4,"Public Safety is always strolling around on campus, but they give out way too many tickets for the amount of parking on our campus."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors are very nice and easy to talk to. If you're struggling, you can usually talk to them and they will try to help you. The class sizes are very small so the professors know each student by name. There is a pretty good variety of courses offered, however, there is a very limited number of seats available, and times available."
College Freshman,4,"I love Meredith. I love the people and the small community. I don't love the price and I'm not sure if its the best school for what I want to do. I don't want to leave Meredith, but I might have to. I don't know if the education is worth the price."
College Freshman,4,Meredith college has great security that do a excellent job at making sure that the campus is secure.
College Freshman,4,There are often career fairs on campus and places where students can go for career advising.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are challenging, not overbearing, and interesting. The professors are great and always willing to help the students if a student feels like she is not understanding the material being taught in class."
College Freshman,4,"My current dorm is situated close to most of my classes, which is very nice. The community with in the dorms is also really great; however, there are occasions where the rules about keeping quiet hours quiet could be emphasized more."
College Freshman,4,Greek life at Meredith College is small and very low key. Most of the Sororities are geared toward community service and specifically set up for a small community of people who a majoring in the same subjects.
College Freshman,4,The classes at Meredith are very interesting and informative. The teachers are very helpful and willing to work with you if you don't understand the subject matter.
College Freshman,4,Good for people interested in sports.
College Freshman,4,I am thrilled with the courses in my chosen field of study. There are many graduate students in my classes.
College Freshman,4,"Sometimes I wish it was a little more diverse in options here, but overall it's pretty good."
College Freshman,4,"Poteat is pretty dirty and claustrophobic, but the rest of the dorms are pretty nice and tend to have lots of storage available."
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I sometimes have a hard time dealing with some of the girls here, but that's to be expected at any college.  However, one wrongly accused me of cheating, and although the honor council declared me not guilty with no sanctions, my professor refused to change my grade.  Watch out for girls like these!"
College Freshman,4,quick to respond to issues
College Sophomore,4,The Greek life at my school revolves around honor societies and not parties at all.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at our school are wonderful! The college encourages women of all types to participate in sports and a lot of students enjoy coming to games on the weekends.
College Sophomore,4,I love Meredith College and it was one of my top choices when applying for college. I enjoy the small intimate feel of a private college while enjoying the challenging classes.
College Freshman,4,"I answered N/A for the above questions because I have yet to hear about any sexual assault issues on campus and I don't want to answer without knowing anything.  I feel safe on Meredith's campus, our security is very active and they care very much for the safety of us (as students), and faculty as well.  I think that at night, it would be more comforting to see security's presence in the courtyard (on the off chance that someone is walking alone back from the parking lots), but other than that I feel safe at Meredith."
College Freshman,4,"There are so many opportunities for internships and recruiting on campus, I am excited to utilize them in the future.  From what I have heard already, and the Blackboard job postings I am applying for, I know that Meredith gives great care to the future of their students."
College Freshman,4,"I've only had a semester at Meredith, since I am a member of the class of 2019.  I cannot wait to see what Meredith has to offer me in the future, and what I can give back to Meredith as well.  I love the girls I have met so far, I've had cooperative professors (who are understanding of my anxieties), and the courses that I have taken so far are relatively challenging."
College Freshman,4,"Meredith is a very unique school, with a unique environment and staff.  I found myself feeling at home on the first day, and that's saying something for someone who has social anxieties and such.  It is a creative hub while also balancing academics.  Everything and everyone is important, and I think that that's really special & you wouldn't find that at a large public university."
College Freshman,4,"One thing I really like about my school is that it's fairly easy to get to know one's professors and advisors. Many of mine from last semester knew my first name. Sometimes they knew me from interviews from before I came to school. It's also a great place to make friends. It feels like half the time I meet someone new, they know somebody that I know or am acquainted with."
College Sophomore,4,"Meredith is awesome. I really love it, but I wish there was more inclusion within the students."
College Freshman,4,I'm really happy to be at this school and excited to see where it takes me.
College Sophomore,4,The Bee Hive is great place to hang out and dine with your friends for lunch or in between classes.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of different housing options in the area that are close to campus.
Freshman,2,"Meredith College is a superb place to attend school for undergrad should you have a car and be from the surrounding Raleigh area. However, I do not recommend that anyone should come to Meredith from out-of-state unless you are an athlete. The classes are excellent and I love the relationships I have with my professors, but outside of that this is entirely a suitcase campus. Everyone goes home every weekend and some weeknights, or they are visiting their boyfriends at a different schools. The school has no social activities during the week or on the weekends that are worth going to. You may be thinking, ""I can just hop over to NC State or UNC or one of the surrounding schools for that!"" However in reality, if you are not friends with people from those schools before coming here you will find yourself incredibly isolated. Otherwise, this is a beautiful school with a plethora of academic opportunities. It's a wonderful place should you have the connections beforehand."
Freshman,2,"Not much diversity in campus life and activities. 

Lots of clubs to join, cafeteria food is okay, and professors are great."
College Junior,2,Not sure there is one
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is so small, athletics are not a huge involvement, which stinks.  Our facilities are not great whatsoever, and fan support is only there for a few teams."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many sports. I wish there were more club sports, for example, powderpuff football. Meredith is a women's college so there is not a football team, but a lot of girls at Meredith would love to have a flag football team. Maybe just freshman vs sophmores, juniors vs seniors, and then the winners face off. Make it a once a year thing like Corn."
College Sophomore,2,"My first year experience was not up to my expectations. My roommate never lived in the room, so I was alone for a majority of the year. I also didn't make many friends my first year, primarily because a lot of students came in already having friends from their high schools. I went to a small high school and only two people I knew went to my college. The college that I am attending now is also a small school, with a larger school right across the street, so it is difficult seeing all the school spirit from the football games and basketball games, when my school does not have that."
College Freshman,2,"I mean, it's an all women's college. What do you expect?"
College Junior,2,I hated living on campus. Students pay almost double compared to living off campus for a meal plan that makes students sick and isn't available past 6:30pm. You're not allowed to have boys on campus even if a brother or family member is coming in to visit from out of state. Did I mention the cost of housing yet?
College Junior,2,Meredith doesn't have a party scene. You have to go to NCSU to do anything fun.
College Freshman,2,"I live in Heilman, the freshman dorm secluded from everything. It's the newest building, built in '68, but it's falling apart, and I've never seen them clean anything. We had bats and had to evacuate 3rd floor, but all the vents are connected, so I'm sure breathing in those fumes was healthy. This is the 2nd worst dorm, but it's the only one not connected to the dining hall."
College Freshman,2,"We have sports here, but telling you we even have intramurals is a lie. No one attends the games, because they're very boring and no one cares about a D3 womens college."
College Sophomore,2,The process was awful but my school was extremely helpful
College Junior,2,"The dining hall/campus dining is the college's largest weakness.  The food is not bad, just not as great as all the other amenities the campus has to provide."
College Junior,2,"I never heard of any games at Meredith, any updates are slow and way after the game was done."
College Junior,2,"They ask for so many useless papers before they even give you any sort of financial aid. And when they do, it's like a few hundred dollars."
College Junior,2,Some of the dorms need to be renovated. Barefoot needs to opened and not there taking up space.
College Sophomore,2,They're very strict. It's not like living in jail but it sucks not being able to have a guy friend over in the dorms whenever you want.
College Junior,2,"Athletics at Meredith College are enjoyable for the athletes, but not very well advertised or encouraged by the rest of the student population.  I was a three season athlete in high school and attended most sports events that I did not play in.   However, now that I am at Meredith, I have never been to an athletic event due to the poor spirit and interest in athletic events on campus."
College Student,2,It's an all girl school so we do have sports but I have not attended any events or games and the majority of students are more involved in going to the school that is next to us (NCSU) for football and basketball games. 
College Student,2,"If able to choose my first year college destination again, I would not choose Meredith. I have been so disappointed with everything that school has offered. I started off with being paired up with a roommate that was totally opposite with everything that I had written on my compatibility roommate form which turned into a nightmare. I have a teacher that came right out and said that she wouldn't be ""teaching"" us, that she was there to answer any questions that we may have but we would be learning from the text books ourselves. My overall experience has been terrible and I can not wait to transfer. "
Senior,1,"After four years here, you either become a brainwashed student that pays more attention to their social media and onyx than the school's fundamental issues, or a hard-working student that has to stand on their own because the school offers no help. We have an anonymous newspaper (Meredith Briar Patch) to inform students of the real happenings around campus instead of what our biased herald will have you believe. 
If you don't get the onyx, be ready to answer to every Meredith girl why you don't have one. Because they will ask. A degree should count as your entry into the sisterhood, not a piece of jewelry. 
Financial aid only cares if you are a prospective student or an alumn. I've gotten emails EVERY semester stating that I would be removed from my classes if I didn't pay. It was always because my financial aid officer (that never spoke to me) hadn't updated my payment. Meredith definitely teaches leadership and it's because you have to lead everyone in Johnson Hall to do their job."
Freshman,1,This college is terrible. The activities they plan here are extremely boring and not fun at all. I would not recommend coming to Meredith. You pay so much to go here and you don't benefit from it. You pay a lot of money for terrible classrooms and horrible dorm life. The food in the dining hall isn't good either.
Freshman,1,"Where do I even begin with this college? 
You pay $40,000 + a year to go to a college with dorms that are in complete disrepair. (On the tour they only show you the one dorm they've renovated) 
This school just paid 3.5 MILLION for a new WELCOME CENTER while the dorms are falling apart, the classrooms and technology inside of them (if any) are outdated and the desks are wooden and ALSO falling apart.
They tell you that if they don't offer a major you want, you can take any of those classes and get your major at NC State. Guess what? Also a lie. I had planned to do this and Meredith suddenly said that the major I had wanted, the one they told me I could do at NCSU while attending Meredith, wasn't possible! Meredith staff and students will literally do and say ANYTHING to rope you in.  Even the students who say that they ""love it here"" complain all the time. Meredith is only the ""perfect school"" when they're trying to get vulnerable high school Seniors to attend."
College Junior,1,It's awful! You get meal plan dollars so that's nice but the food is so repetitive and they do the weirdest stuff to it.
College Freshman,1,"This is awful. No boys except on weekends, no drinking, no smoking, no parties, no noise after 10, nothing."
College Freshman,1,"Dry campuses suck and everyone leaves on the weekends anyway. State is your best bet, just don't go to Sig Pi."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek program at all.
Recent Alumnus,1,Do not come here if you are a transfer student. I now have an absolute massive amount of debt because this college does not put in any effort to helping transfer students. 
College Freshman,1,"There are no drugs visible on campus, this is my second semester at Meredith, i have yet heard of any drug or alcohol usage. The only thing that i usually see is people smoking regular tobacco. The policy is quite enforced, besides who wants to be caught doing such a thing."

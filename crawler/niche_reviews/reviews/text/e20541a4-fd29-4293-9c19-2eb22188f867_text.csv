Junior,5,The online classes I took one was really easy. However the other one was super hard for me. I couldn't learn from the videos and the professor offered little help.
Junior,5,I loved the advisors and the help that I got while I was there! The class sizes were just the right size to make me feel comfortable speaking up. So far a great experience and I can't wait for the Radiological technology program!
Sophomore,5,"I had a food experience transferring over to TCC and compared to the last college I went to, the admissions staff was always on point. The professors really care about their students passing and make good accommodations if something happens. The only problem I have had is advising staff giving me wrong information from time to time, I usually have to talk to three different people to have my questions answered completely."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently taking classes online and the professors are willing to work more with students than I have ever seen before. I have a couple of professors still trying to figure things out, but it's all new so I can't blame them. I think they have been able to handle the switch to online learning really well!"
Freshman,5,"Tallahassee Community college is very organized and helpful when it comes to transcripts and getting placed in your classes. I definitely recommend tcc to freshman who have never left home, It's a very friendly and thriving environment. I love my classes and im a full time student. My classes are  evenly broken up on mondays,wednesdays,and fridays. Giving me time to get a job and still remain on top of my classes."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience has been great. The teachers are very helpful and are very hands-on when it comes to making sure that their students reach their goal during and after attending. I personally appreciate all the staff for having the best interest of all students."
Freshman,5,all of my professors at Tallahassee community college have been extremely kind and will help you out with anything you don't understand.
Freshman,5,Tallahassee community college is honestly an amazing school that gives you tons of opportunities. the advisors are awesome and will go above and beyond to help you.
Sophomore,5,"I am in the dual enrollment program, I have been extremely impressed by what this community college offered me and my major in Health related sciences."
Sophomore,5,Even with COVID-19 summer classes with TCC have been just as efficient and full of material. I expected there to be some hiccups but there wasn't any major disrupts and the staff treated the change very fairly.
Freshman,5,So far I love TCC it's great considering it is a community college. All the staff are kind and willing to help with anything they can. It's a nice sized campus and a lot of people are friendly!
Sophomore,5,"Tallahassee Community College is a very diverse environment that includes many different Cultures. The overall learning experience is very efficient and balanced. Professors are very caring and want to see you
Pass and will do anything to help you."
Sophomore,5,The online experience was a very good experience and efficient. Professors made it easy especially in very difficult circumstances that COVID-19 provided.
Sophomore,5,I took a few online classes. At first I wasn't sure if it was the right choice. But I could say taking online classes was amazing and I will be taking more online classes in the future.
Sophomore,5,Tallahassee community college is a great school. It is easy to find buildings and locations. Staff are a great help and not to mention the study area it is amazing.
Graduate Student,5,"I took the majority of my classes online. Rarely did I have a bad experience with those classes. In fact, nearly all my teachers were very helpful and kind and wanted me to do my best, so they were willing to work with me to get there. The courses were easy to navigate. TCC used Canvas for its online classes, which allowed me to see what my grades were (or potentially could be with the addition of allowing me to know how my overall grade would be affected if I got a certain grade on an assignment). I also could easily get to discussion boards, assignments, and tests."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved going to Tallahassee Community College. I made a lot of great friends there, and it was refreshing to go to a school where most everyone was eager to learn and do well. Coming from a bad high school experience, TCC was a breath of fresh air. I took two in-person classes: Biology Lab and Creative Improv. Biology Lab was a night class, but I never felt unsafe. The people in that class were lively and cheerful. My Creative Improv class was difficult at times because I am a quiet person, but it helped me break out of my shell and have fun. I made closer friendships there because we all had to lean on each other to do well. My teacher was energetic and kind, and I developed better stage presence from that class. The campus was not difficult to navigate; for starters, there were campus maps in several areas, and on more than one occasion I was able to ask a local teacher or advisor walking by where something was and they could help me immediately. TCC was a great experience for me."
Sophomore,5,Online experience is great but it's better if you have on campus class you will learn more and if you get stuck you can ask your professor for office hours.
Sophomore,5,I like about Tallahassee Community College is that the resources are really helpful like professors and office hours. I wouldn't change anything
Freshman,5,I like the area around campus and the professors they have excellent staff and knows what they're doing. Advisors are willing to help students any way they can
Freshman,5,"The school has passionate teachers who enjoy what they do. The gym and the schools facilities are very nice. The school stays clean and well maintained. This is one of the best higher education institutes in the state of Florida, and they offer some of the best tuition prices."
Freshman,5,"Really an great experience so far The professors are really really helpful and nice and the campus is not too big but not too small it’s just right in the athletics program is awesome my favorite part about Tallahassee community college is the library in the study area is really quiet you can really focus on getting work done in due on time in the library also has a tutoring lounge where you can login on the app in place your ID number down and a professor will come and help you on which subject do you need to be tutored on Another thing I actually like about  the community college is the weather change it honestly feels like you’re in New York and Tallahassee gets cold ,  Tallahassee community college old buildings Looks like you’re going camping in the snow"
Freshman,5,Tallahassee Community College has been great in assisting me with my educational goals. I am a transfer student and they worked hard to make the transition as smooth as possible.
Senior,5,"I first enrolled at Tallahassee Community College fall semester 2012 and I currently am finishing my last semester for the upcoming summer semester 2020. It was at this community college that I found renewed motivation after I flunked from Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University. I changed my major multiple times and lost hope in what I was striving to become. I may still feel unsure of what I want to do still, but I'm confident I'll be able to find the answer once I finally receive my associates. And I'm forever thankful for Tallahassee Community College helping lead to this place."
Sophomore,5,We Need a Football Team !!!! Great school awesome academics many opportunities for a job after college .
Junior,5,"Small class sizes, open and willing to help instructors. Easy to navigate counselor. Every administration's office was willing to help. Great campus, small and easy to navigate."
Freshman,5,The falculty is amazing the courses are amazing the professors have many degrees in different areas some are better than others they help you inside and out! They make sure you are prepared for school and the work force
Sophomore,5,"I came to Tcc right after graduating from High School , I had no clue on where to start with going for my degree with the early childhood education. with the help of orientation and the aid from my advisors I was able to get off on the right track and by doing that I made the presidents list so I’m thankful for this amazing college"
Sophomore,5,TCC really caters to the student! Whether you’re a first-time freshman or going back after a hiatus you will find resources to fit your needs. Along with faculty whom really go out of their way to accommodate you.
Freshman,5,"The resources her e are amazing, the student are very determined and its a great environment. The downside is this community college has no dorms of any sort."
Sophomore,5,I've had a great experience with TCC so far. All of my professors have been really hands on and the staff in the library is really great too.
Freshman,5,"Tallahassee Community College is a good school. It's not very big so it's easy to find your way around. But if you have trouble there are maps all around and you can ask for help. People seem to be very kind. The teachers are great & they really help you understand things. There is also a wide variety of resources, like free tutors, on campus to help you in the classes that you typically struggle with."
Sophomore,5,Easily connected to Florida Sate University. Really gets you prepared to transfer to FSU. A lot of great clubs as well as amazing diversity.
Sophomore,5,My experience at TCC so far has been great. The campus isn't too big or isn't too small. The few professors that I have had so far has been great. The professors are very knowledgeable about their courses.
Freshman,5,"Very good place with high quality education and affordable for average students. Provides a diverse range of subjects to study from cosmetology to A.A. transfer programs. Provides those who otherwise wouldn't be able to attend college to receive valuable, affordable education"
Graduate Student,5,I completed a lot of my nursing prerequisites at TCC.  Everyone was very helpful and I would recommend to anyone.  I am start two more courses this Fall in criminology.
Freshman,5,"It was so welcoming. The people and environment was so nice and they made sure you got the classes that you needed on time. None of the advisors had attitudes nor tried to get slick with you they all had good intentions on getting you where you need to be, to be successful."
Sophomore,5,"TCC has an open community that engages and helps students, like me, to acheive our goals. The TCC advisors and teachers helps students one on one to further understand what courses to take and when to apply for what. I am proud to be a TCC student!"
Alum,5,"Overall I had an amazing experience at TCC. I gained my confidence as a student at TCC accomplishing straight A's for multiple semesters, something I did not think possible from myself. I loved the different resources provided to students and even wish I took better advantage of the resources because I can only imagine if I used them to the best of my ability, my GPA would be even higher. I did not really experience any problems with TCC, the only thing I would say is to tighten up to safety and security of the students wherever possible."
Freshman,5,What I like about Tallahassee Community College isz the diversity and the help and unconditional support from the advisors.
Freshman,5,Everything about TCC screams opportunity. The only thing I wish they had was student housing. The campus is so diverse which gives you a chance to meet different people. TCC's  environment and scenery is very appealing.
Freshman,5,"The staff/registrar is super helpful! They helped me every step of the way to make sure I know what I’m doing and helped with my prerequisites. The professors take their time when it comes to teaching in their class. They help you out after they’re done with their lecture and make sure you fully understand the concept. One of the best community college there is, and its close to Florida State University!"
Alum,5,"My experience at Tallahassee Community College was amazing. I didn't really have any problems with the faculty or staff. There  were a couple of times where the professors would give you an exam about something that wasn't pertaining to the homework, but other than that it was good. The teachers did everything that they could to help me and were very open and welcoming. Also the tutoring sessions in the library was very helpful if I wasn't able to get to the teacher's office hours. One of the main reasons why I like TCC is because of the smaller classrooms and that allowed the teacher to be extremely attentive to the students needs. The only thing I didn't like was the smoking areas that would be right in front of some of the classes."
Freshman,5,I was dual enrolled with TCC through my high school. It was my first experience with college classes. TCC made the process easy to understand and the professors I had made each classes enjoyable.
Freshman,5,My experience with TCC has been great. I have only taken online courses but the Professors are very helpful in teaching the classes even through the internet. I don't think that I would change anything with the school.
Sophomore,5,"Hands down the best community college I have attended. The staff is always very friendly. I am a terrible math student, but the professors here have been amazing and I have made A's in every math course. Highly, highly recommend them!!!!"
Junior,5,"It’s a great option for a community college. Great teachers that really seem to care for the success of the students. Couldn’t have picked a better college in terms of actually learning the material to better myself for the career I am receiving my degree in. The campus is alright, but the classes are a pretty short walk from each other, so that’s a definite plus."
Sophomore,5,I love going to school here and have enjoyed my professor very much. I would like to be able to see a sign language class as an option for foreign language.
Niche User,5,"What I like about Tallahassee Community College is that it has almost every major you can think of. It is a nice diverse college with kind people who are looking forward to succeed.  Students are motivated to work hard and earn their degree. Another good thing about this college is that if you want to go to FamU, you can spend two years in Tallahassee Community College, then you can transfer to FamU."
Freshman,5,Fantastic! School is great! Teacher is great! Especially Honors program and International Student organization!
Freshman,5,TCC is a great community college and the perfect home for someone looking to be in college and still have the feel of a highschool with more freedom
Graduate Student,5,"It is organize college and TCC provides many opportunities for students to get involved on campus. Through co-curricular offerings, students can have fun, learn and live the college experience while acquiring leadership and life-long learning experiences. they encourage students to participate in educational activities, events and programs to make the most out of their experience at TCC."
Niche User,5,I love Tallahassee Community College because they provide many scholarship opportunities and have a 100% chance of acceptance.
Junior,5,The professors at this college really try to help the students as much as possible. The whole feel of this college is friendly.
Niche User,5,"I have not yet go into this college, but my sisters have attended and many of my friends. They absolutely love it!"
Freshman,5,Very fun and great in teaching and education and understanding and great teachers and I did very well.
Freshman,5,No one is judgmental & everyone has a common goal. Everyone is motivated to be successful which makes the learning environment a special experience.
Sophomore,5,"Tallahassee Community College is  a rewarding school for me because coming out of High School, I was not mentally prepared for going into a huge university with classes that had over 50 students and a high level of difficult work. Going to TCC made it easier to keep learning but giving us hard working professors that treat you way different than our high school teachers taught, The environment is completely different and without going to TCC, I don't think I would've been ready to take on the challenge at a higher end university."
Freshman,5,I chose Tallahassee Community College for several reasons.  The main reason was I can get a four year degree in less time than going to a large University.  Another reason is that it offered evening classes for those that work and the success rate was incredible.
Sophomore,5,Having smaller classes at Tallahassee Community College really helps teachers have the one on one time with students which is exactly what I need. I love attending Tallahassee Community College.
Freshman,4,I take three out of four classes online and my other class is taught through zoom lectures. The online programs are easy to navigate and it is easy to communicate with professors when needed.
Freshman,4,I entered Tallahassee Community College doing online and Zoom courses and my experience has been very smooth. Their course material is thorough and professors care about students. I am planning to transfer to Florida State University and they give helpful assistance along the way.
Sophomore,4,I have  had a great experience so far at TCC. Most of my classes  have been online or via zoom but I have had very good professors for every class.  The only thing I wish was different is that it maybe had more of variety of programs to study.
Freshman,4,"Tallahassee Community college is very organized and helpful when it comes to transcripts and getting placed in your classes. I definitely recommend tcc to freshman who have never left home, It's a very friendly and thriving environment. I love my classes and im a full time student. My classes are  evenly broken up on mondays,wednesdays,and fridays. Giving me time to get a job and still remain on top of my classes."
Freshman,4,"At first, it was kind of hard to get used to, but the teachers made it very easy for me and my fellow classmates. It was fun, though it's not like being on campus..at all."
Freshman,4,It wasn't a hard transition. I feel like Tallahassee community college we're very direct and clear how they we're going to handle the online schooling situation.
Sophomore,4,It is a great school. You have some that are difficult to work with but the some that really care makes the difference.
Sophomore,4,"Some of the professors do not seem qualified. I have had many of them assume that I am the type of person to put up with them being unfair, but when I go over their heads to get the grade I deserve, they act like nothing happened."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy my school because of everything they have to offer. The councilors reply very slow is the only downfall. I asked her for help and she gave me a wrong answer now after i took the class i have to take an extra class to get my AA since i need two math classes.
Freshman,4,"My experience at TCC is so far so good. The only downside is that most of the professors are too lazy to write a letter of recommendation. I literally had to ask 6 different professors in order to get one. However, the BEST math teacher there and the ONLY professor who didn't give me a hassle of having to beg for a Letter of recommendation is Mrs.Suzanne Ferrell-Locke. BEST TEACHER THERE, HANDS DOWN. Other than that, the school is great, very educational, and has many food drives to help the students. Good luck getting a letter of recommendation if you really need it though."
Freshman,4,What i like about Tallahassee community college is that there student tuition isn’t that high . I also like that everyone gets a chance  on attending the school . I wish they could change some professors .
Sophomore,4,"Tallahassee Community College, in my opinion, has surpassed my expectations of being a junior college. The services and different departments offer students exposure all kinds of growing experiences."
Freshman,4,"its a great place to get used to starting college. The teachers and students are friendly, and there are lots of clubs that catch my interest."
Sophomore,4,Good school to obtain associates degree from. The professors care about the students and engage with them at a personal level.
Freshman,4,Allows different people from different backgrounds to come together and learn. A lot of diversity among its students and the professors are invested in each student's future.
Sophomore,4,I love attending TCC. I recieve a more personalized approach to learning there which really helped me ease into the new academic environment.
Junior,4,I began my second year of college at this community college and in the dire state I was in at the time it really helped save my hope for school. I can't honestly give it a five star rating only due to it being a non-LOI school that forces me to pay out of pocket for school with my Tuition Assistance and the tedious process of enrolling into classes. But none the less it's one of the best community colleges in the state of Florida and I will forever be indebted for going there.
Sophomore,4,Tallahassee  community college is full of students transferring to FSU and FAMU. The staff/registrar is super helpful! They helped me every step of the way to make sure I know what I’m doing and helped with my prerequisites. The professors take their time when it comes to teaching in their class. They help you out after they’re done with their lecture and make sure you fully understand the concept. One of the best community college there is.
Sophomore,4,"Transferred to finish my AA and some prerequisites. Have had great professors for calculus, but the chemistry department is lacking."
Sophomore,4,The professors have been excellent but there is a lot of red tape to get through to actually attend the school.
Sophomore,4,There are a lot of resources to take advantage of at Tallahassee Community College. The administration is very helpful and assists any students with their needs.
Freshman,4,"The professors are pretty awesome. I enjoy small class sizes. The facilities are nice. Personally, I don't like all those who smoke, but it's mostly contained to one area, so I can't complain too much."
Junior,4,It’s a good college for people who want to take the time to really learn and the professors are always willing to have one on ones  with students.
Junior,4,"Everything was great at TCC, and the staff ensures that you get the classes that you need in time for the semester. Plenty of on campus events to be involved in, many clubs to join as well. The only they that’s not so great is finding a way to school if you live to far away. They stopped public transportation deal with the city."
Niche User,4,Tallahassee is an amazing place to visit. On the college tour there was so many different classes to choose from. The professors were very nice and I ate very good. Students and staff treated me just like I was one of them they showed me different things I would experience their. I can't wait to attend the school.
Sophomore,4,"It’s a school to get the experience and feel of preparing yourself as a college student, molding  your mind and future being ready for the University ones dreamed of attending after transferring."
Sophomore,4,"Tallahassee Community College is a very affordable option, and a great transfer school. It has a good selection of classes, great teachers and helpful staff. The only reasons why I would give it four stars is because of the campus and its safety. The campus could use some cleaning and some upgrades, especially in the bathrooms. There have also been a few instances of robbery and theft on campus, as well as the fact that a lot of homeless tend to wander on campus and harass students. But other than that, I personally haven't had any bad interactions."
Freshman,4,"Besides the basic everyday academic life, at the Tallahassee Community College is the time and place for befriending faculty members and students."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy all of the options there are for online courses. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Campus is clean. There are several security guards walking around campus during the day. TCC is located near downtown Tallahassee, so there is plenty to do."
Sophomore,4,"I have no regrets coming to TCC. Classes are cheaper, smaller, and easy to access. Campus is also smaller than university. TCC is an excellent starting point for any future student."
Niche User,4,Tcc is very similar to a community college I attended before. I enjoy it and it's layout. Teachers and faculty seem nice
Freshman,4,I love it at Tallahassee community college. The students are nice and the Workers and teachers are really nice. They help you out so much and they want the best for you and your college experience.
Freshman,4,I am an incoming freshman to TCC and am participating in the TCC to FSU program and transfering later in the year. I am excited to be attending.
Alum,4,Tallahassee Community College would be a top choice for a 2 year institution if you're looking to get your AA or AS degree. There are lot of different programs for students who are interested in Nursing or other majors. The classes aren't too big so you feel like you really have the professor's attention during class as opposed to a class that may have 200 or so students. They also have a TCC to FSU program that makes it easier for those with their AA to get into Florida State University. The food is good and the college isn't so big to where you would get lost. The professors that I've had in my time there are fantastic and really have a passion for what they're teaching. TCC's diversity is unlike any other. I've had the privilege to meet a lot of different people with many different backgrounds. It would be the best choice if you're looking to take a few classes or pursue a certification with the low tuition rates.
Junior,4,Tallahassee Community College is a great place to go if you are deciding what it is that you want to do. The professors are amazing and have the best interest of their students present without doubt. They surely help you grow and they expose you to various topics in an unbiased and enthusiastic way.
Sophomore,4,"Great college with excellent resources and instructors. TCC is a great place to start your college career. College isnt for everyone, but TCC can help anyone start."
Sophomore,4,I have only been at Tallahassee Community College for 2 semesters and I really enjoyed my time there. I have grown so much in such little time and made numerous of friends. What I really enjoyed most about TCC was the people and of course the professor. Some of the professors weren't the greatest but they still had a way of helping me even if I didn't understand it the first time. TCC also have this study and tutoring area called the learning commons which helps on any and every subject.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Tallahassee Community College has been one full of opportunities to advance in my studies. There are many programs that are put in place to assist students with their academic needs. Of course, it is up to the students to take advantage of this help. The Campus is large yet personable enough to not feel overcrowded and looked over. There are great classes to choose from; classes that are very interesting."
Senior,4,"Tallahassee Community College is a great place to get your A.A degree, meet new friends, and learn more about life. The campus is beautiful, the majority of the students are friendly, and so is the staff. The only problem that I have had with the school is lack of communication when it comes to signing up for classes and financial aid. I submitted by documents, but no one told me that there was an error with submitting the application until weeks after. I had to go to TCC in person and ask about my financial aid status; lack of communication in the enrollment office is the only problem that I have had."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve enjoyed my time at TCC. Professors are willing to help you, TCC provides you with extra academic help in the learning commons."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love TCC! The Student to teacher ratio is great! The faculty is very helpful. The atmosphere is encouraging as well. You meet so many others who are on the same path as you! Nothing needs to change! It is a great community college.
Freshman,4,"Tallahassee Community College’s campus has been one of my favorite parts apart going there. The buildings don’t feel restricted or claustrophobic and the brick gives an nice scholarly touch. I enjoy the surrounding just as well, Tallahassee has a nice community atmosphere. The teachers at TCC have not yet disspointed me and have been very helpful and straight forward with course work. All in all, Tallahassee CC provides a good education and a beautiful campus to learn it on."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy being able to go to TCC, but honestly I feel that some of their teachers are not so good. I've, so far had good teachers except one, but other than that I've had a good experience for my first semester of college. I like the festivities they have around school, it's a good break for someone just getting out of a class."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at this college. Most of the professors know how to teach there subjects very well. There is also many events and ways to get connected around the campus.
Sophomore,4,Tallahassee Community College is one of the best decisions I made. It is finiacially affordable and a great choice to start off college.
Junior,4,"It was such a nice surprise when finding out how wonderful and inspirational the teachers are.  They truly care about the subject matter and the students.  Also, for the price of courses, it is a great return on investment.  This is the perfect place for transitioning from high school to a large university."
Freshman,4,I like the one on one interaction between students and faculty. The campus is small and everyone is friendly.
Junior,4,"I loved this school because unlike many other community colleges, the staff and students themselves are actively involved in bettering one-another and you can see the pride in everyones eyes. this campus is small, but growing very fast and it is no wonder we are top 10 in the country for best community colleges!"
Freshman,4,I like that the teachers are really helpful. They're willing to work with you one on one to help you succeed
Sophomore,4,"I feel Tallahassee Community College is one of the best community colleges in Florida. The campus is beautiful and very green it is filled with historic trees and brick buildings. It is located near Florida State University. Which also neighbors downtown Tallahassee. There are endless amount of restaurants, bars, and night clubs all around Tallahassee. The academics at Tallahassee Community are great. Professors and advisers at Tallahassee Community push students to succeed and continue their education at Florida State. Tallahassee Community does not have many sport teams or on campus housing. Although the apartments that are around Tallahassee are of good quality."
Niche User,4,"I really liked the Professors, they actually took time out of their day to help us.  I also LOVED the Library, everyone was very respectful and quiet"
Freshman,4,"I'm really excited for my freshman year in college, I'm going to give my best effort with the professors and my new classmates. The experience will be life changing and I can't wait"
Graduate Student,4,"Tallahassee Community College is a great institution to start your college education. As an international student, TCC really helped me transitioning from a High School in another country to an American college."
Junior,4,"Overall, I had a good experience with TCC. The staff and professors are helpful and know their subjects, and the students are friendly."
Freshman,4,It has been an easier alternative to a four year college that I have enjoyed attending.  With smaller classrooms I feel as though the teachers have more of an impact in my academic performance.
Sophomore,4,"TCC is a great college. It offers many great amenities like the library and learning commons where students can seek help with papers, tutoring, etc. This is all inclusive in tuition. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The professors really care about your academic success and are willing to help you once you ask and show initiative. The on campus police keep the school safe and they have good response time if there is an accident. There is also an international student organization where you can link up with people from the world over and learn about various cultures."
Junior,4,Affordable with smaller classes. Most professors have open door policies and very helpful when you need it. The Learning Commons is also a great resource for those in need of tutoring.
Freshman,4,"I was nervious to begin my first samester at TCC, Tallahassee's local comunity collece, but once I stepped foot on campus my anxiety soon turned into ambition. The campus is home to some of the most fun and engaging teachers I have ever met. This school has changed my dreary views of an 8 am class in to excitement and a hunger for knowledge."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the teachers, the curriculum and the testing center. My classes have been on-line so my experiences on campus are mostly in the testing center and bookstore."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the atmosphere. It was pleasant. Check out the Golden Guarantee Program while you have 15 hours or less, and always use the Learning Commons!"
Niche User,2,"I was a dual enrollment student here. Many of the teachers here were strictly about making sure you ""passed"" and not making sure that you learn. It's often difficult to pass some classes if you're not used to independent studies."
Sophomore,2,My first semester at TCC was terrible to say the least. Large campus with nearly no signs to give you a sense of direction or building numbers. The Professors don't teach anything but whats out of the book. The library hours suck and the food on campus or near is cheap and disgusting. Campus is generally a far commute due to traffic and city stop lights if you live more than 4 miles way (15 minute drive plus). One thing that did help me that I loved about TCC was the learning commons tutor center and the STEM program.
College Sophomore,2,I had few choices for summer classes.
College Sophomore,2,Not a fan either. Needs more recruits. I have to reschedule everything.
College Sophomore,2,Very difficult process to get it all mailed and transferred. Was a nightmare.
College Freshman,2,"Most students use this college as a ""steeping stone"" in terms that most either drop out or transfer rarely any student will graduate from TCC."
College Senior,2,"My credits did not transfer  correctly and when i went to talk to an advisor, they didn't tell me that. So I took classes I didn't need and wasted time and money for their mistakes."
College Senior,2,TCC has a career center?
College Student,2,Because it's a community college
College Junior,2,Professors try but the curriculum more gauged to high schoolers. I dont feel I have been given a proper college education. Classes are very hard to get  for major. I waited 3 semesters to get one class I needed for my major. class size is good
College Junior,2,not really any post grad services
College Junior,2,They should let us know everything we need to do and fill out in one go. Making an hour long line to be told one step and then wait 24 hours to do the next step makes the process horrendous.
College Sophomore,2,There seems to be a lot of paperwork and poor communication. I usually have to call to find any information regarding financial aid
College Senior,2,Financial aid is tricky. The reason I'm not done with school yet is because I can't afford it sometimes and it takes me a while to save for it. 
College Senior,2,It's nothing to write home about. They don't usually let you make up missed assignments.
College Senior,2,"There's nothing special about the facilities. They're white, plain, outdated and boring. "
College Junior,2,We have select groups of students that really care about what they're doing and strive to achieve dreams and goals and programs such as the honors program and internship clubs to help with those.
College Junior,2,"Professors are all very invested, the curriculum isn't that challenging but interesting, registration is as easy as it can be but sometimes a pain, there are many study options and tutoring that are very helpful, and the workload isn't too bad. "
College Junior,2,"TCC is pretty average. It is a great school, but I am only going for financial reasons. I can't wait for the next chapter of college, but TCC is also a lot better then I expected. The professors are very invested in their students and most of the materiel is very interesting."
College Junior,2,"TCC is a community college, and although it is one of the best community colleges, many of the students are somewhat average. Of course there are the students, like myself, who are there for financial reasons and are very bright, but I would say the majority is not. "
College Junior,2,"The tuition is reasonable, however financial aid is kind of a pain. I have no money for college, due to my father being unemployed for 5 years and my mothers own student loans. However, now that my father has a job, I don't qualify for anything but loans, and still have no money. These factors are not taken into consideration for financial aid. "
College Sophomore,2,An average bunch of kids who are immature at times but they are not the majority.
Recent Alumnus,2,"My school has an average community college student body.  There are lots of lazy students who aren't involved in anything, but a few exceptional ones who are involved in everything.  Honestly, if you don't go out of your way to meet people by joining clubs or being aggressively friendly, you will not meet anyone.  It's about 60% fresh high school graduates and the rest falls under a large range of ages and backgrounds."
College Sophomore,2,Have a very large computer lab and. in several sites on campus. Network seems slow and there is a large amount of spam and virus that comes from the actual campus servers. No one seems to care about it . I have had several viruses  to show up on my home computer just by signing on my campus site. Have reported several times but there is still a big problem.
College Sophomore,2,"Gym is small , too small for student population. library isn't much to speak of. really just a place to put more computers. Campus is well laid out so it is easy to get to classes. student center small and not enough variety for on campus eating. but is comfortable. limited activities"
College Senior,2,"It's pretty average. In some classes I have outgoing people. In other everyone comes to class sits, learns, and leaves."
College Sophomore,2,The campus resources are reliable but there could be more computers available for the students. Although there are not many computers there is 4G wireless network which you can access at any location on campus. There is a need for your own personal computer being that there aren't many computers in the library.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel like I paid way too much for the class. I did not learn anything.
College Senior,2,It is very confusing doing everything online and when you call for help you have to wait a long time
College Freshman,2,"The tuition is very cheap, but the financial aid process can be a little difficult. There are only two ways in which TCC distributes the money. Either you get a TccOneCard, which is pretty much like a debt card, or you get it direct deposited which means you get you money close to three days after everyone else."
College Senior,2,"Do all your forms and things for financial aid during the PREVIOUS semester, and not right before the semester. The lines are long and there are a bunch of people waiting in line for things that should have been dealt with the previous semester. Also, the FA website is horrible compared with other schools. So many people would probably not have to wait in line if the website said more."
College Junior,2,"They rate average for a community college. Fortunately I don't have to spend much time in the computer lab. Colleges are so anal about their hardware. I will say that the ""blackboard"" system is atrocious, though that is still average. I've yet to meet a similar online learning system that was bug-free."
College Junior,2,They give you the run around and unclear information.
College Junior,2,The phone wait time of 30-40 minutes each call is very frustrating.  Once you finally do get contact the phone call usually ends up a less than 5 minute conversation with no resolution.  I finally was able to get results after the 5th or 6th phone call.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I've had exceptional professors, but I've had instructors who did inspire me at all."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I graduated 7/2012 with an AS degree in business administration and I thoroughly enjoyed what I learned in finance, writing, mathematics, communications, marketing and customer service. I am excited to go into the bachelor's program."
College Junior,2,It could be alot better if the staff working were a little more friendly and professional.  You have to make sure you keep copies of everything you turn in to financial aid because they almost always lose your paperwork.
College Junior,2,"Don't Answer the Phone – The career service never answers their phone and when they do they put me on hold. i actually waited for 2 hours for them to get back to me. so, i went up there and they finally helped me with my situation. :)"
College Junior,2,"Square One – I haven't received any Financial Aid, but i am hoping to in the future. We have applied for it numerous times but something always goes wrong and puts us back a square one. Now, Financial Aid is going to set me back a month from me furthering my education. That is why i am here filling out as many scholarships as possible."
College Junior,2,"My Walk With TCC – I have and would recommend this community college compared to the surrounding ones it is better in my opinion. Also, their really needs to be a nationwide curriculum adjustment. Stop teaching History unless a student is majoring in that specifically. Class registration process was difficult until I was diagnosed with a math learning disability and assigned a DSS counselor. Now, its a breeze. I could hardly get the classes I needed before the DSS occurred. Especially after the recession, more and more people have returned to gain their education because of the lack of employment. Now, parking and enrollment is a headache, I started taking online classes because some of the professor/instructors treated the students as if they were actually in high school or on a job. Some instructions would totally call out a student in front of the class and shame them for being late. I think that is wrong for college. If the student is late and he/she misses something it is their loss and responsibility to make it successful. Humiliation only makes the student not want to return. There are proper ways to address issues. Respect the student as the instructor wishes to be respected. We are not in middle school anymore folks. Lighten up and let the student take the responsibility for their education. If they fail, they can't blame in on the school or instructors especially if the instructor just provided the lesson and not the public reprimand. Granted there are a large number of high school grads coming in and some are very rude and nasty and need extra guidance and compassion, not public ridicule and humiliation. Hurray for the online classes."
Freshman,1,"not fond of being looked down on as a hard worker and student just because im homeless Jesus was homeless yet he's still the King, imagine that! This came from staff at that they are not professional at all if you take time and effort into building someone up than what you prefer to do I wouldn't have to stop write this review and change over colleges thanks TCC for wasting my time and watch another school get praised for what you will never gain for what you put your hard efforts to. I am pretty sure Tallahassee community college has a lot of potential if you get out of your arrogant ways and be able to see true quality in all not those of appearance and of personal choice Im like you in a special way im here to work not to impress you and be your friend. so you should have kept your personal remarks to yourself and let me work so if you get paid for being a prideful jerk just remember thats what comes before the fall. enjoy it because  youre not taking me with you so bye and enjoy"

Freshman,1,"The customer service is horrible. I have been waiting on my sons financial aid to get processed and this is not happening. The items are sitting. When you call the school and you think your contacting financial aid its a customer service rep that knows nothing and they put a tickets in for someone to call you but, I have yet to get a phone call back with someone that can help me.All I am wanting is for the financial aid to be processed. I am paying for books from money that i do not have. This is a awful experience."
College Senior,1,"I attempted a couple of online courses, but I was not able to keep both grades up. there was so much reading for both classes, that i ended up having to choose which one would get the appropriate attention needed for me to pass the class. This was a difficult juggling act tacked onto to in-class courses, working two jobs, and raising my son. I had a horrible experience with online courses...this is not to say that it may be perfect for someone else, it just was not, and is not, for me"
College Junior,1,Not getting my monies worth. classes are remedial at best. Financial aid office is a joke. I spent half my time trying to straighten out their mistakes out.
College Junior,1,"Library is 20 years behind the times. No real books to help in courses the college gives. Gym i s bad. Not much bigger than a closet. A lot of campus activities, mostly eating."
College Junior,1,"not a lot of diversity. The college ignores the local students and spends it""s time bringing students from Egypt. They get the best while the local students have to endure a rise in tuition every semester to fund these foreign students tuition.That is why I am transferring as soon as I can."
College Sophomore,1,"I took online classes for an entire semester at my old school and absolutely hated it. I mean the professor/student relationship, and the peer-to-peer interaction wasn't bad. But, just the amount of work was ridiculous. I felt like I was doing school work all day every day. And I couldn't even socialize with the person next to me. I will never take online classes again!"
College Senior,1,Not close to where it should be in today's world. 
College Senior,1,There really isn't anything pertaining to Veterinarian Science. 
College Junior,1,I never took online courses in college but when i was in high school it was terrible I would kind of get bored and i need a teacher to show me face to face so I can understand more.
College Sophomore,1,They have a long line sometimes. It extends from the financial aid office or registration office all the way to through the student union. The funny thing about it they have 4 slots for workers yet its only 2 working.
College Sophomore,1,"When you do the work online some teachers will just post away. However, when you try to contact them some will not reply back at all. Or, it will take them forever to get back with you. Some of the professors I had online misspelled his words and nothing was done about it."
College Sophomore,1,"When you drop classes you automatically fail them this college is fair however, I would say when it comes down to classes, teachers, and money. Know what you are doing when you are doing it. For it will come back to haunt you."
College Junior,1,The tuition is expensive. And to get the help you need from the Financial aid office is like pulling teeth. Half the people in the office have no idea what they are talking about. They will tell you something that makes no since just to get you out of thier office.
College Senior,1,I had a hard time taking online classes. I was depressed because I was not on a campus. I did not have any friends. When my roommates when to campus it made me gloomy. I needed to be able to sit and talk with my teacher. Being in activities makes me happy and I could not do that online.
College Freshman,1,Very Irritating – The financial aid office is horrible. Trying to get in touch with a representative is incredibly irritating and their use of your financial aid money is not at all helpful.
College Senior,1,"Eh...Last Resort – Honestly, yes there are teachers that do sincerely have passion behind what they're teaching. However, unfortunately there are many that just do not. It is like being in a poorly funded public high school. What makes it worse is everyone feels entitled at my school. As if they all deserve A even if honestly they do not. For example, if you continuously do poor on tests you deserve that poor grade.You have to work hard for what you want, for example when you get into grad school or for your masters you are going to have to work insanely hard to get that best grade. As for the financial aid I hate it. When requesting for it, I was denied. WHy? Because according to them my mom had 8,000 extra dollars per child, and there are four of us. Frustrated I called the head financial aid department in america, when further questioned they saw that they were wrong. My mom works 12 hrs. a day to help put me through school, and support all her children. I feel like they do not care. The school's tuition is fair. I just wish that I could get this scholarship to help my mom help me to live and thrive in tallahassee so I can grad. and transfer to FSU to get my masters degree."
College Sophomore,1,"Is Horrible – Well for starters I don't have any scholarships so all i get is loans and a very little amount I can barely survive with that and they give me my financial aid until all my classes have starter and they expect me to pay a big amount of money before classes start and knowing that I have not receive my financial aid yet they don't even let me pay for some of my classes they want me to pay for them all at the same time. If you go to the financial aid office they try to help you, but over the phone they don't.They make you wait for 15 to 30 minutes before you talk to someone and when they finally answer you they don't know nothing, they all have a different answer for the same question is like they don't even know what they are doing, last year i receives my financial aid until spring, I got nothing for fall and I have to survive with what my parent's where giving me. Hopefully this year they will give it to me this year."
College Junior,1,"Are sorta hard, you have to make the time to go get help because the teacher won't. I thought since i had already taken the class it would be easy, but when i completed all the assignments and chapter reviews and went and took the test my work wasn't excepted with my answer."

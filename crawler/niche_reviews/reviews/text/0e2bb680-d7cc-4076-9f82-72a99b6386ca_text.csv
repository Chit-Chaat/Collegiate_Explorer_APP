Freshman,5,"I haven't took any online stuff, so I couldn't really tell you anything about it. but I feel like it would be a good experience."
Freshman,5,"I went to go visit Kentucky state and so far it looks good and sounds good, but I haven't lived on campus yet."
Freshman,5,My online learning was pretty good. Teachers were responsible with every Assignment . They worked hard and made us understand everything.
Freshman,5,I love my HBCU. You see a diversity of cultures and their program is amazing. Teachers do everything to help you and that is why I consider that is the best university. Also the sports teams are super good and competitive.
Senior,5,"For the most part, my teachers have adjusted well except for one. It was rocky for her at first but she soon got it back on track. They made it very easy to access them and get the help that may have been needed."
Sophomore,5,Kentucky State is  a family oriented school. You know a lot of people but you also see new faces often. Kentucky State has come a long way since my freshman year and the university is only getting better.
Senior,5,My experience at Kentucky State University has been one to remember. Many memories have been made; especially being a student athlete traveling around to different areas an meeting different people. The campus scene is on the come up and there is no going backwards.
Sophomore,5,"Kentucky State University has a lot of different events, teams, and clubs to be a part of. There are many different majors to choose from (also an amazing ROTC program) at a really good price."
Freshman,5,I’m so excited to be starting college this fall at Kentucky State University. My whole life I’ve been saying I wanted to attend an HBCU and I’m so grateful that I chose KSU
Junior,5,"Transferring to KSU, I have found it very exciting to be in a humble and diverse environment. The caring support from student and faculty has made my first-semester experience remarkable. Being a Florida resident and then attending a predominantly white Institution in the state of Minnesota, I was fearful and lacked the will to achieve greatness due to the fact of me having the feeling of not being accepted or being inferior to my classmates because of the color of my skin. I played sports in Minnesota and I would go through tough times and I wouldn't receive the help that was necessary to withstand a peace in mind to succeed from my coaches so I gradually begin to fail academically.  After attending KSU for just one semester I now have a GPA of a 3.64, have earned an athletic scholarship as a walk-on and has found the girl of my dreams. My overall experience has been nothing but excellent since I step foot on campus."
Niche User,5,I have done several dual credit course with KSU off campus and I enjoyed every single course I took. The teachers were engaging and made the course work understandable.
Sophomore,5,I love that its a small college. It helps the professors to give you one on one if needed. Wish it was better places to eat on campus
Niche User,5,"I like that Kentucky State is an Historical Black University ! I love the mascot of Thoroughbred which are known for their agility, speed and spirit -Kentucky State campus certainly has a lot of Spirit!! Everyone is so friendly and willing to help out and that makes me feel very Welcomed!"
Freshman,5,Kentucky State University is a great college! The school is a great HBCU. They have great and overly certified teachers. Great activities for the students to engage in. The campus is safe for staff and students. Graduation rates are high and job acceptance is also!  Kentucky State is a great school for anyone who wants to go out of state and have a home feeling.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Kentucky State University was fantastic. The school was very welcoming and friendly. The dorms and campus were clean.Before visiting, I didn't know this campus existed. I didn't even know it was a HBCU. This was the first HBCU that I visited. But, the students and staff are friendly and I can say with my head high, you wouldn't regret coming here."
Senior,5,"I love my HBCU. Every school has its challenges to face, but K state has always overcame any obstacles that came our way. It feels like family."
Junior,5,Kentucky State is amazing. It is the ultimate HBCU experience. I love the culture and community. I would only like to change how much aid is available for independent students because I struggle to pay for college being an out of state attendee.
Senior,5,"Its not too expensive, its good school you will be able to be more connected with your professor and everyone out there is nice and everyone is like family"
Senior,5,"Great school love it Hello Alexas! We are excited that you have registered to attend New Student Orientation at Albany State University on July 27.

Niche User,5,"For 2 summers consecutively I have lived on campus at Kentucky State and the experience is one to live for. Students and Administration on campus are very helpful and vibrant, they speak and always seem optimistic. During my time on campus, I attended several events where students as well as myself enjoyed our entire time their. Although it is an HBCU, the environment was friendly for people of all color."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity available. Also there are many satellite campuses that allow me to take classes in different towns. Their study abroad program is nice and easy to apply. The information is true and easy to understand. Thankful for my hometown university.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Kentucky State University has been awesome, such an amazing atmosphere. You automatically make new friends and feel that every student is family. You can focus on one on one teaching that can enhance your knowledge on a professional level."
Freshman,5,Well this is my second year at Kentucky state overall I love the school and the people. They show that they care about you. Kentucky state is a small school and I love the fact that the classroom are small because a person like me need a lot of one on one time with the profession. Its just a great school to go to.
College Sophomore,5,"its very exciting you get to see them step, the probates, and its just a lot of fun."
College Freshman,5,Haven't really heard a lot about anything so everything is good
College Junior,5,It is always available whenever you need one. Every building in our campus has a computer lab and it's very convenient for us.
College Junior,5,Off-campus Dining is fantastic! There are varieties of food to choose from.
College Junior,5,"While attending Kentucky State University, I had the chance of a life time to work with children who are at-risk in our Youth and Development Program. I am a mentor to a child who is at-risk and with the help of our education courses, I learned how to better connect with my mentee and try new ways to keep her comfortable."
College Freshman,5,"I love our school meal plans. You can switch them up if you need to and the food is not expensive, its very resonable. and you have alot of options to choose from"
College Freshman,5,We have a lot of good resturants. Alot of them also deliever to campus. And they are not far at all from campus.
College Sophomore,5,The technology available at kentucky state is up to date with current technological advancements
College Freshman,5,"It's in Frankfort – It in the capitol of kentucky, therefore there are lots of police. They make it very safe."
College Freshman,5,I got full tuition paid and most of my housing... excellent
College Junior,5,I Love the RN Program. I love the RN program at KSU because we have a very small class which means more attention.  We all work together as a team and are eager to help each other out.  The RN program is so selective and can be hard to get into.  If you have good grades and apply your chances are great to be accepted into the program.
College Sophomore,5,"If you want to go to a place where there is a mixture of north and south weather Frankfort,Ky is the place. Summers are great and winters it rarely even snows. People are always up and about in Frankfort weather."
College Freshman,5,The girls and guys at KSU are all wonderful. Nobody there is bad looking and everyone seems to have their own individual sense of style. A lot of the people there are musically talented so people will sometimes be singing in the middle of campus. There is never a dull moment at KSU!
College Sophomore,5,"Very Divirse – For Kentucky State University to be located in a small town, there are a lot of international students from Asia,Mexico, and South America for a campus of the size."
Recent Alumnus,5,Love It – I love my school I am so happy I choose this school. It is small but also close to home I wouldn't go anywhere else.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The man that gives out parking tickets gives out about $1,000 worth of tickets daily."
Recent Alumnus,5,Academic Center of Excellence – The Academic Center of Excellence also known as A.C.E. is a place on campus where free tutors for all students is available.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't had an experience at Kentucky State just yet because I am currently a transfer student coming in from Northern Kentucky Univerity, but from what I heard from students at the university I know that I'm going to love it and that I will have a wonderful college experience."
Sophomore,4,I haven't had an online learning experience with the university just yet because I'm a transfer student. I'm just looking for some extra money to help with my remainding balance.
Senior,4,I love how my teachers truly care for us and want us to succeed. They offer ample support for aid whether its academically or financially.  I would like to see nothing change at the moment.

Freshman,4,The Professors are great and will work with you if you show them you are willing to learn. The students are very friendly and help each other out.
Sophomore,4,"One thing that I love about Kentucky State University is the aspect of family. As an incoming transfer from Murray State University, I did not know what to expect. Since my very first day at Kentucky State University, I can honestly say that I have felt nothing short of love and support from the staff and my peers. The shower of love and support given from this HBCU can only be described as the love in which your ideal family would give. All in all, the school of course isn’t perfect, like most families, but I wouldn’t rather spend what is left of my undergraduate experience elsewhere."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the small classes at Kentucky State.  I play volleyball and the smaller class helps with being able to keep up with classes.
Freshman,4,Kentucky state university has changed my life for the better. I could never regret choosing this hbcu. I enjoy every day seeing my peers trying to better themselves like I am. Kentucky state has motived me to become a better be. I learned to enjoy my college experiences and also get my school work done. Choosing this school you would have a wonderful support system because the teachers and faculty want to make sure no student is left behind. One thing I would say I would want to change is housing. Its many problems with the dorm rooms it makes you wonder do they think about the students. Things in the rooms are broken and no one is in a rush to fix the problem. I could say overall I love this school and wouldn't change my decision on coming here
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a pretty good experience. If you like small classes KSU is the place for you. The professors are motivated to assist you with earning your degree and furthering your career."
College Sophomore,4,The school has came a long way since it opened its doors.
College Sophomore,4,its very great. the classes are the perfect size and great teachers.
College Sophomore,4,its very good and aware they keep an eye on the students and make sure everybody is safe.

College Freshman,4,The Greeks are always doing something for the community.
College Freshman,4,Frankfort is the capital thats where we are located and I'm a Poli Sci major so its gonna be easier for me to find work than other students with different majors
College Freshman,4,I can't wait to be apart of it
College Student,4,The classes i have provide me with the equipment i need to prepare me for college and so does the cafeteria.
College Student,4,The amount of staff at the orientation to help us through the process was great.  Even if they didn't know the answer they would help us find someone that could help us.
College Senior,4,"Learning at Kentucky State is not limited to academics. I have learned at lot about myself, my faith, and made some life long connection with people all over the world."
College Junior,4,many people come from all over the world. at parties you see the differences in how people dance and their type of music they enjoy from that specific city.
College Junior,4,it has a variety of things. Their main goal is to have healthy food for the students.
College Junior,4,most students come here for the athletics. its great. Many students workout even after they have their one one practices with there teams.
College Junior,4,"you learn more as you go, it helps with your goals"
College Junior,4,they treat everyone with respect
College Student,4,The parking lots are easy to find and are close to almost everything you need
College Student,4,"Everyone enjoys sports events, they are very interactive ."
College Student,4,"Ive not experienced any type of warnings or violations personally. I have seen students placed on probation for numerous things from missing class, nonpayment of tuition, inappropriate behavior.  "
College Junior,4,"Some computer labs on campus have the apple desk tops which are a plus. Most computer labs on campus have free printing unless you are printing in color, then you can swipe your student I.D. card to pay for it with preloaded funds on there. The network on the campus is great while you are own university own computers, but if you are on your laptop it may take multiple attempts to log on to the wireless network. The school has set up codes for students to use so they can print documents wirelessly from their laptops. "
College Senior,4,very convenient and a variety of food place to choose from
College Senior,4,the school attend is a hbcu but the campus is diverse 
College Senior,4,to be a computer science major you have to be very good in math. This major requires a lot of hardworkers
College Senior,4,athletics at our school is great. the only exciting thing about the school is sports
College Senior,4,"I will be a intern at my schools IT department, which will help me get some hands on experience for my career.  "
College Junior,4,In certain areas of study there are great computers and labs but for the entire school there is one lab and about 11 computers in the library. Sometimes the wifi works in the dorms sometimes it doesn't. It best to have your own laptop though.
College Junior,4,The weather is similar to what it's like back in my city. 
Recent Alumnus,4,"Diversity at KSU is very good.  There are a wide range of races and ethnic groups represented on campus, as well as traditional and non-traditional students.  There has also been an increase in international enrollment in recent years. Although KSU is an HBCU, there continues to be an increase in the non-African American student population."
College Sophomore,4,I will soon find out who's fit for me and who just simply isn't.
Recent Alumnus,4,good variety of housing opportunities that are affordable.
College Sophomore,4,The school is great on sharing facilities. The facilities are open to all students and are capable of being reserved for events if needed.
College Freshman,4,"You can tell they put alot into the sports at Kentucky State even though this football season was not so great, they still try to support them in many ways."
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, i actually feel safer there than at home."
College Sophomore,4,The nursing school has provided various great experiences and great clinical sites.  My teacher works hard to  provide good lectures and is willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed the night nursing program.  There is alot of parking and it is safe because the school police are around making sure everything is ok.
College Sophomore,4,"Physical Education. Once you start taking classes specifically for your major you will begin to feel like you are already in that career field. For example, being a teaching major you do things such as teaching observations and opportunities to teach as well."
College Sophomore,4,"there are a mix of everybody, every body is nice and some what respectable in most cases very helpful mostly everybody is into FASHION!!"
College Freshman,4,"Although Kentucky State University allows the students to have fun, the still have ground rules which i find are pretty reasonable for us to follow."
College Freshman,4,"tHE NIGHTLIFE AT MY SVHOOL IS ACTUALLY PRETTY FUN, AND ITS WAS BETTER THEN WHAT I EXPECTED. IF I DONT HAVE MONEY TO GO OUT ONE WEEKEND, NO WORRIIES. I CAN STAY ON CAMPUS AND HAVE JUST AS MUCH FUN."
College Sophomore,4,National Eats – The resturants around campus are most likely resturants that you would have in your home town. The sit down resturants may have student discounts but they are still more expensive than the fast food thats around.  But if you want a bigger variety then you can go to the next city.
College Sophomore,4,"Glad to Be Greek – The Greeks on campus are very proud to be Greek but they don't change the social life on campus.  The Greeks are friends with everyone but the do get offended if a non-Greek mocks them in some way.  A lot of non-Greeks can't wait for an oppurtunity to pledge.  Then, as far as housing I know some Greeks have housing but not all."
College Sophomore,4,Very Strong Athletic History – The athletics at kentucky state university have a very rich and strong history
College Senior,4,Check Out Guadalajara's Mexican Eatery – We have several Mexican restaurants but this one is by far the best in town.
College Senior,4,Parties are fun. once you get older you get use to them. How you get out and enjoy them is up to you
College Senior,4,kstate has a nice social life. It also has a nice study hall called ace that you can go to study and get help from a tutor. Whats unique is that the school is full of spirit.
College Junior,4,No Complaints Here. I have really enjoyed going to my classes and my professors are top notch.  I have made many friends and have fit right in.  I am glad I chose to go to school at KSU.
College Junior,4,Many Places to Eat All Over Town – There are plenty of places to eat.  They have casual dining to fast food.  I am not disappointed to the choices I have.
College Freshman,4,"Greeks Are Just the Same as the Rest of Us – Greeks basically just organize the parties and try to get things going at KSU but they don't make you feel left out if your not a greek. At KSU being a greek really isn't that important, if you want to join cool, if not cool."
College Freshman,4,"Wonderful School – Kentucky State is a great school and i would tell anyone to go there. The staff and students are extremely friendly help you to feel at ease and comfortable while your in school. The class sizes are about 15-20 per class room but some classes may have a few more students. I really love the small class sizes because the teaches get to know you one on one, and your not just a number in their class room. I love KSU!"
College Sophomore,4,"Sports Are Great – The football, baseball and Basketball teams are very good. As well as the inter mural programs."
Alum,2,"I went there back in the 90s and see from the reviews that not much has changed. The school concentrates more on the black students getting in than they do any other race. The financial aid office was pitiful when I attended. On several occasions in which I had an appointment, I would be told that I had to come back. The last time this happened, I never went back. The school enrolled me in the 2 classes I had signed up for even though I did not get any financial aid and had to way to pay for the classes. I attempted many times to contact the 2 professors so I could withdraw, even going to their offices several times, but could never get in touch with them.  They then gave me grades of F reducing my 3.7 GPA down to below 2 %. Some of the ""professors"" barely or rarely show up for class and then give you a simple test and pass you. That was not what I was paying for, I actually wanted to study and learn to improve my knowledge.  I would never recommend this school to anyone."
Sophomore,2,"It’s an okay online college experience. I transferred from a different university and their online platform was so much better. I would have thought an HBCU would have a better interface. Also, the professors aren’t used to doing online classes, they treat it like a traditional classroom."
College Senior,2,"There are many talented players, but I feel bad for them. They need a lot of updates."
College Freshman,2,The halls dorm is far away from everything...
College Freshman,2,Messed up my account and they don't answer the phone
College Sophomore,2,My tip is to stay in their faces
College Student,2,The places they place you is usually very dirty or are in areas with alot of drug use
College Student,2,"Ive noticed numerous people involved in drug activities. Sitting in the cafeteria, the library, walking in the halls, people constantly discuss drugs. Ive even been in a bathroom and heard women snorting pills."
College Student,2,There are no shuttle buses. The public bus only goes to the first building on campus and nothing else. The school needs better transportation.
College Student,2,I still am not completely sure what my financial aid status is. They do not help you one on one.
College Senior,2,There is nothing unique about my school that set apart from other schools
College Senior,2,The school i attend has it's ups and downs but i would not recommend anyone to apply here. We have the worst service in the financial aid department and the school is pretty much like an high school. You don't really get to experience the college life like you would at another institute.
College Junior,2,It needs to be renovated completely. 
College Junior,2,There really isn't any transportation. This is a small VERY small city. There aren't too many places to go.
College Junior,2,There have been fights and guns on campus and not enough police to catch the kids. They have ruined yard parties and all they do is give out parking tickets. There's three security officers for all six dorms
College Junior,2,"The dorm I stay in is terrible, it has mold and insects running around. The only thing I like about it is that I've been here for three years and I am close to the dorm manager. If I could I would stay off campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking on campus is for non traditional students is extremely limited.  You often have to park across campus from the actual building where your class is being held.  This is especially inconvenient for older students and those with disabilities.
College Senior,2,"My experience with Financial aid has been really bad. The school seems to process information really slow, and on more then one occasion they  have lost papers I have given them. I do feel that some people do their job better than others , but if the staff members all equally worked hard Financial aid would run much smoother."
College Freshman,2,Unless there is a party going on you will probably not find anyone outside.
College Freshman,2,"I went to Orientation and the campus police was there answering question about security on campus and the dorms. They talk like I'll be safe, so I give the a C for average and grade them once I get there. Coming from Chicago, IL. its hard to feel safe anywhere."
College Junior,2,"The places to eat around campus are your average, Mcdonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and White Castle. Although it might set a thrill, sooner or later you would want to chill! The food tends to get unwanting after a while. The same with the actual cafe food on campus. They try to creat good and nutritious meals, but the food is almost always bland."
College Sophomore,2,For some odd reason when it comes to cars and driving that life just isn't meant to be perfect.
College Sophomore,2,Go to visit for open house soon but I gave this review a C because I haven't heard of any major world disaster incidents in Kentucky since a minor tornado recently.
College Sophomore,2,"Most lunch at schools are USDA approved, at least I would hope so and they're usually clean and delicious enough to eat for the time being."
College Freshman,2,The weather at KSU changes. One minute its really warm and the next theres snow on the ground. It just depends.
College Freshman,2,The diversity at KSU is about 75% Black and 25% everyone else.
College Sophomore,2,The curriculum and work load and tough. If intrested in joining the Nursing program you have to be very focused and determined.
College Freshman,2,our teams are not great and they are not really into playing but we support them no matter what.
College Freshman,2,Kentucky State University is a very good university. However as college students we should be able to have a certain amount of freedom as far as growing adults. Sometimes it feels like I am back in high school again. They talk about fun and growing as a campus but if everybody is complaining or not wanting to participate then we will never get to that point. You cant expect a full campus of students to improve while youre holding them back in every other situation.
College Sophomore,2,Sports are not nearly as big as a Division 1 School. I don't think the students give the athletes enough acknowledgement.
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough on campus parking. For those students that live on or off campus, if they do not have a parking permit tickets will add up daily."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some of the most enforced rules are much too simple, like wearing a hat inside a building. Yet, people are not usually caught doing more severe things. Once you get a sanction you are forbidden from holding leadership roles in many organizations, and sanctions are given as a result of any rule breaking."
College Junior,2,Drugs in the Air – Although drinking is not the biggest thing on Kentucky State campus alot of people take to smoking in the main hang outs on campus
College Sophomore,2,Stick to the Burger and Pizza Line – there is something good every now and then but most of the time just stick to the burgers and pizza they have other options and some of it is good but most of the time its not.
College Senior,2,Fairly Easy – The overall process of applying to the university isn't the easiest. There seems to be a lot that needs to be done and finding out what they are is hard. I feel the staff aren't on the same page in some aspects.
College Sophomore,2,Kentucky State University has a strict policy that if a car doesnt have a parking permit of an specific dorm and they are parked there they will get a ticket. Alot of ticketing and fines.
College Sophomore,2,Kentucky State University has a lot of variety. Many people usually stay in groups based on race or style. There isn't really alot of different cultures.
College Sophomore,2,Professors and/ or teachers are not really available as much as they should be. Our transfer rate is very high.The registration process is unorganized and can be stressful. I love the Ace where students can go and get help. I love my school as a whole.
College Freshman,2,"Little Town but Hard to Get Around – Most thing in our town aren't in walking distance.  We have bus transportation but there arent many buses and the times may not be convenient to some.  Then, we have a taxi thats only ten dollars to go anywhere within the city.  But, the way most people get around is from having a car or a friend with a car."
College Freshman,2,They have a KSU bus that will take you to walmart on monday evenings. Im not aware of any other options for the use of the kentucky state university bus.  I was told that the public transportation is free but have not seen one around.
College Freshman,1,For a student needing to be picked up from the airport or bus station transportation is horrible
College Freshman,1,I'm used to city life so this is a big change
College Freshman,1,The wifi connection is terrible
College Junior,1,It's boing and racist here.
College Junior,1,People smoke and drink all the time. There is no pressure to join in though.
College Freshman,1,"I recieve NO information from Kentucky State about different scholarships. I'm an out of state student and need 10,000. after my financial aid is apply. That a Pell Grant and loans only. Financial is difficult to get in touch with. A night mare o Main Street."
College Junior,1,"Not very helpful, very slow working and needs new working methods."
College Sophomore,1,"Frankfort is a small city, which does not recognize its local university unless there is an event which brings the city profit. There are not many things to do for college students, nor are there popular hangouts."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have good transportation at all. If you need to get around town we do have a bus but it stops running at a certain time and goes only in certain directions. Majority of the stores are far out so I would recommend every student to come to KSU with a car or get to know someone willing to car pull.
College Sophomore,1,I am currently not in my major now but the classes I do have to take to get into the Nursing Program are extremely hard.
College Sophomore,1,"Housing Rules
Normally  males are not suppose to be on the girls floor without being signed in or after 2 am. the security really do not care in some dorms, and i think if some kids get along with the security guard they wont say anything, if that is a RULE every one should have to follow it"
College Freshman,1,"Public transport is terrible around campus because it is a small cities. There is only one bus that goes in and out of town every few hours. The only to get anywhere is either the bus, call a taxi, or hope someone that you know is able and willing to go in town."
College Junior,1,There are never any spots and you get tickets for parking in spots that your pass isn't for.
College Freshman,1,"I got the majority of my money from federal grants and loans but it was not enough to get all of my tuition covered. Making sure I did not end the semester with a balance was a lot of hard work, I did not receive much help at all. I had to do a lot on my own as well as my family."
College Freshman,1,"Something to Do or Nothing to Do – On Kentucky State's campus there is either a lot to do or nothing to do. It usually depends on if there is some type of special occasions occurring. There is one major club in Frankfort, Ky, Boonies. Boonies is really cheap and is open just about every night. Many times house parts are thrown and are attended by a lot of people because they are free and not much of anything else to do because of the fact that Frankfort is very small."
College Freshman,1,"The Scoop on KYSU – I am not aware of any unique opportunities at the school.  Probably the only thing that would be of excitement would be the fraterniy/sorority groups.  Information is not provided freely as it should be, especially for a first time student that has no college experience."
College Freshman,1,"If you like a secluded and quiet town, this is the school for you. Class sizes are extremely small and you may sometimes feel as though you're still in hs...."
College Junior,1,"Although I live off campus I lived on campus and I can say that the dorms need alot of work done. Realistically, the rooms are not liveable. From Mold in the rooms to the Bugs etc."
College Junior,1,"Organization at This School Is Terrible – Getting financial aid is easy enough but actually getting help from the people who work there is ridiculous. Most people that work there most of the time don't have the answers that you are looking for and the people that do are very difficult to get in touch with. They are late with getting your financial aid up on their website so you can accept it, and it's just a total unorganized mess."
College Sophomore,1,"A Mess – They gave me scholarship and everything, but ended up giving me the wrong amount and took some of my money away in the middle of the first semester.  To add onto it, they told me the wrong thing about my book voucher which i thought was free money but it ended up taking money from my refund.  My financial aid experience was not very good at all.  There was nothing but confusion and chaos."

Sophomore,5,Augustana is a great school that prepares its students for their future and continues to help them even after they graduate.
Sophomore,5,Augustana adjusted well to the quick switch to online classes and continues to make improvements to keep its students safe while ensuring academic success.
Alum,5,"Augustana was salvation for me. I found most of the professors well prepared and  willing to accept outsiders. You did not have to be a  white Anglo-Saxon, Lutheran American to be accepted. As a Jew who was saved during the Night of the Broken Glass I found so much understanding.  I was required to attend Chapel two times a week but I found the talks related to universal problems of humanity. In my novel, Home Front Diary 1944: A Family's Awakening To Truth and Courage I highlight my experience at the college. I particularity include a character based on Dr. Celms who taught philosophy. We became friends because he   like me had survived Nazi terror and were open to the ideas of Einstein and others.  I graduated in 1957 so I may not be up with the other topics that you list below."
Alum,5,"Augustana College offered a great education in Music and Psychology and prepared me academically for my current graduate studies. The staff care deeply about your well-being and want you to succeed. The smaller class sizes allow for greater interaction between students and professors for deeper understanding of course content. Additionally, a smaller school allows you to get more involved in campus activities and programs, along with meet more people. 

The campus ministries was welcoming, and my faith life was also enhanced greatly through personal relationships with the pastors and getting to know other students on retreats. 

Finding employment on campus was easy, and working in Admissions was a terrific experience! Areas for improvement at the school include making significant improvements to residential life and updating older dorms and academic buildings."
Sophomore,5,"Augustana is a beautiful place for you to learn more about yourself as well as others. This is also where I got to be with the people who I truly vibe with. Also, the campus is really beautiful here. The professors and employers are helpful and supportive. Most of the students here are respectful. So yeah, it's an amazing place for you to study."
Sophomore,5,"I did take online classes during the pandemic. The professors had made changes to the syllabus and were also flexible with our deadlines. I had taken an FYI-102 class and it was interactive and engaging to me. Although there were some setbacks due to connection errors, my professor was understanding. Also, the exam dates were flexible too."
Freshman,5,"My first few months at Augusta as a freshman, were some of the hardest times of my life. I was not in a very good headspace mentally. After first semester, I decided to start counseling with the school and it made such an impact on my life. The school truly wants the best for their students and are so understanding when it comes to mental health. They have so many great groups on campus that are willing to show you support ever step of the way. The greek life can be a little bit cliquey, but that is to be expected among most college campuses. All of the professors I have had have been amazing so far. They are so passionate about teaching and are willing to go out of their way for each and ever student. The overall atmosphere of the school is so warm and welcoming. Although yes, there are things about the school that I do not necessarily like, the good definitely outweighs the bad."
Alum,5,"Augustana was the best choice I could have made for an undergraduate experience. I was able to be involved in various extracurricular activities, explore my major in the classroom and in the real world, and explore other interests in the classroom. I graduated with a major, two minors, multiple real-world experiences related to my major, and various leadership positions in groups across campus."
Works Here,5,Augustana College is a closed knit community. Faculty and staff are driven to support student outcomes. The campus is gorgeous and the people are friendly.
Alum,5,"Augustana College was an amazing experience for me, and if I had to go back and do it again, I would not have chosen any other school. I worked with so many faculty members that took time out of their personal lives to help me succeed, and was offered some amazing opportunities I am confident I would not have found in other colleges. There are a large variety of clubs, programs, and activities that you can get involved in to include yourself in campus life and help you find a group of people that you fit in well with. I made amazing lifelong connections at this school with professors, friends and other faculty that I am very thankful for and have helped guide me in post-graduate life. I miss Augustana every single day and would highly recommend it to anyone, it is a great place to be."
Junior,5,"Augustana College has a very diverse and friendly faculty. Personally i had no plans of attending this college but after the hospitality i received from the admissions team, i felt at home so i committed. What still impresses me the most is they still show me the same hospitality they showed me a while ago which is a statement itself about how committed, passionate about service delivery. 
The academics system allows you to take multiple majors and still complete them in four years and the CORE office is so exceptional at helping students secure internships and jobs. There are multiple student organizations which make student life a wonderful experience. The food is very great and there is a campus shuttle which ferries students across campus because safety of students is of paramount importance. Of course there sports clubs to help refresh the mind."
Senior,5,"When I visited there, I felt welcomed because people were smiling, and everyone was just friendly there."
Junior,5,"Overall, my experience at Augustana has been great. I have absolutely loved all my professors and have a good relationship with all of them. If you are looking for a smaller school and classes with good professors then this is the school for you!"
Niche User,5,"i connected with  augustana college pretty fast. when they college rep visited our school, she really sold the school, everything from academics to social life was great."
Freshman,5,"Augustana is a very wonderful school filled with caring students and staff. While it lacks in diversity, the smaller percentage of colored students that do attend this school have various outlets to express their cultures and appreciate others. The classroom sizes are ideal-not too large and not too small-and the campus itself is absolutely gorgeous."
Junior,5,"It really depends on what department your course of study is a part of. Overall though, faculty really cares about the students."
Sophomore,5,"I love being at Augustana. The students here are driven and motivated and the small classes make it easy for professors to get to know you and personally help you achieve your goals. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus in both sports and the arts, and both receive funding and attention. The one thing I don't like about Augie is how the school uses its money on ""campus beauty"" projects and delaying the necessary task of adding AC to its dorms or improving some of its technology systems, such as WiFi. Overall though, I think Augie is a fun place to be with great faculty that truly do care about you when you put in the effort."
Sophomore,5,I love the environment of the classrooms and decisions. It's a beautiful campus and has a lot that you can get involved with.
Junior,5,Augustana is a great place to go to college. I have thoroughly enjoyed the last two years that I have been at the institution. They help students think for themselves and encourage the growth of personal pursuit.
Senior,5,Great School! Love the small school environment and small class sizes. You really get to know your professors and everyone on campus.
Freshman,5,"I haven't visited yet, but from talking to representatives on the phone so far everything seems very well."
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful. Everyone is really friendly. I especially liked the wrestling coaching staff
Freshman,5,"What I love about Augustana is that it is easy to get around, the people are nice, and the professors are even better. At Augustana there are a lot of opportunities to get out and be apart of clubs or groups without feeling odd. The campus is very inclusive with people. The education here is also very eye opening and helps to establish a well rounded individual."
Freshman,5,It is a very positive and good school.  Everyone there is very nice and there is a lot of support from the faculty and the administration.
Freshman,5,"I love how not only students but also the faculty and staff are extraordinarily welcoming and helpful since the beginning of my freshman year, from moving in to finding great local food, from class registration to dealing with papers/assignments to thrive in courses. There is always something going on around the campus, either a concert or an outdoor activity. Augie students can hop on any local bus for free (one only needs to show the school ID)! And for Asians, there is just a perfect place for you to curb your savory and sweet appetite!"
Freshman,5,"Augustana College is a great institution which promotes well-rounded and higher level learning and thinking.  The community is friendly and caring, and it is everyone's goal to make you feel right at home."
Sophomore,5,"Augustana College is a fantastic higher learning experience.  It offers strong NCAA DIII sports (I am a pole vaulter).  Student life is fantastic as well.  It boasts a fantastic liberal arts program.  But Augustana also offers exceptional specialty paths for various professions.  My neuroscinces program will prepare me for the MCAT and for med school with fantastic academics, research opportunities and internships around the world."
Niche User,5,"I liked how the campus was small, and one of the overall concerns was safety of the students. The campus seems to have a lot of safety precautions, which was nice. Also, everyone was super welcoming and wanted to get everyone involved in activities."
Junior,5,Great academic school with great professors who are always there to help out the students.  All the sports teams are very fun to watch. Night life is lit
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Augustana and I have absolutely fallen in love with it. The community is wonderful, the athletic, musical, and social opportunities are endless. I would however critique my school in its budgeting abilities. The cost of living combined with a meal plan and tuition is incomprehensible. Especially considering the salary and houses of Principal Bahls. However, where Augustana struggles, there are also mainy areas where it succeeds. I have never been a part of such a welcoming, diverse, and accepting group of students. The academics, with the exception of my brief experience in mathematics, has been effective though very challenging compared to high school. I love my school and there are many areas that need change however, there is so much to appreciate in my day to day life here."
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere and overall campus feel. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly. The food is great and there are so many options. The housing and residence halls are clean and very livable. I fall in love more everyday.
Freshman,5,"Augustana College is amazing, it has so many things to keep you busy and active despite the size of the campus."
Freshman,5,"There are so many different opportunities at Augustana. I went in just three months ago as a freshmen who had everything planned out, and now I have done all and more! I was never athletic throughout my 18 years of life, but when I came to Augie, I joined rowing and met so many amazing people while staying active. I really enjoyed it and even still hang out with the people and exercise for next season!  I never understood what was so different about going to a liberal arts school, but it has changed my life. My perspectives have changed. You are exposed to so many ways of thinking-very critically thinking. I have been able to extend this new found knowledge to other areas of my life as well where it is critical that I make a responsible decision."
Sophomore,5,"I love Augustana because of the people I meet everyday. From the administrators, to the teachers, and of course, students, I feel welcome at all times. This keeps me motivated and ready to learn."
Alum,5,"As a liberal arts college, Augustana allowed me to experience a wide variety of classes while still being able to complete my chosen degree."
Junior,5,"I have only been here for one trimester, as a transfer student, but I love Augustana. It is exactly the kind of school I was looking for. I was never completely sure whether i would want to attend a big school or a small school, but I'm glad I went with a smaller school. Everyone is so friendly and you run into the same people all the time, which makes it easier to make friends. Augustana's student population is the same amount of students that attend my high school, about 2500 people. I do wish, however, that there was a marching band at Augustana. "
College Senior,5,I just finished my third year at Augie and I couldn't be happier with how my education has gone. Augie has offered many opportunities to me that I never thought I would be able to be a part of in college.
College Sophomore,5,"I am a geology major and the 3 main professors are all very engaged and helpful. They challenge us and have a very notable sense of humor about them. Courses are very intensive with relatively small class sizes (~15-25) and so can be very personalized. Class styles include powerpoint notes, term-long research projects, and many opportunities to hear from featured guests/speakers."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school because of its beautiful location next to the Upper Mississippi River. I love it because of the bustling and internship-rich Quad Cities it lies within. I love being a part of an incredible track team full of talented and endearing you adults. I love the department I am learning from and my eccentric and quirky peers within it. In short, I feel very fortunate for picking where I chose to study because it has become a home truly not far from home."
College Freshman,5,"Being a small liberal arts college, there are many opportunities that stem from this. CORE knows how to get you connected with jobs and prospective internships, and make sure you know what the next step is on your part."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Swanson, and it is the best residence hall to live in. A bathroom shared by only 4 people, and the janitors come to clean it every week. Co-ed floors in Swanson too because there is no communal bathrooms. The rooms are spacious, and the air conditioning is an added bonus. With the magnetic door holders, it is easy to leave your door open and meet the others on your floor. Overall, the best part of college has been my residence hall and the people I have met from it."
College Freshman,5,"There is nothing like the atmosphere at an Augustana basketball game. The Carver Crazies earned their name! The basketball team is the most popular here on campus, and rightfully so. It felt like the entire school showed up to their games!"
College Sophomore,5,It's the best. Really. People are safe and you can get help when you need it.
College Junior,5,"It's different than anywhere else in that the sororities are big, but you know every single girl within the group and ACTUALLY have a sisterly bond. Best decision I have made was joining a sorority."
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe on campus! Guaranteed, I also do not put myself in dangerous situations. I always walk with someone else, especially at night."
College Freshman,5,"CORE, the career center on campus, does an excellent job of preparing students for job applications and interviews. The likelihood of getting a job with an Augustana degree is extremely high."
College Freshman,5,"I have loved every course I have taken so far. Similarly, every professor I have had has been excellent! All of the professors are so friendly, helpful, and really care about their students."
College Freshman,5,I live in Swanson Commons and I LOVE it! I would stay in my exact room every year if I could. My room is very spacious and up-to-date. Having direct access to a bathroom only shared by four of us is also a great perk!
College Freshman,5,"I love attending athletic events, such as football and basketball games. The recreational facilities are newly renovated and very nice. I am also a member of two dance teams and love everything about them! Choosing to tryout for those teams has been one of the best decisions I have made in college thus far."
College Freshman,5,"If I could do my college search process over again, I wouldn't do a single thing differently! I absolutely LOVE everything about Augustana and cannot even imagine myself ever being happy at any of the other schools I originally considered. The professors are wonderful, everyone on campus is incredibly friendly, the classes are excellent, and I love being involved in extra-curricular activities. Augustana is truly my home away from home."
College Freshman,5,We had to take several online informational courses about sexual harassment and sexual assult among other things and it makes me feel safer on campus knowing everyone went through that training
College Junior,5,"We have lots of international students. It is a religious college, you don't have to be religious to attend."
College Junior,5,The feel of the campus is very safe. Students have the number for public safety if they every feel unsafe. Students are also offered free transportation anywhere on-campus through ACEs.
College Junior,5,"There are a wide variety of courses offered. The professors are all extremely knowledgable in their fields, but they are still approachable. Class sizes are small, this is nice because professors get to know every student."
College Junior,5,"CORE is all about giving students the opportunity to find internships. They also help with resumes, interview prep, and they always have recruiters on campus."
College Junior,5,"I was a transfer student so I never lived in the traditional dorms. I do live in a TLA on campus, which is an on campus apartment for juniors. The apartment is very clean, and big each roommate has their own bedroom."
College Junior,5,"Lots of students are involved in Greek life, but it's not a big deal if student's are not involved. All of the social sororities and fraternities are local chapters. There is one national service sorority, and one national co-ed service fraternity."
College Junior,5,"Augustana College is an amazing institution. I am incredible happy I picked it, the faculty are very helpful. The class sizes are small, this makes it so professors learn your name. The professors are approachable, and always willing to help."
College Freshman,5,I have really enjoyed all of my professors in all the different subjects i have had. My professors seem to really enjoy and be passionate about their subjects. They are accommodating if you need help and good with their teaching styles.
College Freshman,5,I am on the varsity volleyball and track and field teams at school and they are excellent. We are one of the only D-3 schools with access to multiple athletic trainers and facilities. We have a very good fan base at sporting events and the coaches and school spirit is great.
Alum,4,The professors strive to make their students succeed on any platform. Could not ask for any more from them.
Alum,4,Great college with tons of diversity just not the safest of places surrounding the college. Would not go of campus after dark.
Sophomore,4,the professors were really  understanding and lenient . they let you to submit assignments overdue if you have a good reason. the test also lasted for days so that anyone can take it when  they have time and access.
Sophomore,4,"Augustana college is a very good school. the classes are small size and the professors put a lot of effort into helping the students. since the classes are small you will be able to get individual attention from the professors. you can also talk to them in office hours and they also encourage you to do so. There are different offices to assist you in different subjects and everything, such as: reading and writing center, career center,  .. etc. The staffs are really helpful and polite. But the college is not the one for someone who loves a crowd. the school is in a small town and there isn't really much to do. it might be boring to someone who lived in a big city. But if you focus solely on education, it's a place you need to be."
Sophomore,4,The online learning experience with Augustana was great because our professors were understanding and the overall session was achievable.
Alum,4,"I love the small class sizes and the professors and faculty because they really care about you. Students have the ability to participate in so many things, like band or choir even when they are not music majors. I was a little disappointed in the ability of the school to put students first in terms of tuition raises and taking care of the grounds after snow and ice storms and residential life leaves much to be desired."
Sophomore,4,Overall it is a very good school with an optimal balance with the student to proffesor ratio with it being 1:18. this ratio also leads to managable class sizes being around 20 students.
Sophomore,4,They did a good job getting the faculty ready to teach online. They also were trying to get up to date information about the virus and determine the risk for classes in the fall.
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience at Augustana has been so much better than I thought it would be. Three out of my four professors have done google meets at least once a week for each class. This has really helped me stay connected with my peers and feel that sense of community that most of us seem to be lacking right now. All of my professors adjusted the syllabus's to accommodate for distanced learning, so they understand that school can be difficult right now. I did have one professor who only sent one email when we left campus with all the due dates for the semester and pretty much told us good luck. There has been one check in email that I got from him, but for the most part I feel he has done a poor job during distanced learning. But that is the only thing that I have to complain about. The daily emails from the school, which are pretty much just a newsletter, have been helpful as well."
Freshman,4,"Augustana college is my home away from home. The campus is so beautiful and the college is academically really good too but with everything there are pros and cons. The cons Augie has is it's too expensive and the college athletics aren't that good as it's a D3 school. Moreover, the location where the college is located isn't that good as there is much to do once you exit the campus area. Lastly my advice about having a good college life is making the most out of it. People have mixed reviews about Augustana college but I really liked it."
Freshman,4,Augie is a really nice college. It peaceful and there are amazing students. Everyone is so nice. The atmosphere is amazing same as the city around it.
Freshman,4,I'm just starting at a freshman this year but I've had an overall good experience at Augustana. I've really liked the small class sizes and the professors really seem to be invested in the success of their students. It's really easy to get involved in activities on campus and everyone is friendly.
Freshman,4,"Augustana college is a great college in terms of studies, opportunities and professors. Having a small knitted community at Augustana really helps me to feel like I am a part of Augustana and it does not make me feel like a stranger to it. However, one thing that I wish I had known before coming here is that unfortunate location that this college is placed in. Firstly, the city rock island is always cold and secondly there is nothing to do here as it is a small city."
Senior,4,"Augustana College offers incredible opportunities, from research to study abroad, for all students to experience. The professors truly care about their work and are willing to help any student succeed!"
Junior,4,"Loved my experience here. The campus is beautiful, and the professors really care. Excellent theatre program."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this campus, but I will say that this isn’t disability friendly. I have a hard time getting around campus because there are almost no elevators or simple ways to get down to the main campus. Other than that, students are welcoming and there’s a ton of fun events going on. Westy is absolutely beautiful, the CAs are chill, and the professors are very personable."
Alum,4,"Amazing atmosphere, personable teachers, great student life. 10/10 would reccommend...unless you are pursuing a medical career. If so, go to another school, as this is just a liberal arts school that doesn't prepare you to be competitive at all when applying to med school or other graduate programs."
Senior,4,"Augustana provides a welcoming atmosphere to incoming students. There are a bit of issues with the process of registering classes, but get better as you integrate to the college. The campus really focuses of ""beautifying"" campus as it makes it attractive to incoming students and makes its a wonderful place to live in. Professors are really interested in each student's future and make an effort to adjust their teaching styles to meet their students needs."
Junior,4,"It’s a small private liberal arts school were everyone seems to know each other. The classes are small but the professors do seem to care, but that does not make them any easier. You have to actually show up and try because the professors do know you by name. Greek life is a hit here, and it is a big party/ bars school. We also have a ton of international students, and they are the best ever."
Sophomore,4,"After my first year at Augustana, I am thoroughly in love. This diverse campus allows you to meet so many people from different backgrounds and truly broadens your horizons. You will leave this college with an open mind and be able to evaluate situations better than ever before. The administration could do a little bit better for students concerns but the professors and amazing and you can connect with each and every one on a personal level if you wish to do so."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love Augie! I am beyond content with my choice. A few factors that lead me to feel this way are the small class sizes which almost always leads to a strong connection with the Professors. With those connections, one can strive to get their best education. Augie is a small school with a big school feel. You get the best of both worlds. There is an abundance of clubs, sports, or extracurriculars one can join to feel apart of the community. To add, there is always a friendly face around every corner. After one year Augustana is my home away from home. But, with that being said, it does not make me feel as safe as my true home does. There is plenty of money going into the facilities at the school that could also be put towards the student's safety. In my opinion, there are not enough blue light poles around campus. A simple installation of more of these can make a huge difference in making the students feel safe. This would be my one critique of the school."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the first year. Many events and everyone there are so nice to one another.  Professors are so impactful with our learning experience that I say you learn more than all the other years in high school.
Freshman,4,"Augustana College, or Augie as the students, staff, and faculty call it, is a liberal arts college, so it's a place where you will be able to explore whatever interests you, but also expand your horizons with new viewpoints. The campus is great and so are the people, who come from all over the U.S. and the world. It is a little difficult being a commuter and I have heard that living on campus is not easy for some, but overall you will likely find the perfect group of friends, club, and major for you. Augie is a place that you can consider your second home and it will welcome you with open arms."
Sophomore,4,Augustana College consists of a welcoming and diverse student body alongside the beautiful campus. Augustana's academic programs are outstanding and beneficial for all students. Students obtain the advantage of personal one on one time with professors and the ability to form many relationships throughout the classroom.
Freshman,4,Good choice of majors and located in a nice area. The students and staff are friendly.  Lots of class choices to suit a lot of interests.
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior here at Augustana, and so far my experience at Augustana has been phenomenal. Being a Liberal Arts college, the school requires you to take different types of classes, perspectives, which help broaden your horizon. Had it not been for that, I would have never thought about taking an anthropology class nor a science class, but I did. Those classes helped me and added another point of view for learning. 
While there have been problems throughout my year, such as the chalking incident that criticized feminism or the burning of t-shirts, the school was quick to respond to these incidents with information. The President, Dean, etc. provided support and tried their best to make sure hate crimes like these don't happen again.
The school is not perfect, there's always going to be a flaw in whichever school you choose, but Augustana has grown to be a second home for me."
Sophomore,4,Good liberal arts experience with plenty of activities and a knowledgeable faculty. They are committed to finding students jobs and internships. Each student is given 2000 dollars to study abroad or to fund any activity they decide. Two negative aspects of Augustana is the price and the fact that the crime rate in the surrounding area is quite high.
Niche User,4,"I love how Augustana gives their students $2,000 for internships, study abroad, and more. They give out good financial aid packages to their students too which is very helpful and makes attending college easier."
Junior,4,"I have experienced many great things in terms of social experiences and professors. Some of the curriculum can be modified, and some of my experiences with faculty have not been the best, but overall, I enjoy attending Augie."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the small atmosphere of the school. The teachers were able to give you more attention and individual help. The school always had something going on so there was plenty to do. Like all schools it, isn't perfect, but the atmosphere was pretty inviting and kind for the most part. I enjoyed the fact that it was really easy to study multiple subjects."
Junior,4,"I am so grateful for all the opportunities I have been given at Augustana and I regret none of the decisions that brought me here. I love our community and the fact that people generally care about one another and the world around them. Yes, Augustana isn't perfect, but I feel that steps are being taken to correct any imperfections."
Freshman,4,"Augustana College was where I took a completely big step in my life. I didn't think I would go to college because of my financial issue, but Augustana has offered me a path to success. Its community is friendly and makes me feel like I'm home. Professors and facilities here are very dedicated to students. The resources that Augustana offer is various. However one thing I don't really like about Augustanta is that the road system because it's not perfectly contracted. There are still holes on the road and small cracks. But in general, Augustana College is a good place to start my college life."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, and the area fairly safe compared to many other colleges. The professors (the ones I've had, at least) do their best to help you succeed, and there are many resources to help you improve your academic skills such as the Reading and Writing Centre. There's always something going on everyday, so there are a lot of opportunities to make friends and take a break from studying. My only complaints are about the food and the internet - the food can get old after a while; there isn't much variety in the menu. The internet connection can also get pretty bad depending on where you are on campus. Overall, everyone in the college is friendly and helpful, and there is a good sense of community as well."
Sophomore,4,"I was concerned about my college choice at first (mostly because I didn't know what I wanted), but Augustana has been a wonderful choice. Given, I might have been just as happy anywhere, I am certainly happy I picked a small school where everyone knows everyone - not just students, but faculty, staff, and administration. It helps the school feel less like a 'too-big' institution and more like a network of people who actually care about student success."
Alum,4,"I loved my Augustana experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the trimesters, small class sizes as well as the focus from the professors.  I enjoyed the close connection I made from being on an athletic team as well as my sorority.  I would love to see the cost stay consistent and greater diversity in the student population."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the staff, especially in the music department is wonderful, and I'm glad I made the decision to come here; faced with the same choice, I would still be at Augustana. Additionally, the small school allows me to get to know more people, and I can recognize recurring faces while walking around campus, even if I don't know them personally. Also, there are plenty of resources on campus, and they are all available to everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Augustana College has a great biology department. The professors are helpful, and they want their students to succeed. The campus is diverse, and the multicultural group provides information to the campus. There are many clubs and organizations on campus that students can participate in."
Alum,4,"The thing that drew me to Augustana College off the bat, was the campus. It has an absolutely beautiful campus with amazing scenery: all season! 
The only thing I can proudly say I loved about Augie, was the scenery, the amazing friends I made, and sadly, the parties. If it had not been for my friends, I would have left since my sophomore year. The academics were great, if you weren't a science major. Almost more than half of the friends that I made, who were of a diverse culture and were science majors, had left by sophomore year. The science major had it hard! Especially since many of the professors weren't much help. At one point, instead of helping my grades and advising me on how to improve, I was being told to find a different school. It's sad to say but I strongly believe that Augustana College was in fact racist."
Freshman,4,"Augustana College offers a very unique college experience. With a student population less than 3,000 on a beautiful, quiet, hilly campus, one can come to appreciate what it means to be a part of this school. One thing I really appreciated about Augustana College was the student-faculty ratio. In nearly all of my classes, I created a connection with my professors and continued class discussions with them in their offices. There are days where I stop into their office just to talk about a new concept related to their field of study, which they are always happy to listen to. Augustana utilizes a trimester system (Fall, Winter, and Spring terms) which makes a double major more manageable and offers students more opportunities to explore the courses that they have interest in. This is a perfect institution for those seeking the Liberal Arts education."
Junior,4,"Augustana is a home where each professor knows every student by name, and professors and students alike want to help. This is a place where people watch out for each other, hold doors for each other, and do what they can to be helpful. Professors take time to get to know each student, and create opportunities for learning and change on campus and off."
Freshman,4,"I love Augustana so much. I feel incredibly safe and at home at school, and I love the faculty and staff. Augustana has a great party scene but is also very focused on academics."
Junior,4,It is a good school with some great professors. There are some issues among students and many are ignorant to the idea of diversity. Maybe the school can work on this in the upcoming years.
Junior,4,"Augustana is an amazing school with some simply wonderful professors. The ratio of faculty to students is 11:1, which is very impressive. All of the faculty want to see their student succeed and do everything in their power to help and challenge them. Something that I would like to see changed is the schools housing options. I have friends that are Juniors who are studied abroad this past fall term, and do not have an appropriate place to live, or with the people that they would like to live with. These Juniors are living in dorms, when they should be in apartments."
Freshman,4,"Other than getting bored with the food after 9 weeks, and the obnoxious fire alarms. I love Augustana."
Niche User,4,"Augustana College was a very beautiful college. If there was anything I could change, I would've loved to see the dorms. The most captivating part of our tour was that we got to experience the C.O.R.E project. C.O.R.E helps students in the areas they struggle most in- writing, speaking, presenting. The program gets students ready for the real world. They have tutors to help in the areas of weakness. "
College Sophomore,4,College so far has been a great balance of a challenging but doable academic life and also a lively social life once a group of friends has been found.
College Sophomore,4,"As a new member of a sorority at Augustana, I would say that Greek Life here is pretty big. By big I mean that if you are the kind of person who wants to go to parties, always have something social to do, and be considered ""popular,"" then I suggest that you join Greek Life. That being said, non-Greeks are not made fun of or thought less for not joining a sorority or a fraternity, but being such a small school, if you are not in Greek Life and have not joined any other group, you might feel isolated and not fully included if you are into the party scene. There is definitely a ranking among the sororities and fraternities even though the Greek groups mostly get along. I must say however that there is a definite ranking as to who are the ""popular"" groups and which groups are the ""rejects."" There are pretty large stereotypes that will follow you depending on which sorority or fraternity you join among Greeks as well as non-Greeks. In a nutshell, Greek Life is a huge deal if you are into the party scene. If you are the type of person who does not like to party and would rather stay in and watch Netflix every night (nothing wrong with that!:)) then Greek Life is nothing to worry about. However, I would like to mention that there is prestige in being in Greek Life so if you are into prestige and the whole ""being popular"" scene, join."
College Senior,4,Augie provides many opportunities for internships for students. They are very helpful if you seek help.
College Senior,4,"Most of my teachers care about me and my understanding of the concepts. The classes are all very small, so the teachers are much more intimate with the students."
College Senior,4,There haven't been many problems with safety issues for students.
College Senior,4,"Although the social Greek groups aren't national, they are still very much worth joining. I am in a fraternity and the comradery built by the members creates a very positive way to make friends. All Greek groups get along well with one another so we often have social and charitable events with other groups."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors are great and are very knowledgeable in their field. However some professors give grades based on only a few tests or projects and that ends up being your grade for the term, even if there were other factors that should have been considered. Many classes are graded fairly, though. I also like that the average class size is pretty small, averaging about 25 to a class which makes interacting with professors a lot easier compared to lecture hall sized classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard that when people hear about someone who went to Augustana, they have a very positive response to it. Augustana also has many internship opportunities that our career center offers to students."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school's atmosphere and the professors and students are all very friendly and knowledgeable. However, for a ""liberal arts"" school, they are somewhat conservative possibly due to the school's religious nature. However it seems to be changing among students. For example, students are making a proposal to open a sexual health center on campus. We are unsure what the board has decided, but students seem to know what needs to be changed on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a private, liberal arts school, a bachelor of arts degree for a science major can be pretty valuable to most employers as fields today are becoming progressively inter-disciplinary. Especially in the field of geology--an inherently interdisciplinary major--courses like physics, chemistry, geography, computer science, and history all contribute to the major besides the core courses themselves. CORE on campus is instrumental in findings internship opportunities for all majors. Featured speakers at Geology club often are alumni, and so are easy to network with."
College Sophomore,4,"Depending on the dorm, one may feel some are dirtier/more cramped than others. One common denominator is that each dorm has a fairly substantial social life. Amenities can be made for those living in singles or quads. Swanson ranks as the best while Andreen is the worst but I know people from both that complain about the former and relatively enjoy the latter. The housing process can be stressful but gets easier after each year."
College Sophomore,4,"The Greek life on campus has a nice balance between service and parties. I am not part of Greek life, but I know many people who are and they don't regret it for a second."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a Division III school, there is a perfect balance between stellar athleticism and notable scholasticism. It feels great to be part of such a competitive team and conference but there doesn't come that same amount of risk of getting cut from the team or feeling not good enough as with higher-division schools. The school spirit is generally very adequate for a variety of sports. For example, our basketball team nearly won the national competition last year and it seemed like no one on campus was unenthusiastic for them and eager to see the game's result."
College Freshman,4,"There are some thefts, but any reported incident or even suspicious activity is sent out to all the students to keep everyone informed. There are the blue light emergency stands at random places on campus, and Public Safety is always patrolling and quickly available."
College Freshman,4,"The courses have been wonderful. They are the perfect amount of challenging, but not too much to where you are completely stressed. The professors are always available to help and are only an email away."
Sophomore,2,"All the professors handled it very differently, and many of them changed their schedules completely. It was difficult to keep up with everything."
Niche User,2,"There’s better options than Augustana, the location isn’t great and there’s not much to do on a day to day basis. The school is also very cliquey and feels too much like high school. Partying gets way too much focus at the school and it’s basically what everyone talks about. The sports programs are bad aside from basketball. Don’t get fooled into going to Augustana. A recruiting coordinator will make it feel like you’re wanted there and that it’s the perfect place to be, but it really isn’t. Augustana is a place full of people with overinflated egos who try to make everything into a competition. If you’re from out of state do not go there, it will not be worth your time. Transferring from Augustana was one of the best things to ever happen to me and it got me out of the trap that is the Quad Cities. The academics are okay, but nothing special. Overall, my experience at Augustana was not great and I urge you to really consider what you want out of college."
College Freshman,2,Good luck getting on a bus to anywhere
College Freshman,2,It's an easy school that doesn't really prepare you for the working world. The people you meet here are fake and put up a persona to fit in with everyone else. It's unsafe. I'm glad to be transferring.
College Freshman,2,JOHN DEERE is the only company that I get emails about for internships.
College Freshman,2,"The security on campus is laughable at best. The only security is a card to get into the dorms though door holding or asking someone to open it has a 9/10 chance of working. It is in a poor neighborhood, students run the security desks in the dorms. No cameras except in the lobbies of the dorms and usually go unchecked unless damage to school property happens. I do not feel safe in this school."
College Freshman,2,From what I've experienced most of the people in Social Greek Life are fake and cliquey. Most friends you make freshman year will not talk to you once they get bidded into a chapter. To get you to pledge for their chapter the 'actives' go out of their way to be nice to you during pledging season after not paying any attention to you the days before that. No national social greek life but they still take themselves ridiculously seriously.
College Freshman,2,A support beam broke in one of the houses because there was like 10 people in the living room.
College Freshman,2,"The two most updated dorms re about a 20 minute walk from the academic buildings and get unnecessary renovations every year. The other three are inside the main campus but have no air conditioning, no space, and are very restrictive to noise, visitors, and space. The apartments offered on campus are cramped and cost too much for what you get. If you want to move from your dorm room to another one for any reason, there is a fee."
College Sophomore,2,I feel like most the houses around campus are not that great and for what the landlords charge is just too much with what we already pay for tuition.
College Senior,2,"Most the houses are run down, with landlords who ask far too much in rent."
College Freshman,2,"It really depends sport to sport, but it's not a great sports place.  It's weird that this is a school that an NFL legend quarterback attended (Kenny Anderson of Bengal fame), but still the football stadium is a third full on game days and the athletic facilities are pretty sub par.  For the athlete, it's a great experience, especially for cross country and track runners, where they are coached by a legend in Coach Paul Olsen, and are invited to prestigious events due to the teams' yearly success.  It's mainly a ""Hooray! I get to play a college sport!"" sports atmosphere where the teams aren't very good, aren't very supported, but the athlete gets a great opportunity. "
College Freshman,2,"Well, you pretty much have a few dive bars, a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, a Wendy's, a KFC, and a few pizza places here and there.  But every place has a student discount!"
College Freshman,2,"A very boring, lackluster river town with not a lot too do and without a pretty view.  Rock Island does not really have that small town charm, but feels like another boring suburb.  People are very nice to students, but the college is not exactly located in the best part of town.  It's not an awful place, but very boring and middle of nowhere-ish."
College Freshman,2,"Not a very diverse campus; a lot of middle to upper class white people with a few international students sprinkled into the mix.  Also not a very vocal or engaging campus in terms of political culture/ sexual orientation/ religion.  As a political science major, the basic lack of caring has driven me crazy."
College Freshman,2,"There's always an open computer in a lab, but the wifi and even Ethernet access is slow and spotty."
College Sophomore,2,it is hard to find a spot and commuters have very few places they can park
College Sophomore,2,the food is cheap frozen stuff and nothing is that healthy
College Sophomore,2,it definitely divides students and creates cliques but many people feel pressured to join
College Sophomore,2,The routers are under powered for the number of people using them. Wireless is nearly impossible. The ethernet connection seems to be the best option but then you are limited to where you can be.
Sophomore,1,"Pretty campus. Awful experience. After being a student for 2 years I am transferring as soon as I can. They preach about being like  ""family"" and a ""little community"" but it's all a lie. They dont care about you as a person. You are just another number. I have gone into so much dept for this school and it is NOT worth it. They force you to live on campus for 3 years. Pay extremely high cost for poor living conditions. Mold, bugs, no AC, poor heating systems. TERRIBLE internet connection. Maybe works 30% of the time in the dorms. They dont take sexual assault allegations seriously at all. Super disorganized with everything especially registration. I learned the hard way that they do not care about you as a person or your wellbeing."
Sophomore,1,"Expensive, and to my surprise, they increase their tuition each year. Terrible location. Great professors. Poor diversity ( majority of population is white with a few minorities and international students sprinkled in). TOO small for such small percentage in diversity with extreme cliquey-ness (only ~2500 students). I would recommend that people go somewhere else far greater for far less of a financial hassle—ESPECIALLY prospective individuals who are of a minority."
Freshman,1,"Augustana students and faculty like to portray this institution to be perfect, yet I have to say that this is not nearly the case at all... Diversity sucks, and the minuscule student population makes it even worse! The surrounding communit is extremely far from pleasing, the poverty is blatant. With that being said-- there are very few, if any, restaurants that are desirable--which is a HUGE letdown. The people who attend this school are also extremely attached to their high school cliques, which is also something that one does not expect going into college. On the bright side, this school has great residential areas/ dorms for its students, along with some pretty decent food. The professors are also truly dedicated to their jobs, and it shows. Yet, I would NOT recommend this school to anyone, there are many more places one could go to for far less money."
Niche User,1,"I attended this school for two years. I was very happy with the quality of education, how beautiful the campus is, and especially the caliber of the faculty. 

Although I had a very positive experience before I transferred to a school better equipped for my major, I feel compelled to leave a negative review because of how poorly the administration handles sexual assault cases. 

This is not an appropriate place for details, but please believe that this is a sincere accusation based on the experiences of sexual assault survivors who underwent the process. 

I mean seriously... administration tells girls NOT to go to the cops, and instead are subjected to a hearing in front of a panel of random faculty, a RANDOM STUDENT from student government, and the individual that assaulted them? 

Other than the administration's insistence on internally (mis)handling felony level offences, great school.

Ethan W - I left in 2016. Deans you know me."
Freshman,1,"Augustana portrays itself as the perfect small school to high school seniors, but in reality is the most deceiving institution I've ever encountered. Do not come to this school. It is a money trap, and they will leave you with little to no opportunity to transfer."
College Junior,1,"It's really difficult being middle class, white, with married parents at this school. Even as a first generation college student, you get very little and it takes forever to get it right"
College Senior,1,No parking or it is too expensive for students
College Freshman,1,The school is very strict you will get in trouble for just about anything alcohol related even if you didnt drink
College Freshman,1,"If you are not a heavy drinker/ party-er, this is not the right school for you.  The entire local scene revolves around parties, unfortunately."
College Freshman,1,They give out tickets all the time in ridiculous situations.
College Freshman,1,"The internet is terrible and often goes out around finals time--horrible. Other than that, it's usually not too difficult to find a computer or a printer, plus you usually don't have to pay extra to print."
College Sophomore,1,"Small Town Ghetto – Rock Island is a scary place at night. Its financially troubled and the college  is separated from the town. I don't like walking alone. Theres nothing of interest within walking distance, just high school gangs looking for trouble."
College Freshman,1,"It Sucks Bad. If you drank in high school, or have experience with the opposite sex do not come here if you want good night life. The only kids that appreciate the parties are the ones that did not engage in underage drinking in high school. There are fews bars within walking distance and those are sports bars for creepy men. The parties are small and remind me of a good high school party."
College Senior,1,"It is very frustrating to be a Science Major when you need to use a computer or print something off for a class.  The lab is extremely small for the amount of students in the building and about 25% of the computers do not work.  Also, the printer often stops working and there is only one.  Very frustrating when you only have 15 minutes between classes to print something or check your email."
College Junior,1,"Although I have recieved money it still is never enough and they raise their prices 3.75% every year.  They should stop competing with other schools lower your ""Prestigious"" prices!"
College Freshman,1,Mostly White – 95% of students it seems are white. It is obvious it is a mostly white campus.
College Sophomore,1,Things Are Intense – The school policies are inforced with extreme punishments usually ending in getting kicked out. Drinking tickets are often given out because there is no alcohol allowed on campus and if three are recieved then it is an automatic to get kicked out.

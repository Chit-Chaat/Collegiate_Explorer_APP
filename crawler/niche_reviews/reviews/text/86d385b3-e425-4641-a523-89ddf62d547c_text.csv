Graduate Student,5,"What I like about Andrews University is that applying for the DPT program was easy, and they were very good with communication. When I visited the DPT program for a tour I could tell that the teachers really care about how you do, and push you to do your best, and help you if you are struggling. When I watched a lab in session, I was able to talk to the students and get a feel for how it would be and it seems great!"
Junior,5,"I Love my school. I've found Andrews to be a good christian school. faculty and staff are always ready to help in everything that is needed. They also have good installations for STEM programs. Andrews is also very diverse, so you can easily be friends with people all around the world. I recommend Andrews University to everyone who wants to find a place that certainly feels like home. The only thing that I would change or improve is the athletics. We are not very good in them, but that is something that I think needs to be done better."
Niche User,5,"Appreciate the summer classes they offer.  Good, affordable online classes during for the summer session."
Freshman,5,"Andrews University is a great place of college! There is so much diversity and you can meet so many people from everywhere in the world! The campus is great and it's huge! The professors are really nice and willing to help you if you are confused about something in class. Overall, my experience has been great!"
Freshman,5,"Some really good opportunities in the j.n Andrews honors program. The school campus is very pretty and probably the best Adventist school for nearly all majors. Also, people here are very friendly and job opportunities from the school of business are very nice indeed!"
Junior,5,"I love that it has that large-campus feel but without having 20,000+ students, so you get to know a lot of people and still maintain a interaction with them. The sports teams are great and there are many events and activities for students."
Niche User,5,"Andrews has a beautiful campus (after all, it is nationally designated arboretum) and great professors, who care about the needs of the students. The cafeteria food is excellent as well."
Freshman,5,"Andrews University is located out in the suburbs where there is not much noise and pollution from traffic. It is one of the top most diverse university in the country, boasting students from nooks and crannies of the world. It has a great academic program along with helpful teachers for any questions a student may have. The food is different everyday, providing a wide range of nutrition for students with vegan and even gluten-free options. Overall, it is a great place to go to, though it is not much of a party scene unless you're looking for it."
Freshman,5,To me Andrews  has a very beautiful campus with a wide variety of trees on campus. The professors here are all very good teachers and are excellent teachers.
Niche User,5,"This school created for the glory of God.
 I want this school can be:
1. Improving their Spritual
2. Showing about Jesus lived
3. Finding soul for Jesus"
Niche User,5,"The environment is great, it is relaxing and focused, they care about their students. the administration follows up with each and every student."
Junior,5,"Overall, the classes are small enough so that your professors know who you are.  They also go the extra mile to help you inside and outside of class.  Even faculty who aren't your teachers or advisors or even in your department.  They  really care.  There are lots of different majors, so they also have lots of different study tours, mission trips and social events.  There are lots of opportunities to develop morally, and exposure to topics of gender, race, and society.  The cafeteria is much improved, in both food and setting.  The grounds are actually an arboretum. It feels like you are in a garden during the spring.  Despite challenges that arrive, the administration takes time to listen to the students needs and wants.  The administration takes time to walk with and among the students."
Sophomore,5,Andrews University is a great university and I've had an amazing experience so far. Apart from it being a bit on the expensive side I would recommend obtaining a degree there.
Freshman,5,"Andrews is a great colleges to attend if you are looking for a small community where you want to make friendly relationship with others. The school is so diverse, and the students are open and welcome everyone to join them. It is a very safe place too. I've never witnessed any serious crimes in the area. Also everyone is welcome to join sabbath school at PMC every Saturday!"
Freshman,5,"I have only been to Andrews for a year so far and I absolutely love it here! I have not visited many other colleges before so I am not going to say that this is the best one, however I am going to say that it is a great school. The atmosphere is nice, the campus is beautiful, and there are many things to do on campus. The facilities are all very nice, modern, and clean, and there is almost always something to do on campus. I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. 
Another thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most. I have many friends from the united states, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya, China, Russia and many other people. This school is absolutely great!"
College Sophomore,5,The professors seem to really care about the students grades.
College Sophomore,5,This school has a very good graduate program of the degree in which I am intending.
College Sophomore,5,I really like the dorm settings it is very comfy and has a lot of study space.
College Freshman,5,"So far I haven't seen any drugs or alcohol activity taking place in the campus. Peer pressure, not so much because I'm over the age."
College Freshman,5,"The classroom sizes are small making it easier for professors to intact with students. All my professors knows the name of each student in the class. Plus when we don't understand something, my professor are willing to explain the topic plenty  of times until each students gets it."
College Freshman,5,"As a first-timer living in the dorm. It's a Awesome experience. It's like I'm basically living back home with my parents. My roommate is awesome. She make me feel real comfortable. Also the dorms are spacious, and the environment it self is very peaceful. I LOVE IT ! !"
College Freshman,5,"As a transfer student coming from NYC, Andrews is the best school that I have ever attended in my life. Not only it's a Christian base school but it keeps it's affirmation on how it will help students become better people with careers in today's world. As a pre- nursing student, once I graduate with the degree of nursing, I will be able to find a job because they will help me do internships, while I'm in the program. Basically I won't have difficulty finding a job as a result from this. Another awesome aspect about this school is the atmosphere, it's very spacious peaceful. It's like I'm in a another world. In addition the students, staff, and facility are very friendly. The classroom are small meaning the professors know all the names of the students, as a result it will help the students success."
College Senior,5,"Students came to Andrews University from all over the globe and they are made to feel welcome and are encouraged to get involved from the start. Planning support for newcomers to campus is a big deal at Andrews and is a big part of why so many of our students graduate. 

Because there is a graduate school, many students are older and arrive with their families and many challenges to overcome in the rush to get settled before classes begin. They receive anything along the spectrum of ""directions to resources all the way to vouchers for bed linen, pots and pans""."
College Student,5,My school is know for its diversity. Although it is an Adventist institution there are people for varying religious beliefs. People are generally accepting of everyone regardless of their background.
College Sophomore,5,"Good Professors, moderate class sizes, well planned courses"
Recent Alumnus,5,Probably the safest place on earth. But they don't emphasize sexual assault prevention which should be exercised.
College Senior,5,Lots of campus outreach and job networking opportunities
College Junior,5,"I can only complain about one professor in my three years of attendance. All the professors know what they are talking about, are very personal, and care about their students. Class sizes are usually kept pretty small besides the religion classes that everyone must take. The courses are very diverse and usually look at many different viewpoints and the professors care about your opinion and your personal view. Courses are graded fairly and help is always available to those who want it."
College Sophomore,5,This school's top quality and claim to fame is its diversity!
College Sophomore,5,"Curriculum is pretty top quality. Rigorous workload really drives you to be a hardworking, studious person."
College Sophomore,5,"Course quality is great, overall Professors are very knowledgeable and willing to help. Some are foreign and extremely hard to understand, which can be a barrier sometimes."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at Andrews university is the best so far the people are so friendly. my favorite moment are the banquet and many other things they have going on, one campus. I would not choose school again because that the best school I find and I will stick with it."
College Senior,5,"This school is crazy ethnically/culturally diverse, which means its full of beautiful people, variants of style, and open minds."
College Senior,5,"The J. N. Andrews Honors program is probably the best thing that's happened to me academically. Anyone who goes through this school and opts for the General Education requirements dramatically misses out. I'm sure the GE Program is good too; it's just . . . the Honors Program is awesome.

Also, the Leadership Program. These are both excellent, excellent things at Andrews."
College Junior,5,good people in a christian environment with the good education at hand
College Junior,5,"My undergraduate programs don't have admission criteria; if you are taking the classes and sign up for a physics major, then you're in."
College Junior,5,The Clinical and Mental Health program of study is a great program that is preparing clinician to be effective agent of change in the counseling profession.
College Junior,5,"I don't personally take advantage since I only live 2 hours away, but I know we have a lot of foreign exchange students. Student Association does an amazing job getting students to airports/buses etc. when needed. "
College Freshman,5,This school is ranked one of the most diverse universities in the country. 
College Freshman,5,I have not heard anything about people doing drugs or alcohol. 
Recent Alumnus,5,People from all over the world attend Andrews University
College Sophomore,5,There is a great number of area attractions and activities to do close by whether if you love shopping or you love to hang out in nature. The safety of the town is also pretty safe. Many of the locals who live there also have a friendly attitude to everyone.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Andrews isn't really known for drug or drinking. Maybe the students are better at hiding it, but in all its not a big thing here."
College Sophomore,5,"Most people have their own computer, but there is easy access on campus to computers and printers"
College Sophomore,5,If drugs are used on campus it's used secretly because it is highly frowned upon and not tolerated.
College Sophomore,5,All the rules make sense to me. I understand why they are there. Maybe better parking rules
College Senior,5,"The diversity at my university the best around, I feel. There are students from every country it seems, it is great to learn so much about other cultures and languages at my university."
College Senior,5,"There are so many international students. It's very good that there is so much ethnic diversity. People from all around the world, and in that comes the economic, religious, and political diversity"
College Freshman,5,Not very publicized at all. Don't hear about it unless you look for it!
College Student,5,Its Snows alot during winter here in Berrien Springs but the school does not have snow days hence we have to walk in the cold for most of spring.
College Student,5,"I am in an strict Christian University and the only drug used is caffeine, this mainly done by students who want to do cross-night reading."
College Sophomore,5,"As of 2010, U.S. News & World Report ranks Andrews University as tied for being the fifth most racially diverse National University"
College Senior,5,School computers are great. Students have the option of using PCs or using Apple desktops in several of the Mac labs. The dormitories have their own labs as well.
Recent Alumnus,5,The drug scene at my school is probably almost non-existent. I have never witnessed anyone taking drugs on campus. I believe that if there are students that do take drugs they would go off campus because it would be difficult to do so here without being noticed.
College Senior,5,There are people from many diverse backgrounds and so it is easy for students to feel welcome and are able to relate to other students.
College Senior,5,It is very easy to find a parking space.  There are also security cameras so the premises are very safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,"There is easy access to computers on campus, even the library has many computers available for students. So even if someone does not have a computer of their own, they should be fine."
Recent Alumnus,5,The biggest sports on campus is Basketball. I've heard that our team is amongst the top in terms of private universities competitions.
College Freshman,5,"I did apply for financial aid but based on the responses given by other students, I'd say they have an excellent system set up to deal with issuing  financial aid. It's fast and reliable."
College Freshman,5,There are several sporting activities that one can get involved in during their time at Andrews University. Every student is urged to take part in at least one athletic activity and all the necessary facilities are provided for this. Everyone is highly enthused when it comes on to supporting the school's teams in what ever athletic competition that we are involved in  and so there is a great fan support and the school spirit is extremely high surrounding any level of athleticism.
Graduate Student,4,"I will be going to Andrews University this August for their DPT program. Therefore, I cannot say anything about their learning experience because I have no experienced it yet. But for my college that I attended which is Oakwood University, the online learning experience was not bad. Teachers were accessible and I understood everything clearly"
Senior,4,"Andrews University was a wonderful school to attend. They had many great programs, kind students, and helpful teachers. The cafeteria was always stocked with farm to table plant-based foods. The vegetarian and vegan options were endless. The campus was beautiful and well kept as well as safe. They have many majors for both undergrad and graduate school which makes transferring easy. If religion is important to you than you'll have access to many different styles of worship opportunities as well. Overall, I'd recommend the university."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed Andrews because it gave me a different experience than i had before. Most of the professors are willing to help give you inspiration to do better.
Freshman,4,"I have absolutely loved my experience at Andrews so far.
It might be because my high school experience was not too great but, compared to how much they fund for your education and how much you can get out from this school - it's simply amazing and a grateful experience for me. 

Many people find the cold weather and ""barren"" (Berrien springs so its barren.. you get it? hehe) environment, and I agree! But I love winter so cold weather was fine. Not having enough places to go to around campus is a problem, and you probably need a car for transportation. 

But that was the only ""problem"" I had while going to this school.
Oh, and if you live in Lamson (girls dorm), you might hate the dorm since the rooms are so small and old, but so far, I love it because the dorm LIFE is good!

So if you are planning to come here, I hope you can also have a great experience too XD (DoN't expect party tho since that ain't gon happen here)"
Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience so far. Not only am I being challenged academically, my spiritual life is also being challenged and balanced. This a school that's teaching me to balance my life in a way that brings happiness by collaborating and letting myself being lead by my creator ( God )."
Senior,4,I like that it's easy to connect to professors and that there is a friendly environment. I wish they were a bit more open minded in some areas.
Alum,4,There is a sense of community at Andrews University. The faculty ratio to students provide a close knit and I had a good experience. Love the diversity on the campus and academics. The University is located in a small town but its close by other cities.
Alum,4,"It was an uplifting spiritual experience. Professors are dedicated to teaching students and the small class numbers help make more time for the professors to spend time with students. The campus is really pretty and well maintained. There is no party scene as it is a religious institution however, student life puts on many fun events."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Andrews University has been enjoyable. This school represents everything I stand for when it comes to my religion and it is very diverse. Being at Andrews University has shown me what kind of person I want to be. I have made many friends and learned about a lot of things I didn't know before. Being at Andrews University, I have realized that I am a very independent person who can stand being away from home. I have been able to explore myself at this school and grow as an individual."
Graduate Student,4,The environment of the campus is great. I love the calmness of my surrounding. I also love how diverse the campus is with the different cultures present. What can change is to have more of a guidance of students (mentoring)
Sophomore,4,"Andrews University is full of the students from all around the world. I can communicate with other friends from all over the world and learn about diversity. Also because of the religion, everyone is so kind and nice. The professors are so passionate and everyone do their best in doing their duties."
Junior,4,"A perk of going to Andrews is that it’s a small university, making your relationships with both your peers and professors more personal ones.
Professors are knowledgeable, excel in their field, and genuinely want to see you do well and are willing to go the extra mile to help you in whatever way possible.
Berrien Springs definitely isn’t an ideal location, especially if you don’t have a car, but the campus is beautiful. Food is good for a while until you get sick of it and want options other than gazebo or cafeteria fare.  
Andrews University is proud of its’ diverse student body. There are several clubs devoted to learning about other cultures, and several opportunities for students to showcase their cultures such as the international food fair that comes around every year.
tl;dr: Andrews may be small and far removed from actual civilization, but it has heart."
Alum,4,"Small class sizes, personal attention, delicious and amazing food in the cafe and gazebo.  Good scheduling good professors"
Senior,4,"Hated the snow, love the people. The most diverse school in America. Great art program for photography and film. Very close to Chicago which is nice. Wish we had more restaurants to choose from though."
Niche User,4,"Their Academic performance is Excellent, they care for students, foreign students like to go there because they feel there as home.
Their dorms and housings are safe and secure Andrews University is a Christian institution so they train their students how to serve God and mankind not only the academic but them to live an ethical life."
Alum,4,What I liked about Andrews University was how small the student body was. This allowed me to be able to get to know my peers a lot easier as well as allowing students to really be able to connect with their professors/staff at Andrews.
Sophomore,4,I liked how the professors pray for you if you have prayer requests and how the learning environment has a Christain worldview.
Graduate Student,4,"Being a student at andrews is a great experience overall. I love that there's so much diversity and many of the professors really care and are very invested in the success of their students. As a private university, education a Andrews is costly and I will say that in my experience getting financial assistance is difficult. But as an international student I have to say that the international student department has always been extremely helpful in everything they can. 
Classes depend on the professor but are mostly great. The environment is awesome and there's a great spiritual athmosohere."
Senior,4,"Andrews University is a predominantly Seventh-Day Adventist institution; it has a large emphasis on spiritual growth, though certainly in concert with academic growth. The professors teach a variety of viewpoints alongside critical thinking skills; they do not tell you what to believe, but let you decide it for yourself. Definitely go through the Honors program! It's amazing."
Sophomore,4,"Excellent staff, student body is decent, and beautiful campus. Like any college Andrews isn't perfect. Andrews expects A LOT from their students, and by a lot I mean excellence if not perfection. It's incredibly stressful and stress level varies depending on degree choice, of course. I could go on for pages on what Andrews needs work on (campus safety is major factor that needs work), but I'll cut short with saying, from my experience, the positives still outweigh the negative."
College Senior,4,"In my experience, Andrews University is a great place to study. However, I must mention that each person's experience is different depending on the department. The Speech-Language Pathology department is filled with great professors who have worked really hard to grow the department and to support their students in every possible way."
College Junior,4,I've never felt threatened on campus and personally feel like the safety services do an adequate job.
College Junior,4,"For the most part, it's a clean environment and everything is closely spaced together-- dorms, food, classes, etc."
College Junior,4,I find that there are plenty of people involved in the sports of this school as well as many people who support our teams.
College Junior,4,"My experience at this school so far has been great. The teachers and staff genuinely care about the students, the courses are very informative, you have plenty of opportunities to travel and try new things, and not to mention it is one of the most diverse schools around."
College Freshman,4,"Another thing that I love about this school is that it's multicultural, and we are in the same faith."
College Freshman,4,"When I first came in the campus I was scared especially at night, but there was some students that was taking nigh walk and they was real friendly. As a result we are good friends"
College Freshman,4,Everybody gets along. We have won many championships. Before we start any game we pray.
College Senior,4,"Athletics are not that  big here; for example, there are no athletic scholarships. However, students do play on teams and engage other schools/colleges in friendly matches. The school spirit is high and many students attend to support their team.

Physical fitness is promoted as part of one's responsibility as a human being; we are to treat our bodies as temples by not putting into them anything that is harmful, while keeping one's body in good shape so that God may be glorified."
College Sophomore,4,The class size is great and it allows the professors to focus more on students
College Sophomore,4,The career center is very helpful in answering any questions I may have
College Sophomore,4,"I always feel secure, and I can go and walk outside without fear"
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are very nice and spacious and are always maintianed well cleaned
College Sophomore,4,The school has a great team and all the players are dedicated to their sport
College Sophomore,4,Very nice campus and it has given me the opportunity to connect with God
College Student,4,The professors are very nice. Some give more work than others but all are willing to help you. They are friendly and my the information interesting. The classes are huge so that means the teacher is more available to help students.
College Student,4,I am often walking around campus alone and I do not fell like I need to keep a sharp eye out for suspicious activity. You can call campus safety if you feel unsafe. People do not generally steal things. I have left my laptop places and when I return it is still there.
College Freshman,4,I have no issues walking around on campus. I never feel skeptical of my physical safety.
College Sophomore,4,"Health is one of the utmost importance here. Open campus in the middle of nowhere, campus safety exists and cops come and go frequently."
College Sophomore,4,"personally, only negative is ventilation"
College Sophomore,4,Emphasis on Spiritual life and service; very diverse body of students; variety of great food at the cafeteria and beautiful campus
College Freshman,4,"Andrews University was an excellent choice for me. The class sizes are small and the instructors know each and every student. There is also a great diversity of cultures which make it interesting and provides an additional learning experience. I have always had great interactions with all of the employees as well. The academic advisors and financial advisors are willing to go out of their way to help you. Furthermore, because it is a religious university there is a feeling of peace and security,"
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the opportunity I have here at my school and the diversity.
College Senior,4,Very safe community eventhough the campus is kind of open and accessible. Campus safety always a phone call away
College Senior,4,"Damazo is great, Lamson is okay (Lobby looks better than most of the rooms)"
College Senior,4,"They treat you like adults, I don't like the eeriness of the library though but the labs are excellent"
College Freshman,4,If you are walking accross campus at night and want someone to escort you to needed destination you can always call campus saftey. They are very good at keeping check on whats going on around campus.
College Freshman,4,Like any school it has its ups and downs but the administration does their best to not only listen to what is needed and wanted on campus but to actually set a plain in motion to address the issues.
College Junior,4,"The town our school resides in has had some crime that has come to my attention but Andrews usually takes measures to ensure the safety of their students. Sexual assult is probably not that common because the dorms are not co-ed and under no circumstances are there to be a person of the opposite gender in your room or even areas outside the lobbies. Campus safety is just a phone call away and they have people roaming around campus to make sure everything is fine and running smoothly which is comforting. I do feel safe on my campus and our school goes the extra mile to make sure we all are safe taking initiative to have fire drills, and lock down drills as well. Campus safety is always prompt and always answers and they do have cameras all around campus."
College Junior,4,"Andrews University is unique to say in the least. Our school is Christian and there are many tedious rules that you must follow in order to attend, such as curfew, worships, codes of conduct, dress codes, and they expect certain behaviors from their students. Most find these expectations to be arduous, and while they can be at times I would never change my undergraduate experience at Andrews. The best experience I have had with the school is how much my teachers care. Being a private school there are only about 3,000 individuals who attend, which keeps class sizes really small. The teachers tend to be very personal and you can tell early on that they really care about your success. They are usually quick to respond to emails, meet with you should you need it, and call you back. It is really nice to have people who care so much about you and pray for you, as college can be a struggle at times. My experience at Andrews University has been one worth while for sure."
College Student,4,I enjoy the many activities that are put on by the school which allows me to get to know more people. These activities really bring the school together.
College Sophomore,4,It's kept pretty low. You will always be able to find drugs on any campus. But here it is kept pretty quiet
College Sophomore,4,"There are always going to be bad people wherever you go, there are plenty of drug abusers and bad influences here, but they are very discreet. Very under the radar"
College Sophomore,4,They definitely give you plenty of opportunities for jobs and internships within the church and some local businesses
College Junior,4,A degree from this school prepares graduates fro life. They come to get not just and education but also knowledge. From that each are ready to challenge the world and be missionaries for change.
College Junior,4,I love andrews. I know what i want from them and they are capable of providing.
College Junior,4,The school is very diverse and it also strives to engage students in Christ-like mission to change the world.
College Sophomore,4,"The weather can be extremely cold, but the people are great... You just have to find the right ones."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the school that I picked because it has a great business program. The professors are helpful and considerate of the students, yet they also strive for them to do their best. The other students on campus are fun, friendly, and eager to learn as well. It is also extremely diverse, and is in the top five schools with the most diversity."
College Freshman,4,I appreciate the helpful teachers and Staff and am enjoying the overall environment.
Freshman,2,"Andrews University is the flagship university for the Seventh Day Adventist Church, according to most sources. Therefore, it is automatically implied that there is a heavy emphasis on adherence to the fundamental beliefs of the SDA Church. This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you wish to establish your career in the church. The Christian bias is evident at this university, and although they accept people of any background, it is rather uncomfortable for those people to make themselves at home. In terms of education, the student body here can be described as more spiritually rather than academically inclined."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unless you plan to network within the Adventist system, it's not easy to find a job"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Treat you like kids and the deans,student deans, and resident advisors are annoying"
College Junior,2,"While the people in Lamson Hall are great the dorm itself could definitely use some work. The rooms are very tiny and in my three years there, two of them I had to deal with mold in my room. There have also been cases of bugs in my room which is understandable because the building is quite old. It is also very expensive to live in the dorm adding up to about $8,000 per year including the set meal plan you are unable to change. Unfortunately students are not allowed to move off campus by themselves or with a non-relative roomate until the age of 22 unless Student Life approves."
College Junior,2,"Soccer, Basketball, the rest of the sports are just mediocre while the Office of Student Activities and Involvement tries their best to revive and engage students in various sport codes."
College Junior,2,Too much necessary rules such as students need to be at least 22 to live off campus
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really a lot of partying that goes on.
College Freshman,2,"There's only a few parties at people's houses off-campus, and they're pretty small. If you're not invited, you don't go."
College Junior,2,"There, um, aren't any parties. That can be a good thing, if you prefer the perk of not being kept up by you neighbors drunk parties all the time to the perk of not being able to get drunk at parties."
College Junior,2,"There's really only fast food in town. To find anything else, it's a minimum 10-mile drive."
College Junior,2,"You might qualify for financial aid, but you'll probably have to send a dozen angry emails to the financial department before you see it."
College Junior,2,Our sporting events are not supported by the students and the Athletes are not highlighted.
College Junior,2,Our Campus security is in a terrible state and is in need of major help.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much as far as transportation in this small town.
College Sophomore,2,"The tuition here is terrible and although there are a few academic scholarships, there isn't much else help."
College Sophomore,2,"Extremely remote and nothing to do, I'm glad I don't live on campus or near here at all. I drive every day."
College Junior,2,we are in a rural area so if you do not have a car youre pretty much on campus unless you want to pay for school transportation
College Junior,2,Its just annoying having to account for where you are when not in the dorm
College Junior,2,"We recently had a police canine in the dorms searching everyone's rooms. There are parties happening almost every weekend and if not, we are driving an hour away to find a party or a bar. Every student attending Andrews had to sign a form saying we would abstain from drugs, alcohol, tobacco, etc. yea right. I do know plenty of students who don't partake in the party scene though. I would say the school is split 50/50."
College Junior,2,"The girl's dorm (Lamson Hall) is so old! My grandma (60+) and my boyfriends grandma (80+) both lived IN THE SAME DORM I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING IN!!! Tell me that's not outdated. The process took some time but that my fault. The deans and R.A.'s plan a lot of fun, random activities and ""bonding"" opportunities."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really a night-life. There is a curfew and it's against the rules to drink and stuff.
College Freshman,2,The town by the university is very small and the only thing there really are a few small restaurants.  There is a bigger city about 25 minutes away and Chicago is about 2 hours away.  There are some nice beaches fairly close by.
College Freshman,2,"I have a car, but i'm still unaware of any campus provided transportation.  
"
College Freshman,2,The main parking lots fill up by 10 a.m. and after that it gets really hard to find a parking spot. 
College Sophomore,2,The library and most offices are closed from friday at sunset to Saturday. This is their Sabbath
College Senior,2,"Make sure you get all your financial aid sorted BEFORE you arrive on campus (as much as possible). It's such a hassle to get cleared, so try to find outside funds as much as you can! Oh, and be nice to your financial advisor - you'll need their help for the next 4 years!"
College Junior,2,"Limited options, mostly fast-food such as McDonalds, Taco Bell, Subway."
College Senior,2,The public transportation is very limited but everything that you need is within walking distance for the most part.
College Student,2,Snows a lot and is quite cloudy. I think it contrributes to some depression.
College Sophomore,2,If have not heard of many internship opportunities. I think they are far and few between.
College Freshman,2,"There's not really much around. To get off-campus dining options you could order, walk or fine a ride to go there."
College Senior,2,"Not many options, and generally need a car to get there.  Subway, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Mcdonalds, and some small sit-down restaurants.  More options 15-30 min drive away."
College Senior,2,"The campus is vegetarian, and has some good options but is often disappointing.  Pastas are often good.  The dining hall has a required meal plan of around $1,600 per semester which won't last you if you eat there for two meals a day without reloading or will be wasted if you average one meal a day since they will only refund $200.  This can also be spent at the gazebo, which makes things like smoothies and sandwiches and sells snacks throughout the day.  These can be good but can take a while to get in and out.
Not many food options in town - subway, mcdonalds, pizza hut, taco bell, a few small restaurants; none really within walking distance."
College Senior,2,"Parking is beginning to become inadequate for the volume of use, but it is easy enough to get by on campus without a car or by parking it once for the day and walking for the rest.  It's hard to get a spot where your classes are if you're a commuter."
College Junior,2,Scholarships information is not volunteered to students. If you don't ask they will not tell. As the financial services as much questions you can think of otherwise you may miss some important information.
College Junior,2,"There is not enough parking for the number of students who drive to classes. Even if you are early you might have to park far from your class, so be prepare to walk."
College Junior,2,"Parking is usually available, but the campus security fine for everything. They're so anal about it. You could be parked for maybe a few hours visiting a friend, and most likely you'll get fined for not having a visitor's permit, which is like 50 dollars for a day I believe?"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Main Focus – This school has sporting and athletic opportunities but is not into external competition
College Sophomore,2,"Differnt Dorms Different Quality – The Undergraduate girls dorm at AU (Lamson Hall) needs a lot of updating but it is livable, however the girls graduate dorm (Damazo Hall) is incredible because it is brand new. Meijer Hall, the undergraduate boys dorm is a nice dorm while the men's graduate dorm (Burman Hall) needs updating."
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing such as the apartments look like they need a little updating, but do seem to be a safe place for older students/graduate students"
Senior,1,I did not take any online courses at this time so I'm unable to offer any input. I had a few friends take online courses who found the process painless and convenient. I believe during Covid 19 the programs are mainly online at this time to keep the students safe.
Junior,1,"Awful experience. Unprofessional staff and completely unreasonable and unresponsible teachers. I wish that the spirituality of this college was at least kept up like southern and other adventist colleges that I visited. My conclusion of this place is that it is completely dissapointing to how one of our adventist institutions have fallen so far down a ditch where both spirituality and academics are poop. I hope that they read this and understand that this is coming from a place of love and respect for past leaderships, and would hope that change would occur."
Alum,1,"What a disaster of a college.  Deluded faculty teaching severely deluded students.  Good luck getting a job with that AU degree.  And get used to hearing the rest of your life (i.e., when you tell people you went to AU):  ""Never heard of it.""  Don't get near this place - or the Adventist church!"
Sophomore,1,Basically save your money!!!! This school is not worth it at all unless you want to do theology. Berrien Springs is the worst possible place to live. It is super cold in the winter and there is never anything to do.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have fraternities and sororities in our school.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek life. We are a fraternity/ssorority free campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Very few ""parties"" and they're either really dull or they are just set up for snitches to identify to administration all the ""bad students"".  This can be good if you want to focus on studying or bad if you just want to have fun and mess around. Don't come here if you want parties."
College Sophomore,1,"Very few ""parties"" and they're either really dull or they are just set up for people to rat out to administration anyone doing drugs. This can be good if you want to focus on studying or bad if you want to mess around. I personally didn't care because I don't party."
College Junior,1,Oh my god everything is regulated and it sucks.
College Sophomore,1,It is extremely strict. An example of that is you have to go to a certain amount of worships a semester or else you get put on probation.
College Sophomore,1,"""Campus safety"" is what we call the department on campus that is supposed to keep us safe. Just last month we had three muggings in one night and campus safety failed to notify people about it. Also we don't have a health center on campus."
College Junior,1,None. It is a private university and that stuff isn't relevant to our education.
College Junior,1,"Besides a few Ma and Pa restaurants, it's just a McDonalds and a Taco Bell. "
College Junior,1,"Literally out in the middle of no where. We have a McDonalds and a Taco Bell. Closest mall, and civilization really, is like 45 minutes away. "
College Sophomore,1,It's so cold in the winter! I have a coat that goes down to my ankles and I still feel cold sometimes.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at this school.
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking lot is always full around 9am. Parking your car and entering the the school takes far longer than going to a class on the other side of the building. It would literally take you around 10 minutes to get to class from the parking lot.
College Sophomore,1,"There is basically no public transportation at my school. If you want to get somewhere, you have to borrow a car or go with a friend which doesn't always work out."
College Sophomore,1,"My school pretty much outlaws everything. Including, but not limited to, drinking, smoking, sex, and any other drugs. That all seems pretty normal but then on top of that you have to attend all your classes (as if it's high school) and if you don't they'll fail you. My school treats us like children. If you want to stay out of the dorm, you have to get your parent's permission. Curfew is at 11:00 every night for the dorm. And you have to go to a certain amount of chapels and church services every semester or you get fined. There is even a rule in the rulebook that you can't wear jewelry. Thankfully they don't reinforce that, but there are plenty that they do enforce."
College Senior,1,Hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter
College Junior,1,"I've lived in Berrien Springs the majority of my life & never have I felt so isolated while living in the dorms. I've only lived there for one year & it is a pain. The one thing that bothers me the most is the sanitation of the public bathrooms. They never look/feel/smell clean & it's disgusting. You also HAVE to live in the dorms if your immediate family doesn't live close to town. I tried to live with my mother's cousin & they refused. It seems like Andrews just wants your money. This shows especially well with the financial clearance process. It takes a while for advisors to get back to you & tell you every detail you're entitled to. You literally have to juice them for information which is rather annoying. It also goes for the food services. Everything is MAJORLY overpriced, especially in the Gazebo. Andrews is supposed to be a non-profit organization, there is no need for the absurd $3 granola bars you can get at Wal-Mart for 99 cents. All that aside, there are great programs at AU. I'm in the Visual Arts program & most of the teachers show apparent care & willingness to further your career opportunities."
College Junior,1,"What nightlife? It's non existent. Curfew is required, and living on campus is too."
College Senior,1,"The financial aid process is such a headache for so many people, definitely including myself. There were so many times they were completely wrong or messed something up, but they don't admit, and when they do accept their mistake, they pretend like it didn't matter. Never pick up the phone or answer emails (called at different times within their hours several times a day throughout the week). It definitely has improved, hence the D. I'd have given this something lower than an F- if it hadn't."
College Junior,1,"Not much variety, not very good tasting and not particularly healthy."
College Junior,1,No public transportation. If you do not have a car you are going nowhere!
College Student,1,Its very hard to find spaces and the security has too much time on their hands so they give tickets to everyone they find.
College Senior,1,"The administration is very strict when it comes to having premarital sex.  If a student is found out they will be expelled.  If a person of the other gender is found in locations that they are not suppose to be, the first offense would warrant suspension, but another offense may lead to expulsion."
College Senior,1,"Women's dorm is old, small, inefficient and somewhat unsanitary.  Not at all what you would expect for the price or from a University.  Walking distance to classes is favorable."
College Senior,1,"We call my campus "" Siberia"" because we swear the weather is just as ridiculous as russia. Oh, and the best part.....classes never..ever cancel. I am a senior and the school closed twice( one the school closed willing and the other time they were fined for not closing). If you let the weather get to you, you will get depressed but most students go drifting in the snow, skiing, slidding and snow mobling."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is nothing to do in Berrien Springs, you have to travel at least 40 mins."
College Junior,1,"Dorm situations plain suck. There are two men's dorms and two women's dorms. However, one of the women's dorms, which is the newest one, is limited to people over the age of 22, so pretty much all the undergrad females have to live in one dorm. All the dorms besides the newest women's dorm are terrible. Apparently I came in right after renovations were made. I can't imagine how bad it must have been if these were the ""improved"" rooms. They renovated the bathrooms, sink, and put in new furniture. For the building i'm in, which houses a few hundred people, there are only 6 washing machines and 6 dryers, and they CONSTANTLY break and eat your money. Getting a refund is a hassle. I've lost close to $20 worth of quarters, and they wouldn't reimburse me. The dumbest thing is that females are not allowed in the male dorms and vice versa or pretty much expulsion. The deans are not very helpful. They're useless. I've only lived in one building, but I've been to the other buildings, and they're way worse, especially the girl's dorm."
College Junior,1,"The only sport that gets any real support is the basketball team, which is RELATIVELY good, but it is still USCAA division II, so it doesn't impress me."
College Junior,1,"Nowhere to Eat – You have to go to either Benton Harbor or South Bend to find food that isn't McDonalds, Taco Bell, or Subway. The only reason I didn't give an F is because of Baguette de France. It is the saving grace of the little village."
College Senior,1,Sooo Damn Strict – The cops are insecure ass****s who dont know s*** about what they are doin. They be tearing down the place lookin for weed from a rumor and then they dont even say sorry when they dont find none.
College Senior,1,"This school exists to indoctrinate you in Adventist beliefs, not to help you get a real job or go to a real graduate school. The funny thing is, the professors can't even agree on what the beliefs are so you get a load of conflicting crap."
College Senior,1,"Aid the First Year, Then You're on Your Own – The school will give you aid, call it ""guaranteed"" but if you don't keep a 3.8 GPA, you will lose all your aid sophomore year. They use the aid to entice you to come to your school, but unless you're in the three percent of campus with a 3.8 or higher, you won't get s*** your second year."
College Senior,1,"Same Thing Over and Over – The food itself isn't awful or anything, but after about a week, you will be sick of eating the same subpar food over and over and over... Also, the cafeteria isn't that nice."
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the facilities are very old and outdated. Some, such as the Howard Performing Arts Center, however, have recently been renovated making them very nice. All of the facilities are, however, inferior to that of nearby schools and similarly ranked schools."
College Sophomore,1,"Not an Academic School – This school is an Adventist school. The professors are here because of their commitment to the Adventist Church and its theology, not because of their expertise."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Strict for Your Own Good. This school really cares about it's students because they want everyone to be accounted for every night. There is a curfew for every undergraduate student that varies in years. Dorms are not co-ed. No drinking, smoking, sex, foul language allowed. Basically anything bad is unacceptable in the school."

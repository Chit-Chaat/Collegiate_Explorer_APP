Sophomore,5,"Great community, everyone treats you with kindness and the school provides you with the tools needed in order to succeed."
Sophomore,5,Professors treated me with much care and made sure I succeeded in a different environment and provided me with the support I needed. They’ll go out of their way to ensure all their students are doing their best emotionally and academically
Junior,5,"Large variety of things to get involved in (student life). The Campus Activities Board (CAB) creates opportunities for students to get off campus with things like Broadway trips, sky diving, movies, etc. if you say you’re bored at Lycoming, you’re not doing enough to be involved."
Junior,5,"Lycoming college is at the heart of Wiliamsport, PA. For those who do not like big cities, this city has more of a small town feeling. The campus itself feels like it isnt located in the center of a city duento its corporation of wildlife and nature. The staff are friendly, and become part of your family. The class sizes are small. The academics are excellent, and offer a wide range of opportunities, internshops, and study abroad options. The sports teams are excellent, and have a wide range of availability. The clubs are vast, and the college is always making room for more clubs to be added. The camous is very accepting of all views. The student population is very diverse. Overall, coming to lycoming, and being away from home for the first time, i have found a new home and lifelong friends."
Senior,5,"Lycoming College is amazing! I am so sad to be leaving shortly, especially with the new Gateway Building coming to completion this summer. There are big changes in store for this campus to help Lycoming become even greater. The professors are top notch and want to make connections with the students both inside and outside of the classroom."
Niche User,5,Lycoming is a small liberal arts college in Williamsport PA. The atmosphere is very community centered and welcoming. The school is like a family. The students know each other pretty well and are very friendly!
Niche User,5,"I visited the campus and it is amazing! I know a few students but theyre pretty tame. We walked around, enjoyed the scenery. But, my favorite, most memorable moment of the visits was sitting in a class and acting like a student. Great experience overall!"
Freshman,5,I am planning to attend Lycoming College this coming fall. I personally think that it is one of the best schools you can attend. Hopefully others will too.
Sophomore,5,"The school is small so class sizes are not overwhelming. Also, it allows the professors to personally connect with their students, which can be very beneficial for students in the future for things such as recommendations for gradate school, internships, or even jobs."
Alum,5,"So underrated! Within the past 4 years this college has changed drastically--and for the better! I'm so impressed by the resources that are now available, especially for internships, study abroad and career services. Lycoming has a history of getting the best professors. They are experts, published, and are willing to go out of their way to help you succeed if you have the drive; some will even invite you to their house for dinner! Like many have said, it's like a family. I couldn't be happier with my choice!"
Freshman,5,The environment felt very welcoming and I quickly connected with the people I met. The students are staff were so kind and had a great energy about them. (The creative writing professor gave a vintage copy of one of my favorite books and I was so honored.) The clubs offered are wonderful and create a safe zone for people from all walks of life. I can't wait to go there in August!
Sophomore,5,Lycoming College is an amazing college that makes you feel like you are apart of a family.  The staff at this school really works with you to ensure that you are specializing in a subject that you truly enjoy.  They also have tons of opportunities for students to receive scholarships and grants.  It really is an amazing school.
Niche User,5,"I went to Lycoming College for a visit and it was great. The students are very welcoming, the professors are very helpful and the campus is clean and safe."
Freshman,5,"My favorite part of my time at Lycoming College is all of the opportunities that are available to me. The size of the school and the teacher: Student ratio makes it easy for me to connect, network, and seek help from my professors and staff. The only aspect I would change is their selection process. I truly believe if they had higher standards and were more selective with applicants, this school will be more popular and respected."
Niche User,5,"Lycoming College is a very good school, went there for PFEW and plan on going there for college, The campus is nice and the dorms, may be cramped, still livable. Can't wait to come to Lycoming this fall."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman, and I commute to school. The college is very close to home, and commuting saves a  considerable amount of money. Although a pricey school, I am able to attend due to a sizeable academic scholarship that the college offered me. Although a very safe campus, I would feel safer if the security guards were armed."
Senior,5,"Classes are tough, professors sometimes curve your grades down, all-in-all this college really gives you a taste of life. You are expected to be involved to go above and beyond what you thought you were capable and are demanded more of. This allows someone to branch out and learn about topics you never thought you would cross. The Fraternity and Sorority Life community is very involved. Alpha Xi Delta is one of the sororities, is the most involved, has the most genuine women in it."
Senior,5,"I love being at Lycoming College it is my home away from home. The community members are so nice here in the mountains. The people talk to you, get to know you, invite you to their homes, introduce themselves, willing to help you, and the community gets together to do holiday traditions. The College offers a lot of opportunities to those who live out of state and country. There are plenty of activities for students to do. If students need help in their classes the professors are willing to take time out of their busy schedules and help them. I don't know where I'd be if I hadn't chose Lycoming College. It offers so much and I'm glad to call it my home."
Senior,5,Lycoming college is a very good school. Its a small school so the classes are generally smaller which allows you to connect with professors easily.
Freshman,5,"I like the 'family' feel that the campus gives off, it's like you're at your home away from home. Besides that the professors and other faculty members care for you as if you're their own and the campus matches the beautiful personalities of the people that attend and work on campus. Honestly, it's a place filled with love, and of course, studious busy bodies that are always first up in caring and helping with communities. Lyco is a home, that prepares you with the fundamentals to build your own."
College Junior,5,"The people of the LYCOMING community come together as a family for support. The people are willing to help one another. Students are willing to help other new students and the teachers will take the time to help you. One of my favorite experiences is  when we have the Candlelight Service Mass the chapel is decorated beautifly and at the end we sing ""Silent Night"" and we light each other's candles. During the mass the priest reads a scripture from the bible depicting each part of the mass. I would choose my school all over again because Lycoming lives up to its expectations."
College Senior,5,For me this was a great thing to get involved with
College Junior,5,Career services is incredibly helpful. The faculty within take extra care to make sure they help us find everything we are looking for and will go out of their ways to be of great service.
College Junior,5,"From classes within my major to classes requires as a general study, I have always felt valued and that I am taught to the best of the ability of the professors."
College Junior,5,The sense of community that is felt is absolutely priceless.
College Junior,5,Advisors are extremely helpful in helping plan the future
College Junior,5,My experience with the academics at lycoming was/is awesome
College Junior,5,Lyco is extremely supportive and preventative when it comes to health and safety
College Junior,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE Greek life
College Junior,5,Love my major and classes
College Junior,5,"I just love this institution. Everyone is friendly, people care about your success--your friends, professors, everyone. Everything is great!"
College Sophomore,5,"The professors at Lycoming College are some of the nicest, helpful, and most intelligent people I have ever met. It is so easy to drop by a professor's office just to have a conversation. These are the conversations that really help to shape your future and enhance your time here. There are many many student interest groups on campus, from campus ministry, to 9 different greek organizations, to many community service programs, it is hard NOT to find a place to fit in. Although the work load may be difficult, professors are ALWAYS here to help, as well subject tutors, and even librarians."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are so welcoming and willing to help every student. One of my professors even moved a class time so I could fit her class in with my others!
College Sophomore,5,Lycoming is such a welcoming community. The professors are super approachable and truly want to see each and every student succeed. Student involvement on campus spreads across a plethora of activities and most students take part in multiple extracurricular activities.
College Freshman,5,"The professors at Lycoming are great, and are very good at being supportive of students. I have not had issues registering for classes so far. The process is simple and I have been able to get the classes I want."
College Freshman,5,My experience so far at Lycoming has been great. I've been able to make a lot of friends with similar interests and I've developed good relationships with my professors. I have an on campus job set up for spring semester that I'm excited about.
College Sophomore,5,"You will never find a more supportive environment for learning. Just wow. You can talk to your classmates, your professors, your administrators, even your security staff are willing to have an academic, stimulating conversation with you, or will help you find the right resources to get you to success. The support, along with the motivation and cumulative knowledge or every department, puts Lycoming on a pedestal for learning achievement and success."
College Senior,5,"Lycoming is a wonderful place. It is like a huge community. Going to a small school is super beneficial. The student to faculty ratio is small enough that the professors are there to answer your questions whenever they can. Also, there is a lot to do there, ranging from sports, to clubs, and organizations. Altogether, i love Lyco! GO WARRIORS!!!!"
College Sophomore,5,"I have never been so at home anywhere in my life. Everyone (and I mean everyone) is willing to help you. Food is great, I had a diet of pizza once for an entire semester and it never got old. There is so much you can do and you never need to feel like you are doing too much, you can talk to anyone to help support you and keep you going. It's a wonderful environment and the relationships I have made are nothing I would trade in a lifetime."
College Freshman,5,I love lyco. This school has an environment of friendship and support like no other campus in the United States. I feel so blessed and glad to be apart of this campus.
College Senior,5,"Each major has their own course or courses that relate most to the real world experience you will get.  The more academia type majors have a Research Methods course. The more practical majors have an internship course. People can also create their own majors at Lyco. There's some paperwork and a review board to approve the major, but it's entirely possible. Lyco gives the students a lot of freedom."
College Junior,5,Going Greek was the best decision I have ever made. We have such a big presence on campus and of course on the weekend activities as well!
College Junior,5,Lyco has a gorgeous campus. It's hard not to love it.
College Junior,5,I love my major and my adviser only makes me love it even more.
College Junior,5,I don't think anyone ever gets refused their major. They like students who are going to be involved on campus.
College Junior,5,"Sometimes our teams suck, and hey, it happens. But when we're good, we're champions and not a soul on campus will be afraid to support our kickass team."
College Junior,5,Lyco works really hard to get students established in internships and helps make connections with alum and other businesses to help prepare you for a career path.
College Junior,5,"Some professors will make you want to pull out your hair, but there's going to be one that you come across that will change your life forever."
College Junior,5,There are so many small restaurants around and they're all great.
College Junior,5,Professor Donati leads the Corp. Comm majors and he's fantastic. He has a lot of experience in the matter and is willing to give you any assistance you need.
College Junior,5,I love the professors and the role they play in your studies. Your education here is completely dependent on your actions and what you make of them.
College Junior,5,I received a lot of scholarships and have very minimum loans out at so far and am into my junior year.
College Freshman,5,It is a very safe campus. They handle serious matters appropriately.
College Freshman,5,The professors are all great at their job.
College Sophomore,5,"It's the best because you can get away with literally anything.

There is literally no alcohol or drug enforcement. you can get in trouble but only a warning and that's if you blatantly let tem see you're drinking, and it's easy to get away with underage drinking, again you'd only get a warning.

noise violations are usually always handled right away by your RA and once again its a warning.

the only thing that sucks is when you have a visitor. you can easily get them in and out, there is no check in or out process unless they are staying the night. what sucks is finding them parking. there is like no visitor parking."
College Junior,5,The professors are great. They are willing to take the time to help you.
College Junior,5,"The upperclass housing are better, you only have to share a bathroom with 3 people"
College Junior,5,"Apply for admission into Lycoming College.

If you are accepted, declare your major between your 1st semester of freshman year, and last semester of sophomore year.

Make your application stand out. Include any detail that you think makes you stand out. That not only increases your chances of getting in, but is also increases your chances of getting a scholarship"
College Junior,5,"I love being a sociology major. In my sociology classes we have the opportunity to explore different areas of the society. My goal is to attend law school, and my only concern is being able to afford the funds to first of all complete my bachelors ' degree and then law school."
College Sophomore,5,The professors are extremely helpful and the course work is challenging but fun at the same time.
Sophomore,4,The school is very social and everyone is very friendly. The staff are friendly and they always make sure that the students are comfortable in every aspect.
Sophomore,4,The professors are very hands on and always make sure that no student fails. The professors make it very easy to contact them if a student has any trouble with and assignment and always have available resources in the library. The extracurricular helps students become engaged and learn while having fun at the same time. Due to the student to staff ration being high it is easy to for students to get help in whenever there is some kind of hardship. Work study allows for us students to get paid while studying for exams.
Freshman,4,Enjoying my first semester very much.  Have been getting involved and am excited to see what next semester brings
Freshman,4,Lycoming college makes everyone feel welcome. They do a good job at making the incoming freshman feel welcome and getting them prepared for college. I feel like there was alot of information to take in and there should have been papers to take with information on it but overall good first year experience
Freshman,4,"The dorms should be more homey and less feeling like a prison.  There needs to be more security due to incidents happening the past two weekends in a row.  The food needs to change, sometimes I walk out hungry because there is nothing that looks good at all.  Desserts are the best though."
Sophomore,4,"I've been at Lyco for a year now (as a freshman) and it's been good so far. The professors are kind and will take the time to sit down and discuss about any questions you may have. Class sizes are small, which can be good if you need to have a one-on-one discussion with the professor. Almost all classes are in the same building except for the science courses, which have their own building but is only a couple feet away from the Academic Center.   

 The food options at the dining hall are ok, but if you want better options then there's always Cafe 1812 and a new place that is in the new building the college is opening this fall (I assume they might have better stuff). There's also Jack's but it's more for late-night munchies or if you haven't eaten dinner at the dining hall (they close at 7 or 7:30 p.m, depending on the day). I'm hoping one day the school will invest in better food and better interior design for the dining hall, like seriously."
Junior,4,The professors are very supportive and understanding. They want you to do your best in their class. The campus overall is very beautiful and picture worthy. The different classes offered are very unique and interesting in its own way.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very small and intimate. The entire student body and staff members is like a family, always willing to help one another. I would love to see more clubs be made to help involve more students in our school."
Senior,4,I like the professors and students. Some of the administration are hard to work with though. The cafe needs to get better food prepared. There are tons of ways to get involved though on campus.
College Freshman,4,"We have pretty good sports teams in soccer and football, and most people are interested in attending games. The recreation center is up-to-date, and has impressive new machinery and weights."
College Freshman,4,"Since the moment I arrived at Lycoming College I loved the very friendly environment on campus. Everyone is very friendly and outgoing, and you feel comfortable stepping out of your boundaries because everyone is very accepting. Also, the professors are very caring and understanding when it comes to assigning homework assignments. They really try to give us all the available resources so that we can get good grades in tests and assignments."
College Freshman,4,The school provides many job and internship fairs that students can attend to.
College Freshman,4,"It is amazing, I have met so many people and the professors are extremely supportive with all the students. In addition, there are so many support systems for students to take advantage of."
College Freshman,4,Lycoming provides such an exceptional array of support for students. They are very flexible with our needs and are always there for anything that we might need.
College Freshman,4,"My experience on greek life is limited, but i was invited to join and the process was extremely easy. However, I could not join since my schedule was already so tight."
College Freshman,4,So far I have experienced the life of a college student and I have a good opinion on it. I have involved myself in many groups and am passionate about my class. There is so much support that i can use in order to succeed. The professors are so passionate about their topics that it allows me to be involved in the subject and it ultimately helps me grasp the concept.
College Junior,4,Greek life remind me of Girl and Boy Scouts l. The sisters are really close with one another they get along great and are willing to help one another.
College Junior,4,During the home games at school there is a lot of school spirit from the Lycoming community.
College Senior,4,Lycoming has provided a wonderful college experience.
College Senior,4,Very strong alumni network which will help in the job market.
College Senior,4,Buildings old but atmosphere is great.
College Senior,4,Lycoming has been a great fit for me.
College Junior,4,"I am not involved in Greek Life, but a lot of my friends are. It has a huge presence on the campus, but they do a lot of good things."
College Junior,4,"Not everyone is involved in athletics, but there are plenty of opportunities."
College Junior,4,Lyco athletics is run really well
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Junior,4,We have older and new halls
College Junior,4,I am in Greek life and I love it.
College Junior,4,Great facilities for a D3 school. Coaches are great people that care about their athletes. Very dedicated athletic department.
College Junior,4,The professors and the classes these professors offer are of a great variety and there really is something for everyone. I've taken classes ranging from the history of the English Language to a class specifically studying literature written by women.
College Junior,4,I love living on campus as do most of my friends.
College Junior,4,"There are only five sororities and four fraternities and while a majority of campus is involved in Greek life, sometimes it seems that the higher ups don't quite care about Greek life and their desire to grow beyond their current limitations (ie not enough housing)"
College Junior,4,The athletics are clearly of importance to the college and a large majority of campus that is uninvolved with athletics support them.
College Junior,4,"The school overall is amazing, and the professors are beyond helpful. I'm far more than just a number at Lycoming College."
College Sophomore,4,Courses at Lycoming are great the teachers take great pride in helping the students with whatever they can and care about whether the students learn the topic other then just test being taken.
College Sophomore,4,"Internships are offered throughout your college career in the career you want, and alumni often have  big part in how are campus is run, through the donations and the variety of different activities that is offered for the alumni, and carrer services can be accessed to help in all of your career choice options."
College Sophomore,4,Health and safety is generally very good and there is safety and security around 24-7 that you can call and ask for help for a number of different problems.... also the security will gladly take you to where you need to go if you have to go somewhere off campus.
College Sophomore,4,Housing on campus is better then other places and the atmosphere in the dorms are very nice...with the rooms being spacious and fairly clean.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life though I'm not apart of the Greek Community they do great things for are campus such as fundraisers for important charities and activities to make the campus fun and interactive.
College Sophomore,4,Student athletics at the school is very important and the coaches and athletes are all very dedicated and take the time to work there best to do their best.
College Sophomore,4,My school is a very close community and the teachers care about there students a lot and there are amazing opportunities that allow you to broaden your knowledge and friendship with those around you.
College Senior,4,The environment here is wonderful and welcoming. You feel like you are a part of a community and the people at the school actually care about you. You get personalized attention and there's always someone around to help you.
College Sophomore,4,Very caring with a emphasis on safety to all.
College Sophomore,4,High level of job prospects due to internships.
College Sophomore,4,Small class sizes that stress individuality.
College Sophomore,4,Family oriented with a space for privacy.
College Sophomore,4,"Lycoming College is a small, family environment."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are great and supportive. The curriculum is easy to understand and keep up with, the registration process generally runs smoothly, and the workload per class is manageable."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are generally very helpful and supportive. The courses are interesting and since the class sizes are usually less than 30, students are able to interact more personally with the professors."
College Sophomore,4,"Lyco is a great school. The professors are awesome, the students are welcoming, classes are small, and the dining staff is so pleasant!"
College Sophomore,4,"The education program gets students out in the field from day 1 and it's phenomenal to know that they've all got my back.

Lyco students are well known for their ability to work well both independently and in a team, a nice perk when applying to grad schools."
College Sophomore,4,"The renovated buildings are nice, but the freshman and Greek buildings need some love."
College Sophomore,4,"The gym has something for every student and every ability level. Whether a student is trying to lose weight, stay in shape, or train for their sport, there are facilities and equipment available for all."
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms and halls are about average, but do have enough space to not feel cramped. The authority and rule enforcement is a little lacking with certain RA's."
College Sophomore,4,"You will never be in an unsafe place on Lycoming's campus. Safety & security area constantly patrolling and are more than willing to be of service to transporting and helping students in anyway, shape, or form. I have never felt threatened or felt anyone else has felt threatened in my time on campus. Students themselves take immediate action if someone is having an issue or feels threatened. This fact only builds to the foundation of the community which is Lycoming College."
College Senior,4,"The athletic facilities are up to date. A lot of useful and new equipment, an indoor suspension track, two gyms, and much more."
College Sophomore,4,"People enjoy being apart of a closer knit family in campus. Greek life is constantly active on campus in promoting organizations and bettering the community. I personally am not in a fraternity, but I would suggest to anyone who has the time and motivation to build upon something like Greek life."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone has school pride and it shows at sports events. A football game is won and there is celebration; a football game is lost and there is preparation for the next. And academics come before athletics. Every athlete is made to stay on top of their studies and teams as a whole contribute to keeping each other learning and further progressing a student's education.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The faculty are incredibly helpful and encouraging, making sure students feel supported both as students and as people."
College Freshman,4,"I am an astronomy and physics double major. The department is really friendly and helpful, and the curriculum is interesting. The new science building (including a new planetarium) should give us better facilities."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no jobs in Williamsport, thus no internships. The only chance you have at receiving an internship is through the Wise program, and career services only chooses 30 students of all the applicants."
College Sophomore,2,"As an international student, I pay a hefty amount for room and board. Its upsetting that the facilities are inhabitable. The plastic steel mattresses are a lousy excuse for beds. The showers are to closer together even for a communal bathroom, and the toilets are usually unkept. Its not pleasant to spend tha majority of ones time in the dorm rooms, because it is uncomfortable."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the peopel that join, do it to make friends and closer relationships. however, for $300 its simply not woth it because the campus is so small you end up knowing everyone anyhow by the end of the semester."
College Sophomore,2,"Lycoming college is a divison three university. So, there is not a lot of funding that goes to the sports and that is seen in the sporting facilities. The football and soccer fields are bad, and the teams lose most of the matches. The recreational center is average, with old equiptment and a lot of the sporting teams are required to share as there aren't enough facilities."
College Sophomore,2,"I want to sweat. I want to fihgt. I want to wake up each and every morning and feel as though I worked to my full potential. But that is not what i recieved at Lycoming college. The truth is, the university bored me. I was unsatisfied with the isloated town that lacked motivation, jobs and even recreation."
College Freshman,2,It is not well known by many and therefore may make it difficult to find a job post graduation.
College Freshman,2,"Diversity on campus is basically non-existent, but most students seem open to diversity."
College Freshman,2,"Even if you are in your dorm, security can breathalyze you and get you in trouble. Noise complaints are largely ignored which is bad if your RA is bad."
College Freshman,2,"Williamsport is a notoriously bad city in Pennsylvania. There's a lot of crime in the bad part of town and granted the campus isn't it that part, it still is kind of sketchy. The school protects us though, and has our own security and is a closed campus."
College Sophomore,2,"No diversity. We are all the same in quite a few ways.

Mostly all from the same surrounding areas."
College Sophomore,2,"I enjoy my major a lot, with the one or two classes I had (also with my previous to lyco experiences and work) ,however, for a lot of the majors they make you take bullshit distribution classes."
College Junior,2,Same things all the time 
College Junior,2,Health department will give you advil and tell you to rest even if you have a obvious problem.
College Junior,2,The nicknames S***port…. explains enough
College Junior,2,Dorms are old typical college dorm 
College Junior,2,Very strict if your on their bad side AKA my neighbor 
College Junior,2,Dorms are old heaters clank and wake you up 
College Junior,2,People are nice but just not my kind of people. its mid pennsylvania…..
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm a double major, and no one really knows how to deal with us for some reason."
College Junior,2,The wifi is pretty bad and IT reps aren't very friendly.
College Sophomore,1,"Personally, I had quite a few bad experiences at Lycoming. It is a decent school, just for me I had problems.

I feel like I've wasted time and screwed up this part of my life. The school offered a solution but in only ended with me spending more time here, since they can't reimburse me for my time. I also feel like I can be 'lost' at times and no one helps, I see no assistance from faculty or administration, unless you do something bad.

In all honesty it is a quaint little school and can feel like high school. Most people won't encounter problems, it is a nice school that can provide some important things to you."
College Sophomore,1,"One dining hall with no variety in options for the meal plan, only two choices and they cost the same

food is always the same with the ""hot meal"" and food at bravismo changing daily, but if you don't like those then it's back to the usual food of hot dogs or hamburgers, soup or salad, pizza or pasta, or a sandwich. So you're screwed if you don't like the hot meal.

food is only good with visitors or important people

we also recently changed for vegan and vegetarian people so basically our food is catered to them. so instead of maybe getting meatloaf once a week we get tofu.

Jack's or Jp's is the only good place to get food, but use your flex dollars carefully, everyone always ends up charging to their credit cards. the line and wait can be long some times, but it is usually pretty good."
College Sophomore,1,The school extremely limits the students by not allowing them to live off campus. You either commute or live on campus. This is very annoying because room and board is quite expensive and they force us into paying for the ever increasing room and board.
College Sophomore,1,"I had a horrible experience with classes at Lyco! I ended up with only 3 classes each semester instead of the regular 4. I was put into a high level Spanish class that I didn't think I should be in, I was concerned along with my parents, but lyco pushed me into the class which I had to withdraw from. The next semester I fell through the system and ended up in a class I wasn't able to get credit for, which the school blatantly blamed on me. The system failed, ultimately leading me to be able to sign up for the class. Resulting in my withdrawal from yet another class.

The registration process obviously is horrible.

I've wasted time at Lycoming now because of these setbacks, also wasting my time and money.

Use rate my professor and take it to heart. Some professors suck at their jobs, others are newer and do decently at their jobs. If the professor is horrible on day one then get out while you can. They all are different depending on their personalities; some are laid back and easy, others are hard and strict, and the rest should just quit because they can't teach."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I get sick every semester, because they don't give a lot of options. Also several of my friends have found mold in our food"
College Junior,1,"Greek life at Lycoming is very clique oriented. They say what they need to say to get you interested, especially with freshman. Many of the fraternities and sororities have bad reputations and a lot of people regret joining after they pledged. If you choose not to join, the people who were your ""friends"" before you made the decision will no longer be your friends."
College Junior,1,IT RAINS SO MUCH! IT'S ALWAYS GRAY OUTSIDE! AH!
College Junior,1,"The internet access at Lyco is absolutely terrible. For a time, urban dictionary had a definition for ""s***ernet"" that included ""the internet at Lycoming College.""  It is not very reliable and you will often find yourself in remediation, where you will have to update your computer completely and keep checking for updates until it will approve you to be back on the network. This process can take several hours.  Finding a computer in the library is almost impossible. The other labs are typically your best bet, but they are often used for other classes that reserve them and that can get in the way of things. Heim, the science building, has a computer lab that is rarely used, which is the best option. You definitely need a laptop or a personal computer. However, Lycoming added a new wireless printing option where you download the printer's software on to your laptop, sign in with your username and then after you hit print, scan your id at any school printer near you and then your document will print. However, the software is unreliable also. So you often have no choice but to get on one of the schools computer's to try and print something. The amount of free print counts I'd say are okay. Sometimes it's not enough if you have a class that demands printing often and other times it's great if you have professor's who do not mind you electronically submitting work."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no off-campus housing unless you are a commuter. Everyone is required to live on campus if their permanent address is more than 40 miles from campus. If you want to live off-campus and change your permanent address then I suppose you could find something. If you're looking to live off-campus for just the school year, it's not going to happen."
College Sophomore,1,"Students at Lycoming – Since Lycoming is a liberal arts college and of small size, many art, theater majors go here. The school is made up of basically drama, art, etc students and then the athletes. There is no in between."
College Sophomore,1,Their is not much options for juniors and seniors besides typical dorm rooms. The criteria to get into an apartment is so strict so if one things missing you are stuck living in a dorm all four years.
College Junior,1,Though we have multiple computer labs on campus the internet is awful. The wireless in the dorm rooms either work or doesnt work and an ethernet cable barely helps. The computers in the labs are usually taken and move slow. The printing money however is a very good amount and you will not run out by the end of semester.
College Junior,1,The campus makes it sound like security is really good and will protect you. In reality this is not true. Dont go anywhere alone and do not leave campus at night. As for under aged drinking its super easy to get away with security has no clue.
College Junior,1,"There is nothing healthy on the menu, and it is pretty much the same thing over and over again. Those in charge of dining services don't take student complaints into consideration and seem to mock those who request a healthy change. It would also be nice if we had more than one dining location throughout most of the day, or if our main dining hall were open past 7 p.m."
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation unless you use the public bus, which is scary."
College Sophomore,1,Worst part about the school. Freshman dorms are average. But security regularly patrols the halls and will write you up for anything. There are restrictions on everything you can have within the dorms. Christmas lights have recently been banned. Upperclassmen housing is restricted to on campus apartments or dorms. School is invasive and doesnt give students privacy.
College Senior,1,"Lycoming is terrible. There are no parties and if there are they get busted by midnight. Athletes and Greek life rule the social scene so if you're not part of it you best bet you'll be sitting in your room on the weekends. There is no diversity, no alcohol is served at parties, the people are mean, and the work load is ridiculous. There is nowhere to go in town, there's only one night club and its always raining."
College Senior,1,Rainy and Cold – The weather here is horrible. It is cloudy and rainy almost everyday. It makes the lack of things to do around here even more depressing.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing to Do – There really is nothing to do on campus besides drink. Anyone who is 21+ starts going to the bar on Saturdays. The sororities and fraternities are all in one dorm so there are no ""frat houses,"" except for one fraternity, which is literally down the street. The parties at all of the apartments, also across the street, usually get busted. There is no drinking in freshman dorms. There are absolutely no popular activities besides going out and drinking. That is all anyone wants to do."
